Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>By this Rule, victim-petitioner has challenged the legality and propriety of the order dated 22-01-1995 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fourth Court, Comilla, in Session Trial Case no.  31 of 1994 and order dated 22-09-1990 passed by learned Sessions Judge, Chandpur in Session Trial Case no. 23 of 1990 arising out of Matlab P.S. Case no. 03 dated 16-05-1983 corresponding to G.R. no. 80 of 1983 under sections 148, 149, 379, 436, 302, 34 of the Penal Code allowing the prayer for withdrawal of prosecution from accused–opposite parties under sections 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure( briefly as the Code).<br/><br/>Facts in brief are that on 16-05-1983 at 16:30 hrs. one Akfat Ali Bakaul as informant lodged a first information report by producing three dead-bodies namely his son Abdus Sattar, Abdul Wadud son of Abdul Wahab and Dena Bakaul son of late Ashraf Ali at the Police Station alleging that on 15-05-1983 following night seven dacoits were held with arms and were produced in Court by one Aslam Bepari of village Boro Char and a case was registered to that effect and it was suspected that one accused Sadim Ali Howlader of Bhedarganj Police Station under the then Faridpur district had association with the said seven dacoits. Due to handing over the dacoits to law enforcing authority Sadim Ali Howlader in order to take revenge along with 100/150 of his supporters being member of unlawful  assembly armed with Rifle, ballam, lathi, Dao, Chena, tata etc. attacked the houses of villagers of Borochar alias Charkasim on 16-05-1983 at midnight and started looting at that the informant along with his son Abdus Sattar, Abdul Wadud son of Abdul Wahab Dhali along with 40/50 others of the village tried to flee away to save their lives by boat from Eastern corner of the village of Meghna river. At that while the informant and others were on the mid of the river the accused party opened fire at them on the boat from the bank of the river causing death of Abdus Sattar son of the informant, Abdul Wadud son of Abdul Wahab Dhali and Denu Bakaul, son of late Ashraf Ali and causing bullet injury on Abdur Rab son of deceased Dera Bakaul who was subsequently treated at Chandpur Hospital. The raiders at the time of their raiding activities caused grievous injuries on 50/60 co-villagers and looted away valuable articles including gold ornaments, cash money, cattle and goats and destroyed crops, trees and the raiding party also burnt about 200 living huts including the houses of co-villagers Karam Ali Sarder, Shamsul Sardar, Halim Pradhania, Abdul Sardar, Selim Badsha Bachchu, Nasir Bepari, Tabdil Sardar, Ayub Ali Master, Piyar Ahmed Gazi, Muslim Bakaul, Ali Ahmed Bakaul, Razzak Bakaul, Habu Bepari and many others.<br/><br/>The CID Police after investigation submitted charge-sheet accusing forty seven accused including the accused opposite parties under Sections 148, 149, 379, 436, 302, 34 of the Penal Code. After submission of the Charge-sheet the accused opposite party nos. 2-8 were arrested. Later, they were granted bail from the Court below.<br/><br/>Eventually the case was taken up for trial by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fourth Court, Comilla. Meanwhile, eleven witnesses were examined. Thereafter the Ministry of Home Affairs by its memo no. <strong>১৬-এম-১২/৮৭ (আইন)</strong> dated 09-01-1988 directed the Public Prosecutor to withdraw the case against accused opposite party  no. 8 Abdul Khaleq under Section 494 of the Code. Accordingly the Public Prosecutor filed application to that effect and the learned Judge of the Court below allowed withdrawal of the case against the accused opposite party no. 8 by the impugned order dated 22-09-1990.<br/><br/>Thereafter the Ministry of Home Affairs by its memo no. <strong>৩৮ -এম-১২/৮৭ (আইন) তারিখ ১৪-০১-১৯৯৩</strong> directed the Public Prosecution to withdraw the case against thirteen accused including accused opposite party nos.2-7 under section 494 of the Code. Accordingly the Public Prosecution filed an application to that effect and the learned Judge by the impugned order dated 22-01-1995 allowed withdrawal of the case against the accused opposite party nos.2-7. <br/><br/>Feeling aggrieved one of the victim namely Abdul Rob Bakaul who sustained bullet injuries and lost his father in the said incident preferred the instant application and obtained the present Rule.<br/><br/>No one appears on behalf of the victim-petitioner to support the Rule.<br/><br/>In view of the facts, this is an old revision of 1995, we are inclined to take it up for disposal on merit considering the materials on record.<br/><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State-opposite party no. 1 submits that the impugned memos issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs are contrary to the guide line settled by the same Ministry on 01-11-2001 where it has been decided that the case against the Political leaders and Political persons shall be withdrawn if the case were initiated on Political reason excepting the cases involving murder, rape, arson and with fire arms which the learned Sessions Judge failed to consider and as such the impugned orders are liable to be set-aside.<br/><br/>In order to appreciate her submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to her submissions.<br/><br/>At a very out-set we shall first consider the orders of withdrawal dated 14-01-1993 and 09-01-1988 and subsequently the Guide line of the Ministry dated 01-11-2001 which read as hereunder:</div><div style="margin-left: 40px;

So, judging by these guidelines, the direction of the same ministry contained in the letters dated 14-01-1993 and 09-01-1988 for withdrawal of the case against accused opposite parties are palpably contradicting.<br/><br/>However, we have considered the matter from a broader perspective along with the materials on record.<br/><br/>As we read and understood, the guidelines are meant to give relief to persons who have been implicated for political reasons, not for heinous penal offences. Implicating for political reason means that where a person, because of his political stand, is engaged is activities in dissension from the Government. But this memorandum if applied to all cases, then it cannot be ruled out that veteran criminals may escape trial of heinous offences by pleasing the Ministry as he/she is a political person. Such withdrawal of case will lead to anarchy in the administration of justice and in the society Politicians, if they actually believe themselves as politicians, they must have an ideal character so as to be followed by the future generation. In the book ‘ A Dictionary of Law, Fourth Edition, published by Central Law Book House, political offence has been defined as ‘ an offence that is of a political character, so that the alleged offender cannot be extradited or surrender as a fugitive offender. In the decision of RE. Meunier (1894) 2 QB 415 it has been held that in order to constitute an offence of a political character, there must be two or more parties in the State, each seeking to impose the Government of its own choice on the other and that if the offence is committed by one side or the other, in pursuance of that object, it is a political offence, otherwise not. In the case of Schtracks vs. Government of Israel(1962) 3 All ER 529 it has been held ‘but, if the Government stands apart and is concerned only to enforce the criminal law that has been violated by the contending political organization, that is no reason why the fugitive should be protected on the grounds that they are political offenders. In the case of Harbhajem Singh vs. Union of India, AIR 1987 SC 8, political ground has been characterized as " It suggests vague and fanciful attitude". Case of political character, as we see, has a heavenly meaning but from the guidelines it appears that Ministry’s memorandum is being applied for harbouring the alleged veteran criminals. If section 494, CrPC be used like this, then it is time to think whether section 494, CrPC should at all be kept in the Code or it should be omitted. Personal murderous instinct or blood thirstiness cannot be branded as case of political character so as to withdraw a person from prosecution characterizing the same as being instituted for political reason.<br/><br/>From the reading of the aforesaid guidelines, it appears to us that political leaders aswellas the political workers have an advantage over other accused persons if a case be initiated only on political reason, that is out of a political movement. If any political leader or worker be implicated with allegation of omnibus nature and if political leaders  and workers can prove that they are political leaders and workers and take such plea at the initiation of the proceeding i.e. when they appear before the Magistrate or officer-in-charge or investigating officer, either for bail or for some other purpose, then it may be considered that the case was or is initial out of political vengeance only to harass the accused by any means. But when the case is at trial stage, after completion of investigation and no where the accused disclosed that he is a political person, this defence should in no way be available to any political leaders or workers. The benefit given under the guidelines is not available to a political leader or a political worker when he or she is involved in a case of murder, rape, arson and with fire-arms. The Magistrate or Judge while giving a decision on withdrawal should consider at what point of time the accused claims the benefit of the guidelines i.e. on the ground of political reason. The Judge should also consider whether in withdrawing the case against some accused persons, far less the principal accused, whether the case against the remaining accused becomes weaker. If a case is withdrawn against some of the accused persons leaving other accused persons then equality before law stands nugatory.<br/><br/>In the instant case we find that the principal accused persons have been exonerated by the learned Sessions Judge on accepting the memorandum of the Ministry of Home Affairs without assigning any reason. It should be borne in mind that near and dear ones, of the informant/complainant either raped or murdered or his property with belongings when gutted or subjected to brutality by arson or firearms, are the victims of the offence directly, as opposed to any one of the Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs or the Judge or the Magistrate who issued the memorandum or allowed the application for withdrawing the case and accorded permission of the same. So, the persons in judicial authority giving decision should not only be cautious in individual case but must consider the  general impact of such decision on the society. In our view, in cases involving heinous offences as mentioned in the guidelines of the Home Ministry should not be withdrawn against principal accused, as, in that event, people at large would lose credibility in the judicial system and they would point a finger towards the Court challenging its impartiality.<br/><br/>From the directions of the Ministry we find no cogent reasons were assigned for withdrawal. But the learned Judge, in omnibus manner, without applying his judicial mind, allowed withdrawal of the case against accused opposite parties. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the application made by the Public Prosecutor for withdrawal from the prosecution of the principal accuseds amounts to an attempt to throttle the prosecution and to interfere with the normal course of justice. This is not at all a case where there is no evidence against these accuseds as could not sustain a conviction. The real question in the case is, whether the prosecution witnesses are worthy of credit and whether there are question of circumstances the benefit of which should go to the accuseds. These are questions which can only be determined by a proper trial and this function of the trial Court cannot be permitted to be pre-empted at a preliminary stage by an application of the kind made in this case by the Public Prosecutor.<br/><br/>From the language of section 494 of the Code, it is clear that in the last analysis, the responsibility of the Court is to decide, whether to grant or not to grant consent for withdrawal, and the discretion can be properly exercised only if the application for withdrawal is considered judicially. Judicial exercise of the discretion means consideration of all the facts and circumstances of the case available to the Court and also of the grounds on which the withdrawal is sought. The very word ‘’consent’’ occurring in section 494 of the Code clearly indicates that it is not to be considered lightly on the application of the Public Prosecutor without a careful and proper scrutiny of the grounds on which the application is based. In the decisions reported in 49 DLR (AD) 143, 2000 BLD (AD) 54= 52 DLR (AD) 8, 1996 BLD 418= 49 DLR 589, besides other numerous decisions of India and Pakistan, it was held that non-compoundable offences cannot be withdrawn and the learned Magistrate or, to that effect, the learned Sessions Judge should pass a judicial order  applying his judicial mind. On a consideration of the impugned orders, evidence of eleven witnesses, we find that the learned Judge did not apply his judicial mind and passed the orders as if doing his administrative day-to-day work.<br/><br/>Here in the present case we have reprod-uced above the orders of the Government for the withdrawal of the case and it appears that no ground has been shown for the same. The government’s order does not contain anything that there was consideration by the authority of the materials before taking the decision for the withdrawal. The only word used for the withdrawal is  “প্রত্যাহার করার সিদ্ধা, গ্রহন করিয়াছেন ”  So it cannot be found from the letters that there was application of mind and consideration of the materials available for the withdrawal of a case. The Public Prosecutor also submitted an application praying for withdrawal simply stating that the Government has decided to withdraw. And it appears that the learned Judge without assigning any reason allowed the withdrawal. This order of the learned Judge it appears is a mechanical order. He has not followed the provisions of section 494 of the Code and he has also not considered the decision reported in the case of Matiur Rahman vs. State reported in 35 DLR(AD) 329. So from the Government order aswellas from the petition field by the Public Prosecutor and the order of withdrawal passed by the learned Judge it appears that the  provisions of section 494 of the Code has not been followed by the concerned Judge and there was no consi-deration of the materials by the Government  in their decision. In that view of the matter we hold that such order of withdrawal cannot be supported and maintained.<br/><br/>It is well settled that the consent mentioned in section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not to be given mechanically. The Court is to exercise its function judicially before giving such consent which implies that the Court will have to examine the materials on which the Government decides withdrawal of a case. In the instant case no reason/ground has been assigned for the withdrawal of the case and there is no indication that materials were considered before taking the decision and the learned Judge committed illegality in allowing withdrawal under the aforesaid circumstances.<br/><br/>In the Case of Bakshu Mia vs. Govt. of Bangladesh and others 30 DLR(SC) 228 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>" Criminal Procedure Code(V of 1898) S.494.  </em><br/><em>Combination of prayer by the P.P. for withdrawal from prosecution and the consent of the Court allowing withdrawal make the order of withdrawal complete- Court’s order on the question of withdrawal to be based on reasonable grounds- Recording of reasons by the Court even though not required is desirable to do so. Some materials on record for giving consent must exist.</em><br/><em>The section says that the public prosecutor is to decide and ask for withdrawal from the prosecution and the Court is to give its consent. The public prosecutor prays for the withdrawal of the prosecution either as a whole, or of some accused persons or some or all offences. The section gives no indication asto the grounds on which the public prosecutor is to apply. It does not also indicate any consideration on which the Court is to grant its consent. The language is wide enough and a reading of the section shows that a combination of the prayer and the consent makes a complete order of the withdrawal. Though consent is a necessary part of the order of withdrawal, the decision is that of the public prosecutor, and it must initiate from him. The ultimate order of withdrawal may operate either as discharge or acquittal. This order of the Court will attract the provision of sections 435, 436, 439, or section 417 of the Code. The function of the Court therefore must be based on some reasonable grounds and before making that order, the Court must take into consideration attending or relevant matters and circumstances. It is true that the Court is not required to record its reasons, though it may be desirable to do so. There must, however, be some material on record disclosing reason or grounds, on which the consent of the Court was given.</em><br/><em>Withdrawal of prosecution- Courts  to see that grounds given are not extraneous to justice- Section gives general executive discretion to the P.P. subject to the consent of the Court- Court not to determine anything judicially-</em><br/><em>It is true that the discretion of the Court need not be fettered on materials gathered by Judicial method, or to matters extraneous to the case, but the grounds must not be extraneous to Justice. We are to remember that the section gives a general executive discretion to the public prosecutor to withdraw from the prosecution, subject to the consent of the Court but the court is not to determine anything judicially. The accord of consent may be guided by many possible or probable grounds. It is, therefore, not possible to lay down before hand any rigid standard of what could or could not be possible ground for withdrawal, and they will depend always on the facts and circumstances of each case but the grounds must be relatable to the reasons for withdrawal. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Withdrawal of prosecution- Courts to be satisfied that the Public Prosecutor has not acted improperly.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>Court is to be satisfied that the executive function of public prosecutor has not been improperly exercised, or it is not an attempt to interfere with the normal course of justice or for a collateral purpose.</em><br/><em>What is to be looked at is the substance rather than the form of the order of withdrawal.</em><br/><em>It appears that the records were called for by the Home Secretary and he after considering all aspects of the case and making his own assessment of the matter, by a letter of the Ministry of Home Affairs to the Deputy Commissioner of Sylhet, conveyed the decision of the Government to withdraw the case.

It is the cogency of the material and not the quantum that is relevant for the consideration of giving the consent. The material disclosed by the Special Prosecutor is the decision of the Government to withdraw. A decision at the high level of administration of the Government should prima-facie be a sufficient good ground for withdrawal, unless of course it could be shown that the decision was malafide or done for a collateral purpose. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Abdul Wahab Talukder alias Mohd. and others vs. State and another 30 DLR (SC)-278- 279 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>Code of Criminal Procedure S. 494.</em><br/>Exercise of discretion regarding permission for withdrawal of a case is a Judicial discretion to be based on reasonable grounds.<br/><em>The function of the Court is a Judicial one and the exercise of discretion a Judicial discretion.

Muzammel Hossain, J:</u></strong><br/><br/>This appeal by leave at the instance of the accused-appellant is directed against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 11.12.2002 passed by the High Court Division in Jail Appeal No.1307 (Sunamgonj) Dismissing the appeal and affirming the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 22.02.2001 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Sunamgonj in Sessions Case No.32 of 1993 arising out of G.R. Case No.109 of 1990 originating from Jagannatpur Police Station Case No.14 dated 28.12.1990 convicting the accused appellant under Sections 302 and 34 of the penal Code and sentencing him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Tk.5,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months more.<br/><br/>The Prosecution case, in brief, is that the informant Serajul Hoque lodged an ejahar with Jagannathpur Police Station alleging, <em>interalia</em>, that on 24.12.1990 at about 3:00 p.m. while deceased Moulana Fazlul Haque accompanied by Abdul Quddus reached at the eastern bank of the Kubashpur river on his way home, the accused persons, namely, Alais Miah alias Ilias Miah, Khurshed, Sayed Hossain and others out of previous enmity and grudge being armed with <em>dao</em> and <em>lathi</em> suddenly attacked him. Accused Alais Miah alias Ilias Miah dealt a dao blow to the right side of Moulana Fazlul Haque’s head causing serious bleeding injury and accused Hassan Ali and Waeres Ali separately dealt dao blows on the middle of his head causing serious injury. Receiving these fetal injuries the deceased fell on the ground and then accused Sayed Ali assaulted him with lathi indiscriminately in different parts of his body causing serious injury. At this grisly attack witness Abdul Quddus raised alarm and hearing hue and cry other witnesses came to the place of occurrence and saw the incident. The victim Moulana Fazlul Haque was initially taken to Osmani Medical Collage Hospital, Sylhet. Thereafter Medical certificate was obtained and first Information Report was lodged. This gave rise to Jagannathpur Hospital wherefrom he was transferred to Osmani Medical College Hospital, Sylhet. Thereafter medical certificate was obtained and First Information Report was lodged. This gave rise to Jagannatpur Police Station Case No.14 dated 28.12.1990 under section 143, 324, 326, 323, 307 and 34 of the Penal Coade,1860 Subsequently, victim Moulana Fazlul Haque died in the Hospital on 05.01.1991 at about 8:40 a.m.<br/><br/>The police after completion of investig-ation submitted charge sheet against the accused persons including the appellant under sections 302,114 and 34 of the Penal Code. Charge was framed against the accused persons including the accused-appellant under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code. The prosecution examined on behalf of the accused Wares Ali.<br/><br/>The learned Additional Sessions Judge, Sunamgonj after holding trial by the judgment and order dated 22.02.2001 convicted the accused persons including the accused-appellant under sections 302 and 34 of the penal Code and sentenced each of them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of TK.5000/- each in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months more.<br/><br/>The accused–appellant being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order date 22.02.2001 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Sunamgonj preferred Jail Appeal before the High Court Division and a Division Bench of the High Court Division by judgment and order dated 11.12.2002 dismissed the appeal affirming those passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Sunamgonj in Sessions Case No.32 of 1993.<br/><br/>The accused–appellant being aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 11.12.2002 passed by the High Court Division preferred the instant appeal with the leave of this Court.<br/><br/>Leave was  granted to consider the submissions that the High Court Division creed in law in considering the statement of the deceased recorded under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,1898 during investigation as his dying declaration while there was no apprehension of death and the said statement of the deceased was not given in evidence and the  trial Court after considering the materials on record held the same inadmissible in evidence and the statement of the  deceased under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be legally treated as dying declaration and it has no legal value for all practical purposes. It has been further submitted that the High Court Division erred in upholding the judgment of conviction passed by the trial Court on misreading of evidence and non-considering cross-examination of witnesses and relying upon the testimony of interested, partisan and chance witnesses in absence of any corroboration from independent, natural, disinterested and neighboring witnesses, although it is admitted by the prosecution witnesses that the place of occurrence is surrounded by 10/15 houses. It has also been submitted that the High Court Division deviated from the settled principle of law by not holding that no reliance can be placed on testimony of the witnesses who were examined by the Investigating Officer after lapse of a considerable time.<br/><br/>It appears that four out of 16 prosecution witnesses, namely, PWs 2, 3, 4 and 5 were the eye witnesses who saw the occurrence from a close distance that  the accused appellant Alais Miah alias Ilias Miah dealt dao blow to the head of the victim and other accused persons also inflicted similar blows by sharp cutting weapons and caused injuries on the head of the victim.<br/><br/>The informant Md. Serajulo Haque as PW-1 reproduced the prosecution case as narrated in the First Information Report in has examination in chief. P.W 2-Abu Sayeed deposed that on. 24.12.1990 at about 3:00 P.M. while he was coming behind the victim Fazlul Haque saw that the accused Sayed Ali, Khorshed and Ilias attacked the victim and at the order of Sayed Ali accused khorshed gave a dao blow to the left side of the head of the victim and the accused Ilias also gave a dao blow to the right side of the head of the victim. Hearing alarm raised by the victim other witnesses including Abdur Rahim, Sekander, Sahabuddin Membe, Goffar Member, Shafique rushed to the place of occurrence.p.w.3-Sekander Ali corroborated the evidence of P.W.2 in material particulars stating, that on the date of occurrence while returning to his house he saw that the accused Khorshed and Ilias dealt dao blows to the head of the victim Moulana Fazlul Haque causing serious injuries and he fell to the ground. When they raised alarm other witnesses rushed to the place of occurrence and witnessed rest of the incident.p.w.4.shahabuddin corroborating p.Ws.2 and 3 deposed that on the date of occurrence at about 3:00 p.m. while he was returning home from Jagannathpur and reached near the place of occurrence heard hue and cry of Moulana fazlul haque and then threw him in the mud water of the bank of the river. When P.W.4 along with Goffar, Quddus, Sekander and Abu Sayed brought out the victim Moulana Fazlul hoque from mud water and asked him about the occurrence, he told them that the accused appellant and other co-accused persons had dealt dao blows to his head causing serious injuries.<br/><br/>It appears that cross-examining the prosecution witnesses the defence could not find any discrepancy in their evidence. P.Ws.2 to 5 being the eye witnesses deposed that accused appellant Alias @ Ilias dealt dao blows to the head of the victim causing serious injuries. It also appears that the trial court as well as the High Court Division found that the post –mortem report submitted by Dr. Anwar Hossain, P.W.9 which was marked as Exbt.4 corroborated the evidence of P.Ws.2-4 to the effect that there were wounds on the frontal region of the head of the victim. P.W.11 Dr. Md. Mokbul Hossain later on deposed as p.e.16 stating the seriousness of the injury and the treatment given to him. P.w.15-Dr. Md. Idris Mia and P.W.16-Dr. Md. Mokbul Hossain corroborated the evidence of P.Ws.2-4 in respect of the injuries inflicted on the head of the victim.<br/>From the evidence of the aforesaid eye witnesses who were corroborated by the medical witnesses it is abundantly clear that the accused-appellant Alais Miah @Ilias Miah inflicted blows by sharp cutting weapon, namely, dao to the right side of head of the victim causing serious injury.<br/><br/>From the evidence of the Investigation Officer it appears that during the course of investigation he recorded the statements of the victim Moulana Fazlul Hoque on 31.12.1990 under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when the victim stated that accused appellant Ilias along with co-accused persons had dealt dao blows causing serious injuries on the frontal region the right side of his head. It also appears from the record that occurrence took place on 24.12.1990 at about 3:00 pm and the victim died in the Osmani Medical Collage Hospital, Sylhet on 05.01.1991 at 8:40 a.m. In the instant case the victim Moulana Fazlul Haque is a very vital witness and he died in the hospital after fighting for his life for about 12 days. Now the pertinent question before this Court is whether the statement made by the deceased Moulana fazlul Hoque under section 161 of the Code is admissible in evidence in view of his death a few days after the occurrence. In other words, whether his statement recorded under section 161 of the Code of Criminal procedure, 1898 by the Investigation Officer can be treated as a dying declaration and be accorded the status of an admissible evidence. The admissibility of the statement of a victim who subsequently dies in consequence of the injuries he receives is governed by section 32(1) of the Evidence Act, 1872. This section provides that the statement of the relevant facts made by a person who is dead, or incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the Court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts when the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that person’s death comes into question and such statements are relevant whether the person who made the statements was of was not under expectation of death. Echoing the substance of the section this Division in the case of Lutfun Nahar Begum vs. The State reported in 17 DLR (AD)29 held that the statement of a dead person is a relevant fact under section 32(1) when it is made by that person as to the cause of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that person’s death comes into question.<br/><br/>The maxim “<em>Nemo moriturus praesumitur mentire</em>” is the basis of admitting dying declaration in evidence the meaning of which is “A man will not meet his maker with a lie in his mouth.” It is quite natural that an injured person under the apprehension of death while making oral statement will not forcibly implicate any person even if he is a past enemy. Though hearsay evidence is not admissible in courts on the ground that the person who gives this evidence does not account his experiences but that of another person and as  such the tool of cross examination cannot be applied to verify the truth of the facts stated as hearsay, dying declaration is an exception to this rule It is because, apart from the postulation of  the above maxim, if this evidence is discarded the very purpose of justice will be frustrated in situation when there may not be any other witnesses to the crime other than the victim who subsequently succumbed to his injuries. A dying declaration whether written or oral by the victim has got a special sanctity in the eye of low. It is well settled that when the dying declaration is true and genuine the court can safely rely upon the same as it provides good basis for conviction. But as there always remains the possibility of misusing the provisions relating to dying declaration, court always scrutinizes it meticulously and until it seems to the court that the dying declaration is trustworthy, declines to solely rely upon it to award a conviction to the accused persons. Again sometimes it is very difficult to draw a conclusive line between doubtful and trustworthiness characteristics of a dying declaration. In the case of Shamsur Rahman –Vs- State reported in 42DLR (AD) 200 the Appellate Division held With majority view that alleged dying declaration, the only piece of evidence against the appellant , having not been free from reasonable doubt,  the is entitled to  benefit of doubt and the some cannot be relied upon, while in the same judgment upon same set of facts His Lordship Mr. Justice Latifur Rahman (as he the Was) noted his dissenting view  and held the dying declaration to be genuine.<br/><br/>A dying declaration to be admissible under section 32 (1) of the Evidence Act, 1872 is not necessarily to be recorded in accordance with the provisions contained in chapter XXV of the code of Criminal Procedure. Statements in section 32 of the Evidence Act include both oral or Written statements which means a dying declaration may not necessarily be only in writing. A dying declaration is evidence if it is free from suspicion and believed to be true and it may be sufficient for conviction. If dying declaration is found to be genuine and true it can by itself form a material basis for conviction. The main tests for determining the genuineness of a dying declaration are, as held in PLD 1967 Pesh. 274, (1) whether intrinsically it rings true, (2) whether there is no chance of mistake on the part of the dying man in identifying or naming his assailant ,. And (3) whether it is free form prompting from any outside quarter and is not inconsistent with the other evidence and circumstances of the case.<br/><br/>While considering dying declaration the court is required to see whether the victim had the physical of capability of making such a declaration whether witnesses who had heard the deceased making such statement heard it correctly. Whether they reproduced names of assailants correctly and whether the maker of the declaration had an opportunity to recognize the assailants. Value of dying declaration depends on the facts and circumstances of the case in which it was made. Unlike English law, for admissibility of a statement a person should not necessarily be in the expectation of death when he made the statement.<br/><br/>In the instant case the statement was made by the victim under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 to the Investigation Officer and after a few days the victim succumbed to his injuries. In the case of Subhan Khan –Vs- State reported in PLD 1960 Lah. 1 it has been held that the statement of a person surviving serious injuries is not a dying declaration within the meaning of section 32(1) of the Evidence Act. Supreme Court of India in the case of Ramprasad Vs. State of Maharashtra, 1999 (5) SCC 30 held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“We are in full agreement with the contention of the learned counsel that Ext.52 cannot be used as evidence under Section 32 of the Evidence Act though it was recorded as a dying declaration. At the time when PW 1 gave the statement he would have been under expectation of death but that is not sufficient to wiggle it into the cassette of Section 32. As long as the maker of the statement is alive it would remain only in the realm of a statement recorded during investigation.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The same Court in the case of State of U .P vs Veer Singh And Ors, 2004 AIR SC (4) 4614, observed,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“It is trite law that when marker of purported dying declaration survives the same is not statement under Section 32 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (for short the Evidence Act’) but is a statement in terms of Section 164 of the Code. It can be used under Section 157 of the Evidence Act for the purpose of corroboration and under Section 155 for the purpose of contradiction.”                   </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>But in the case before us the victim made statement in the course of police investigation while he was in a critical and in the apprehension of Imminent death and in fact he had died after 12 days. In the case of state –vs- Akkel Ali and others reported in 5 BLC 4.39 it has been held that merely because the victim died some days after recording the dying declaration will not render the dying declaration inadmissible under section 32 of the Evidence Act. In that case dying declaration was recorded on 22.05.1989 and victim died on 15.06.1989. So, in the instant case there remains no ambiguity that the delayed death to extent of 12 days of the victim did not cast any impurity upon the admissibility of the dying declaration. In Munnawar &amp; ors. V. State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Ors. (2010) 5 SCC 451, the Supreme Court of India held that a dying declaration can be relied upon if the deceased remained alive for a long period of time after the incident and died after recording of the dying declaration.<br/><br/>The other objection, which was most vehemently submitted by the defence counsel, that the statement of the victim, while there was no apprehension of death, recorded by the investigation officer under section 161 of the code of criminal procedure, 1898 cannot be legally treated as dying declaration and it has no legal value for all practical purposes, To this objection the second part of section 32(1) of the Evidence Act, 1872 and section 162(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898  are sufficient to stand as answer. In this context it is pertinent to reproduce section 162(2) of the code which reads as under;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“162 (2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to apply to any statement falling within the provisions of clause (1) of section 32,clause (1) of Evidence Act, 1872, or to affect the provisions of section 27 of the Act.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Section 32(1) of the Evidence Act, 1872 clearly mention that “expectation of death” on part of the declaring person is not mandatory and section 162(2) of the code of Criminal procedure, 1898 says that general rule that statements recorded under section 161 of the code is not admissible in evidence Act, 1872.<br/><br/>Not only statement under section 161 of Cr. P.C. But also complaint recorded by a police officer can be treated as dying declaration in a fit case. In Paras Yadav &amp; Ors. Vs. State of Bihar (1999) 2 SCC 126, the supreme court of India held that a statement of the deceased recorded by a police office in a routine manner as a compliant and not as a dying declaration can also be treated as dying declaration after the death of the injured and relied upon if the evidence of the prosecution Witnesses clearly establishes that the deceased was conscious and was in a fit state of heath make the statement. Therefore, there is no bar to accord the status of dying declaration to a statement recorded under section 161 of the code of Criminal procedure, 1898 during investigation, and admit it in evidence, if other conditions as set out by the relevant sections is fulfilled. In the case of Shahidullah Khan and others Vs. The State reported in 12 DLR 537 the High court so held that statement made in the course of police investigation is admissible as dying declaration.<br/><br/>Regarding the objection raised by the learned Counsel of the appellant that no reliance can be placed on testimony of the witnesses who were examined by the Investigating officer after lapse of a Considerable time-it would suffice to say that in the instant case no occasion had arisen to contradict a statement reworded by the Investigation officer with statement given by the witnesses in the Court on oath. The supreme Court of India in the case of Ranbir and Ors. Vs. State of Punjab AIR 1973SC 1409 observed as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“The question of delay in examining a witness during investigation is material only if it is indicative and suggestive of some unfair practice by the investigating agency for the purpose of introducing a got-up witness to falsely support the prosecution case”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the instant case the witnesses stood unshaken at the fierce cross examination by the defence which suggests that no unfair practice by the Investigation officer for the purpose of introducing a got up witness to falsely support the prosecution case was adopted, and as such delayed examination of the witnesses by the Investigation officer did not harm the merit of the prosecution case.<br/><br/>In the instant case we have already noticed that p.w.2 Abu Sayeed, P.W.3–Sekander Ali and P.W.4-Shahabuddin deposed that they had witnessed in their own eyes that the accused appellant Alais Miah @ Ilias Miah inflicted dao blow to the right side of the head of the deceased Moulana Fazlul Hoque. The said piece of evidence was corroborated by P.W.11-Dr. Anwar Hossain who held the post-mortem examination of the dead body of the victim, P.W. 11-Dr. Md. Makbul Hossain who deposed that when the victim had been brought to Osmani Medical College Hospital, Sylhet he had found injury on the right side of the head caused by sharp cutting weapon. So the statement of the victim during the course of investigation in respect of his injury to the effect that that was caused by accused appellant Alais Miah@ Ilias Miah was corroborated by P.W.s 2,3,4 and 5 and the nature of the injury was sufficiently corroborated by the post-mortem report and by the evidence of Dr. Md. Mokbul Hossain (examined as P.W. 11 and P.W.16) Who had examined the victim Immediately after he had been brought to the Osmani Medical College Hospital, Sylhet. In instant case the prosecution examined credible witnesses. Four of them were eye witnesses and rest of them were the circumstantial witnesses who corroborated the eyewitnesses in material particulars. We have also perused the documents namely, post –mortem report and medical examination report. In a criminal case conviction can be based even on the testimony of a sole witness if it is credible. The defencc by cross-examining the prosecution witnesses not touch the credibility of those PW.s. The trial court and the High Court Division found that the PWs were credible. Both the trial Court and the High Court Division found concurrently found that the prosecution with the evidence of P.W.s 2, 3, 4 and 5 with was corroborated by the post-mortem report and other circumstantial evidence proved the charge leveled against the accused-appellant alais Miah @ Ilias Miah beyond reasonable doubt.<br/><br/>Having considered the submissions of the learned advocate for the accused-appellant and also the additional attorney General for the respondent and the evidence of record, we are of the view that the prosecution has successfully proved the guilt of the accused-appellant Alais Miah @ Ilias Miah beyond reasonabla doubt. The judgment and order of the High Court Division having been passed of proper assessment and consideration of material evidence of record, we do not find any illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgment and order and ad such they do not require any interference by this Court is no merit in the appeal.<br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is dismissed.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div><div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"> </div></div></div></div>

Muzammel Hossain, CJ:</span></u></strong><br/><br/>This criminal appeal by leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 24.04.2006 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.5214 of 2005 making the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>The prosecution case, in brief, is that on 09.09.2004 the complainant-appellant filed a petition of complaint being C.R. Case No.3783 of 2004 before the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka alleging, interalia, that the accused-respondent on 18.07.2004 issued a cheque drawn on Standard Chartered Bank in favour of the complainant for settling the business transaction; that the said cheque was presented for encashment in A.C. No. 37000577 with the Standard Chartered Bank through National Bank, Kawran Bazar on 19.07.2004 and the same was returned back to the drawer on the said date for insufficient fund. The complainant on 27.07.2004 issued a notice under section 138(b) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 upon the respondent and the same was served through Express Guaranteed Post and also through Courier Service and was received by the family members of the respondent on 03.08.2004. The actions and omissions of the accused-respondent in not arranging fund for payment of dues caused an offence under Section 138 of the said Act and hence the case.<br/><br/>The learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka on 09.09.2004 examined the complainant-appellant on oath under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, took cognizance of the case and accordingly, issued warrant of arrest against the accused-respondent under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.<br/><br/>The accused-respondent voluntarily surr-endered before the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka on 13.09.2004 and was released on bail on the same date. Thereafter, on 15.09.2004 the case was transferred to the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka for trial. The learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka by the order dated 03.10.2004 enlarged the accused-respondent on bail and by the order dated 01.12.2004 framed charge against the accused-respondent under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the order dated 01.12.2004 passed by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka the accused-respondent moved to the High Court Division under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.5214 of 2005 and a Division Bench of the High Court Division by its Judgment and order dated 24.04.2006 made the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>The complainant-appellant being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 24.04.2006 passed by the High Court Division preferred the instant Criminal Appeal with the Leave of this Division.<br/><br/>Leave was granted to consider the following submissions of the learned Advocate for the complainant-appellant:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"1. That the complainant having filed the instant complaint case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act,1881 on 09.09.2004 and at the relevant time provision was to make a demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice in writing and in the petition of complaint, the complainant having stated that the notice was received by the family member of the accused and in the application under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure there being no statement to the effect that the person who received the notice is not authorized to receive the same, the High Court Division committed an error of law in quashing the petition of complaint on the ground of alleged non-service of notice upon the accused."<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Mr. M. A. Samad, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that the learned Judges of the High Court Division failed to take into consideration that the address of the accused-respondent No.1 is 7/B, South Begunbari, Police Station-Tajgaon, District-Dhaka and that notices were sent to the said address by registered post and courier services but the accused-respondent used his address as 7/E, South Begunbari (Matisaya), Police Station-Tejgaon, District-Dhaka to mislead the court and the correct address will be proved by the witnesses at the time of trial and as such quashing the proceeding by the High Court Division has caused serious prejudice to the complainant-appellant occasioning failure of justice. He then submits that the complainant-appellant filed the instant complaint case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 on 09.09.2004 and at the relevant time provision was to make a demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice in writing and in the petition of complaint, the complainant stated that the notice was received by the family member of the accused. Mr. M.A. Samad also stenously submitted that in the application before the High Court Division under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure the accused respondent did not make any statement to the effect that the person who received the notice was not authorized to receive the same, therefore, the High Court Division committed an error of law in quashing the petition of complaint on the ground of alleged non-service of notice upon the accused-respondent. He finally submits that whether the notice was duly served upon the accused-respondent No.1 is a matter of disputed facts which can only be verified, proved or disproved by adducing evidence at the time of trial and as such the learned Judges of the High Court Division erred in law in passing the impugned judgment and order quashing the proceeding with the finding that the notice was not duly served upon the accused-respondent No.1.<br/><br/>No one appears on behalf of the respondent No.1.<br/><br/>Mrs. Mahmuda Begum, the learned Advocate-on-Record on behalf of the respondent No.2 supports the contention of the learned Advocate for the appellant. <br/><br/>We have heard the learned Advocates for both the parties and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division, leave granting order, concise statements and also other materials available on record.<br/><br/>In the instant case the moot question before us is whether due service of notice upon the accused-respondent at his correct address can be decided in a proceeding under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The complainant-appellant filed the petition of complaint against the accused-respondent on 09.09.2004 before the Court of Chief Metrop-olitan Magistrate, Dhaka. The complainant-appellant presented the cheque for encashment in the Bank on 19.07.2004 and the said cheque was returned back to him on the same date for insufficient fund and thereafter, the compla-inant-appellant on 27.07.2004 issued a notice under section 138(b) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 upon the accused-respondent through Express Guaranteed Post and also through Courier Service which was received by the family members of the respondent on 03.08.2004. In this case the complainant-appellant asserted that notice had been duly served upon the accused-respondent after dishonour of the cheque. It appears that in the complaint petition, the complainant-appellant clearly stated that notice was received by the family member of the accused-respondent. It is a disputed question of fact whether the notice was duly served upon the accused-respondent or not. The service of notice upon the accused-respondent can be ascertained by the trial Court after examining the witnesses of both the parties at the time of trial. In exercising the jurisdiction under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the High Court Division is not empowered to embark upon an enquiry as to whether notice was duly served upon the accused-respondent No.1 or not as that enquiry requires appreciation of evidence. Admittedly, in the application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure there was no statement to the effect that the person who received the notice was not authorized to receive it. Therefore, it would not be open to any party to invoke the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Division to ascertain as to whether notice was duly served or not and get the proceeding quashed for alleged non-service of notice upon the accused-respondent. In the case of Abdul Quader Chowdhury and others -Vs- The State reported in 28 DLR (AD) 38 this Division while speaking on the jurisdiction under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"In exercising the jurisdiction under section 561A the High Court would not embark upon an enquiry as to whether the evidence in question is reliable or not. That is the function of the trial Magistrate and ordinarily it would not be open to any party to invoke the High Court's inherent jurisdiction and contend that on a reasonable appreciation of the evidence the accusation made against the accused would not be sustained."<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Further in the case of Nizamuddin Mahmood -Vs- Abdul Hamid Bhuiyan and another reported in 60 DLR (AD) 195 this Division held that since the date of receipt of notice is a question of fact to be ascertained at the time of trial, non-disclosure of such fact in the complaint petition cannot render the proceeding liable to be quashed to the great prejudice of the complainant who is entitled to prove his case on evidence.<br/><br/>In the instant case the complainant-appellant asserted that he having received the information of dishonour of the cheque by the Bank, served notice under section 138(b) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 upon the accused-respondent No.1 and filed the instant complaint case.<br/><br/>It appears that the High Court Division on mistaken view embarked upon an enquiry as to whether notice was duly served upon the accused-respondent No.1 through Express Guaranteed Post and also through Courier Service. It is unfortunate to note that whether notice was duly served or not upon the accused-respondent at its correct address or upon its authorized agent or upon himself, all these are questions of facts which are to be ascertained at the time of trial by the trial Court by appreciating evidence adduced by the parties not by the High Court Division in exercising its jurisdiction under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><br/>It is the case of the complainant-appellant that the legal notice was served within 15 days [as per earlier provision i.e. prior to the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2006] then was, prior to the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act,2006] of the receipt of information of the return of the cheque as unpaid from the bank and as such the question of the date of receipt of the notice is not at all material for quashing the procee-ding under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act,1881, keeping in view the provisions of section 27 of General Clauses Act,1897 which contemplates that the service of a document by post shall be deemed to be effected at the time at which the document would be delivered in the ordinary course of post if that is done by properly addressing, pre-paying and posting by registered post. Reasons behind this presumption as embodied in law, are not opaque or absence to conceive. In the decision of the case of Nizamuddin Mahmood -Vs- Abdul Hamid Bhuiyan and another reported in 60 DLR (AD) 195 at page 197, paragraph 16 this Division observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"16. It further appears that it is not possible to know about date of receipt of the notice for the complainant and such a fact is to be proved at the trial and generally in all cases the receipt of notice is denied and service is asserted and therefore, such a question cannot be decided in a proceeding under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure in view of the decision of this Court in the case of Abdul Quader Chowdhury –Vs- State reported in 28 DLR (AD) 38 where it was held that where assessment of evidence is involved the case cannot be quashed." <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Generally, for the complainant, it is not possible to know about the date of the receipt of the notice and in almost all cases the receipt of notice is denied by the accused and service is asserted by the complainant. To resolve this dispute, which may become very crucial for a decision to be made in determining whether a cause of action has arisen or not in a cheque dishonor case, appreciation of evidence adduced by the parties is <em>sine qua non</em>.<br/><br/>The Negotiable Instruments (amendment) Act, 2006 (Act III of 2006), came into force on 9 February 2006. In the said amendment the mode of service of notice as required under section 138(b) has been incorporated in section 138 (1A) which reads as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“1(A) The notice required to be served under clause (b) of sub-section (1) shall be served in the following manner:<br/>By delivering it to the person on whom it is to  be served; or<br/>By sending it by registered post with acknowledgement due to that person at his usual or last known place of abode or business in Bangladesh; or<br/>By publication in a daily Bangla national newspaper having wide circulation.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The case at hand was filed earlier to the said amendment. Prior to this amendment, there was no specific provision as to the mode of service of notice as mentioned above.<br/><br/>However, the purpose of the object of issuing notice indicating the factum of dishonor of the cheque is to give an opportunity to the drawer to make the payment within the stipulated period, so that it will not be necessary for the payee to proceed against the drawer, in any criminal action, even though the bank dishonoured the cheque. In this case the accused respondent did not deny that he had no knowledge regarding the notice but he alleged that notice had not been duly served upon him which is purely a question of fact and can be settled down at the time of trial.<br/><br/>Exercise of jurisdiction under inherent power as envisaged under section 561A of the Code of Criminal procedure to have the criminal procedure quashed is an exception rather than a rule and the case for quashment must be treated as rarest of rare cases so that it can’t scuttle or burry a prosecution case on flimsy and unfounded reasons. The High Court Division, though, is clothed with inherent power to quash a proceeding or to make such order or orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice that power should be exercised in appropriate case, sparingly and cautiously but in the above case the High Court Division on a flimsy ground quashed the proceeding of a Criminal Case which is liable to be knocked down by this Division.<br/><br/>In view of the above findings and observations, we are of the view that the High Court Division in exercising its jurisdiction at the very first instance is not empowered to interfere with the trial proceedings by invoking jurisdiction under section 561A of Code of Criminal Procedure,1898. It has been consistently held by this Division that when the complainant stated that he had served a legal notice within 15 days from the date of the receipt of information of the return of the cheque, non-discloser of the date of service of notice in the complaint petition can not be a ground for quashing the proceeding. In this context reference may also be made to the decision of the case of Habibur Rahman Howlader -Vs- State and another reported in 53 DLR (AD) 111.<br/><br/>From the aforesaid discussions and findings, we are of the view that the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division is not sustainable in law. Accordingly, we find merit in the appeal.<br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed without any order as to cost. The impugned judgment and order dated 24.04.2006 passed by the High Court Division in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.5214 of 2005 is hereby set aside and consequently the proceeding of C. R.

Thereafter, the plaintiff filed an application under Order XI Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying  to direct the defendant to supply the name of the necessary parties and thereupon, as per direction of the Court  the defendant No. 1  supplied the name of one Haji Mohammad Sanaullah to be added as necessary party in the suit.       The learned trial Judge on consideration of the materials on record by his order dated 15.3.1999 allowed the prayer of the plaintiff holding that the said Haji Mohammad Sanaullah is not a necessary party in the suit. Against which  the defendant No. 1 unsuccessfully moved a revisional application being Civil Revision No 1473 of 1999  before this Court and then he  went up to the Appellate Division and during pendency of the C.P.L.A. No.698 of 2002 before the Appellate Division the plaintiff of the suit filed an application for impleading the said Haji Mohammad Sanaullah as defendant in the suit and the learned trial Judge by order dated 24.10.2002 allowed the said application,  in this way the said Haji Mohammad Sanaullah has been added as defendant No.19 in the suit and consequently, the defendant-petitioner did not proceed with the C.P.L.A. No.698 of 2002 before the Appellate Division.<br/><br/>In usual course the summon/s was served upon the added defendant No.19, Haji Mohammad Sanaullah and thereafter,  he appeared in the suit and  on 10.10.2005 filed an application for striking out of his name from the suit and also striking out of the schedule property-3 from the suit property as described in the plaint.<br/><br/>The learned Joint District Judge by his order dated 10.10.2005 fixed the matter for hearing on 17.11.2005 with a direction to serve the copy of the application upon the parties. On 22.11.2006 the defendant No.19 served a copy of the application dated 10.10.2003 to the learned Advocate of the plaintiff although the defendant No.19 did not serve any copy upon the contesting defendant No.1 and thereupon, on 24.01.2006   the defendant No.1 filed an application praying for a direction to the defendant No.19 to serve a copy of the application dated 10.10.2005 to him and also for adjournment the hearing of the application dated 10.10.2005.<br/><br/>The learned Joint District Judge upon hearing the application of the defendant no. 1 (petitioner) was pleased to allow the said  application as prayed for but subsequently, on the same day he took up the petition dated 10.10.2005 for hearing and upon hearing the learned Advocate for the added defendant No.19 allowed the petition dated 10.10.2005 filed by the defendant No.19 striking out of the name of the defendant No.19 from the plaint and also striking out  of  the schedule property-3 of the suit property as described in the plaint.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order dated 24.01.2006 the present defendant-petitioner has approached this Court in an application under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the present Rule.<br/><br/>Mr. Golam Arshad, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner submits that admittedly the plaintiff and defendant No.1-4 transferred the schedule property-3 to the added defendant No.19 Haji Mohammad Sanaullah resulting  he became  a co-sharer to the suit property and in a suit for partition it is the mandatory provision of law that all  the ejmali properties in between the co-sharers should be taken into hotchpot and since the  schedule-3 of the plaint has not yet been partitioned by metes and bounds with the  defendant No.19  the learned Joint District Judge ought to have rejected the application for striking out the name of  the added defendant No.19 Haji Mohammad Sanaullah from the suit and also for striking out of the schedule property-3 from the suit property.<br/><br/>Mr. Golam Arshad, the learned Advocate in the course of argument upon referring to the application dated 24.01.2006 along with impugned order dated 24.01.2006 submits that on 24.01.2006 the present petitioner as defendant No.1 filed an application praying for a direction to supply the copy of the application filed by the defendant No.19 and also for adjournment for submitting written objection and the learned Joint District Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka upon hearing the application allowed the application as prayed for but the reasons best known to the learned trial Judge as to why on that date few minutes after he took up the application dated 10.10.2005 filed by the added defendant No.19 for hearing in absence of the defendant No.1 and mechanically allowed the same in a summary manner and as such the impugned order  is not only cryptic in nature also contrary to the first part of the impugned  order which resulted  in the  failure of justice. The learned Advocate finally criticized the impugned order in submitting that in the facts and circumstances of the case the impugned order is perverse being contrary to law as well as the materials on record and as such the same is liable to be set-aside.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Mr. M. I, Farooqui, the learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff-opposite party No.1 by filing counter affidavit supports the impugned 0rder No.104 dated 24.01.2006 which was according to him just, correct and proper. The learned Advocate in the course of argument upon placing the counter affidavit submits that the plaintiff as well as defendant Nos.1-4 transferred their entire shares of schedule No. 3 of the suit property and in that view of the matter the defendant No.19 is not a necessary party in the suit whatsoever. Mr. Farooqui, the learned Advocate next submits that in the facts and circumstances of the case the impugned order is based on correct evaluation of facts and materials on record   inasmuch as admittedly the plaintiff and defendant Nos.1-4 transferred their entire shares of the schedule property-3 to the added defendant No.19 Haji Mohammad Sanaullah. He further submits that the learned trial Judge after allowing the adjournment application of the defendant-petitioner took up the application dated 10.10.2005 for striking out the name of the defendant No.19 from the plaint, which is a mere omission or irregularity, not an illegality and the law is well settled that mere omission or mere irregularity will not be a ground for interference when the order is otherwise supportable on merit.<br/><br/>Mr. M. I, Farooqui, finally submits that the order striking out the name of the defendant No.19 from the plaint has not occasioned any failure of justice inasmuch as in the facts and circumstances of the case the added defendant No. 19 is not a necessary party in the suit whatsoever and as such the question of interference by this Court sitting under revisional jurisdiction does not arise at all.<br/><br/>Perused the revisional application, counter affidavit along with Annexures as filed thereto and considered the submissions of the learned Advocates of both the parties. It appears from the record that the defendant No.19 Haji Mohammad Sanaullah was made party as added defendant No.19 pursuant to an application filed by the plaintiff on 24.10.2002 and thereafter, the said added defendant No.19 appeared in the suit and filed an application for striking out of  his name  from the plaint and also for striking out the schedule-3 of the suit property as described in the plaint  and the trial Judge on receipt of the application ordered to supply a copy of the same upon the parties and fixed the next date of the suit on 27.11.2005 and on that date the added defendant No.19 filed hazira and the defendant No. 1  by filing application prayed for time  which was allowed and thereafter, on 24.01.2006 the present defendant-petitioner filed an application for adjournment of the case on the ground for supplying a copy of the application dated 10.10.2005  to him and also for filing written objection and the trial Court below upon hearing the defendant No. 1 allowed the application of the defendant No.1. Subsequently, on that date  by the self-same order the trial Court below  without hearing the contesting defendant No. 1 allowed the application dated 10.10.2005  filed by the added  defendant No.19 for striking out the  name of the added defendant No.19 and also for striking out the schedule property-3 from the suit properties  as described in the plaint.<br/>Now, the only question for consideration is, whether the learned Joint District Judge has committed any illegality in passing the impugned order resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice.  To resolve this dispute we feel it necessary to quote hereunder the relevant portion of the application filed by the defendant No.1 on 24.01.2006, which reads as follows:“</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>১। অদ্য অত্রমোকদ্দমাটি দঃ শুঃ জন্য দিন ধার্য্য আছে বটে।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">২। ১ নং বিবাদী অত্র মোকদ্দমা ১৯ নং বিবাদী কর্তৃক দাখিলকৃত কপি প্রাপ্ত হয় নাই। ১ নং বিবাদীকে দরখাসেত্মর কপি দেওয়া হয় নাই। তদাবস্থায় ১ নং বিবাদীর প্রতি দরখাসেত্মর কপি প্রদান করা আবশ্যক। কারন- ১ নং বিবাদী অত্র মোকদ্দমায় প্রতিদ্বন্দিকারী বিবাদী। ফলে ১ নং বিবাদীকে কপি দাখিল সাপেক্ষে মোকদ্দমা দরখাসত্ম শুনানী মুলতবী করিয়া আপত্তি দাখিলের জন্য সময় প্রার্থনা করিয়াছে। মজ্ঞুর করা হউক।<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">The learned Joint District Judge upon hearing the application by its 0rder No.104 dated 24.01.2006 allowed the application stating as follows:“</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>১৯ নং বিবাদী পক্ষ হাজিরা দাখিল করিয়াছেন। বাদী পক্ষ হাজিরা দাখিল করিয়াছেন। ১ নং বিবাদীপক্ষ এক দরখাসত্ম দাখিল করতঃ দরখাসত্ম বর্নিত কারনে সময় প্রার্থনা করিয়াছে। প্রার্থনা মঞ্জুর করা হইল।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the above, it is apparent that the prayer of the defendant No.1 was allowed but subsequently, the reasons best known to the learned Joint District Judge that as to why on the same date by the self-same order in absence of the present defendant-petitioner allowed the application  dated 10.10.2005 filed by the added defendant No.19 for striking out the name of the added defendant No.19   from the plaint of the suit as well as striking out of his property namely, schedule property-3 as described in the plaint  of the suit.<br/><br/>On the face of the impugned order, it appears that the first part of the order is totally   inconsistent and contrary with the last part of the impugned order. Therefore, we are inclined to hold that the learned Joint District Judge seriously erred in law in passing the impugned order without properly applying his judicial mind into the facts and circumstances of the case and law bearing on the subject and the same has resulted in an error in the impugned decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/><br/>The Court cannot grant relief against the defendant or plaintiff either generally or otherwise which is inconsistent or contrary to its order. Granting of such relief against the defendant or plaintiff without affording opportunity to contest, is not only violative of the principle of natural justice but also against judicial norms. Mr. M. I, Farooqui,  is not correct in submitting that the order striking out the name of the defendant No.19 from the plaint as well as striking out the property namely schedule property-3 as described in the plaint  of the suit has not occasioned any failure of justice.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute without any order as to costs. The impugned order so far it relates to allowing the application dated 10.10.2005 filed by the added defendant No.19 is set-aside.<br/><br/>Since the matter has been dragging over a period of 10 (ten) years the trial Court is directed to expedite the trial of the suit in accordance with law.<br/><br/>Communicate the order at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

No. 36 of 1993 under section 302/34 of the Penal Code shall not be brought before this Court to be dealt with in accordance with law so that this Court may satisfy itself that they are not been detained in custody illegally, improperly and without lawful authority, and/or pass such other or further, order or orders as to this Court may deem fit and proper.<br/><br/>The petitioners were convicted in Sessions Case No. 125 of 1996 by the Additional Sessions Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Sylhet by order of conviction and sentence dated 13.09.2001 convicting the petitioners under section 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentencing each of them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Tk. 2,000/- in default to suffer rigorous impriso-nment for 06(six) months more. Then there was a jail appeal in this Court being jail appeal no. 117 of 2002 filed by the petitioners and that was also dismissed by judgment and order dated 25.06.2003.<br/><br/>The petitioners were arrested by police on 23.05.1992 and was forwarded to the Court and on that date they were sent to jail hajot. During the whole period of trial they were in custody and ultimately the trial was concluded on 13.09.2001 and they are still in jail in connection with the conviction and sentence mentioned above. An application was filed on behalf of the petitioners to the Additional Sessions Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Sylhet for treating their custody in jail hajot for more than 09(nine) years as part of their sentence but that was rejected by the learned judge. The petitioners in various ways requested the jail authority to release them from jail complying with section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure hereafter to be referred to as the ‘Code’ but the authority concerned refused to release them by saying that the trial Court did not say in the judgment that the period of remaining in hajot during the trial about 09(nine) years and 03(three) months shall be reduced from the sentence. The petitioners then sent the notice demanding justice to the opposite parties praying for releasing them from the jail on 06.06.2014 but that was not complied with. The Senior Jail Super Dhaka Central Jail -2, Kashimpur, Gazipur informed the learned advocate for the petitioners vide memorandum no. 44.07.3300.080.02.00.009.12-2195 dated 23.06.2014 and memorandum no. 44.07.3300.082.02.04.14-2308 dated 26.06.2014 informing that the petitioner no.1 Hazrat Ali has earned remittance of 04(four) years 01(one) month 07(seven) days that is 1447 days upto may,2014 and accordingly his date of release is 05.08.2027and more remittance may be given in future and his date of release may occur before that. As there was no order in judgment that the time in hajot shall be excluded from the sentence he will not get the benefit of section 35A of the ‘Code’. As regards the petitioner no.2 Jalil Mia @ Abdul Jalil, it was informed that he has received the remittance of sentence for 1372 days that is 03(three) years 09(nine) months 22(twenty two) days upto 30.03.2014 and his expected date of release is on 21.03.2027 if he deposit the fine otherwise it will be 2109.2027. Getting no way left the petitioners filed this application under section 491 of the ‘Code’ and obtained this Rule.<br/><br/>Mr. S.M. Shafiqul Islam with Mr. Md. Shahjahan, the learned advocates appeared for the petitioners while Mr. Amit Talukder, the learned Deputy Attorney General appeared for the state.<br/><br/>Mr. S.M. Shafiqul Islam, the learned advocate appearing for the petitioners submits that the accused petitioners were arrested on 23.05.1992 and already they have received remittance of sentence for 04(four) years 01(one) month 07(seven) days and 03(three) years 09(nine) months 22(twenty two) days respectively and the judgment and order of conviction and sentence was passed on 13.09.2001 that means they were in jail hajot for 09(nine) years 03(three) months and 20(twenty) days and remittance have been given to them for about 04(four) years which make it clear that from the sentence of 30(thirty) years they will get benefit of about 13(thirteen) years. If section 35A of the ‘Code’ is applied upon them. He further submitted that in the jail, sentence of 9(nine) months constitute one year and life sentence is equivalent to sentence of 30(thirty) years but one is to serve 22 (twenty two) years 6(six) months to complete the life sentence. The petitioners have served more a 13(thirteen) years and they have received benefit of 13 (thirteen) years. As such it is clear that they have served out their sentences and they are entitled to be released forthwith. The authority by denying to release them have done illegality and as such the petitioners are to be released. <br/><br/>During hearing of the matter it appears to us that some question of law having public interest is involved in this matter and as such we decided to take assistantce of some senior lawyers as amicus curiae to reach at a proper decision and in this respect Mr. Khondoker Mahbub Hossain, Mr. Munsurul Haque Chowdhury, the senior advocates and Mr. M.A. Mobin, advocate were appointed to assist us in the matter as amicus curiae. Receiving our information they all appeared before us and submitted on the following point.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“whether section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure will be applicable in the facts and circumstances of the instant case and whether the accused petitioners will get any benefit out of that”.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Munsurul Haque Chowdhury, the learned senior advocate appearing as amicus curiae submitted that in our country, the sentence of imprisonment for life is equivalent to 30(thirty) years. But under the law, one is to serve the sentence of 22(twenty two) years 6(six) months to complete the life sentence. He placed a decision reported in 19 BLC(AD) page-204 and then placed paragraph 24 of that decision where the meaning of life sentence have been discussed-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“It can be stated that sentence of “imprisonment for Life” as used in Bangladesh is utterly a misnomer; indeed it appears to be an erroneous interpretation. The way it has been interpreted, the word “Life” does not bear its normal linguistic meaning. In other words, a person sentenced to imprisonment for life does not necessarily spend his life in prison, although section 45 of the Penal Code defines “Life” as the life of a human being unless the contrary appears from the context. The given interpretation has been arrived at with the aid of section 57 of the Penal Code, which provides that in calculating fraction of terms of punishment, imprisonment for life shall be reckoned as equivalent to rigorous imprisonment for 30(thirty) years. This last mentioned section read with relevant provision of the Jail Code effectively means that a person sentenced to imprisonment for life will be released after spending a maximum of 22 years in prison. Under section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure the period of time spent by the accused in custody during pendency of the trial would be deducted from his total sentence. Thus we find that in many serious murder cases, where the trial lasts for many years, the accused who is found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for life gets released after serving a total of 22  years including the period spent in custody during trial. Hence, the sentence of imprisonment for life imposed at the time of delivery of judgment appears to be a lenient sentence and may in the minds of some appear to be not a proper sentence, especially when some horrific facts are disclosed in evidence.”<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Baising on this decision he submitted that a person sentenced to imprisonment for life will be released after spending maximum of 22years imprisonment and under section 35A of the ‘Code’, the period of time spent by the accused in custody during pendency of the trial would be deducted from his total sentence. Thus an accused who is found guilty and sentence to imprisonment for life gets release after serving a total of 22years including the period he spent in custody during trial.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">He further submitted that this being a decision of the Appellate Division is binding upon all and as such in the instant case also the petitioners will be released after serving of 22years including the period they spent in custody during trial. He then submitted that the trial Court judgment in this case was passed on 13.09.2001 and the jail appeal was disposed off on 25.06.2003 and section 35A of the ‘Code’ was inserted in Act No. 16 of 1991 which came on 5.5.1991. It was then replaced by Act No. 19 of 2003 on 08.07.2003. He submitted that as it was replaced, operation of the Act will be from 1991 and not from 2003. As such the benefit of this section 35A of the ‘Code’ will be applicable from 1991 and the instant case the petitioners were convicted by the trial Court on 13.09.2001 and as the word shall was used, the petitioners shall get benefit of section 35A of the ‘Code’ in the instant case also. As we consider that the first information report of this case was filed on 22.05.1992 then also it can safely by considered that in this case, section 35A of the ‘Code’ will be applicable and accordingly according to him both the petitioners are entitled to get the benefit of section 35A of the ‘Code’. Mr. Munsurul Haque Chowdhury placed before us section 35A of the ‘Code’ when it was enacted as Act No. 16 of 1991.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“35A Term of imprisonment in cases where convicts are in custody:- where a person is in custody at the time of his conviction and the offence for which he is a convicted is not punishable with death or imprisonment for life, the Court may in passing the sentence of imprisonment take into consideration the continuous period of his custody immediately proceedings his conviction.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Upon perusal of this, he submitted that power is given to the Court to take into consideration the continuous period of his custody and in case of conviction and sentence not with death or imprisonment for life. But the law has changed in 2003 by Act No.19 section 35A of the ‘Code’ has been replaced by a new section 35A of the ‘Code’ which runs as follows-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“35A. Deduction of imprisonment in cases where convicts may have been in custody:- 1) Except in the case of an offence punishable only the death, when any Court finds an accused guilty of an offence and upon conviction and sentence, such accused to any term of imprisonment simple of rigorous, it shall deduct from the sentence of imprisonment, the total period the accused may have been in custody in the mean time in connection with that offence. 2) If the total period of custody prior to conviction refer to sub-section-1 is longer than the period of imprisonment to which the accused is sentenced, the accused shall be deemed to have been served out the sentence of imprisonment and shall be released at once, if in custody unless, required to be detained in connection with any other offence, and if the accused is also sentenced to pay a fine in addition to such sentence, the fine shall be remitted.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>This Act as it stands shows that it is the duty of the authority to deduct from the sentence of imprisonment the total period, the accused may have been in custody and that this is applicable to all cases except punishable only with death.<br/><br/>Mr. Munsurul Haque Chowdhury further submitted that as Act No. 19 of 2003 has been replaced in place of Act No. 16 of 1991, the benefit of section 35A of the ‘Code’ will be on the basis of Act No. 19 of 2003 but it will take effect from the date Act No. 16 of 1991 came into operation and in the instant case the petitioners will get benefit of section 35A of the ‘Code’. Moreover, the appeal being a continuation of the trial proceeding, the instant case was disposed of on 25.06.2003 when the judgment of jail appeal was passed. At that time Act No. 19 of 2003 although has not come into operation but the petitioners will get benefit of section 35A of the ‘Code’ as Act No. 19 of 2003 came into operation after replacing Act No. 16 of 1991. He last of all submitted that considering all these aspects and on calculation, it is found that the petitioners have served out the sentence and they are entitled to be released.<br/><br/>Mr. M.A. Mobin, the learned advocate appearing as amicus curiae submitted that the Act No. 19 of 2003 will have retrospective effect as it has come in place of Act No. 16 of 1991 by amending some rights. In support of his submission he placed before us the case of Mohammad Alam and 03(three) others versus the State reported in 19 DLR (SC) page 242 and submitted that</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Law –Altered during the pendency of the case-Law existing at the commencement of the trial will govern the case, unless the new law is expressly or impolitely given a retrospective effect.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>With this he submitted that when the Law is altered during the pendency of an action, the rights of the parties are to be decided according to the Law as it existed when the action was began, unless the new statutes shows a clear intention to vary such rights. Where the legislature has made its intention clear that the amending Act should have retrospective operation, there is no doubt that it must be so construed, even though the consequences may entail hardship to a party. But even without express words to that effect, retrospective effect may be given to an amending Law, if the new Law manifests such a necessary intendment. With regard to the procedural Law, the general principle is that alternatives in procedure are retrospective unless there be some good reasons against such a view. If a statute deals merely with the procedure in an action, and does not affect the rights of the parties, it will be held to apply prima facie, to all actions pending as well as future. It is only if it be more than a mere matter of procedure, i.e. if it touches a right in existence at the passing of the new Act, that the aggrieved party would be entitled to succeed in giving a successful challenge to the retrospective effect of the new Act.<br/><br/>He then submitted that in the instant case the new statute shows a clear intention to very such rights because in the original Act, the sentence was death or imprisonment for life and that the power of the Court was given by the word “may take into consideration” but in the amended Act the sentence was only death and duty was given to the Court to deduct the time of imprisonment in jail hajot by the word “shall” and as such according to him it should be decided that Act No. 19 of 2003 has got retrospective effect with the pending cases and he submitted that the benefit of section 35A of the ‘Code’ should be given to the petitioners. This decision of 19 DLR (SC) page 242 has been considered and accepted in a case of Abdul Wadud Versus the State reported in 48 DLR (AD) page 6 in considering the legal position of an amendment in procedural Law.<br/><br/>Mr. Mobin then submitted the decision in the case of Adnan Afzal versus Sher Afzal reported in 21 DLR (SC) 123 and submitted that after the coming into operation the West Pakistan Family Courts Act-1964, proceedings pending before the Criminal Courts also came under the jurisdiction of this Court. In that decision, it was held that</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The combined effect of sections 5 and 20 of the Family Courts Act is clearly to give exclusive jurisdiction to the Family Courts without, in any way, dismissing or curtailing the rights already possessed by a litigant with regard to the schedule of matters. The Family Courts Act has changed the forum, altered the method of the trial and empowered the Court to grant better remedies. It has thus brought about only procedural change and not affected any substantive right. According to general rule of interpretation,, a procedural statute is to be given retroactive effect unless the law contains a contrary indication. There is no such contrary indication in the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, so the Act affected also the pending proceedings and the District Magistrate was right in holding that Courts of Magistrate has no longer any jurisdiction either to entertain, hear and adjudicate upon a matter relating to maintenance.”<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Mr. M. A. Mobin lastly submitted that even at the Appellate Division stage after passing the judgment of conviction and sentence by the trial Court and the appellate Court, the benefit of section 35A of the ‘Code’ can be given to the petitioners. In support of his submissions he placed before us the case of Mohammad Ali Shanu Versus the State reported in 13 MLR(AD) 121 and submitted that in that case the petitioners were convicted by the trial Court under section 394/34 of the Penal Code and the said conviction and sentence was affirmed by the High Court Division. In this case the FIR was lodged on 06.09.1986, trial Court convicted the petitioner on 02.06.1991, then the High Court Division as Appellate Court dismissed the appeal on 31.01.2006 and the Appellate Division passed the judgment on 10.12.2007. In the Appellate Division the benefit of section 35A of the ‘Code’ was given to the petitioners and with the following observation, the petition was dismissed.<br/><br/>“As regards the sentence, the learned advocate submitted that the accused has been languishing in custody about a year before the trial has commenced under the provision of law, the accused is entitled to get the benefit of the said period to be deducted from the total period of conviction. The said submission has substance and accordingly, the actual period spent in custody prior to trial is liable to be deducted from the period of sentence”.<br/>He then submitted that in the instant case also the petitioners were not given benefit of section 35A of the ‘Code’ in the trial Court and in the appellate Court but they are entitled to get it even at this stage. As such he submitted that the petitioners shall get the benefit of section 35A of the ‘Code’ and the rule is to be made absolute.<br/><br/>Mr. Khondakor Mahbub Hossain, the learned senior advocate appearing as amicus curiae submitted that in this case as the order was passed by the Tribunal legally petition under section 491 of the ‘Code’ does not lie. He submitted that in a petition under section 491 of the ‘Code’ the Court cannot see the propriety of the order and it cannot go into the merit of the case as to whether the conviction and sentence was legal or not. As such this petition filed under section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure where no remedy has been given to the accused petitioner under section 35A of the ‘Code’ legally or illegally, this Court cannot consider that matter and pass any order in this respect. Later on he submitted that this petition under section 491 of the ‘Code’ can be transferred into a petition under section 537 read with section 561A of the ‘Code’ and the power of this Court under section 537 read with section 561A of the ‘Code’ can be applied. In support of his contention he placed before us the case of Bakul Mia versus Govt. of Bangladesh and others reported in 46 DLR(AD) 530 wherein it has been stated</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Where there has been a judgment and conviction passed by a Court, the High Court Division cannot interfere under section 491 on the ground of irregularities.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>He submitted that if a petition is filed for transferring the petition filed under section 491 of the ‘Code’ to a petition under section 537 read with section 561A of the ‘Code’, then the Court can allow it and proceed to see the legality or illegality of the order and pass appropriate order in this case. But he submitted that this petition has not been filed and as such consideration of this petition under section 491 of the ‘Code’ as petition under section 537 read with section 561A of the ‘Code’ is not sustainable. Consequently according to him this Rule has got no merit and is liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>Mr. Hasan Arif, the learned senior advocate on request of us being present in the Court room submitted that if it is found that the period of confinement in the custody is beyond the sentence passed, then certainly the confinement becomes wrongful confinement and in that position a petition under section 491 of the ‘Code’ is maintainable. He submitted that the Court cannot see whether the conviction and sentence passed are legal or not but if it is found that whatever the sentence upon the petitioner has been passed and the petitioner is to serve following the Jail Code, if it is found that he has served out the sentence and ought to have been released earlier but the jail authority has not released him, then this Court can pass order under section 491 of the ‘Code’ to direct the jail authority to release the petitioner from jail custody. As such according to him, this petition filed under section 491 of the ‘Code’ is maintainable if on calculation, it is found that the petitioners have served out the sentences following the law and then they are entitled to be released.<br/><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General placed the decision of the case of Thirumalai Chemicals Limited Versus Union of India and others reported in (2011) 6 SCC 739 wherein it has been held</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Therefore unless the language used plainly manifesto in express terms or by necessary implication a contrary intention a statute divesting vested rights is to be construed as prospective, a statute merely procedural is to be construed as retrospective and a statute which while procedural in its character affects vested rights adversely is to be construed as prospective.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>He then submitted another decision in the case of Hitendra Vishun Thakur and others versus State of Moharashtra and others reported in AIR 1994(SC) 2623 wherein it has been held in paragraph 25 that</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">A statute which affects substantive right is presumed to be prospective in operation, unless made retrospective, either expressly or by necessary intendment, whereas a statute which merely affects procedure, unless such a construction is textually, impossible is presumed to be retrospective in its application, should not be given an extended meaning, and should be strictly confined to its clearly defined limits.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Law relating to forum and limitation is procedural in nature, whereas law relating to right of action and right of appeal, even through remedial, is substantive in nature.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Every litigant has a vested right in substantive law, but no such right exists in procedural law.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A procedural statute should not generally speaking be applied retrospectively, where the result would be to create new disabilities or obligations, or, to impose new duties in respect of transactions already accomplished.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A statute which not only changes the procedure but also creates a new rights and liabilities, shall be construed to be prospective in operation, unless otherwise provided, either expressly a by necessary implication.”</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">He then submitted another decision in the case of Farid Ali versus the State reported in 4 BLC 27 wherein it has been held</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Sentence- Normal sentence under section 302 of the Penal Code is death but under some extenuating circumst-ances it may be imprisonment for life but such sentence can never be 30(thirty) years taking the aid of section 57 of the Penal Code.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>By placing the decisions mentioned above, the learned Deputy Attorney General submitted that the benefit of section 35A of the Code will not be applicable in the facts and circumstances of the case. He submitted that section 35A of the Code was enacted in 1991 and at that time, for any sentence of death or imprisonment for life, the said section was not applicable. When the Act was amended on 08.07.2003, the jail appeal was not pending, because the jail appeal was dismissed on 25.06.2003. As such the petitioners here also shall not get the benefit of section 35A of the Code. He then submitted that no Court in their judgment and order has given the benefit to the petitioners as such on this Count also, the petitioners are not entitled to get any benefit of section 35A of the Code. Last of all he submitted that there is no rule that the imprisonment for life shall be treated as imprisonment for 30(Thirty) years. It is a fact that the government allows release of one convict sentenced for life imprisonment when he has served sentence of 30(thirty) years but it is not a rule. The petitioners cannot claim it as their right. As such he submitted that on the points he submitted, the petitioners cannot be released at this stage and the rule is liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>Last of all in reply to submissions made above, Mr. Md. Shahjahan, the learned advocate appeared for the petitioner along with Mr. Md. Shafiqul Islam and submitted that if it is found that the petitioner is in custody beyond the legal period which he ought to have been served out then this Court can order to release him under section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In reply to the submission of amicus curiae Mr. Khondaker Mahbub Hossain, he submitted that the simple question is whether the petitioners have served out their sentence imposed by law or not. If it is found that the petitioners have served out their sentence and ought to have been released earlier, then the Court can pass order under section 491 of the Code to release them. He further submitted that the question is not whether this is a petition under section 537 read with section 561A of the ‘Code’ or section 491 of the ‘Code’, but it is to be seen whether the persons detained have served out their sentence and if the Court is satisfied that they have served out the sentence beyond time then this Court can pass order under section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The question is not the validity of the conviction and sentence and nobody is arguing regarding the merit of this case on that point and as such there is no bar to file an application under section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Even if it is found that the petition under section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not maintainable, in this case which is not, this Court without waiting for a petition to be filed for transfer can consider the petition as under section 537 read with section 561A of the ‘Code’ and pass necessary orders under the law. For this problem the petition cannot be held to be not maintainable and the petitioners cannot be deprived of the proper order as required under the law. He then submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case, it is clear that the petitioner have served out their sentences as section 35A of the Code will be applicable to them and hence they are being detained illegally and improperly and as such the rule is to be made absolute.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned advocate for both the sides and the learned amicus curiae and perused the application and the materials on record. The accused petitioners were arrested by police on 23.05.1992 and forwarded to the Court and since then they are in custody. The petitioners were convicted in Sessions Case No. 125 of 1996 under section 302/34 of the Penal Code and each of them were sentenced to suffer rigorous impriso-nment for life and to pay a fine of Tk.2,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 06(six) months more. Against this judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 13.09.2001, the petitioners filed Jail Appeal No. 170 of 2002 which was also dismissed by judgment and order dated 25.06.2013. Thereafter the petitioners filed the application for inclusion of the period of suffering hajot which could be entertained under section 35A of the ‘Code’. But by order no.90 dated 08.07.2010 that prayer was refused by the trial Court. The petitioners tried to satisfy the jail authority as regards the application under section 35A of the ‘Code’ but the authority refused to release them on the understanding that the trial Court did not say in the judgment that period of remaining in the hajot during trial shall be deducted from the sentence and when this has not been stated in the judgment, the benefit of section 35A of the ‘Code’ cannot be given to the petitioners. But we find here that the trial Court judgment was passed on 13.09.2001 and the jail appeal was disposed of on 25.06.2003 and section 35A of the ‘Code’ was inserted by Act No. 16 of 1991 dated 05.05.1991 and it was then replaced by Act No. 19 of 2003 dated 08.07.2003. When it was replaced, operation of the Act No. 19 of 2003 will be from 05.05.1991 and not from 08.07.2003 and the benefits given in Act No. 19 of 2003 is to be given. Thus we find that these petitioners shall get the benefit of section 35A of the Code as given in Act No. 19 of 2003, and the order no. 90 is not legal.<br/><br/>The petitioner no.1 for his good behavior manner and activities has been awarded exemption for 04(four) years 01(one) month 07(seven) days till 1<sup>st</sup> day of July, 2014 as per Jail Code and the petitioner no.2 has got the said exemption for 3(three) years 9(nine) months and 22(twenty two) days till 30<sup>th</sup> March, 2014 and they have suffered sentence from 13.09.2001 and till today they are in custody that means they have suffered till today i.e. 04.12.2014 for 13(thirteen) years, 2(two) months and 22(twenty two) days and before judgment they have suffered 9(nine) years, 3(three) months 20(twenty) days in hajot and as such they have suffered 22(twenty two) years 6(Six) months 12(twelve) days except the exemption given to them. We have already found from the judgment passed on 19BLC(AD) 204, that a person serving sentence of life imprisonment is to serve a maximum of 22 years in jail, which makes it clear that even without calculating the days of exemptions given the petitioners have already served their sentences and they are entitled to be released forthwith. The case will be far better, if the exemptions are taken into consideration. <br/><br/>In consideration of the reported decisions referred by Mr. M.A. Mobin, the amicus curie, we get that in the original Act, the sentence of death or imprisonment for life was mentioned and the power of the Court was given by the word “may take into consideration.” But in the amended Act, the sentence was only death and duty was given to the Court that it shall deduct the time of imprisonment in hajot and as such Act No. 19 of 2003 has been given retrospe-ctive effect with the pending cases and benefit of Section 35A of the ‘Code’ is to be given to the petitioners. We also get that even at this stage in considering this rule, we can give benefit of section 35A of the ‘Code’ which was not given in the trial and appellate judgment, if we follow 13 MLR (AD) 121 case.<br/><br/>In considering the submission made by Mr. Khondaker Mahbub Hossain, we get that he has submitted that in this case, the petitioners are not entitled to get benefit of section 35A of the ‘Code’ as the application has been filed under section 491 of the ‘Code’. We respectfully differ with his submission that we have already got that mere mentioning of the section will not debar anybody from the relief. Moreover, this is not the question of legality of the judgment and order of conviction and sentence, when the petition under section 491 of the ‘Code’ may be a bar, but this is a question of keeping a person in jail beyond the time he is required to stay in jail and as such we find that when the question is whether the person is being detained in jail beyond his term of sentence, this petition is maintainable.<br/><br/>Thus we find that this petition filed under section 491 of the ‘Code’ is maintainable, the petitioner shall get the benefit of section 35A of the ‘Code’ and that the petitioners have served the sentence as required under the law, and as such we have got no hesitation to hold that the petitioners are being detained in jail illegally, improperly and without any lawful authority and they are entitled to be released forthwith.<br/><br/>The rule is thus made absolute. The petitioners 1) Hazrat Ali, son of Jabed Ali and 2) Jalil, son of Ishak Ali are directed to be released forthwith if not wanted in connection with any other case.<br/><br/>Before parting, we want to note our heartiest gratitude on the participation, deliberation of the amicus curiae mentioned above and we respectfully remember their services, arguments advanced and we admire and say that the deliberations have immensely helped us in reaching to the decision of this case. Very respectfully we acknowledge their services herein.<br/><br/>Inform the opposite parties at once.  <br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Case No. 359 of 2002 under section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 pending before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka, which was registered as Miscellaneous Case No. 7287 of 2005.<br/><br/>The C.R. Case No. 359 of 2002 arises out of an application filed by the respondent No.2, Anowar Hossain, against the petitioner alleging, inter alia, that the petitioner had business relationship with the firm Messrs Karim Galvanizing Steel Limited, of which accused No.1, Joynul Karim is the Managing Director, accused No.2 M. Rahman alias Moshbahur Rahman is the Executive Director and accused No.3, Jaglul Karim is a Director, and in accordance with their business dealings, the complainant-petitioner supplied aluminum steel goods worth Tk. 2,36,00,000/-, against which two bills were submitted, each for Tk. 1,18,00,000/-, and the accused persons paid one bill and the other remained unpaid and subsequently accused persons paid Tk. 50,00,000/- against the unpaid bill for Tk. 1,18,00,000/-, and thereby balance outstanding amount stood at Tk.68,00,000/-,  payable by the accused persons to the complainant petitioner. Thereafter, the complainant further supplied 30 M. tons of aluminum iron worth Tk. 35,11,000/- and accordingly submitted the bill, against which part payment of Tk.30,00,000/- was made. Thus balance amount of Tk. 5,11,000/- remained unpaid against this bill. Thus, the total outstanding amount payable by the accused persons to the complainant petitioner stood at Tk.68 lacs plus Tk.5.11 lacs i.e. total Tk.73.11 lacs and that after much persuasion the accused No.2 by letter dated 28.02.2001 confirmed payment of outstanding bill amount within 6 (six) months from date, which the accused persons failed to comply with, but on 14.6.2001 the accused No.1 gave a postdated chaque dated 28.08.2001 in favour of the complainant petitioner towards payment of the outstanding amount of tk.68,00,000/- against the earlier bill assuring payment of the balance of Tk.5.11 lacs of the last bill later. Accordingly the complainant petitioner, as per assurance of payment given by the accused No.1, deposited the said cheque for Tk. 68,00,000/- dated 28.08.2001 in the Bank for encashment but the cheque was dishonoured and returned with the endorsement “not arranged for and refer to drawar” and thereafter the complainant petitioner through its letter dated 19.1.2001 informed the accused No.1 about non-payment and requested to confirm about encashment of the cheque but without any response. Then, on contact over telephone made by the complainant petitioner, the accused No.1 expressed sorry for such non-encashment of the cheque and requested the petitioner to deposit the cheque again in the month of October and accordingly on 23.10.2001 the cheque was again deposited for encashment through bank but again encashment was refused with the endorsement “not arranged for and refer to drawar” and faced with such situation the complainant petitioner requested the accused No.1 for payment against said cheque but without any response and thereafter on 12.01.2002 the said cheque was  again  deposited  in the  bank for  encashment  and the same was returned with  the  endorsement  Not  arranged  for  and refer   to drawer” .  In  such  circumstances  the  complainant Petitioner  caused issuance of legal  notice  under register post   demanding   payment   against the accused persons avoided  to receive the notice which returned undelivered and thereafter the cheque but the complaint petitioner filed the case. The accused persons as petitioners moved the Additional Sessions Judge, Dhaka, in Metro Criminal Revision No.443 of 2002 by filing an application  under section 439A of the Code Of Criminal Procedure praying for their discharge from the case submitting, amongst others, that earlier the petitioners filed an application under section 241A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for their discharge from the case i.e.  in C.R. Case No.359 of 2002, which after hearing was rejected by order dated 27.7.2002 passed by Metropolitan Magistrate ,Dhaka , and that the Metropolitan Additional  Sessions Judge ,2<sup>nd</sup> Court ,Dhaka heard and disposed of the Criminal Revision No.443 of 2002 by the judgment and order dated 20.01.2003 allowing the revision setting aside the judgment and  order dated 27.07.2002 passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate in C.R  Case No .359 of 2002 in respect of the case filed under section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881, holding that the complainant failed to file the case within the stipulated period and the learned Magistrate failed to appreciate the law of limitation and has illegally framed the charge against the accused persons and that the accused persons are entitled to be discharged from the case. Being aggrieved the complainant as petitioner moved the High Court Division in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 3203 of 2004, which was allowed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division, pursuant to which one of the petitioner of Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 7287 of 2005 was arrested and it is alleged that thus the other two accused persons came to know  about the decision of the High Court Division in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 3203 of 2004 and then  the accused petitioners Moved the High Court Division in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No .7287 of 2005 under  section 561A of the Code of Criminal  Procedure initiated as aforesaid. The High Court Division upon hearing discharged the Rule observing that:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“We do not find presence of any of such ground to eliminate a criminal proceeding without allowing to hold a fair trial. Rather we find existence of a prime–facie case of the opposite party No.2 complainant to proceed against the accused–petitioners under section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881, and there is hardly any reason to hold the view that continuation of such proceeding will be sheer abuse of the process of the court and that it has been brought for the purpose of harassment.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The High Court Division further observed that:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“the inherent power under section 561A of the Code of Criminal procedure for quashment of a proceeding, particularly when the stage of examining P.ws. appears to have been started, should sparingly to be exercised. It has already been settled by their lordships of the Appellate Division in the case of Ali Akkas Vs. Enayet Hossain and others, reported in 17 BLD (AD) 44 and also in some other reported cases that the scope of the quashment proceeding is very limited and some set points have been formulated for the purpose of consideration of an application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In discharging the Rule their lordship in the High Court Division also observed that the grounds taken for quashment under Section-561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure are hyper technical in nature, which cannot be considered as substantial ground for the purpose of interference under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Proceeding and that the alleged omission of impleading the Company in the proceeding is an  irregularity and the same is not fatal and that though the company is not made a party in the proceeding but the persons concerned representing the company, who are party in the issuance of the dishonored cheque in reference, having been made party in the proceeding, the proceeding cannot be said to be bad for defect of party inasmuch as the punishment, if any on proof, is to be inflicted upon the natural persons involved in the offence committed. The High Court Division appeared to have also discussed the issue of return of the legal notice, and answered the same as being “intentionally avoided” inasmuch as the legal notice sent under registered post were correctly addressed and the address being of the registered office of the company, refusal to accept legal notice addressed to the Directors of the Company in their personal names, are manifestly malafide and intentional and that the case has been filed within time from the date of cause of auction as per section 141(C) of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate for the petitioner before us submitted that the case is bad for non-compliance of the pre-condition for making demand for payment within 15 (fifteen) days from the date of dishonour of cheque as per proviso-B of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 and further there being no service of legal notice no question of effective demand in the eye of law is in existence and in the absence any valid demand, the C.R. Case is liable to be quashed, and that the cause of action as alleged in the complaint petition is exfacie beyond the period of limitation and as such there was absence of cause of action and therefore the continuation of the impugned proceeding is an abuse of process of Court and that the dispute as to non-payment is of civil nature.<br/> <br/>We have perused the application for leave to appeal and the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division as well as the judgment and order passed by the court below on the application filed under section 241A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. There is no denial as to the dishonouring of the cheque issued by the accused petitioner and the fact of issuance of legal notice after the last occasion of dishonoring the cheque by the bank concern with the endorsement “not arranged for and refer to the drawar”  and on the face of dishonour of the disputed  cheque  and non-response to the demand for payment against dishonoured cheque we find criminality as alleged and as the High Court Division has observed that the accused persons have been avoiding payment and that the legal notice was issued within time and the complaint case has also been initiated within time we do not find any illegality in the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division in discharging the Rule. The High Court Division on detailed discussions on the issues involved has arrived at its decision with cogent reasonings, which are in accordance with law and hence no interference is called for.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>Accordingly, the petition for leave to appeal is dismissed.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The Petitioners subsequently came to know that the said property was mortgaged by the Respondent Nos. 5 to 12 in favour of Bangladesh House Building Finance Corporation (“HBFC”), Sylhet, who had defaulted in paying the loan money. HBFC filed Artha Rin Suit being No. 51 of 1992 which was decreed in its favour. The said Decree-Holder HBFC for realization of its decretal amount filed Artha Jari Case No. 16 of 2005. Thereafter, the Petitioners after getting information about the aforesaid case sent a legal notice to the Respondent Nos. 5 to 12 for alleged suppression of fact and to take necessary steps for releasing the property from HBFC. Subsequently the Respondent Nos. 5 to 12 after receipt of the said notice, instead of taking any steps for releasing the property, filed Title Suit No. 185 of 2006 against the Petitioners in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Court of the Joint District Judge, Sylhet, for declaration that the <em>kabalas</em> registered in favour of the Petitioners in respect of the aforesaid property are forged and fraudulent and for recovery of khas possession of the said property.<br/> <br/>Thereafter, the Petitioners filed an application for addition of party as Judgment-Debtors in the Artha Jari Case with a prayer for accepting the decretal amount from the Petitioners. But the Respondent Nos. 5 to 12 filed an objection and the learned Judge, Artha Rin Adalat by its Order dated 14.11.2006 rejected the application of the Petitioners and published Tender Notice for auction sale of the property in the daily ‘Sabuj Sylhet’ on 04.03.200. Impugning the said Order and the Tender Notice the Petitioner No. 1 filed Writ Petition No. 2782 of 2007 in this Court in which a Rule Nisi was issued and Order was passed staying operation of the Impugned Notice for auction. However, by this Court’s Order dated 26.05.2010 the Rule was discharged for non-prosecution on the assurance of the Respondent No. 5, the Borrower-Judgment-Debtor, that she will repay the entire outstanding loan within a short period. Subsequently, the Respondent Nos. 5 to 12 did not act as per their assurance and deposit the decretal money. However, by Order dated 21.07.2011 passed by the Artha Rin Adalat the Petitioners were added as judgment-debtors Nos. 2 and 3 in the Artha Jari Case.<br/> <br/>That on an Order of the Artha Rin Adalat (“Adalat”) the Petitioners have deposited TK.20,44,000/00 (Twenty lac forty four thousand) in the account of the Respondent No. 4 HBFC towards adjustment of the outstanding loan owed by the Respondents Nos. 5 to 12 vide three deposit receipts, one dated 28.03.2007 and other two dated 20.07.2011.<br/> <br/>That on 12.01.2012 the Petitioners as the added judgment-debtors filed an application in the Adalat praying for a direction to the Decree-Holder HBFC for adjustment of the deposit made by the Petitioners in the loan account of the Borrower-Judgment-Debtors, the Respondent Nos. 5 to 12. By Order No. 54 dated 29.02.2012 the Adalat allowed the application of the Petitioners with the consent of the Respondent No.3 and Respondents Nos. 5 to 12, directing the HBFC to adjust the amount deposited by the Petitioners in the loan account of the Borrower-Judgment-Debtors.<br/> <br/>That on 09.07.2012 HBFC filed an application for reviewing the Order No. 54 dated 29.02.2012. The Adalat by Order No. 58 dated 29.07.2012 reversed its earlier Order and directed the HBFC to supply draft copy of auction sale by 13.08.2012 holding that the Borrower-Judgment-Debtors denied the claim of the Petitioners to have purchased the case land from them and that the higher authority within HBFC refused to adjust the deposit against the outstanding loan. At this juncture the Petitioners moved this Court by filing this Application under Article 102 of the Constitution challenging the propriety of the Impugned Order and obtained the present Rule and Order of Stay.<br/> <br/>By filing a Supplementary Affidavit the Petitioners further stated that Toslimunnessa, the Respondent No. 5 and her son Mohiuddin Ahmad, the Respondent No. 12, and daughter Yasmin Akhtar took loan from Uttara Bank, Ambarkhana Barnch, Sylhet by mortgaging .070 acre of land covered by S.A. Plot No. , corresponding to B.S. Plot No. 7108. Out of the said land Taslimunnessa sold .035 acre of land by a <em>kabala</em> dated 18.05.2005 to Md. Mostafa Ahmad (Azad), who in turn sold the same to the Petitioners by <em>kabala</em> No. 12503 dated 17.07.2005. Taslimunnessa and her sons and daughters, the Respondents Nos. 5-12 herein, sold .08 acre of land to the Petitioners by <em>kabala</em> No. 12504 dated 17.07.2005 suppressing the fact of earlier mortgage with the Uttara Bank. The Respondents Nos. 5-12 defaulted in payment of loan and the said Bank filed Artha Rin Suit No. 7 of 2008 in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Court of the Joint District Judge and Artha Rin Adalat, Sylhet. The Suit was decreed, and the decree-holder Bank filed Artha Rin Execution Case No. 28 of 2009 for realization of the decretal money through auction  sale of the mortgaged property under sections 33(1) and (4) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (“Act”). Since, there was no bid in response to sale proclamations and notices, on the application of the said Bank the Adalat issued and registered a certificate of title on 01.08.2012 in respect of the aforesaid .070 acre of land in favour of the Bank under Section 33(7) of the Act declaring the title of the said land vested in the decree-holder Bank. The present Petitioners made representations to Uttara Bank on 07.06.2012 and 27.02.2013 seeking release of .035 acre of land, which the Petitioners purchased from Md. Mostafa Ahmad Azad, a transferee from Taslimunnessa Jaigirdar on 17.07.2005, on receipt of the decretal amount from the Petitioners. But instead of responding to the Petitioners, Uttara Bank published auction notice on 28.4.2013 for sale of .07 acre of land. The present   Petitioners challenged the same by filing Writ Petition No. 4924 of 2013. By an Order dated 15.5.2013 this Court directed the said Bank to dispose of those representations of the Petitioners within a period of one month in accordance with law and further directed that till disposal of those representations the auction process initiated by the Bank be kept in abeyance.<br/> <br/>Uttara Bank, however, remaining in non-compliance  of that Order, the present Petitioners, consequentially filed Contempt  Petition No. 74 of 2014 wherein a Rule was  issued  on 15.5.2014 directing the Uttara Bank to show cause as to why a contempt proceeding  will not be  drawn against it. This led to a positive response from the Bank manifested in its recognition that the Petitioners should pay the whole of the decretal amount and take whole of the land. Ultimately, the Petitioners agreed to the Bank’s proposal to secure their property and the said Bank by a <em>kabala </em>executed and registered on 9.6.2014 sold the land in the case plot No.   to the Petitioners who thus acquired title in the said land.<br/> <br/>Evident also is the fact that, Taslimunnessa Jaigirdar took loan of Tk. 5,00,000/- from the Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd. Ambarkhana Branch by mortgaging the self same land by a deed of mortgage dated 21.7.2002 prior to the Petitioners’ acquisition of the said land from her. Thereafter, the Petitioners got the property released by paying the loan and then took the <em>Kabala</em> No. 12504 dated 17.7.2005 from Taslimunnessa Jairgirdar and her son and daughter. At the time of purchase, the vendors handed over certified copy of  their title deed to the Petitioners on the plea that the original had been lost. The Petitioners further asserted that, if the money paid by the Petitioners is adjusted in the account of the Judgment-Debtors, the Petitioners undertake that they would not demand from HBFC return of the original title deeds of the Borrower-Judgment-Debtors and will not claim any other right of subrogation.<br/> <br/>HBFC contested the Rule by filing an Affidavit-in-Opposition denying all the material allegations made in the application  contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that on an Order of the Adalat the Petitioners deposited the decretal money in their names and not in the names of the Borrower-Judgment-Debtor Respondent Nos. 5-12. Since the higher authority within HBFC refused to accept the said deposit in the names of the Petitioners, HBFC filed a petition in the Adalat on 9.7.2012 to review the Order No. 54 passed  by it on 29.2.2012 and the Adalat by Order No.58 dated 29.7.2012 reversed the earlier Order and directed  HBFC to supply  draft copy of auction sale by 13.8.2012. It is also contended that HBFC cannot accept the decretal amount from a third party other than Judgment-Debtors as there is no legal relationship between HBFC and the Petitioners. Rather there is a title dispute between the Judgment-debtors and the Petitioners relating to the mortgaged property. So, the Petitioners have no locus standi and as such the Writ Petition is not maintainable and the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/>Mr. Khair Ezaz Maswood, the learned Advocate appearing for the Petitioners submits that the Petitioners as purchasers with a view to save the property from auction filed an application in the Artha Jari Case praying for addition of party as Judgment-Debtors and accepting the decretal amount from the Petitioners. By Order dated 21.07.2011 the Adalat added the Petitioners as Judgment-Debtor Nos. 2 and 3 in the Artha Jari case. The Respondents did not challenge the said Order before the higher court and as such the Petitioners have assumed the status of Judgment-Debtors co-extensive with the Respondent Nos. 5 to 12. As Judgment-Debtors the Petitioners in pursuance of an Order of the Adalat dated 29.12.2012 have deposited entire decretal amount with interest totaling Tk. 20,44,000/- in the account of HBFC towards adjustment of the loan owed by the Respondent Nos. 5-12. The Adalat passed the said Order with the consent of HBFC and Respondent Nos.5-12 directing HBFC to adjust the amount in the loan account of the Respondent Nos. 5-12. On an application filed by HBFC the Adalat reversed the Order No. 54 dated 29.02.2012 and directed the Decree-Holder to supply draft copy of the auction notice by 13.08.2012 most illegally and arbitrarily. Mr. Maswood further submits that the Artha Rin Adalat cannot review its Order passed earlier which has already taken effect. It is also argued that any person whose interest is involved in the mortgaged property other than a Judgment-Debtor is similarly legally entitled to pay and satisfy the decree with a view to get the property released. Since, therefore, the Petitioners have assumed the role of Judgment-Debtors in the Artha Jari Case by way of addition, there is no legal impediment in they making the payment of the decretal amount towards adjustment of the loan of the Respondent Nos. 5 to 12. It is argued, therefore, that, the Adalat passed the Order on 29.2.2012 rightly allowing the Petitioners prayer to pay the amount and directing HBFC to adjust the same in the loan account of the loanee.<br/> <br/>The arguments above are predicated on the core submission of Mr. Maswood that persons other than the judgment–debtor can satisfy the decretal amount and seek recording of satisfaction of the decree as per provisions of Order XXI, Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (“Code”). Accordingly, the Petitioners having made payment of the decretal amount to the Decree-holder, the latter is legally bound to adjust the same in the account of the borrower Judgment-debtor. But the Decree-Holder HBFC instead of making adjustment of the amount in the account of the loanee with a mala fide intention , Mr. Maswood submits, sought review of the Order passed by the Adalat. It is also argued that the intention of the legislature  is to recover money  from the borrower Judgment-debtor and  not to sell the property of the mortgagor or their successor. But in the instant case HBFC is more interested to sell the property in auction  than to adjust  the amount  paid by the  Petitioners in the account of the Respondent Nos. 5-12 borrowers. Such attitude and action of the HBFC has got no legal sanction under the  Act or under any other laws and as such the Impugned Order passed by the Adalat  reversing its earlier Order  is palpably illegal  and without lawful authority. It is also submitted that the Petitioners shall not claim redemption of the mortgaged property in their favour or ensist on the handing over of the original property documents, if the adjustment of the money is made by HBFC in the loan account of the judgment-debtors. In support of his submissions he has referred to the case of <em>K.S. Hussain Peer-Vs.- Kadapala Venkata Ramana Reddy</em> reported in A.I.R. 1989 (AP) 62.<br/> <br/>Mr. Imam Hossain with Ms. Khorshid Jahan , the learned Advocates appearing for the  Respondent No.4 submit that the Petitioners are neither  mortgagors nor Judgment-debtors as such they are not entitled to make payment  of the decretal amount to HBFC which is not legally  obliged to accept the payment made by them and to release the mortgage property in favour of any person other than the mortgagors. Mr. Imam also submits that there is a dispute between the mortgagor-borrower and the Petitioners regarding validity of the sale deeds alleged to have been executed by the mortgagors. If the payment is received from the Petitioners and the property is released by HBFC, there is the risk of multiplicity of proceedings and anticipating such scenario HBFC refused to accept the payment and adjust the same in the account of the borrower and took step for auction sale as per Order of the Adalat. It is also argued that the Artha Rin Adalat can rectify its own order under Section 57 of the Act and there is no illegality in the Impugned Order. In support of his submissions he has referred to the case of <em> Md. Salim Hossain- Vs- Uttara Bank Ltd. reported</em> in 17 BLC (AD) 154, facts of the present case is different from the case referred to by the Respondent’s counsel.  <br/> <br/>Heard the learned Advocates for the parties, perused the Writ Petition, Supplementary Affidavit, Affidavit-in-Opposition alongwith the Annexures annexed thereto.<br/> <br/>In the present Case the Petitioners grievance stems from the Order No. 58 dated 29.7.2012 passed by the Artha Rin Adalat, Sylhet   reversing its order No. 54 dated 29.2.2012 by which the Court directed the Decree-Holder HBFC to adjust the amount  deposited by the Petitioners in the loan account of the borrower judgment-debtors. For proper appreciation, Order No.54 is reproduced below;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“</em><em>54z 29/2/12   AcÉ Aœ ®j¡LŸj¡ öe¡e£l SeÉ ¢ce d¡kÑÉ z ¢X¢œ²c¡l fr q¡¢Sl¡ ¢cu¡­Re z c¡¢uL fr q¡¢Sl¡ ¢cu¡­Re z e¢b öe¡e£l SeÉ mJu¡ qCm z</em><br/><em>Heard the petition filed by added judgment Debtors seeking for an order directing the decree holder bank to adjust the amount deposited by them in the loan account of the borrower judgment debtor. Ld. Lawyer for decree holder bank and also the Ld. Lawyer for the borrower judgment debtor did not oppose the prayer. Obviously, the Petitioners deposited the decretal amount in the concerned loan account of the borrower judgment-debtor unassumingly and they look forward to having their dispute settled in T.S. 185/06. On the other hand, borrower judgment debtors have resorted to delatory tactics turning down their commitment made before the Hon’ble High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 2782/07 and have filed petition seeking for adjournment again today. Considering every aspect, the prayer of the added judgment debtors be allowed and that of the borrower judgment debtors be rejected. Decree holder is directed to adjust the amount deposited by the added Judgment debtors according to the date of such deposit and submit report by 09.04.12 as to their satisfaction.”</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">From  a perusal of the above quoted Order of the Adalat, it is found that the direction given by the Adalat  to adjust the amount deposited by the Petitioners in the account of the Borrower-Judgment-Debtor without any objection from the Decree-holder as well as the judgment-debtors i.e. Respondent Nos. 5 to 12 . Thereafter, HBFC  by filing an application on 9.4.2012 prayed three months’ time to effect adjustment  of the amount and for an Order enabling HBFC not to hand over the original documents to the added judgment-debtor-petitioners. The Adalat allowed time as prayed for and fixed 9.7.2012 for further Order. On the date fixed the HBFC filed an application under Order 47, Rule 1 of the Code for review of the Order No. 54 dated 29.2.2012. The Court fixed 12.7.2012 and thereafter on 29.7.2012 for hearing the said application. The Adalat  heard the application filed by HBFC on 29.7.2012 and upon hearing the parties allowed the application and accordingly reversed its earlier Order dated 29.2.2012 in the terms which runs thus:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“58. 29.07.12 Today is fixed for hearing of both the Petitions filed by the contending parties and order. Both parties filed hazira. Heard the ld. Lawyers at length and perused the petition with inept attention alongwith the record as a whole. As per version of the petition propounded by the decree holder, higher authority of the decree holder declines to adjust the amount deposited by the added judgment debtors. Obviously, the added judgment debtors have deposited the entire dues of the impugned loan disclosing that they purchased the scheduled property in good faith from the borrower-judgment debtors by virtue of the kabalas dated 17.07.05 but the borrower judgment debtors headed by Taslimunnessa Jaigirdar denied such claim stating that the deeds are forged and were procured from her under threat. It is further asserted that she has already instituted T.S. 185/06 praying for cancellation of the kabalas. In such state of affair, higher authority of the decree holder logically refuses to adjust the amount deposited by the added judgment-debtors to avoid further complicacy.            </em><br/><em>Banking upon foregoing observations, I could not but accept the apprehension of the decree-holder and entertain his prayer. Hence the prayer is allowed. Ipso facto the prayer of the Added judgment debtor is rejected, especially when their review petition has been disposed of by the Head Office of the decree holder with negation. Hence, in view of order no. 40 Decree-holder is directed to supply draft copy of auction sale by 13.08.12.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Impugned Order above raises the core issue for this Court’s consideration thus:  Can a person other than the Judgment-debtor pay or satisfy the decretal amount in the account of the Judgment-debtor and whether the Adalat is empowered to review an earlier Order.?<br/> <br/>To answer the first part of the question raised, provisions of payment under decree provided under Order XXI, Rules 1 and 2 of the Code may be looked into. These run thus:-<br/>Order XXI  R.1. Modes of paying  money under decree .- (1) All money payable under a decree shall be paid as follows, namely:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>by deposit in or by postal money order sent to the Court whose duty it is to execute the decree, or </em><br/><em>out of Court to the decree-holder, or </em><br/><em>otherwise as the Court which made the decree directs.</em><br/><em>2(a) Where any payment is made under clause (a) of sub-rule (1), notice of such payment shall be given to the decree-holder or the person in whose favour the order is made.</em><br/><em>(b) The cost of giving such notice shall be borne by the person making payment who shall have the option of having the notice served either by a process-server of the Court or by registered post. No such notice shall issue until the said cost shall have been paid.</em><br/><em>Order XXI R.2. Payment out of Court to decree-holder. (1) where any money payable under a decree of any kind is paid out of Court, or the decree is otherwise adjusted in whole or in part to the satisfaction of the decree-holder, the decree holder shall certify such payment or adjustment to the Court whose duty it is to execute the decree, and the Court shall record the same accordingly.</em><br/><em>(2) The judgment-debtor also may inform the Court of such payment or adjustment, and apply to the Court to issue a notice to the decree-holder to show cause, on a day to be fixed by the Court, why such payment or adjustme-nt should not be recorded as certified; and if, after service of such notice, the decree-holder fails to show cause why the payment or adjustment should not be recorded as certified, the Court shall record the same accordingly.</em><br/><em>(3) A payment or adjustment, which has not been certified or recorded as aforesaid, shall not be recognized by any Court executing the decree.</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is to be noted that Order XXI, Rule I deals with diverse modes of payment of the decretal amount.  In that regard, payment can be made by deposit into the Court, out of the Court to the decree-holder or otherwise as the Court directs. The intention  of the legislature is to realize the decretal amount  by the decree-holder by putting the decree in execution. It is to be deduced, therefore, that the decree–holder is concerned with the payment of the decretal amount whatever be the source for such payment. In that regard, if any person comes forward to pay the decretal amount  on behalf of the judgment-debtor or such person is obliged  to pay the decretal amount due to various circumstances the decree-holder, in this Court’s view, instead of refusing such payment should come forward to accept the payment.<br/>In the present case the situation is that the Petitioners are constrained to pay the decretal amount in the account of the Judgment-debtor to protect their property from auction sale and they, for such reason, came forward to satisfy  the decree by making payment to the decree-holder  with a view to safeguard them from resultant loss  and further harassment  and hardship. Order XXI, Rule (2)(1)  of the Code obliges the decree-holder to certify such payment or adjustment of the decretal amount to the Court but the decree-holder HBFC in the present case refused  to accept and adjust the amount paid by the Petitioners in the account of judgment-debtors. Instead, HBFC got the earlier positive and favourable direction of the Adalat to adjust the amount paid by the Petitioners in the account of the judgment-debtor reviewed.<br/> <br/>A cumulative reading of the clauses (a)(b) and (c) of rule 1 coupled with rule 2 of Order XXI of the Code reveals that while judgment-debtors are legally bound to pay the deretal amount to the Decree Holder, there is little indication as <em>who</em> specifically may pay the amount in the manner formulated in clause (b) of Sub-rule 1. This, in this Court’s view, sufficiently envisage a scenario where a person who has purchased the property subject to the encumbrances may step into the shoes of the vendor and, though not being the borrower Judgment-Debtor strictly understood, by that reason is entitled to, and not precluded from, pay the decretal amount. Indeed, this can be  seen substantiated from another perspective, for example, under Section 55(5)(d) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 which runs thus:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><em>55.       Rights and liabilities of buyer and seller- </em></strong><em>In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the buyer and the seller of immovable property respectively are subject to the liabilities, and have the rights, mentioned in the rules next following, or such of them as are applicable to the property sold:</em><br/><strong><em>…</em></strong><br/><em>(5)  The buyer is bound-</em><br/><strong><em>…</em></strong><br/><em>‘(d).- Where the ownership of the property has passed to the buyer, as between himself and the seller, to pay all public charges and rent which may become payable in respect of the property, the principal moneys due on any encumbrances subject to which the property is sold, and the interest thereon afterwards accruing due’.       </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>This Court finds, therefore that given the above quoted provisions of law, a buyer shall be  bound to pay the moneys due on any encumbrances  subject to which the property is sold and the interest thereon afterwards accruing due. In the instant case the Petitioners contend to have purchased the case property with the encumbrances and as such they suffer from no legal impediment to pay the decretal amount as public charge to the decree-holder to satisfy the decree even given the fact that the fact of mortgage is not disclosed in the sale and notwithstanding the pending of Title Suit No. 185 of 2006. It is understood that the sale in question took place subject to encumbrances. For that reason also the Petitioners can pay and satisfy the decree as alleged purchaser of the property subject to a mortgage.<br/>Furthermore, Order XXI, Rule 2 of the Code also does not preclude or prohibit any person to apprise the Court regarding payment and record satisfaction of the decree. This Court, accordingly, finds no rationale or purpose behind the rigid interpretation of disabling the judgment-debtor or the Petitioners to set in motion the proceeding for recording satisfaction of the decree. Indeed, there is no prejudice to the Decree Holder if any person whatever may seek  satisfaction of the decree on proof  of payment  of the decretal amount in the account of the judgment-debtors as  provided under Order XXI, Rule 1. Given these facts and circumstances, it is this Court’s view that Order XXI, Rule 1 of the Code does  not indeed preclude person(s) other than Judgment-Debtor(s)  to pay the decretal amount in the name of the Judgment-Debtor(s) and seek a recording of such satisfaction of decree accordingly.<br/> <br/>To answer the second part of the question earlier raised, this Court, upon visiting the Act in its entirety has found nothing therein that attests to the fact of the Artha Rin Adalat being empowered to review its own Orders. By that reason, and given the observations herein above, this Court finds that the Impugned Order on the face of it is illegal and not sustainable in law. Therefore, this Court finds merit in the Rule and is inclined to make the Rule absolute. However, nothing of this judgment shall affect the merit of the Title Suit No. 185 of 2006 filed by the Respondent Nos. 5-12 against the Petitioners challenging the validity of the sale deeds in question.<br/> <br/>In the result the Rule is made absolute, however, without any order as to costs.<br/>Accordingly, the  Order No.58 dated 29.07.2012 as evidenced by Annexure-F passed by the Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Sylhet in Artha Jari Case No. 16 of 2005 refusing the Petitioners prayer for adjustment of their deposit against the outstanding  loan and directing the decree-holder Respondent No.4 to supply the draft copy of auction sale is declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect, and the Order No.54 dated 29.02.2012 as evidenced by Annexure-E, directing the Decree-Holder Respondent No.4 to adjust the deposit made by the Petitioners in the loan account of the borrower Judgment Debtors is, hereby, restored.<br/> <br/>The Respondent No.4   decree-holder HBFC is, hereby, directed to adjust the amount paid by the Petitioners in the account of the Borrower-Judgment-Debtors, i.e. Respondent Nos. 5 to 12 and to certify the payment and adjustment of the decretal amount in accordance with law and consequentially release the property in question by way of redemption to the mortgagors.<br/> <br/>Furthermore, the Artha Rin Adalat is directed to dispose of the case  recording satisfaction of the decree after confirming that the payment duly made by the Petitioners in the account of the borrower –judgment –debtor i.e., Respondent Nos. 5 to 12.<br/> <br/>The Order of stay granted earlier at the time of issuance of the Rule is, hereby, vacated.<br/> <br/>Communicate a copy of this Judgment at once to the Artha Rin Adalat concerned.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

He further submits that  in all the cases the petitioners including  those of Writ Petition Nos. 5055 of 2009 and 1660 of 2011 are working without having  any decision making power and as such  the nature  of their job clearly suggests that they are workers. In this respect he has drawn our attention to the Annexure A of the Writ Petition No.  1660 of 2011 where it has been stated that the petitioner “শ্রমিক হিসেবে বিবেচিত” i.e.  he is classified as a worker even though he is a Senior  Master Technician. The learned Advocate has also drawn our attention to the Public Corporations (Management Co-ordination) Ordinance, 1986 as amended and the schedule where the name of Bangladesh Steel and Engineering Corporation of which Atlas Bangladesh Limited and Bangladesh Blade Factory Limited are Enterprises. He therefore submits that the aforesaid Ordinance will be applicable in the instant case and the petitioners be allowed to work at the age of 60.<br/><br/>As against this, Mr. Mollah Kismat Habib, the learned Advocate for the Respondent No. 2  vehemently submits that the petitioners are working for Atlas Bangladesh Limited and  Bangladesh  Blade  Factory Limited, these two are limited companies  and a portion  of the shares are even owned by the workers  itself and as such the Writ Petitions  are not maintainable. He further submits that the petitioners are doing various supervisory work and they cannot be classified under the category of worker and from that point of view the Rules are not maintainable.<br/><br/>We have given our anxious consideration to the submissions of the learned Advocates.<br/><br/>It appears that in the meantime the petitioners have reached their age of superannuation i.e. 60 years during pendency of the Rule and gone into retirement and stopped working for the concerned Mills but have not yet been given their retirement benefits.<br/><br/>The only point for adjudication therefore is whether the petitioners are entitled to work upto the age of 60 years.<br/><br/>Under the Public Corporations (Management Co-ordination) Ordinance, 1986 as amended a worker has been defined as "any person, skilled or unskilled, who works for hire or rewards, but does not include a person who is employed in any managerial, administrative, supervisory or solely clerical capacity.”<br/><br/>In the instant case in Writ Petition Nos. 2969 of 2009 and 9396 of 2011 no Affidavit-in-Opposition has been filed and none appeared to contest the Rules. The petitioners in this case were serving as Master Technician and there is no allegation that they are not workers and as such the question of not being classified as worker in this case does not arise.<br/><br/>In the case of Writ Petition No. 1660 of 2011 although the petitioner was appointed  Foreman whose work includes certain supervisory works, Annexure  A, a letter from the Mills administration  clearly states that he was classified and considered a worker. We are  also not satisfied that as junior foreman  which was  the petitioner’s post he was doing  exclusively supervisory work though such supervision may have been part of his duty and as such  it cannot be said  categorically  that he is not a  worker  and as such  we feel that the benefit of doubt  should go  in favour of  him.<br/><br/>In Writ Petition No. 5055 of 2009 the petitioner was serving as Senior Dying Helper and as such no question of not being a worker arises. <br/><br/>Section 14A of the Public Corporations (Management Co-ordination)  Ordinance, 1986 as amended  states as follows :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“14A Retirement of a worker , etc. (1) A worker  of an enterprise  shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the terms and conditions of  his employment in any contract, rule, regulation, bye-law or other instrument, retire from employment on the completion of the sixtieth year of  his age:<br/>Provided that a worker who has completed the sixtieth year of his age on or before the date of commencement of the Public Corporations (Management Co-ordination) (Amendment) Act, 1994 shall cease to be in the employment of the enterprise on such commencement.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>On perusal of the aforesaid provisions of law it appears that the petitioner is entitled to continue in service till 60 years of age which indicates that he cannot be retired before that and the impugned order purporting to retire the petitioner on the age of 57 years is clearly inconsistent with the provisions of law.<br/><br/>As regards the submission of Mr. Mollah Kismat Habib, the learned Advocate for the Respondent that Atlas Bangladesh Limited  and Bangladesh  Blade Factory Limited  are limited companies  and these Writ Petitions are not maintainable is misconceived in view of  several decisions of this Court where it has been  decided that when the shares of limited companies  are owned by the Government  it becomes an instrument of the Government  to implement its policy and it may be considered  also as a local authority  and the Writ Petition is clearly maintainable.<br/><br/>It may be pertinent to point out that the Public Corporations (Management Co-ordination) Ordinance, 1986 only applies to enterprises of the Corporation but not the Corporation itself. Accordingly although the retirement age of a worker of enterprise under the Corporation would be 60 years, the other employees of the Corporation itself would be retired as per provisions of the Public Servants Retirement Act, 1974.<br/><br/>Since in all these cases the petitioners were in employment until they reached the age of 60 years they are entitled to their salaries and other retirement benefits until the age of superannuation i.e. 60 years, the respondents are directed to pay the same on completion of their 60 years age if they have not already been paid.<br/><br/>In the result, all the Rules are made absolute without any order as to costs.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong></span><br/><br/>By this appeal, the informant-appellant has challenged the legality and propriety of the order dated 23-06-1997 passed by the learned Judge of Senior Tribunal, Khulna (briefly as Judge) in Special Tribunal Case no. 107 of 1997 arising out of Dacope P.S. Case no.05 dated 23-07-1996 under sections 19A and (f) of the Arms Act discharging the accused-respondent without taking cognizance and not considering the narajee petition filed by the informant.<br/><br/>Facts in brief, are that on 23-07-1995 the appellant as informant lodged a first inform-ation report against the accused respondent alleging that on the night following on 22-07-1995 at 3:00 p.m. he was engaged in the fish shrimp of Md. Saiful Kabir as watcher at about 3:00 p.m. he found a man catching shrimp in the said gher and the informant went near him and focus torched light and he identified the accused as Abdus Sattar who raised Pipe gun for to hang fire. Thereafter the accused was caught red-handed with the help of the other locals. Then he handed over the accused with arms with the Dacope Police Station and lodged the instant case.<br/><br/>The Police after investigation submitted final report in favour of the accused. Against which the informant filed the narajee petition.<br/><br/>Eventually the case was taken up by the learned Judge of Tribunal for trial who by the impugned order dated 23-06-1997 accepted the Police report and discharged the accused by rejecting the narajee petition.<br/>Feeling aggrieved the informant preferred the instant appeal.<br/><br/>No one appears on behalf of the appellant to support the appeal. In view of the facts this is an old appeal of 1997 we are inclined to take it up for disposal on merit considering the materials on record.<br/><br/>No one appears on behalf of the accused-respondent no.1 to oppose the appeal.<br/><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State-respondent no.2 supports the appeal and submits that the learned Judge of the Tribunal without appreciating narajee petition and without passing any order to that effect accepted the Police report and discharged the accused which cannot be sustained in the eye of law.<br/><br/>In order to appreciate her submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to her submissions.<br/><br/>On going to the materials on record, it transpires that after investigation of the case, the Police submitted final report, the same was received by the learned Magistrate on 03-05-1997. On 20-05-1997 the informant filed Narajee petition against the said report. Afterwards the learned Magistrate referred the case record to the Tribunal wherein on 15-06-1997, the informant furnished the statements of five witnesses by swearing respective affidavits. It is a matter of great regret that the Tribunal did not at all take any notice regarding Narajee petition, which is not only non application of judicial mind but also a cause of injustice to the parties.<br/><br/>A three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court of India in Bhagwant Singh Vs. Commissioner of Police (1985)2 SCC 537=AIR 1985 SC 1285 opined that while dealing with a final report submitted by the Police stating that no offence appears to have been committed, the Magistrate can adopt one of the three courses, i.e. (1) he may accept the report and drop the proceedings or (2)  he may disagree with the report and taking the view that there is sufficient ground for proceedings further, take cognizance of the offence and issue Process or (3) he may direct for further investigation to be made by the Police under sub-section 3 of Section 156 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (briefly as Code). While adopting the first course (accepting the final report and dropping the proceedings), the informant must be given an opportunity of being heard so that he can make his submissions to persuade the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence and issue process. In its subsequent decision in Union Public Service Commission Vs. Papaiah (1997 Cr. L. J. 4636(SC), the Court, as per the law laid down in Bhagwant Singh’s case observed that the issuance of a notice by the Magistrate to the informant at the time of consideration of the final report is ″must ″.<br/><br/>It has been held in the case of Nurul Huq vs. Fazal Ahamed and 3 others reported in 48 DLR 327 that if an accused discharged from prosecution or on a final report that means that the accused has been discharged from custody not discharged from the case and subsequent prosecution of the accused is permissible. It was further held in the said case that Narajee petition is a fresh complaint and a Magistrate is competent to take cognizance on the basis of a Narajee petition by complying with the requirements of the law.<br/><br/>In the instant case the Tribunal did not take notice regarding narajee petition. It has been held in the case of Nur Mohammad Mandal vs. Abul Hossain and 3 others reported in 28 DLR 389 that the complainant is to be examined on oath under Section 200 of the Code. We also hold that without examining the complainant on oath, as required under section 200 of the Code, it cannot be determined as to whether there is a prima facie case against the accused-persons or not and without examining the complainant as required under section 200 of the Code the complaint petition cannot be thrown out in limine.<br/><br/>By the above principle we find that the Narajee is to be treated as fresh complaint, the Court can take cognizance of an offence if, in his opinion, there is sufficient ground for proceedings (27 Cal. 985 (DB), and discharge the accused where no sufficient ground exists.<br/><br/>There can be said to be no sufficient grounds in the following cases for issue of process.</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>where the complaint is made on information and not an personal knowledge. In such cases the Court should satisfy itself on inquiry that there is a case for the issue of process (4 Crl.

But the informant in his narajee petition categorically stated that the Police without visiting the place of occurrence without examining the eye witnesses most illegally submitted a perfunctory final report. We have meticulously examined the FIR, narajee petition, impugned order, Police report along with other materials on record and we find that there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against the accused in the instant case. Moreso it appears that the learned Judge of the Tribunal without appreciating the narajee petition and without any speaking order accepted the Police report. So in our view the same cannot be sustained. Therefore, we hold that the appeal having merit succeeds.<br/><br/>In view of foregoing narrative the appeal is allowed. The learned Judge of the Tribunal is directed to dispose of the narajee petition filed by the informant in accordance with law and in the light of observations made above.<br/><br/>The Office is directed to send down the record at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div><div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"> </div></div></div></div>

Abu Zafor Siddique, J:</u></em></strong><br/> <br/>This Jail Appeal is directed against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 27.11.2006 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Nowgoan in Session Case No.115 of 2006 arising out of Niamotpur Police Station Case No.4 dated 10/04/2006 corresponding to G.R. No.36 of 2006 under section 302 of the Penal Code and sentencing the appellant to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Tk.5,000/= in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 1 year more.<br/> <br/>The prosecution case, in short, is that on 10.04.2006 one Zamal, son of deceased Kabari, as informant, lodged an ejahar with Niamathpur Police Station, Nowgong alleging inter alia, that on 18.06.2003 at about 7.00 hours, he came to know that his mother Kabari @ Zahirun died at her 2<sup>nd</sup> husband’s (Rafiqul Islam Mondal) house at Bahadurpur. Thereafter, he rushed to the place of occurrence along with his maternal uncle and other relatives and they saw the dead body. He heard from the local people that accused Md. Rafiqul Islam (husband of the deceased) had killed his mother and was trying to quickly dispose of the dead body, but he opposed. Thereafter, the elder brother of the accused started a U.D. Case with Niamatpur Police Station. The police prepared the inquest report and sent the dead body to the Sadar Hospital, Nowgong for Post Mortem. <br/> <br/>The case was investigated by the police. After investigation, the investigating officer found prima-facie case against the accused-appellant and he submitted charge-sheet against him under section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>After investigation, the case record was transmitted to the learned Sessions Judge Nowgoan for trial and it was registered as Session Case No.115 of 2006. Charge was framed against the convict appellant under section 302 of the Penal Code and the same was read over and explained to him to which he pleaded not guilty and prayed to be tried in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>During trial, the prosecution examined as many as 12 witnesses out of 24 cited witnesses in the charge-sheet, but the defence examined none.<br/> <br/>The defence case, as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, is that the appellant is completely innocent and he has been falsely implicated in the case.<br/> <br/>Considering the facts and circumstances and deposition of the prosecution witnesses and hearing the parties, the trial Court convicted and sentenced the appellant in the manner as already stated above.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentenced, the convict appellant preferred the instant Jail Appeal.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khabir Uddin Bhuiyan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that the learned Session Judge, Nowgoan has misread the evidence on record and misinterpreted the law in passing the judgment and order of conviction which is not tenable in the eye of law. He further submits that the convict appellant is innocent and he has been falsely implicated with the case out of enmity. He next submits that not a single independent witness has supported the prosecution case. Thus, the prosecution has failed to proved the allegations against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. He therefore, prayed that the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence be set-aside.<br/> <br/>Mr. Kazi Ebadat Hossain, the learned Assistant Attorney General appearing on behalf of the state, has supported the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 27.11.2006. He submits that the alleged offence has been proved by the witnesses by adducing corroborative evidence.<br/> <br/>Moreover, in the opinion of doctor “the cause of death of the deceased was due to asphyxia as a result of strangulation which is anti-mortem and homicidal in nature.” He next submits that the prosecution has been able to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubt, and as such, the appeal is liable to dismissed.<br/> <br/>We have considered the argument advanced by the learned Advocates of the both sides and perused the memorandum of Jail Appeal, impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence of the trial court, evidence on record and the relevant papers in the L.C.R.<br/> <br/>Let us now discuss the relevant evidence and others material on record.<br/> <br/>P.W.-1 Md.

Abdul Based, Inspector and Officer-in-charge of the Niamotpur Police Station and Investigating Officer of this case. He deposed that- “তদমতকালে যথাসময়ে ঘটনাসহল পরিদর্শন করি, খসড়া মানচিত্র, সূচি সহ আলাদা কাগজে লিপিবদ্ধ করি, সাক্ষীদের জবানবন্দি ফৌজদারী কার্য বিধির ১৬১ ধারা মতে লিপিবদ্ধ করি। আসামীকে গ্রেপ্তার করি। U.D. মামলার আলামত হিসেবে গ্রহণ করি। তদমতঅমেত আসামীর বিরতদ্ধে সংশ্লিষ্ট অভিযোগপত্র দাখিল করি।” He Exhibited sketch map, index and his signature as exhibits 5, 6, 5/1 and 6/1 respectively.<br/><br/>These are all evidence adduced by the prosecution.<br/>After conclusion of recording of deposition of the prosecution witnesses, the Trial Court examined the accused-appellant under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It appears that while examining the appellant under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the Court properly disclosed the available evidence against the appellant who were present in the dock. In reply, the accused persons claimed to be not guilty of the offence and demanded to be tried in accordance with law.<br/><br/>Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is based on the principle “<em><u>audi alteram partem” that is no one should be condemned unheard</u>.</em> It is the utmost duty of the Court of law to give an opportunity to an accused to defend himself. The real object of section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is inviting the attention of the accused-person to the points raised in the evidence which are against him for which he may be convicted. So, it is clear from the record that the accused-person have been given a good chance to offer their explanation as to those.<br/><br/>We have scrutinized the depositions of the prosecution witnesses along with the materials on record with attending facts and circumstances of this case in our own way to ascertain whether the trial court committed any illegality in passing of the impugned judgment.<br/><br/>It appears that- P.W.-1, stated ঘটনাসহলে গিয়ে তার মায়ের শরীরের যখমের চিহু দেখে ও মায়ের কান দিয়ে রত্তু বের হতে দেখিয়াছে। আসামী রফিকুল কবর খুঁড়ে তড়িঘরি করিয়া তাহার মায়ের মরদেহ কবরসহ করিতে যাচ্ছিল। সে বাঁধা দেয় এবং থানায় খবর দেয়। P.W.-2 stated that- মৃত. কবরীর মাথা দিয়ে রত্তু বের হচ্ছে। P.W.-9 deposed that- “মৃতার কান দিয়ে রত্তু বের হয়েছে ও তাকে মেরে ফেলা হয়েছে শুনি। P.W.-11 is the medical officer of the concern medical board and he has proved the postmortem report given by them and he has also proved their opinion. “The cause of death of the deceased was due to asphyxia as a result of strangulation which is ante-mortem and homicidal in nature.” P.W.-12, investigating officer of this case. After his investigation having found a prima-facie case he submitted charge-sheet against the appellant under section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the appellant has tried to raise a question that since the witnesses are the close relatives and neighbours of the deceased, they are the interested witness of this case.<br/> <br/>On the question of interested witnesses, we have considered the case of Yogeshwar Gope -Vs.- State, reported in 58 DLR (AD) 73, wherein the Apex Court held that;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>''Only because of relationship of witnesses evidence connot be thrown away unless the evidence is found to be untrue or tainted by motive.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>We have also taken notice of the views expressed in the case of Tungo Veskata Krishnaiah –Vs.- State of Andra Prodesh (1985)29 ML.Jr(Cr) 130, at page 140-141(AP) which run as follow:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Where a witness is a natural witness to the occurrence and her evidence is consistent and it inspires confidence to accept her evidence to be truthful, her evidence alone is sufficient to base conviction.”</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">We are respectfully relying upon the views noted above. We have not found, upon scrutiny of the evidence and the materials on record, anything to show any motive or intention on the part of the prosecution witnesses to falsely implicate the appellant in this case, rather, we find strong circumstantial evidence. All the P.Ws. are natural witnesses and their evidences are consistent and inspires confidence in our mind to be accepted as truthful. Their evidence had also been corroborated by the informant. As such, we do not find any substance in the submission of the learned Advocate for the appellant. On the other hand, we find that the prosecution witnesses have been able to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The medical report also has supported the prosecution story.<br/><br/>We have also taken notice of the views expressed in the case of Sheik Muksed Ali -Vs.- The State reported in 10 M.L.R. (AD) 27, which run as follow:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“When it is established that the husband and his deceased wife were residing in the same house at the time of the occurrence the husband owes an </em><em>obligation to explain the circumstance under which his wife died. When the explanation so offered is proved false and the victim is found to have died due to injuries which were ante mortem and homicidal in nature, the conviction and sentence of the convict husband is held by the apex court to be perfectly justified.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Considering the fact and circumstances of the case, we are of the  view that the trial Court has rightly found the accused-appellant guilty of murder as charged as per section 302 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to imprisonment for life and a fine of Tk.5,000/-.<br/><br/>Therefore, we do not find any illegality in the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 27.11.2006 and consequently, it does not call for any interference by this Court.<br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is dismissed.<br/><br/>The order of conviction and sentence dated 27.11.2006 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Nowgaon in Session Case No.115 of 2006, arising out of Niamotpur P.S. Case No.4 dated 10.4.2006, corresponding to G.R. No.36 of 2006 is hereby affirmed.<br/><br/>Send down the lower Court records to the concerned Court along with a copy of the judgment at-once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

But by no consideration government can be allowed to use corporate façade as a device to impair, emasculate or frustrate fundamental rights of citizens guaranteed by the Constitution. If the control of the Government in the affairs of the company is so deep and pervasive as to destroy the corporate character of the company and the   capability of the company of being run by its Memorandum and Articles of Association proves an impossibility, the company is a sham or façade no more than an instrumentality of the Government. It must suffer the same constitutional and public law limitations as the government does. . . . (48)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>Here in this case it is difficult to identify TBL</strong><strong> as an identity distinct from the Government. The huge venture is still entirely dependent on the public exchequer for its finance.  Its Board is predominantly manned by the public functionaries who hold the position <em>ex officio</em> as servants of the Republic. All the Directors are nominated by the Government. The Board is substantially dependent on the Government for every major policy decision of the company. Exactly as is done by a government department, TBL acts under direction and supervision of the Ministry and keep the Ministry informed at least about important official transactions.  Government control on TBL management and policy is as unusually deep and pervasive as to admit of no separate corporate autonomy or character of its own.  It has no independent will distinct from the Government. All the indicators available on records lead to the irresistible conclusion that TBL as a company is nothing but a sham or façade. It is only identifiable as an instrumentality or agency of the Government. It follows that TBL must be subjected to same constitutional and public law limitation as the Government is. . . .(49)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>Principle of Natural Justice—If not followed</strong><strong>-Consequence thereof.</strong><br/><strong>Charge of misconduct itself implies stigma on the service career which is followed by punishment, if proved. No employee, therefore, can be punished for misconduct without a proceedings initiated and prior notice given allowing him reasonable opportunity to explain his position.</strong><br/><strong>In the instant case the allegation consists in ‘providing false information about the petitioner’s permanent address which, if true, is a kind of ‘misconduct’ as contemplated under law.  And the petitioner was removed straightaway on the charge by resort to  the  ‘No-show cause clause’  without initiating any proceedings or giving him an opportunity to explain his position which is not only illegal and a fraud on the law but also unjust, arbitrary and oppressive. This apart, the termination order issued forthwith merely on a verification report, that too, on a trifling subject like inconsistency in home address (later found correct) besides being <em>mala fide</em> is utterly disproportionate and not acceptable in the eye of  law.</strong><strong>...(55 and 56)</strong><br/><br/><strong><em>MH Chowdhury Vs.

Moazzam Husain, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>This rule <em>nisi</em> was issued calling in question an office order bearing Memo No. TBL/ HR/ Security/2007-2008/135 dated 15.04.2013 issued by Respondent No.4 (M.D., Teletalk Bangladesh Limited) terminating service of the petitioner.<br/><br/>Facts relevant for disposal of this rule are that the petitioner is a highly educated young man. He joined the Teletalk Bangladesh Ltd. (shortly, “the TBL”) on 29.12.2009 as Deputy General Manager (Audit). Since joining the petitioner had been serving the Company with satisfaction of all concerned. All on a sudden the Respondent No.4 issued the impugned Memo dated 15.4.2013 terminating his service on the allegation that he supplied false information about his permanent residence while taking the job.<br/><br/>Having received the termination letter the petitioner came to know that the local SB office was requested to make verification about the permanent address of the petitioner. Pursuant to the request police made an inquiry and submitted report showing some discrepancies in the information. The petitioner addressed a letter the next day to the M.D., TBL, re-reaffirming the truth of the information given by him and requesting him to make a further inquiry into the matter.  He addressed another letter on the same day addressing the M.D. requesting him not to give effect to the termination letter till submission of the proposed second verification report.  On 16.4.2013 all the directly recruited Managers and Deputy General Managers of TBL made a joint representation to the M.D., TBL, asking, amongst others, to withdraw the termination letter served upon this petitioner. The petitioner on his own filed an application to the Superintendent of Police, Narshingdi, requesting him to make further police verification into the truth of information about his permanent residence.<br/><br/>The Superintendent of Police, District Special Branch  made an inquiry and submitted his report dated 23.4.2013 to the Special Police Super (VR), Dhaka showing, <em>inter alia</em>, that the permanent address of the petitioner was correct but he did not reside there.  The Additional Inspector General of Police, Special Branch, Dhaka, forwarded the inquiry report to the M.D., TBL.<br/><br/>The petitioner thereafter on 25.4.2013 addressed a letter to the M.D., TBL requesting him to withdraw the termination letter in view of the report subsequently submitted by police on second verification. In view of the silence on the part of the authority the petitioner sent another letter on 13.6.2013 to the M.D. making a similar prayer. None of the moves was of any avail.<br/><br/>With the backdrop of facts the petitioner came up essentially with four contentions. First, the order was issued in violation of Rule 6 of the Discipline and Appeal Regulations of Teletalk Bangladesh Ltd.  Second, the order is tainted with <em>mala fide </em>in that it was passed upon a secret verification made by police. Third, the petitioner did never furnish any false information about him far less his permanent address and the order was passed on a wrong report given by police.  And finally, the order was passed in violation of natural justice in that no opportunity was given to the petitioner to explain his position nor was he given a copy of the police report.  As for maintainability, the petitioner’s case is that Teletalk Bangladesh Ltd is an instrumentality of the Government and the company is wholly dependent on the financial assistance of the Government. The corporate character of TBL is a sham and in fact the Government is operating behind the corporate veil.<br/><br/>The TBL as Respondent No.2 contested the Rule by filing affidavit and supplementary affidavits-in-opposition.  The main attack of TBL seems to be on maintainability of the writ petition. The specific case of TBL is that the writ petition is not maintainable inasmuch as Teletalk is an ordinary public company as good as other private sector companies carrying on business as a mobile phone operator. Shares of TBL are held by certain individuals not by the Government. Nor is it dependent on the financial assistance of the Government. Government does have no control in the affairs of the company. The company is completely run by its Memorandum and Articles of Association. TBL is not an instrumentality or agency of the Government so as to be amenable to writ jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Subject as above,   the other contentions, worth consideration,  raised by TBL,   are that the petitioner had an alternative and equally efficacious remedy in the service regulations of the company as the law gives the petitioner scope for filing review before the Board of Directors against any order of the Managing Director and that , even on merit writ does not lie in that there are two contradictory police reports on the same subject which cannot be resolved on affidavits.<br/><br/>As the question of maintainability is of overriding importance we chose to hear the Advocate for the contesting respondent ie, the TBL first. Mr. Raisuddin Ahmed learned Advocate, appearing for TBL was at great pains to assail maintainability of the writ petition and strenuously argued that the writ petition is totally misconceived and not maintainable in that TBL is a limited liability company as good as other companies operating in the telecommunication sector. Government has nothing to do with the company nor is the company dependent on financial assistance of the Government as claimed. He sought to substantiate his point saying that- if government has to hold any share it must be issued in the name of the President of the Republic or the Government not in the names of individuals. He referred to us the instance of the Telephone Industries Corporation Ltd, latterly, Telephone Shilpa Sangstha (TSS) wherein majority shares of the enterprise were issued in the name of the President of the then Pakistan.  Here in this case, he emphasized, the shares are held by some individuals, neither by the President nor by the Government. By reference to <em>MH Chowdhury v Tias Gas Transmission &amp; Distribution Ltd</em> reported in 33 DLR (AD) 186:1981 BLD (AD) 61 and the Full Bench case, <em>Arif Sultam v DESA, </em>reported in 60 DLR 431 Mr. Ahmed submits that those cases are not applicable in view of the fact that corporate character of TBL is thoroughly maintained.<br/><br/>Mr. Mahbub Shafiq, learned Advocate, appearing for the petitioner submits by reference to different annexures that Teletalk is a company limited by shares 100% of which is held by the Government. And the company is wholly dependent on the financial assistance of the Government. He also traced the genesis of the company and stressed that the records relating to its birth and development will <em>ipso facto</em> suggest that Teletalk Bangladesh Ltd was born in the womb of the Government and is run and managed by the Government through its officials. It was never allowed to run by its Memorandum and Article of Association so as to be called an entity distinct from the Government.  He sought to rely upon the Special Bench case ie,   <em>Arif Sultan v DESA</em> (<em>supra</em>) and insisted that   <em>Arif</em> <em>Sultan</em> is a major breakthrough in this area which has effectively settled the controversy leaving hardly or no scope  to raise the question of  maintainability of writ petition against government-owned companies of the kind.  Mr. Mahbub sought to repel the question of alternative remedy saying that the petitioner has been terminated pursuant to a decision of the Board of Detectors. The appeal lay before the Board. That being so a move for appeal to be filed before the Board would mean nothing but a futile move from Caesar to Caesar.<br/><br/>As is apparently unsuited to the constitu-tional requirements writ petition against a company, in its ordinary parlance, is nearly impossible. But companies are often subjected to constitutional limitations in certain circum-stances. This being an emerging jurisprudence can hardly be addressed without an overview of the concept of welfare state that furnished the background of the issue as well as some of the leading cases decided on point.<br/><br/>New dimensions in the state-activity beyond its traditional role essentially confined to law and order, security and defense, encompassing wider sphere of well-being of the citizens began to be visible in early twentieth century. The conception of government itself gradually changed. The administrative state of the modern times was taking shape with the growing feeling that it was the duty of the state to look after its citizens in their many different needs in day-to-day lives and provide remedies in basic socio-economic problems they are beset with. As the state diversified its role the concept of welfare state began to take root to continue into the twenty-first century. Now the engagements of a welfare state have extended as much as to cover the activity directed to providing food, shelter,  employments, medical services, pension, transport, travel,  leisure  and so on. With the progress of science and techn-ology the ever-expanding area of state activity are gradually extending to  encompass newer and more technical and specialized fields often demanding expertise, special skill and profes-sionalism and more suitable service conditions incidentally not compatible to bureaucratic grooming and traditions.<br/><br/>In order to meet the exigency govern-ments were seen to be engaged in commercial activity through corporatization, a process, in which government agencies and departments are often re-organized as autonomous or semi-autonomous corporate entities created by or under law sometimes with shares listed on the stock exchange which gave rise to the concept of government- owned companies, state-run corporations and the like.  The basic charact-eristics of government owned corporations/ companies are that they may be separate and autonomous from the government and tend to steer away from constitutional and public law limitations. This extended role of the governments being commensurate with the changing need of time is also constitutionally recognized in many countries including our own.<br/><br/>With the brief glance on historical background of the issue, let us now turn to some of the leading cases how the issue of maintainability of writ petition has been approached in Indian Jurisdiction:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>In <em>RD Shetty v International Airport Authority</em> <em>of India, </em>(1979)3 SCC 489,   the Supreme Court, while answering a question of the kind pointed out:<br/><br/><em>“The corporation acting as instrument-ality or agency of the Government would obviously be subject to the same limitation in the field of constitutional and administrative law as the Government itself, though in the eye of law, they would be distinct and independent legal entities. If Government acting through its officers is subject to certain constitutional and public law limitations, it must follow, a fortiori, that Government acting through the instrumentality or agency of corporation should equally be subject to the same limitations.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The court then proceeded to indicate certain tests to identify the character of the corporation:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“It may, therefore, be possible to say that where the financial assistance</em> <em>of the State is so much as to meet almost entire expenditure of the corporation, it would afford some indication of the corporation being impregnated with governmental character… a finding of State financial support plus an unusual degree of control over the management and policies might lead one to characterize an operation as State action.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In <em>Mysore Paper Mills Ltd v Mysore Paper Mills Officers’</em> <em>Association</em>, (2002) 2 SCC 167: AIR 2002 SC 609, Supreme Court was called upon to decide the question of maintainability of writ petition against a company registered  under the Companies Act.  It was held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“ The concept of instrumentality or agency of the Government is not to be confined to entities created under or which owes its origin to any particular statute or order but would really depend upon a combination of one or more of  relevant factors depending upon the essentiality  and overwhelming nature of such factors in identifying the real source of governing force, if need be, piercing the corporate veil of the entity concerned.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In <em>Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. v Brojo  Nath Ganguly</em><strong><em>, </em></strong>(1986) 3 SCC 156: AIR 1986 SC 1571,  Supreme Court was called upon to decide whether Central Inland Water Transport Corpn, a company incorpo-rated under the Companies  Act can be said to be “State” within the meaning of Article 12. In giving the answer in the positive Supreme Court took into considerations the following factors: (i) the Corporation was wholly owned and entirely financed by three Governments (ii) It was completely under control of the Central Government and was managed by the Chairman and Board of directors appointed by the Central Government and recoverable by it (iii)the activity carries on by the Corporation were of great importance to public interest, concern and welfare and found that it was the Central Government operating behind the corporate veil.<br/><br/>In <em>MC Mehta v Union of India, </em>(1987) 1 SCC 395<strong><em>,</em></strong>  in response to a similar question Supreme Court took into consideration several factors ie, industrial policy of the government, public interest importance of the activities carried by the private corporation, extensive financial control by the government and said: “ The question is whether these factors are cumulatively sufficient to bring Shriram within the ambit of Article 12. Prima facie it is arguable that when the State’s power as economic agent, economic entrepreneur and allocator of economic benefits is subject to limitations of fundamental rights, why should a private corporation under the functional control of the State engaged in an activity which is hazardous to the health and safety of the community and is imbued with public interest … run under the State’s industrial policy should not be subject to same limitation.”<br/><br/>The case of  <em>Som Prakash Rekhi v Union of India</em>, [1981] 1 SCC 449, arose out of a claim of provident fund etc payable to the petitioner by the Bharat petroleum Corporation. The petition was resisted on the ground that the undertaking was vested in a company registered under Companies Act and question of writ against a private company could not arise.  Ayre, J brushed aside the contention and held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“Any person’s employment, entertain-ment, travel, rest, and leisure, hospital facility and funeral services may be controlled by the State. And if all these enterprises are executed through Government companies, bureaus, societies, councils, institutes and homes, the citizen may forfeit his fundamental freedoms vis-à-vis these strange beings which are Government in fact but corporate in form. If only fundam-ental rights are forbidden access to corporation, companied bureaus, institutes, councils and kindred bodies which act as agencies of the administration, there may be break down in the rule of law and Constitutional order in a large sector of Governmental activity carried on under the guise of ‘jural persons’. It may pave the way for new tyranny by arbitrary administration operated from behind by the Government…” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In <em>Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib</em><em>, </em>(1981) 1 SCC 722:  AIR 1981 SC 487, Bhagwati, J (as his Lordship then was) took a similar view and held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“ Where constitutional fundamentals vital to the maintenance of human rights are at stake, functional realism and not facial cosmetics must be the diagnostic tool, for constructional law must seek the substance not the form… Today with increasing assumption  by the Government of commercial ventures and economic projects, the corporation has become an effective legal contrivance in the hands of the government for carrying out its activities for it is found that this legal facility of corporate instrument provides considerable flexibility and elasticity and facilitates proper and efficient manage-ment with professional skills and on business principles and it is blissfully free from departmental rigidity, slow-motion procedure and hierarchy of officers… In such cases the true owner is the state, the real operator is the  State, and the effective controller is the State and accountability of its action to the community and  to the Parliament is of the State” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><em>Speaking for the Court his Lordship further observed: </em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“ Now it is obvious that if a corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the Government, it must be subject to same limitations in the field of constitutional law as the Government itself, though in the eye of law it would be distinct and independent legal entity. If the Government acting through its officers is subject to certain constitutional limitations, it must follow a fortiorari that the Government acting through the instrumentality or agency of a corporation should equally be subject to the same limitation… It must be remembered that  the Fundamental rights  are constitutional guarantees given to the people of India and are not merely paper hopes or fleeting promises and so long as they find a place in the Constitution, they should not be allowed to be emasculated in their application by narrow and constricted judicial interpretations.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the said judgment it was recognized that mantle of corporation may be adopted in order to free the government from the inevitable constraints of redtapism and slow-motion but at the same time it is emphasized that the government must not be allowed to take recourse to corporatization as a device to frustrate the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution. The court, however, formulated six criteria upon which government-linked corporations or companies may be tested in order to discern the truth behind the corporate veil.  The criteria are:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">If the entire share capital of the corporation is held by the Government, it would go a long way towards indicating that the corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the Government.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Where the financial assistance of the State is as much as to meet almost entire expenditure of the corporation, it would afford some indication of the corporation being impregnated with governmental character.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the corporation enjoys monopoly status which is State enforced or State protected.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Existence of deep and pervasive State control may afford an indication that the corporation is a State agency or instrumentality.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">If the functions of the corporation are of public importance and closely related to governmental functions, it would be relevant factor in classifying the corporation as an instrumentality or agency of the Government.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">If a department of the Government is transferred to a corporation, it would be strong factor supporting the inference that the corporation is an instrumentality or agency of Government.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In a more recent case, <em>Zee Telefilms Ltd v Union of India</em> reported in (2005) 4 SCC 649 &amp; AIR 2005 SC 2677, the Constitution Bench by a majority of 3:2 took  comparatively a  restrictive  view and said that the State is today distancing itself from  commercial activities and concentrating on governance rather than on business. There is no need to expand the scope of Article 12 of the Constitution as the situation prevailing in 1975 does no more exist.  On the contrary, the minority maintained the ongoing pro-active trend and spoke in the following language:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“With the opening up of economy and globalization, more and more Governmental functions are being performed and allowed to be performed by private bodies. When the functions of a body are identifiable with the State functions, they would be State actors only in relation thereto.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In our jurisdiction successively two important cases arose at the juncture of 70’s, and 80’s namely, New<em> Dhaka Industries Ltd v Qumrul Huda</em>, (1979) 31 DLR (AD) 234 and <em>MH Chowdhury v Tias Gas Transmission &amp; Distribution Ltd</em> reported in 33 DLR (AD) 186  originally out of writ petitions filed against dismissal/termination of service from private limited companies nationalized under PO 27 of 1972. In <em>New Dhaka Industries</em> question was raised as to whether an employee dismissed from his service in a private company can challenge the order of dismissal in writ jurisdiction. Before the High Court Division the maintainability point raised by the company failed to gain ground. Appellate Division having examined the impact of nationalization upon the company found that nationalization, although conferred some controlling power on the Jute Mills Corporation, did not destroy the corporate character of the company and, therefore, the appellant being an employee of the company his service was governed by the ordinary law of master and servant. In coming to its decision Appellate Division observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>[T]he effect of nationalization on corporate character of the company is not uniform, and it depends on the nature of the legislation for which it was designed. In some nationalization scheme, enterprises may operate through the existing companies keeping their types in existence... and though the nationalized companies may have their particular structural differences, they assume basically the same form of being a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal and power to hold property..  It, therefore, seems clear that the general law of the corporation will govern them except in so far as this is expressly or impliedly modified and much, therefore, depends on the language and the purpose of the legislation under which the enterprises are nationalized</em>.”  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In <em>MH</em><em> Chowdhury</em> (the oft-quoted case), the question arose whether a company 100% or bulk of whose shares are held by the Government placed in a statutory corporation by operation of law retained the corporate character of a limited company so as to be called an autonomous body. <br/><br/>Fact was that, in October, 1968 the appellant   was employed as Internal Auditor in Titas Gas Transmission &amp; Distribution Company Ltd. The company terminated his service by a notice issued on June 22, 1971.  After emergence of Bangladesh he was appointed as Administrative Manager in the company which was placed under Bangladesh Minerals, Oil &amp; Gas Corporation under nationalization measures taken pursuant to PO 27 of 1972.  Respondent No.1 (GM, Titas Gas Company) by his order dated May 24, 1979 terminated his service as per terms of contract/letter of appointment. High Court Division discharged the rule holding, <em>inter alia</em>, that no privilege of natural justice was available to him as his service was terminated as per terms of contract of service which he entered in 1968. And his appointment in 1972 as Administrative Manager of the company was not fresh appointment but continuation of the earlier appointment testified by the fact that he accepted the seniority from 1966.<br/><br/>The appellant challenged the order of termination on the ground of lack of authority of Respondent No.1 to terminate his service; he was no longer an employee of the company but an employee of the corporation. He denied that there was any contract with Respondent No.1 under which his service might be terminated; the order of termination was <em>mala fide</em> as passed in violation of natural justice. The appellant contended that the company became a public enterprise within the meaning of the terms as provided in Comptroller and Auditor General (Auditorial Functions) Amendment Act, 1975. As a public enterprise its accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General of Bangladesh. It gets allocation from of funds from development projects of the Government and its annual development programme has to be approved by the Planning Commission. Due to these measures, both legislative and executive, the status of the company changed from that of an ordinary limited company to that of public enterprise which is owned by the Government and controlled by the corporation.<br/><br/>Having considered the effect of the relevant provisions of series of enactments having bearing on PO No. 27 of 1972 Appellate Division held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“After considering the various provisions of law contained in the Bangladesh <em>Abandoned Property (Control, Management &amp; Disposal) Order, 1972 (PO 16 of 1972) and Bangladesh Industrial Enterprises (Nationalization)  Order, 1972 (PO 27 of 1972) under which the enterprise was first taken over by the Government as abandoned property and then nationalized and placed under the corporation and the enactments relating to the creation of the Corporation , its power and functions and the enactments which refer to and deal with public or nationalized enterprise, it would be difficult to hold that the company or enterprise, namely, Titas Gas Transm-ission &amp; Distribution Co. Ltd. maintained corporate character of a limited  company after it was taken over by the Government  as a nationalized Enterprise and placed under the Corporation. From the definition of public enterprise or nationalized enterprise as appears from the abovementioned enactments, the Titas Gas Transmission &amp; Distribution Co. Ltd. can be viewed both as a nationalized enterprise and a public enterprise. Apart from the legal provisions, the company or the enterprise is, in fact entirely controlled by the Government. There is nothing in its memorandum or articles of association to show that it maintained its autonomous character or separateness from the controlling hand of the Corporation. No private individual has any share in it, nor does the memorandum of association or articles of association provide for participation in its shares by members of general public. Its Board of Directors are entirely manned by and composed of Government officers. It would be seen that except for the purpose of identification of the enterprise or the company vis-a-vis other such nationalized company or enterprise which have been placed under Corporation, it has no distinct will of its own as against Corporation. Whatever separateness may be claimed for or on behalf of any enterprise or company which has been taken over by the Government under the Nationalization Order it has to be understood in this context. If the separateness or, in other words, its autonomy from the Corporation is claimed, it must be shown from the recognition of such autonomy in its constitution, after whatever alterations have been made in it, either by the Government or the Corporation itself. The degree or extent of autonomy may appear also from the actual functioning of such company or such enterprise…If,   in spite of a company or an enterprise being a public enterprise or a nationalized enterprise it is allowed by the Corporation to manage its affairs according to its constitution, that is, its Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association or agreement or deed under which it was originally created, it may be said that such company or enterprise has maintained its corporate character, if that is not so and its functioning is seen to be controlled by the Corporation, whatever independent entity it might have before its becoming a nationalized enterprise  or company is submerged into that of the Corporation. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Thus the company being held to have lost its corporate entity into the government-owned corporation was found to be instrumentality of the Government and thus amenable to writ jurisdiction. <br/><br/>The two leading cases of the Appellate Division, regardless of the ultimate result, were decided on the same legislative background and on similar jurisprudential approach. <em>MH Chowdhury</em> being the later and more suited to the present context may conveniently be followed for representing the principle.  In <em>MH Chowdhury</em> the <em>ratio</em> decided is that -writ petition will not lie even against a nationalized company placed, by operation of law,  under a statutory corporation, if the corporate character of the company is maintained ie, the company is allowed to run by its Memorandum and Articles of Association. While holding that Titas Gas Company is amenable to writ jurisdiction the Court took into consideration, amongst others, the degree and extent of control exerted by the Corporation upon <em>Titas Gas</em>; the extent of functional autonomy <em>Titas Gas</em> did enjoy; absence of public participation in its shares; dominant role of Government officials  in the Board of Directors and absence of its independent will distinct from the Corporation.<br/><br/>Newer cases came up before the High Court Division with peculiar backgrounds demanding wider and more activist search directed to unveiling  government pursuing commercial venture in corporate clothings to the deprivation of fundamental rights of citizens or that the company is engaged in activity of public nature affecting larger sections of people.  Down the line came up the cases of <em>Conforce</em> Ltd v Titas Gas Transmission &amp; Distribution Ltd. reported in 42 DLR 33; <em>Bangladesh Consumers’ Supply Company Ltd v Registrar, Joint Stock Company, </em>46 DLR 552; <em>Farzana Moazzem v Security &amp; Exchange Commission</em> reported in 54 DLR 66; <em>Zakir Hossain Munshi v Bangladesh</em> reported in 55 DLR 130: 22 BLD 483 and lastly the Full Bench case of <em>Arif Sultan v DESA</em> reported in 60 DLR 432.  <br/><br/>In <em>Conforce Ltd</em>. disconnection of gas line by Titas Gas Transmission &amp; Distribution Co. Ltd. was challenged as arbitrary and violative of the terms of contract. Ground of maintainability was as usually raised. The contention was that the company was an ordinary limited company registered under the Companies Act against which writ cannot lie.  More so, what is challenged is an alleged violation of contractual obligation which is also not susceptible to writ jurisdiction. This time round <em>Titas Gas</em> <em>Company</em> was viewed from a different angle and was found amenable to writ jurisdiction as it was engaged in transmission and distribution of the property of the Republic ie, gaseous substance, under the direct control of a statutory corporation.  Since the company was authorized to exercise governmental power the contract executed by it was found not to be an ordinary contract; it was a contract made on behalf of the state in its sovereign capacity. <br/><br/>The case of <em>Consumer’s Supply</em> <em>Company</em>, however, arose in a different context, ie, out of a winding up petition made under Sections 162 and 166 of the Companies Act, 1913. The opposite parties resisted the petition on maintainability ground stating, <em>inter alia,</em> that the government is the 100% share holder of the Company. In spite of incorporation of the petitioner as a limited company under the Companies Act the petitioner retains its character as a public sector enterprise as contemplated under Public Corporation (Management &amp; Co-ordination) Ordinance, 1986(Ordinance No.48 of 1986), therefore, Section 162 of the Companies Act has no manner of application in this case. The Government with <em>mala fide</em> motive to defraud the creditors brought the petition. High Court Division while maintaining the petition observed–‘Merely because 100% share of the Company is held by the Government and the Company being a ‘Public Corporation’ within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Ordinance and included in the schedule thereof it cannot be said that the same is a department or organ of the government  so as to frustrate the winding up petition.<br/><br/>In <em>Farzana Moazzem</em> validity of a letter issued by the Chief Executive Officer of the Dhaka Stock Exchange was challenged by an investor with ancillary directions sought against the respondents to act as required by Reg.7 of the Settlement of the Stock Exchange Transactions Regulations, 1998 in respect of share-transactions made by the petitioner. Question of maintainability came up. A Division Bench of this Division having considered the nature of control of the Security and Exchange Commission on the Dhaka Stock Exchange in the light of connected laws particularly the Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969, found the writ petition maintainable and held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“On careful examination of the various provisions of the aforesaid laws, partic-ularly the sections referred to above from the Securities and Exchange ordinance, 1969, we are persuaded to hold that the DSE has been performing its duties in carrying out its object and business as an instrumentality or a subordinate functionary of the SEC, a local authority, which in fact has also stepped into the shoes of the Government in respect of some matters provided for in the erstwhile Capital Issue (Continuance of Control)  Act, 1947(Act XXIX of 1947). DSE is thus amenable to the jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In <em>Zakir Hossain Munshi, </em>the petitioner, a subscriber of the Grameen Phone line, challenged the imposition and realization of royalty and license fees every year from him as a subscriber and sought a direction to refund the money so realized from him. Question of maintainability was seriously raised. In this case a Division Bench of this Division took an apparently activist approach and found the writ petition maintainable. In so holding the court reasoned that establishing, maintaining and working telegraph is the exclusive privilege of the Government as per section 4 of the Telegraph Act, 1885.  The same legal provision empowers the Government to grant license to any person so to do within any part of Bangladesh. Grameen Phone, under license from the Government, has installed and placed in operation multi-station radio system of digital mobile cellular telephone service all over Bangladesh in order to provide cellular mobile phone service to the subscribers. Grameen Phone as a licensee under the Government, has been providing cellular phone service on behalf of the government, therefore, the phone company is in fact performing governmental and sovereign functions, that is, the exclusive functions of the Government under section 4 of the Telegraph Act.<br/><br/>It may be noted that this case has been decided on a new proposition ie, companies performing governmental functions under license must be subject to writ jurisdiction irrespective of corporate character maintained.   <br/><br/>Lastly, in the Full Bench case (<em>Arif Sultan v DESA</em>) the Court was called upon to decide two questions: (1) whether lifting the veil would be necessary in a case where the impugned order is issued by a company limited by shares held by the Government, and (2) whether the company entire share of which is held by the Government comes within the meaning of “local authority” so as to maintain writ petition against the same.<br/><br/>The case arose out an order of termination of service of the petitioner issued by the respondent company, namely, Dhaka Electric Supply Company Ltd. (DESCO). The Court proceeded to answer the questions upon examination of series of cases decided in our as well as in Indian jurisdiction having bearing on the issue including most of the cases referred to above. The two reference questions were answered in the positive and DESCO was finally identified as an instrumentality of the Government and held to be open to writ jurisdiction. Main plank of arguments addressed at the Bar leaned in favour of a liberal approach in matters of interference in such cases. The Full Bench, however, remained wedded to the literal meaning of the principles decided by the Appellate Division keeping in view the changing need of time, implications of welfare state and   compulsions of the modern day governments to pursue commercial ventures through corporate bodies.  To quote the exact language of the Court:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“In<em> this age of survival of the fittest, the company must have the option to fire its employees in order to hire the most skilled ones. With the advent of the welfare state , it began to be increasingly felt that the framework of civil service was not sufficient to handle the new tasks which are often of specialized and highly technical character. The inadequacy of civil service to deal with the new problems came to be realized and it became necessary to form companies incorporated under the Companies Act by the Government.  But it is important to note that the company must be allowed to  determine  its own fate according to Memorandum and Articles of Associations after its incorporation and that so long that is not allowed the company is deemed to be an instrumentality or agency of the Government or local authority. The interest of the Government will be taken care of by its nominated directors and not by the Government itself.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The Court then proceeded to lay down a five-fold test to determine whether a company is an instrumentality or agency of the Government. The five-critera test put in place appears not to be meant as exhaustive rather in the sense that the cumulative effect assessed on the criteria should indicate the answer. The conditions enumerated are as follows: </div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>If the entire share capital of the company is held by the Government, it will go a long way towards indicating that the company is an instrumentality or agency of the Government. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Existence of deep and pervasive control of the Government.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The true rationale in setting up the company.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The company is fully dependent on the financial assistance of the Government.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The company is not run by the Memorandum and Articles of Association.  </em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The overview of cases especially of Indian jurisdiction referred to above suggests that the Supreme Court took a more liberal view in matters of interference and came down heavily in the protection of fundamental rights of citizens as something not to be bartered away with governmental compulsion of corporatization and subjected the corporations/ companies to constitutional limitations if found to be identifiable with government agency or instrumentality irrespective of corporate character maintained. View taken in our jurisdiction, <em>albeit</em> not directly focused on fundamental rights concern, appears to be more tilted to a balance between State-compulsion for corpora-tization and fundamental rights entitlements of citizens.<br/><br/>Looking back to Teletalk Bangladesh Limited, it appears that TBL was registered in 2004 as a public company limited by shares formed <em>albeit</em> apparently for commercial purposes essentially imbued with public interest objectives. Several documents connected to the company are put on records on behalf of the petitioner, namely, copies of Memorandum and Articles of Association; a copy of certificate of incorporation, a copy of certificate for commencement of business; a copy of Annual Report of the company for the year 2009-2010; a notice dated 29.12.2004 issued by the Secretary, Ministry of Posts &amp; Telecommunications as Chairman Teletalk Bangladesh Ltd inviting the first meeting of the Board of Directors;  minutes of the first meeting of the Board of Directors held on 30.12. 2004; a copy of notice dated 01.6.2005 inviting statutory meeting of the company; minutes of the statutory meeting of the company held on 22.6.2005 and an  overview of the Board of Directors retrieved from the Company’s official  website. <br/><br/>The constitution of the company ie, Memorandum and Articles of Association on the face of them  suggest that  there are seven high officials of the Government who subscribed their names to the Memorandum and Articles, namely, 1) Secretary, Ministry of Posts &amp; Telecommunication; 2) one Joint Secretary, of the same Ministry; 3) one Joint Secretary, Ministry of Commerce; 4) one Joint Secretary, Ministry of Finance; 5) one Joint Secretary, Ministry of Science &amp; ICT; 6) Chairman, Bangladesh Telegraph &amp; Telephone Board and 7) Project Director, Mobile Phone Project.  As per the company’s Articles they, by virtue of being the subscribers, are the Directors of the company. The company is registered with an authorized capital of Tk. 2000, 00, 00,000.00 (Two thousand crore) divided into 2, 00, 00,000 (Two crore) shares of Tk. 1000/- each. The Directors took two shares each<u>.</u><br/><br/>The Articles provide that till the time the new Directors are appointed, the subscribers shall remain as Directors of the company. The office of the Director shall be <em>ipso facto</em> vacated if he is transferred, released or retired from the post by virtue of which he is nominated or appointed to hold the position of Director of the company. The Secretary of the Ministry of Post &amp; Telecommunications, Government of Bangladesh will be the first Chairman of the company. The Managing Director of the company shall be nominated by the Government and approved and appointed by the Board of Directors. Board’s power to create posts and make appointments is also subjected to the power of the Government so to do in respect of the company. Besides the specific cases of nomination/appointments, all the members of the Board are nominated by the Government. The position is borne out by the Annual Report of the company (2009-10) in the following words: ‘The Board of Directors comprises of eleven members, all being nominated by the Government of Bangladesh’.<br/><br/>As an enormous corporate venture aimed at providing cellular mobile phone services side by side with other mobile phone companies now in place, TBL needed <em>a priori</em> huge initial capital and infrastructure in order to commence and continue its business, more so, in a competitive market. No indication is given in the affidavit how the company went on financing such a huge corporate venture and commenced trading before raising minimal share capital and being possessed of approp-riate level of assets. Curiously, the company, although did not disown the documents placed on records, chose not to explain them. Rather tried to meet them by the patent words: TBL is an ordinary public company as good as other companies operating in private sector and that it is not dependent on the financial assistance of the Government.<br/><br/>The Annual Report for the year 2009-10 of TBL and other connected documents placed on records by the petitioner, however, seek to answer the question in a way. Relevant portions  of the Report are selectively quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>‘In Bangladesh the mobile telephony was opened to private sector for more than a decade ago and during the period four mobile operators came up to serve the people in this sector. But they could not fulfill the public demand as anticipated… Under the circumstances, the idea of establishing a mobile telephone project in the public sector was conceived…The ECNEC of the Government of People’s Republic of Bangladesh decided to form a separate public limited company for implementation and operation of the project. Then the Bangladesh Telephone &amp; Telegraph Board having longest experience of serving in the telecom sector in Bangladesh undertook initiative to form the desired company in public sector.  In view of the fact that formation of a public company involves considerable time and various relevant formalities, </em>it was decided that BTTB should implement the project and operation thereof would be carried out by the desired company.<em> Subsequently the assets out of this process would be taken over by the desired company to be formed. With the view described above, Teletalk Bangladesh Limited being the only government-sponsored mobile telephone company in the country was incorporated on 26 December, 2004 as a public limited company under the Companies Act, 1994.’</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>‘Since the company’, the report continues, ‘inherited the BTTB project the relevant equipments and infrastructure necessarily were in the name of the erstwhile BTTB. Upon approval of the Government, the company by executing a vendor’s agreement with the Ministry of Posts &amp; Telecommunications has acquired all the equipments and infrastructures thereby transferring the title of the relevant assets in its own name. <u>In consideration 6,438,639 fully paid ordinary shares of Tk. 1000/-each have been issued in the name of the Ministry of Posts &amp; Telecommu-nications…</u> <u>After acquiring the assets and upon increasing the paid up capital by that extent, as the Government decision, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved to go for IPO @ 40% of TBL paid up capital in the capital market. Such decision of the Board has been commun-icated with the Ministry of Posts &amp; Telecommunications for obtaining further guideline</u>.’ (Emphasis added)</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The Report paraphrased, bears the plain meaning that TBL is the child of an idea conceived at the Government level that a mobile telephone project need be taken up to ensure more competitive and better service to the people. The idea led to the decision taken in the meeting of Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC) that a company was to be formed for operation of the project. Bangladesh Telegraph &amp; Telephone Board (BTTB) was entrusted with the responsibility to devise and form the company primarily to see the operational side of the project. The assets needed in the process were to be taken over by the company. TBL accordingly came into being as the only government-sponsored company and started operation on the existing equipments and infrastructures of BTTB. Thereafter the BTTB-equipments and infrastructures taken over by TBL were formally transferred to TBL by a vendor’s agreement made with the Ministry of Post &amp; Telecommunications. In consideration 6,438,639 fully paid ordinary shares of Tk.1000/each were issued in the name of the Ministry.  Thereafter, pursuant to a decision of the Government, the company decided to go for initial offer  of its shares to the investors in the capital market and communicated the decision to the Ministry of Posts &amp; Telecommunications.<br/><br/>The Report read with the affidavit sworn by TBL leaves us with no doubt that TBL was born out of the flesh and blood of the Government. It still feeds on the staff, equipments and infrastructures of BTTB, a statutory public authority.  It owes its origin in the idea of the Government to launch a mobile phone project in public sector and ECNEC decision to form a company to operate the project. TBL has, so far, not made any formal offer of its shares to the public so as to raise its own capital. All the facts taken together necessarily indicate that, TBL, for all practical purposes, is an instrumentality of the Government working in corporate costume for operating a mobile phone project of the Government entirely depending on the financial assistance of the Government. <br/><br/>On the management side, Government’s control in company affairs has been deep-seated from very inception continued till date. The original Board of Directors, as mentioned earlier, comprised of seven members all of whom were high officials of the Government. The present Board of Directors comprises of eleven members, eight from top, are public functionaries. The Secretary, Ministry of Posts &amp; Telecommunications is the <em>ex officio</em> Charmin of the company’s Board. All the Directors including the Managing Director, as suggested by the Articles and the Report, are nominated by the Government and holding office by virtue of their respective offices in the Republic. Their appointments as Directors are made variable with the variation of their services in the Republic.  The Board’s power to create posts and appointment of company employees  is subjected to the decision of the Government.  As transpired from the minutes of the first meeting that TBL did not take the expensive operating license from BTRC as is done by private sector companies, and is carrying on  its business upon the license that was held by BTTB just by changing name through the Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (BTRC). This is clearly indicative of the fact that TBL has been enjoying a kind of monopoly as against others under the direct protection of the Government.  More importantly, the company does have no independent will of its own distinct from the Government and is incapable of taking at least any major decision without prior approval of the Government which is apparently manifested (as transpired from Article &amp; Report) in three examples, namely, the subordination of the Board’s power to create posts and make appointments for the company to the power of the  Government; its lack of authority to make public offer of its shares without prior approval of the Government and  its practice of keeping the Ministry informed about its official transactions. <br/><br/>Seen in the light of compulsion of modern governments to be engaged in multiplicity of functions keeping in view the wellbeing of the citizens, we see nothing unfair on the part of the Government to corporatize its functions demanding special knowledge, skill, and professionalism for more efficient and fruitful outcome. But by no consideration government can be allowed to use corporate façade as a device to impair, emasculate or frustrate fundamental rights of citizens guaranteed by the Constitution. If the control of the Government in the affairs of the company is so deep and pervasive as to destroy the corporate character of the company and the   capability of the company of being run by its Memorandum and Articles of Association proves an impossibility, the company is a sham or façade no more than an instrumentality of the Government. It must suffer the same constitutional and public law limitations as the government does.<br/><br/>Here in this case it is difficult to identify TBL as an identity distinct from the Government. The huge venture is still entirely dependent on the public exchequer for its finance.  Its Board is predominantly manned by the public functionaries who hold the position <em>ex officio</em> as servants of the Republic. All the Directors are nominated by the Government. The Board is substantially dependent on the Government for every major policy decision of the company. Exactly as is done by a government department, TBL acts under direction and supervision of the Ministry and keep the Ministry informed at least about important official transactions. Government control on TBL management and policy is as unusually deep and pervasive as to admit of no separate corporate autonomy or character of its own.  It has no independent will distinct from the Government. All the indicators available on records lead to the irresistible conclusion that TBL as a company is nothing but a sham or façade. It is only identifiable as an instrumentality or agency of the Government. It follows that TBL must be subjected to same constitutional and public law limitation as the Government is.<br/><br/>The contention of Mr. Ahmed that a company to be an instrumentality of the government shares must be  issued in the name of the President or the Government cuts no ice as is  totally watered down by the jurisprudence emerging over the decades through judicial expositions. His contention that the persons holding shares of the company are mere ‘individuals’ nothing to do with the Government is utterly unacceptable and stands in bold contrast with the company constitution itself. <br/><br/>For the reasons stated above we find no substance in the argument of Mr. Ahmed addressed on maintainability. The writ petition against Respondent No.2 ie, Teletalk Bangladesh Ltd. is found to be maintainable.<br/><br/>Turning to the case of the petitioner, he was removed from service on the allegation that he supplied wrong information about his permanent address while getting his job in TBL. The petitioner after completing his Master’s degree and other specialized courses joined TBL as Deputy General Manager (Audit) in December, 2009.  At the time he was served with termination letter he completed three and half years in service. It appears that the termination letter followed a police verification report wherein permanent address of the petitioner was found inconsistent and none from the locality could identify the petitioner as one belonging to the address.  Nothing is alleged about the quality of service rendered by the petitioner over these three and half years. Let it be mentioned that there was a second verification made by police in which the information given by the petitioner was found correct.<br/><br/> The police verification upon which the impugned order was issued was admittedly made in secret as is usually done. The management of TBL took the matter very seriously and decided to award him the highest punishment. Accordingly the termination letter was issued by the Managing Director on April 15, 2013 pursuant to a decision of Board of Directors, taking recourse to Clause 4(b) of the appointment letter. Admittedly no show cause notice was issued asking the petitioner to explain his position, before termination of his service. The relevant portion of the termination letter addressed to the petitioner reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Your employment with Teletalk Bangladesh</em><em> Limited (TBL) is hereby terminated under clause no. 4(b) of your appointment letter for providing false information which has been intimated by police through their verification report.</em><br/><em>2) The decision of termination of your employment with TBL for providing aforesaid false information was passed in the resolution of 109<sup>th</sup> meeting of  Board of Directors (BoD) of TBL held on March, 16, 2013. </em><br/><em>3) ……….. ……. …………     …………….     ………………..     …………….</em><br/><em>4) …………….   …………  ……………        …………………………   ….”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The termination letter shows that the petitioner’s service was terminated attracting Clause 4(b) of the appointment letter. Clause 4 of the appointment letter enumerates four grounds for termination, two of which are   related to termination for misconduct and two others including Clause 4(b) are related to termination <em>simpliciter</em> as a matter of law not for any fault.<br/><br/>Since Clause 4(b) of the appointment letter provides for termination of service without notice for no fault of the employee, provision of the clause cannot be resorted to where an employee is sought to be removed for misconduct. Charge of misconduct itself implies stigma on the service career which is followed by punishment, if proved. No employee, therefore, can be punished for misconduct without a proceedings initiated and prior notice given allowing him reasonable opportunity to explain his position.<br/><br/>In the instant case the allegation consists in ‘providing false information about the petitioner’s permanent address which, if true, is a kind of ‘misconduct’ as contemplated under law. And the petitioner was removed straightaway on the charge by resort to  the  ‘No-show cause clause’  without initiating any proceedings or giving him an opportunity to explain his position which is not only illegal and a fraud on the law but also unjust, arbitrary and oppressive. This apart, the termination order issued forthwith merely on a verification report, that too, on a trifling subject like inconsistency in home address (later found correct) besides being <em>mala fide</em> is utterly dispropo-rtionate and not acceptable in the eye of  law.<br/><br/>We are not persuaded by the submission of Mr. Ahmed, that the petitioner had equally efficacious remedy in departmental appeal or in civil suit in that the suit cannot be equally efficacious in any view of the matter and departmental appeal was to be preferred to the Board of Directors which took the decision of termination meaning thereby that an appeal was to be made from Caesar to Caesar as rightly pointed out by Mr. Mahbub. The contention that disputed facts presented by two contradictory police reports cannot be decided in writ petition is of no anvil as the facts do have no bearing upon merit of this Rule.<br/><br/>For what we have stated above, we find merit in this Rule. Accordingly, this Rule is made absolute. The impugned order of termination from service is declared to have been issued without any lawful authority and is of no legal effect. The Respondents are directed to reinstate the petitioner in his service with seniority and to pay all  arrear salary and other service benefits within one month from receipt of this judgment.<br/><br/>There shall, however, be no order as to cost.<br/><br/>Communicate copies of this judgment at once. <br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Rezaul Hasan:</span></u></strong><br/> <br/>This is an application under section 233 of the Companies Act, 1994 (the Act).<br/><br/>Facts leading to filing of this application, in short, are that the petitioner is the Managing Director of the Respondent No.1 Company namely The Heaven Homes Private Limited, certificate of incorporation No. C-71163 (3670)/08, having 500 shares of Tk.1000 each. The petitioner is holding 20% shares in the company, incorporated on 08.05.08 as a private company limited by shares, under the Companies Act, 1994 (the Act) to carry on the business of housing, Real Estate, construction of houses, apartments, commercial centers and to dispose the land, plot, apartments or shops by way of allotment, sale, rent etc; that it was stipulated in Article 29 of the Article of Association of the Respondent No.1 company that the affairs and business of the company shall be managed under the control and supervision of the Managing Director; that the petitioner has been appointed as Managing Director for a period of 5(five) years from the date of incorporation, as stated in Article 32, wherein it also has been mentioned that his remuneration and other allowances shall be determined by the Board of Directors of the company; that Article 30 and 31 of the Articles of Association of the Company contemplates that Respondent No.2 Mr. Mohd. Abdus Salam shall be the first Chairman of the Company for a period of 5(five) years and his responsibility shall be to preside over all the meetings of the Company and Respondent No.3 Mr. Abdul Jabed shall be the Vice Chairman of the Company for a period of 5(five) years, who will discharge the function of the Chairman in his absence; that during 14-15 days in the month of July, 2011 while the petitioner was out of Sylhet, the  Respondent No.2, having taken advantage of his close relation with internal auditor, received the audit reports along with the book of accounts from him without any concurrence of the petitioner and behind his back; when the petitioner approached Respondent No.2 to provide the audit report along with the papers, but the Respondent No.2 showing different reasons delayed to hand over the audit report and books of account of the Company; that Article 38 of the Articles of Association of the Company provides that the entire fund of the Company shall be kept with any Islami Bank determined by the Board of Directors of the Company and the same shall be operated under the joint signatures of the Managing Director with either the Chairman or the Vice Chairman; that the Company opened a bank account with Respondent No.7, Exim Bank Ltd. Sylhet Branch, Al-Hamra Shopping City, Zindabazar, Sylhet, being account No.000313100002098 which was to be operated under the joint signature of the Managing Director with either the Chairman or Vice Chairman; that upon receipt of a hand written board resolution dated 06.10.2011, signed by the Respondent No.2, which was annexed to the petition of Complaint case No.117 of 2011 filed before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Sylhet, it was noticed that the petitioner has been released from the office of Managing Director; that subsequently the petitioner was able to collect a printed version of the Board resolution dated 06.10.11; that the said board meeting has not been convened by the petitioner as Managing Director and that he was not served with any notice of the said meeting, that the resolution mentioned above did not contain the name or signatures of the Directors; that as such it appears that the board resolution of the Respondent No.1, the Heaven Homes Private Limited, dated 06.10.2011, is fake and created collusively by the Respondent Nos.2 and 3; that Article 25(d) of the Article of Association of the Respondent No.1 Company stipulates that if the Chairman, Vice Chairman, Managing Director or Executive Directors are engaged in any activities subversive to the interest of the Company or failed to perform their duty they may be released from their office as per the recommendation of the Board of Directors in an Extra-Ordinary General Meeting, but in the instant case the Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 disregarding the provision of Articles 25(d) removed the petitioner from the office of the Managing Director by an ordinary board resolution which is unlawful and is of no legal effect. Hence this petition.<br/><br/>The Respondent No.2 appeared in this matter and submitted affidavit-in-opposition denying all materials allegations and specifically stated that Article 38 of the Articles of Association of the Company provides that the entire funds of the company shall be kept with any Islami Bank determined by the Board of Directors of the company and the same shall be operated under the joint signature of the Managing Director with either the Chairman or Vice Chairman; besides during the course of hearing the respondent No. 2 submitted a supplementary affidavit filed by the respondent stating at paragraph No.3 that before holding the meeting dated 6.10.2011, whereby the petitioner has released from his office as Managing Directors, he was verbally informed about this meeting; the petitioner submitted an affidavit-in-reply to the affidavit-in-opposition specifically denying at paragraph Nos.4 and 3 that no notice was served on the petitioner before holding of the said meeting dated 16.10.2011 the petitioner was neither verbally informed, nor any notice served upon him.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Jashimuddin Ahmed appearing along with the learned Advocate Mr.Md.Zakir Hossain, having placed the petition and other materials on record and particularly drawing my attention to Article 32 of the Articles of Association of the respondent No.1 (the Company), submits that the petitioner is entitled to hold his office as Managing Director for 5 years and that the company being registered on 8.5.2008 the tenure of 5 years will be expired on 7.5.2013. As such the board resolution dated 6.10.2011, whereby the petitioner has been removed, is totally ultravires the power of respondent and the questioned resolution is liable to be cancelled as per provisions of clause a of sub-section (3) of section 233. The learned lawyer, then referring to paragraph No.38, providing for operation of Bank Accounts further that submits the Bank Account to be opened with Islami Bank is to be operated under joint signature of the Managing Director (the petitioner) and the Chairman or Vice Chairman, but adopting this disputed resolution dated 6.10.2011 the respondents have violated the provisions of Article 38 and as such the resolution is liable to be cancelled under the aforesaid provisions of law. He also submits that it has been clearly stated that in paragraph No.10 of the petition that the petitioner has been removed from his office by the board resolution dated 6.10.2011 without serving any notice and the said resolution is liable to be cancelled on that count as well for violation of the specific provision of section 95 of the Companies Act. The learned Advocate for the petitioner finally submits that section 106 of the Companies Act provides for removal of a Director. But in the instant case the petitioner (Managing Director) has been removed by board resolution dated 6.10.2011, which is a clear violation of provisions of section 106 of the Act, hence also the questioned resolution is liable to be cancelled. Accordingly, he has prayed for allowing the petition interms of the prayer made in the application filed under section 233. The learned Advocate for the petitioner has referred to 54 DLR 583(a case under section 233), 50 DLR 597 (a case under section 95), 50 DLR AD 138 (a case under section 95) arose out of 50 DLR 597 and 53 DLR 81 (a case under section 233) in support of his contention.<br/><br/>The learned Counsel Dr. M. Zahir, appearing along with the learned Advocates Mr. Shah Muhammad Ezaz Rahman and Mr. Mustaque Ahmed Chowdhury, on the contrary, submits that a mere reading of the resolution dated 6.10.2011 would show that the petitioner was released (<strong>AhÉ¡q¢a</strong>) from the office of the Managing Director. As such the submission that he was removed from his office is totally misconceived. The learned Advocate, further referring to Form-XII (particulars of Directors) filed on 15.10.2011 with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms, submits that it clearly shows that the petitioner Mr. Md. Abdul Wadud has ceased to be the Managing Director, but he is continuing as a Director since 6.10.2011. Hence, question of following provisions of section 106 of the Act did not arise in this case and the Board of Directors are very much competent to adopt the resolution in question. He next submits that the resolution in question, annexed as annexure-C to the petition, would show that the petitioner was released from his office of the Managing Director because of dishonour of 4 (for us) cheques issued by him in favour of the company, upon his admission in a meeting dated 5.9.2011 that the petitioner has illegally removed Tk.25,18,502/- from the company’s fund and that he has admittedly refunded Tk.2,53000/-, while for repayment the balance amount he has issued 4 cheques with commitment to adjust the said amount by 29.9.2011. But none of the said 4(four) cheques were honored and the company has filed N.I.Act  cases and the Complaint Petitions filed under section 138 of the N.I. Act have also been annexed as Annexure-X-4 to X-11 to the affidavit-in-opposition. As such, there is no case of oppression on the petitioner as minority shareholder. Rather it is a clear case of taking action against the petitioner for committing breach of trust and removal of company’s money and the action taken for this reason should not amount to oppression against the petitioner as a minority shareholder. As such, the learned lawyer continued, that the petition is not at all maintainable under section 233, since there is no question of oppression. Rather the action was taken upon specific allegation of defalcation, admitted by the petitioner and duly proved by the materials on record before this court. The learned lawyer for the petitioner further submits that this petition under section 233 is not maintainable as well for the reason that section 233 of the Act only protects individual right and interest of minority shareholder, but this section is not available to seek protection of the office of Managing Director which is divisible from the petitioner’s capacity as a member. He finally submits that the Respondent No.1 Company is a private company limited by shares and indeed there was no practice in this company, since inception, to issue any notice in writing. Hence the petitioner was verbally informed about this meeting dated 6.10.2011, notwithstanding the fact that in his petition and in his affidavit-in-reply he has denied to have been informed verbally as well as he has denied to have been served with any notice. The learned Advocate then concludes that the question, with reference to section 95 of Act, agitated before this Bench hearing company matter is not possible to be decided by this court inasmuch as no specific jurisdiction has been vested in this court to hear or to decide dispute that has arisen or that may arise for non-compliance of section 95 of the Act, in other words for not issuing any notice upon any Members of the Board of Directors and that if any Director has any allegation of this kind he will have to raise it before the civil court. On this ground, the learned Advocate for the respondent submits that, the instant petition is liable to be dismissed with costs. The learned lawyer for the respondent has referred to 54 DLR 28 (a case under section 233), 54 DLR 306 (a case under section 95 and 61 DLR AD 82 (a case under section 95) in support of his submission.<br/><br/>I have heard the learned Advocate appearing for both sides, the petition filed under section 233, the affidavit-in-opposition, the supplementary affidavit, the affidavit in reply and other materials on record.<br/><br/>As regards the submission that the petitioner has been removed from his office of the Managing Director, in violation of Article 32 and Article 38 read with section 106 of the Act, I find from the questioned resolution dated 6.10.2011 (annexure-C to the petition) that the petitioner was simply released (AhÉ¡q¢a) from the office of the Managing Director. He has not been removed from his office as a Director Office or of Managing Director. ‘Removal’ and ‘release’ are two different acts. Besides, from perusal of Articles 29, 30, 31 and 32, it is apparent that the managing director is to perform his duty subject to the supervision of the board of directors. As such, the board of directors are very much competent to adopt the resolution in question. Alongside, having considered the contents of the said Board resolution alongwith 4(four) Complaint Petitions, it is apparent that the petitioner was released from his office for committing financial misdeeds, but he has been continuing as a director as is evident from Form XII, dated 15.12.2011, (Annexure 15) to the affidavit-in-opposition. So, apparently this is not a case of removal and the decision was taken not from any motive to oppress the petitioner, rather on the basis of an specific allegation and admitted position of defalcation or removal of company’s monies. Hence, in this case the question of oppression does not arise and <strong>taking of an action on the allegation of delinquency (supported by the materials on record) against the petitioner, does not amount to oppression on minority shareholder merely for the reason that he happens to be a minority share-holder in the company and shall not bring this cause to be considered under section 233 of the Act.</strong><br/><br/>I have also considered the submission, as advanced by the learned Advocate for the respondent that, section 233 of the Act protects the interest quo member. But, the question whether such interest shall refer only to the direct interest of a member or to ultimate interest to see that the company is being managed properly and as per law was neither agitated nor decided in the aforesaid decisions referred to by the learned advocate for the respondent. <strong>A Member’s interest, in my considered opinion, is not confined only to his individual interest. But shall extend to his ultimate interest as well and in his interest to ensure that the company is being managed and run properly, profitably and in compliance with the provisions of law.</strong> <strong>Once the complaining share holder is able to show mismanagement of the affairs of the company, resulted either from non-compliance of law or otherwise, a petition under section 233 of the Act is maintainable and the court may pass appropriate order to undo the wrong resulting from non-compliance of the provisions of the Act or of the Articles of Association. Otherwise, the purport and the legislative intent in incorporating section 233, in the Companies Act, will be frustrated. The sprit of section 233 is to be considered to ensure corporate governments as well and to require fairness in managing the affairs of the company by the Board of Directors or majority share-holders.</strong> However, on the facts of this case, I find 54 DLR 28 is liable to be distinguished for the reasons stated herein before.<br/><br/>Then referring to the, decisions taken in 54 DLR 306 and in 61 DLR (AD) 82, there is no reason to depart from the views taken in those cases that unless the jurisdiction is conferred in this court to decide a lis, this court does not have authority to decide the same. <strong>But, I am of the opinion that reading section 233 with section 95 of the Act and rule 8 of the company Rules, 2009 this court has jurisdiction to decide about the validity of a meeting held without complying with the provisions of section 95 and to cancel any resolution taken in such a meeting under section 233 as well as for ends of justice.</strong><br/><br/>Finally, having considered the fact that no notice for calling the meeting dated 6.10.2011 has been issued, I find that this ground has been specifically taken at paragraph 10 of the substantive application, although by a supplementary affidavit the respondent has stated that they have verbally informed the petitioner to attend the meeting the petitioner. However, by filing an affidavit-in-reply the petitioner has denied this statement and again asserted that no notice was served on the petitioner and that there was no practice either to call a board meeting without issuing any formal notice. In my considered view, to receive such a notice, is a statutory right of a director, ensured by section 95 of the Act, that reads as follows: “95 Notice of meetings:- Notice of every meeting of the Board of Directors of a company shall be given in writing to every director for the time being in Bangladesh and at his address in Bangladesh.” Besides, in the instant case the petitioner has not waived his right to receive the notice required to be served upon him as per provision of section 95of the Act.<br/><br/>So far as the question of legality of the board meeting without serving any written notice upon the directors (the petitioner in this case) as required by section 95 of the Act, the petitioner has referred to 50 DLR 597 (Ittefaq Group of Publications Limited and others Vs. Arab Bangladesh Bank Limited and others). It further appears that this matter was ultimately taken to the apex court and the apex court has upheld the decision of the High Court Division, vide the case reported in 50 DLR (AD) 138. In 50 DLR 597 it has been held that “<u>For holding a valid meeting of the board of directors written notice must be given to all the members of the board of directors. If any one is left out the resolution taken in that meeting becomes invalid</u>.” I would respectfully follow this view expressing the correct position of law, while I do not see any reason to depart from the views taken in 50 DLR597. (emphasis added).<br/>This court has inherent jurisdiction under rule 8 of the Companies Rules, 2009 to pass appropriate order for ends of justice in a case in which non-compliance of the provision of law comes to its notice.<br/><br/><strong>The word “inherent jurisdiction”, used in rule 8, is of wider connotation then that the word ‘inherent power’. This inherent jurisdiction vested in this court under rule 8 is in addition and supplementary to the statutory jurisdiction vested in this court under sub-section (1) of section 3 of the Act. Reading sub-section (1) of section 3 alongwith rule 8 of the Companies Rules, 2009. I find no lack of jurisdiction of this court to pass an appropriate order to hold the questioned board meeting unlawful for non-service of the statutory notice, as required to be served as per provisions of diction 95 of the Act, particularly in the absence of a case of waiver or acquiescence.</strong><br/><br/>In my considered view, if the directors are allowed to call a board meeting without serving statutory notice, as required by section 95 of Act, then it is bound to lead to chaos and to collapse the management of the company. <strong>So, the law should be interpreted in a manner that will support the purport and intent of enacting the law instead of being frustrated and thereby will help compliance of the provisions of law. Any interpretation that would lead to giving indulgence to non-compliance should be avoided and abhorred</strong>. Besides, the law declared in 61 DLR (AD) 82 and 54 DLR 306, concerning section 95 of the Act, declared before the Companies Rule, 2009 has come into effect. As such, the legal significance of Rule 8 of Companies Rules, 2009 was neither agitated nor decided in those cases. Hence those cases are liable to be distinguished on this aspect.<br/>In view of the deliberations recorded herein above, for calling the questioned meeting without serving any notice upon the petitioner, I hold that the concerned resolution is liable to be cancelled for non-compliance of section 95 of the Act.<br/><br/>Accordingly, I find merit in this petition.<br/><br/>In the result the petition is allowed. However the company is at liberty, if so adviced, to proceed according to law in compliance with section 95 of the Act.<br/><br/>However, the acts done by the board consisting of new Managing Director, in the meantime, shall be deemed to be valid inspite of any irregularities in his appointment. <br/><br/>The direction given at the time of admission of this petition, on 17.1.2012, not to deal with the companies Bank Account No.00313100002098, maintained with Exim Bank Limited (respondent No.7) shall stand vacated.<br/>Costs will be borne by the parties.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Thus, section 19(4) of the Ain comes into operation if the application is filed in compliance with both the conditions as prescribed in sections 19(2) and 19(3) of the Ain i.e. limitation period and deposit of 10% of the decretal dues. . . .

Therefore, on receipt of an application in pursuance of section 19(2) of the Ain, if the Adalat is satisfied that both the conditions of section 19(2) and 19(3) of the Ain, is complied with, it shall allow the said application as per section 19(4) of the Ain. . . .

Thus, it is apparent that unless both the requirements of sections 19(2) and 19(3) of the Ain are complied with, the Adalat has no scope to allow the application under section 19(4) of the Ain setting-aside the exparte decree even if the defendant deposits 10% of the decretal dues. . . .

Hassan, J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>By filing an application under Article 102 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, the petitioner obtained this Rule on the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Let a Rule Nisi be issued calling upon the respondent Nos.1-7 to show cause as to why the provision of section 19(4) empowering the Judge, Artha Rin Adalat to set aside the        ex-parte decree at once only on deposit of 10% money of the decretal dues without issuing a notice to the decree holder and without giving the decree-holder an opportunity to explain its/his position and without enquiring about the actual date of knowledge of the judgment-debtor about the decree should not be declared to be arbitrary, discriminatory, inconsistent with the principle of natural justice, and ultravires the provisions of the Constitution and why the impugned order dated 04.03.2009 passed in pursuance of that provision by the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat No.3, Dhaka in Artha Rin Suit No.174 of 2006 should not be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect and/or pass such other or further order or orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Subsequently, on the basis of an application filed by the petitioner a supplementary Rule was issued on 06.06.2012 in the following manner:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Let a supplementary Rule Nisi be issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the order No.30 dated 15.07.2008 allowing the Miscellaneous Case No. 668 of 2008 setting aside the ex-parte judgment and decree dated 05.03.2008 passed by the Artha Rin Adalat No.3, Dhaka in Artha Rin Suit No. 174 of 2006 should not be declared to  have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect and/or pass such other or further order or orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Relevant facts necessary for disposal of the Rule are that the petitioner, Pubali Bank Limited, Principal Branch, 26, Dilkusha Commercial Area, Dhaka (shortly, the Bank) as plaintiff instituted Artha Rin Suit        No. 174 of 2006 on 20.08.2006 before the Artha Rin Adalat No.3, Dhaka (shortly, the Adalat) against the respondent Nos. 3-7 for recovery of loan money amounting to Tk. 52.84,652.86. Summons were duly served upon the defendants in all manner as per provisions of law including paper publication. The defendant Nos. 1-3 and 5 appeared in the suit and filed written statements on 15.02.2007 and 12.03.2007 respectively. Subsequently, they did not pursue the suit and as a result the suit was decreed ex-parte on 05.03.2008 (decree signed on 10.03.2008). The Bank put the decree into execution on 22.05.2008 through Artha Jari Case No. 430 of 2008 in the Adalat for realization of Tk. 60,46,670.86 including interest and costs of the suit as per decree. Notices in the name of judgment-debtors were published in the daily news papers except the judgment-debtor No.5 who had already received the notice of execution case.<br/> <br/>On 04.06.2008 the defendant No.4 filed Miscellaneous Case No. 668 of 2008 under section 19 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (shortly, the Ain) for setting aside the ex-parte decree dated 05.03.2008 and also prayed for restoration of the suit to its original file and number stating, inter alia, that summons was not served upon this defendant and that this defendant was not aware about the suit as well as the decree; from the letter dated 13.05.2008 issued by the Food department, the defendant, for the first time, came to know about the suit as well as the decree; the defendant ascertained the fact of decree by an information slip obtained on 14.05.2008 and thereafter by depositing 10% of the decretal dues, the defendant filed the miscellaneous case.<br/> <br/>Without issuing any notice upon the plaintiff (decree holder), the Adalat by order dated 15.07.2008 allowed the miscellaneous case setting aside the    ex-parte decree dated 05.03.2008 and thereby restored the Artha Rin Suit No. 174 of 2006. On 31.08.2008 the defendant No.4 when served the copy of the written statement upon the plaintiff Bank, for the first time it came to know about the impugned order dated 15.07.2008 by which miscellaneous case was allowed and suit was restored to its original file and number.<br/> <br/>On 18.11.2008 the Bank filed an application before the Adalat under section 57 of the Ain for recalling the order dated 15.07.2008 and that the said application was rejected on 04.03.2009.<br/> <br/>In the aforesaid circumstances, the plaintiff-Bank filed this writ petition challenging the order dated 04.03.2009 as well as the vires of section 19(4) of the Ain and obtained the Rule. Subsequently, by a supplementary Rule the order dated 15.07.2008 setting aside the ex-parte decree has also been challenged.<br/> <br/>Respondent No.4 has filed affidavit-in-opposition controverting the statements made in the writ petition. This respondent contends that there is no provision in section 19 of the Ain to serve notice upon the plaintiff-decree holder before setting aside the ex-parte decree; that as per requirement of section 19(3) of the Ain the defendant deposited 10% of the decretal dues and that the legal requirement having been complied with, the Adalat allowed the miscellaneous case as per sanction of section 19(4) of the Ain; that no summons was served upon the defendant No.4 and that being unaware about the suit, this defendant could not contest the suit and as a result the suit was decreed ex-parte; that the defendant No.4 could not know about the ex-parte decree in time and as a result the application for setting aside the decree was filed beyond 30 days of the ex-parte decree but as soon as the defendant came to know about the said decree, he filed this miscellaneous case within 30 days from date of his knowledge and therefore, the miscellaneous case being filed as per requirement of section 19(2) of the Ain, the Adalat allowed the miscellaneous case finding deposit of 10% of the decretal dues. Therefore, the Rule does not have any merit and as such, it is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mrinal Kanti Biswas, the learned Advocate appearing for the writ petitioner (the Bank) submits that by passing the exparte decree, a legal right has been accrued in favour of the plaintiff but section 19(4) of the Ain empowers the Adalat to set aside the said ex-parte decree curtailing the legal right of the plaintiff without issuing any notice upon the decree holder (plaintiff) and only on deposit of 10% of the decretal dues. Therefore, the said provision is arbitrary, against the principle of natural justice and thus, ultravires the Constitution. He also submits that the application for setting aside the ex-parte decree was filed beyond 30 days of the decree. Therefore, the defendant was required to satisfy the Adalat about the date of knowledge as per requirement of section 19(2) of the Ain but without complying with the said provision of law, the Adalat allowed the miscellaneous case setting aside the ex-parte decree and as such the impugned order dated 15.07.2008 is liable to be declared to have been passed without lawful authority.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Attorney General appearing for the respondent No.4 submits that the Artha Rin Adalat Ain is a special law enacted by the legislature for recovery of the loan money by a speedy trial and that to effect the object of law, section 19(4) of the Ain has been provided by the legislature to have an effectual adjudication by setting aside exparte decree directly in order to avoid delay and for expedite disposal of the suits and that the legislature has put an extra condition in this provision requiring the defendant (judgment-debtor) to deposit 10% of the decretal amount. Therefore, this section itself is not arbitrary.  He further submits that when the judgment debtor deposits 10% of the decretal dues as per section 19(3) of the Ain, the Adalat applies the section 19(4) allowing the same setting aside the ex-parte decree and as such, it has no relation to the service of notice upon the plaintiff. However, the learned Attorney General frankly concedes that when the application for setting aside exparte decree is filed beyond 30 days of passing the decree by introducing the fact as to date of knowledge, the defendant is required to prove it by a fair procedure and the plaintiff deserves a notice in such adjudication like the provisions as provided in Order IX Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) for setting aside the ex-parte decree. Since section 19 has not provided any such provision to serve notice upon the plaintiff decree holder, this Court may suggest the legislature to provide such provision of service of notice to enable the plaintiff decree holder to know about the miscellaneous case. But for want of the provision as to non-service of notice, it can not be said that section 19(4) of the Ain contradicts the Constitution or it violates the principle of natural justice.<br/> <br/>We have gone through the writ petition as well as annexed papers and affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondent No. 4.<br/> <br/>Admittedly, the Artha Rin Suit filed by the petitioner plaintiff was decreed ex-parte on 05.03.2008.<br/> <br/>Section 19 of the Ain enunciates the provisions relating to ex-parte decree and also for setting aside the same. For our better understanding the said provisions are quoted herein below:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“১৯z (১) মামলার শুনানীর জন্য ধার্য কোন তারিখে বিবাদী আদালতে অনুপসিÛত থাকিলে, কিংবা মামলা শুনানীর জন্য গৃহীত হইবার পর ডাকিয়া বিবাদীকে উপসিÛত পাওয়া না গেলে, আদালত মামলা একতরফা সূত্রে নিস্পত্তি করিবে<br/>(২) কোন মামলা একতরফা সূত্রে ডিত্র্রী হইলে, বিবাদী উক্ত একতরফা ডিত্র্রীর তারিখের অথবা <u>উক্ত একতরফা ডিত্র্রী সম্পর্কে অবগত হইবার ৩০ (ত্রিশ) দিবসের মধ্যে, উপ-ধারা(৩) এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে</u>, উক্ত একতরফা ডিত্র্রী রদের জন্য দরখাস¹ করিতে পারিবেনz<br/>(৩) উপ-ধারা (২) এর বিধান অনুযায়ী দরখাস¹ দাখিলের ক্ষেত্রে বিবাদীকে উক্ত দরখাস¹ দাখিলের তারিখের পরবর্তী ১৫ (পনের) দিবসের মধ্যে ডিত্র্রীকৃত অর্থের ১০% এর সমপরিমান টাকা বাদীর দাবীর সেই পরিমানের জন্য স্বীকৃতিস্বরূপ নগদ সংশ্লিষ্ট আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠানে, অথবা জামানতস্বরূপ ব্যাংক ড্রাফট, পে-অর্ডার বা অন্য কোন প্রকার নগদায়নযোগ্য বিনিমেয় দলিল (Negotiable Instrument)  আকারে জামানত হিসাবে আদালতে জমাদান করিতে হইবে<br/>(৪) উপ-ধারা (৩) এর বিধানমতে ডিত্র্রীকৃত অর্থের ১০% এর সমপরিমান টাকা জমাদানের সংগে সংগে দরখাস¹টি মঞ্জুর হইবে, একতরফা ডিত্র্রী রদ হইবে এবং মূল মামলা উহার পূর্বের নম্বর ও নথিতে পুনরুজ্জীবিত হইবে, এবং আদালত এ~ মর্মে একটি আদেশ লিপিবদ্ধ করিবে;  এবং অতঃপর মামলাটি যে পর্যায়ে এক তরফা নিস্পত্তি হইয়াছিল, ঐ পর্যায়ের অব্যবহিত পূর্ববর্তী পর্যায় হইতে পরিচালিত হইবেz<br/>(৫) বিবাদী উপ-ধারা (৩) বিধানমতে ডিত্র্রীকৃত অর্থের ১০% এর সমপরিমান টাকা বাদীর দাবীর সেই পরিমানের জন্য স্বীকৃতিস্বরূপ নগদ সংশ্লিষ্ট আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠানে, অথবা জামানতস্বরূপ ব্যাংক ড্রাফট, পে-অর্ডার বা অন্য কোন প্রকার নগদায়নযোগ্য বিনিমেয় দলিল (Negotiable Instrument) আকারে জামানত হিসাবে আদালতে জমাদান করিতে ব্যর্থ হইলে, উক্ত দরখাস¹টি সরাসরি খারিজ হইবে; এবং আদালত ঐ মর্মে একটি আদেশ লিপিবদ্ধ করিবে<br/>(৬) অর্থ ঋন আদালতে বিচারাধীন কোন মামলা, বাদীর অনুপসিÛতির বা ব্যর্থতা হেতু খারিজ করা যাইবে না, এবং এইরূপ ক্ষেত্রে আদালত, নথিতে উপসÛাপিত কাগজাদি পরীক্ষা করিয়া গুনাগুন বিশ্লেষণে মামলা নিস্পত্তি করিবে” (underlined, emphasis supplied)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On perusal of the aforesaid provisions, it appears that in the absence of defendant, the Adalat can pass exparte decree under section 19(1) of the Ain and that the defendant can also file application under section 19(2) of the Ain to set aside the said exparte decree within 30 days, from the date of passing the said exparte decree or from the date of knowledge about the exparte decree. Moreover, the application has to be filed subject to provision of section 19(3) of the Ain, which requires the defendant to deposit 10% of the decretal dues, within 15 days after filing the aforesaid application. Therefore, it is clear that section 19(2) and 19(3) of the Ain are complementary to each other and has to be read together. As such, to file an application for setting aside exparte decree the required conditions as provided in both the provisions i.e. (sections 19(2) and 19(3) of the Ain), must be complied with. In other words, to file such application the defendant has to satisfy the Adalat about limitation period as per requirement of section 19(2) of the Ain and he is also required to comply with the provision of section 19(3) of the Ain i.e. deposit of 10% of the decretal dues (উপধারা (২) এর বিধান অনুযায়ী দরখাস¹ দাখিলের ক্ষেত্রে বিবাদীকে উক্ত দরখাস¹ দাখিলের তারিখের পরবর্তী ১৫ (পনের) দিবসের মধ্যে ডিত্র্রীকৃত অর্থের ১০% এর| সমপরিমান টাকা -----আদালতে জমাদান করিতে হইবে) and that the Adalat has no scope to consider such application if any of the aforesaid conditions is left in filing the application.<br/> <br/>Section 19(4) of the Ain, though empowers the Adalat to allow the application instantly if the condition provided in section 19(3) of the Ain as to deposit of 10% of the decretal dues is complied with but that application has to be filed within the limitation period as provided under section 19(2) of the Ain and subject to section 19(3) of the Ain. Thus, section 19(4) of the Ain comes into operation if the application is filed in compliance with both the conditions as prescribed in sections 19(2) and 19(3) of the Ain i.e limitation period and deposit of 10% of the decretal dues.<br/> <br/>According to section 19(2) of the Ain the limitation period to file such application has been prescribed in two ways i.e either 30 days from the date of passing exparte decree or 30 days from the date of knowledge about the exparte decree.<br/> <br/>As statutory right under section 19(2) of the Ain, the defendant can file the application to set aside exparte decree within 30 days from the date of said decree and the Adalat can satisfy itself by reckoning the days about the said limitation period. Thus, when the application is filed within 30 days by depositing 10% of the decretal dues, in such circumstances, the Adalat can directly allow the application under section 19(4) of the Ain. Yet, as soon as an order is made setting aside exparte decree, the Adalat shall cause a notice thereof to be served upon the plaintiff at the cost of the defendant so that the revived suit does not proceed unrepresented.<br/> <br/>Under section 19(2) of the Ain, the defendant can also file application for setting aside exparte decree within 30 days from the date of knowledge (<strong>অবগত হইবার ৩০ দিবসের মধ্যে</strong>) about the said decree. But, to exercise such statutory right, the defendant introduces a particular fact as to date of his knowledge about the exparte decree. Question arises, whether in such circumstances, the Adalat can allow the application directly on deposit of 10% of the decretal dues. <br/> <br/>As this right of the defendant is subject to a limitation period of 30 days from the date of his knowledge about the said decree, therefore, it is to be exercised subject to proof about the date of knowledge. Moreover, on pronouncement of exparte decree a legal right has been accrued in favour of the plaintiff (decree holder) and allowing of an application for setting aside the said decree, is curtailing the accrued right of the decree-holder (plaintiff) and as such, natural justice demands that decree holder (plaintiff) should be heard in disposing of the said application so as to fair adjudication of the fact about the correctness of the date of knowledge as alleged by the defendant.<br/> <br/>Though, section 19(2) of the Ain does not expressly prescribe for issuance of any notice upon the decree-holder plaintiff to show cause in determining the correctness of the date of knowledge but it is the established principle of law that even when a statute is silent, notice has to be given if any person is sought to be affected in his right, interest, property or character and to lay this principle the leading cases are Abul A’la Moudoodi Vs. West Pakistan reported in 17 DLR (SC) 209 and the case of Maneka Gandhi Vs. Union of India reported in AIR 1978 (SC) 597.<br/> <br/>The ratio decidendi as laid down in the aforementioned cases has been reflected in the case of Jobon Nahar and others Vs. Bangladesh, through the Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Public Works Department, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and others reported in 49 DLR (HCD) 108 wherein their Lordships held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The principle of natural justice not only applies to Courts but, nowadays more and more it is being applied to administrative process to ensure procedural fairness. In many occasions it has been held by this Court that violation of the principle results in jurisdictional error. <u>The principle of natural justice now extends to any person or body deciding matters affecting the rights and interests of an individual. Following some English decisions, the Courts of this sub-continent have held that the principle of natural justice should be read to have been incorporated in every statute unless it is excluded expressly or by necessary</u> <u>implication by statute</u>. (Abul Ala Moudoodi Vs. West Pakistan 17 DLR (SC) 209)”. (underlined, emphasis supplied)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Therefore, when an application for setting aside the ex-parte decree is filed beyond 30 days from the date of passing the decree and the defendant alleges that he has come within 30 days from the date of his knowledge within the purview of section 19(2) of the Ain, in such situation, the plaintiff has got a right to be informed about hearing of the said application by proper notice and the Adalat on hearing both the parties, shall decide the issue as to correctness of the defendant’s alleged date of knowledge in order to satisfy itself towards compliance of the section 19(2) of the Ain. Thus, in addition to compliance of section 19(3) by depositing 10% of the decretal dues the defendant shall have to satisfy the Adalat that the application has been filed within the limitation period inasmuch as filing of an application under section 19(2) of the Ain is subject to compliance of limitation and the section 19(3) of the Ain. Therefore, on receipt of an application in pursuance of section 19(2) of the Ain, if the Adalat is satisfied that both the conditions of section 19(2) and 19(3) of the Ain, is complied with, it shall allow the said application as per section 19(4) of the Ain.<br/> <br/>Section-19(4) of the Ain provides that on deposit of 10% of the decretal dues the Adalat shall allow the application setting aside the ex-parte decree and the suit shall be restored to its previous file and number. But before that the defendant has to satisfy the Adalat about requirement of section 19(2) of the Ain in the manner as discussed above i.e. whether the defendant filed the application within the limitation period has to be proved and that since section 19(2) of the Ain is subject to section 19(3) of the Ain, therefore, requirement of deposit of 10% of the decretal dues under section 19(3) of the Ain shall also have to be complied with before deciding the limitation period. Thus, it is apparent that unless both the requirements of section 19(2) and 19(3) of the Ain are complied with, the Adalat has no scope to allow the application under section 19(4) of the Ain setting-aside the exparte decree even if the defendant deposits 10% of the decretal dues.<br/> <br/>In view of above discussions as well as the legal position, we are led to hold that section 19(4) of the Ain is mere a operating provision prescribed by the legislature to allow the application for setting aside the exparte decree and to restore the suit to its previous file and number but the said application has to be filed in compliance with the sections 19(2) and 19(3) of the Ain. Therefore, to apply section 19(4) of the Ain, the Adalat has to be satisfied that the application has been filed properly within the limitation period as prescribed in section 19(2) of the Ain and also in compliance with section 19(3) of the Ain (deposit of 10% of the decretal dues) and that in determining such limitation period particularly the correctness of the date of knowledge as per requirement of section 19(2) of the Ain, notice has to be served upon the plaintiff. This requirement as to service of notice is silent in section 19(2) of the Ain and not in section 19(4) of the Ain. In view of legal position, we are not inclined to interfere with the provision of section 19(4) of the Ain because, such interference shall, rather, frustrate the purpose of section 19 of the Ain as a whole to restore a suit decreed exparte to its previous file and number. However, respondent No.1 shall take steps to remove such ambiguity by making necessary amendment of section 19 of the Ain relating to service of notice upon the plaintiff in the light of the observations as made in the body of this judgment. Therefore, the Rule so far as it relates to the vires of section 19(4) of the Ain does not call for any interference.<br/> <br/>In the present case ex-parte decree was passed on 05.03.2008. Section 19(2) of the Ain requires the defendant to file an application for setting aside exparte decree either within 30 days from the date of passing of the said decree or within 30 days from the date of knowledge about the said exparte decree. Admittedly, here in this case the defendant filed the miscellaneous case on 04.06.2008 i.e. beyond 30 days of passing the ex-parte decree and the defendant claims that the miscellaneous case has been filed within 30 days from the date of its knowledge. To establish such claim as to date of knowledge, the defendant has introduced the fact that the defendant was not aware about the ex-parte decree and for the first time it came to know about the said decree on 13.05.2008 and from the said date of knowledge within 30 days the defendant filed the miscellaneous case (application) for setting aside the exparte decree as per sanction of second part of section 19(2) of the Ain. Since the defendant claims that the application has been filed within 30 days from the date of knowledge, therefore, the Adalat has to be satisfied about the said date of knowledge by a proper and fair adjudication, giving an opportunity of being heard to both the plaintiff and the defendant so as to determine the correctness/genuineness of alleged date of knowledge.<br/> <br/>But from the impugned order dated 15.07.2008, it appears that without being satisfied about correctness/genuineness of the alleged date of knowledge, the Adalat allowed the miscellaneous case finding deposit of 10% of the decretal dues which is one of the requirements to file and consider the application for setting aside the ex-parte decree as per section 19 of the Ain inasmuch as, unless the other requirement as to limitation under section 19(2) of the Ain is complied with, the Adalat has no scope to allow the said application, irrespective of the fact that the defendant deposited 10% of the decretal dues.<br/> <br/>In view of the above discussions, we have no hesitation to hold that the Adalat passed the impugned order dated 15.07.2008 without satisfying itself as to requirement of section 19(2) of the Ain and as such, it warrants interference of this Court. Thus, we find merit in part of the Rule.<br/>By the order dated 04.03.2009 passed in Artha Rin Suit No. 174 of 2006, the Adalat rejected petitioner’s misconceived application on point of maintainability as it was filed under section 57 of the Ain for setting aside the order dated 15.07.2008. This order dated 04.03.2009 being rejected on maintainability, has no effect over the main issue of this Rule and as such, it is not necessary to give any decision on this issue.<br/> <br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute in part without any order as to costs.  The impugned order dated 15.07.2008 passed by the Artha Rin Adalat No.3, Dhaka in Miscellaneous Case No. 668 of 2008 is hereby declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect. The Adalat is directed to dispose of the Miscellaneous Case No. 668 of 2008 in the light of the observation as made above.<br/><br/>Communicate the judgment and order to the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 expeditiously for taking necessary steps as per observations of the judgment.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

It was also stated that 0.76 acre of land of C.S. Plot No. 3103, 5.57 acres of C.S. Plot No. 3104 appertaining to C.S. Khatian No. 222 of Mouza Bawnia, 0.44 acres of land of C.S.

Khatian No. 279 in total 11.33 acres all within Mouza Bawnia, Thana Keraniganj (Now Pallabi) District- Dhaka were owned by Kushai Matbar in whose name the said land was correctly recorded in C.S. record. Kushai Matbar died leaving only son Mohan Matbar who transferred the said land to Basanta Kumar Mallik and Tribhanga Mallik by registered deed. Basana Kumar died leaving only son Balai Chandra Mallik and Tribanga Mallik died leaving 3(three) sons namely Bramananda Mallik, Baliram, Mallik, Nipendra Mallik and wife Shayma Mallik, Balai Chandra Mallik and Bramananda Mallik transferred 0.76 acre of C.S.

Thereafter Salim Mia sold the total land of 8 (eight) Pakhi to Mohammad Ali by a registered deed dated 19.9.1958 and delivered possession to him. Mohan Matbar son of Kushai Matbar transferred 2.11 acres of land of C. S. Plot No. 3121 and 3123 to Ashraf Ali who transferred 1.27 acre of land form C.S.

Mohammad Ali died leaving some of the petitioners as his heirs who inherited the said lands and in the last city survey the case lands were recorded in the name of sons and daughters of Mohammad Ali.<br/><br/>It was also stated in the application that the Government acquired 11.33 acres of land of C.S. Plot Nos. 3103, 3104, 3105, 3106, 3107, 3121, in L.A. Case No. 5 of 1972-73. The petitioners filed application to Additional Deputy Commissioner (L.A.) to release the said land from acquisition but no action was taken. Then the petitioners were constrained to institute Title Suit No. 451 of 1978 in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Dhaka and the same was decreed on 22.5.1980, against which neither the concerned department, nor any other authority filed any appeal and further an order of temporary injunction was passed in their favour in respect of the said lands (annexures- A and B).<br/><br/>The petitioner Nos. 1 to 20 are the owners of 11.33 acres of lands of C.S. Plot No. 3101, 3102, 3103, 3104, 3105, 3106, 3107, 3121 and 3123 and the case lands along with other lands were acquired in L.A. Case No. 5 of 1972-73 in favour of National Housing Authority but the case lands were neither utilised for the purpose for which the same were acquired, nor utilized for any other purpose. The petitioners have been living since the time of their predecessors in the case lands peacefully for generations for about 100 years. Although the case lands were acquired by the Government but possession of the case lands were not taken from the petitioners or their predecessors and the original owners did not receive compensation for the case lands. The Government did not disturb the possession of the petitioners for the last 40 years even after acquisition and hence there are homestead, Madrasha, Mondir, family graveyard in the case lands.<br/><br/>The petitioners have full ownership and possession in the said lands and the lands having been recorded in their names. They have mutated their names in respect of case lands and they have been paying rents, taxes and bills in respect thereof. Since the case lands were not utilized by the Government after acquisition the petitioners are entitled to have same released from acquisition in their favour. But in spite of repeated requests and applications the case lands were not released from acquisition. The petitioners have no lands in their names other than the lands acquired by the Government and so the case lands may be released from acquisition in their favour.<br/><br/>The constituted attorney of the petitioner Nos. 1 to 20 filed an application dated 31.05.2009 addressed to the Secretary, Ministry of Land informing that since the paternal property of the petitioners were not utilized for the purpose for which those were acquired and were resumed in khas he prayed for permanent settlement of the case lands in favour of the petitioners according to Government Rules and principles (annexure- C).<br/><br/>The Ministry of land by a Memo being No. i§x jx/n¡-10/A¢d/Y¡L¡-15/2008 dated 6.7.2009 informed the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka that some lands of C.S. Plot Nos. 3101, 3102, 3103, 3104, 3105, 3106, 3107, 3112 and 3123 were acquired in L.A. Case no. 5 of 1972-73 and some lands of C.S. Plot No. 3107 were acquired in L.A. Case No. 13 of 1959-60 which have not been utilized by the requiring body and are lying unutilized. In the said lands there is a mosque and a Madrasha in 0.33 acre of land in C.S. Plot No. 306, so the Deputy Commissioner will resume the land in khas in the light of paragraphs 77 and 78 of land Acquisition Manual 1997 and correct the records. So the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka was requested to take necessary steps to resume the lands (annexure- C-1).<br/><br/>The Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka by Memo No. ­Sx fÐx Y¡x/Hm. H n¡/2010 dated 01.03.2010 informed the Secretary, Ministry of Land that the concerned Land Acquisition Officer, Kanungo and surveyor enquired into the lands and it was found on enquiry that 10.18 acres of land of C.S.

Kala Miah died leaving two wives, 8 sons and 10 daughters. From these heirs of Kala Miah the present respondent Kamrun Naher Begum purchased 2 anas 3 godans and 13 till share and the present appellants purchased the rest 13 anans 16 gondas,3 koras, 2 kranties, 7 till share. Kamrun Nahar Begum-the respondent herein-filed Partition Suit No.86 of 1993 for declaration of title and for partition of her share in the suit property and got a decree on 04.06.2003. In that decree the present appellants also were allotted separate shaham for the rest 13 anas 16 gondas, 3 karas, 2 kranties, 7 till share. The said judgment and decree was upheld upto the High Court Division. Thereafter, the plaintiff of that Title Suit No.86 of 1993 (the respondent herein) filed Miscellaneous Case No.26 of 2006 for buying up the share of the opposite parties (the present appellants) under section 4 of the Partition Act contending, inter-alia, that the property in question was her homestead property and she had been possessing the same with her family members since 1978; that the opposite parties are stranger purchasers and they had no possession in this property. That the petitioner had been possessing the entire property on paying rent, municipal taxes, electricity, WASA and gas bills. The opposite parties are strangers and as such the petitioner was entitled to by up the share of the opposite parties and she was ready to pay the compensation money.<br/> <br/>The opposite party Nos.1 to 3 contested the case by filing written statement contending, inter-alia, that they acquired the major share of about 14 annas in the property in question by three documents dated 30.04.1981 which was earlier then the purchase of the petitioner. That these opposite parties earlier filed Miscell-aneous Case Nos.189 and 190 of 1984 for pre-emption of the land of the petitioner and it went upto Appellate Division and the Appellate Division found that the property fell within Dhanmondi Residential Area and for this reason the pre-emption would not lie.<br/> <br/>The trial court, on consideration of evidence adduced by both the parties and the facts and circumstances dismissed that miscellaneous case under section 4 of the Partition Act finding that the petitioner was not a member of undivided family and heir of Kala Miah and that she was a stranger purchaser and her purchase was subsequent to the purchase of the contesting opposite parties who were major share holders. The revisional court below affirmed this judgment of the trial court. The High Court Division set aside the concurrent findings and decision of the courts below and allowed the miscellaneous case by its impugned judgment and order.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mahmudul Islam, the learned senior Counsel appearing for the appellants has made submissions to the effect that admittedly the petitioner-respondent was not heirs of Kala Miah nor was a member of the family of Kala Miah, but she, admittedly became co-share by virtue of purchase from the heirs of Kala Miah. The learned Counsel has argued that both the courts of facts, on proper appreciation of these facts and circumstances rightly dismissed the case under section 4 of the Partition Act, but the High Court Division without adverting to or reversing the concurrent findings and decision of the courts below most unjustly allowed the case under section 4 of the Partition Act ignoring the fact that none of the elements for attracting operation of section 4 of the Partition Act was present in this case. The learned Counsel has argued that in this case it is an admitted fact that all the members of Kala Miah-the original owner have transferred their entire interest in favour of the petitioner and the respondents and now there is no question of undivided family and that the petitioner, admittedly, being brother’s daughter of one of the wives of Kala Miah-is not a member of Kala Miah’s family and that there is no evidence at all to prove that the petitioner was a member of Kala Miah’s family. The learned Counsel has contended that the High Court Division most unreasonably and unjustly allowed this miscellaneous case under section 4 of the Partition Act by the impugned judgment and order and as such the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mahbubey Alam and Mr. M. A. Quayum, the learned Senior Advocates for the respondent has made submissions supporting the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division. They have made submissions to the effect that the petitioner being brother’s daughter of one of the wives of Kala Miah used to reside in the property in question with the family of Kala Miah and as such her claim under section 4 of the Partition Act cannot be brushed aside.<br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates of both the sides and gone through the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division, those of the revisional court below and the trail court and also the evidence on record.   <br/> <br/>Section 4 of the Partition Act provides:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">”Where a share of a dwelling house belonging to an undivided family has been transferred to a persons who is not a member of such family and such transferee sues for partition, the Court shall, if any member of the family being a share-holder shall undertake to buy the share of such transferee, make a valuation of such share in such manner as it thinks fit and direct the sale of such share to such share-holder, and may give all necessary and proper directions in that behalf.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the above quoted section 4 it is evident, that the elements which must co-exists in order to attract the operation of section 4 of the Partition Act are:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">that the dwelling house should belong to an undivided family,</li><li style="text-align: justify;">that the share thereof should have been transferred to a person who is not a member of such family,</li><li style="text-align: justify;">that the transferee should sue for partition.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Here, in the present case, the main element for attracting section 4 of the Partition Act is absent. There is no existence of any undivided family now,  Admittedly, Kala Miah was the original owner  and possessor of the property in question and he died leaving 2 wives, 8 sons and 10 daughters. Admittedly, all of these heirs of Kala Miah have transferred their entire share in the property in question. It is also an admitted fact that the present appellants purchased about 14 annas share of the property in question from the heirs of Kala Miah before the purchase of 2 annas, 3 gondas and 13 till share by the petitioner respondent Kamrun Nahar Begum. So, admittedly the appellants and opposite party are now owners of the entire property in question and none of these appellants and the opposite party is heir of Kala Miah. So, the question of undivided family now does not arise at all.<br/> <br/>From the side of the petitioner-respondent though some arguments has been advanced to the effect that the petitioner being the brother’s daughter of one of the wives of Kala Miah used to reside in the property in question with the family of Kala Miah and as such she should be treated as the member of family of Kala Miah, but this argument also is not acceptable at all. It might be that the petitioner-respondent Kamrun Nahar Begum used to reside in the house of Kala Miah with his family but where, admittedly, all the heirs of Kala Miah sold out their entire share in the suit property in question, that is the entire property to the petitioner-respondent and the appellants opposite parties, there remains no question of any undivided family now.<br/> <br/>In this case, admittedly, the transferee appellants did not file any suit for partition, rather they, as earlier purchasers, filed pre-emption cases to preempt the land purchased the petitioner-opposite party. So the other element for attracting the operation of section 4 of the Partition Act-that is the transferee should sue for partition-also is absent in this case. <br/>Both the petitioner-respondent and the appellants were stranger purchasers and admittedly the appellants purchased their share before the purchase of the petitioner-respondent. In the circumstances the prayer of the petitioner-respondent for buying up the share of the appellant opposite parties is not entertainable at all.<br/> <br/>It appears that the trail court, on proper appreciation of all the facts and law rightly rejected the case under section 4 of the Partition Act. The revisional court below also, on proper appreciation of the facts and law rightly affirmed this judgment and order of the trial. But it appears that the High Court Division set aside these concurrent findings and decision of the courts below and allowed the case under section 4 of the Partition Act, on making findings to the effect that “the opposite parties are strangers of the suit premises and the petitioner is residing in the suit land.”  Evidently, the High Court Division committed serious wrong and illegality in allowing the case under section 4 of the Partition Act on the above findings. In a case under section 4 of Partition Act the possession of the parties is not at all a necessary factor to be considered. So, the allowance of the prayer for buy off on the ground that the petitioner is in possession of the property in question and the purchaser opposite parties are not in possession-has been most erroneous and illegal. It appears that the learned Judge of the High Court Division, in its impugned judgment, though has quoted section 4 of the Partition Act, but could not appreciate the true purport of this very section.<br/> <br/>However, from the above discussion, it is evident, that the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division cannot be sustained in law.<br/> <br/>In the circumstances this appeal is allowed on contest without any order as to cost. The impugned  judgment and order of the High Court Division is set aside and those of the courts below are hereby affirmed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

A. Aziz Matubber on his conviction under section 302 of the Penal Code awarded by the Judgment dated October 21, 2008 passed in Sessions Case No157 of 2007 arising out of Hizla Police Station Case No. 02 dated July 07, 2007 corresponding to G.R. No. 66 of 2007.<br/>Deceased Monwara Begum shall be described hereinafter as victim of crime Monwara. Convict Abdur Razzak Matubber shall be described as convict-appellant.<br/>The prosecution case, in brief, is that one Md. Habibullah Talukder (P.W.1) lodged a First Information Report, shortly, “FIR” on July 07, 2007 with Hizla Police Station alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that there had an enmity between the victim and the accused Abdur Razzak Matubber who used to steal fruit from the victim Monowara Begum's garden and that the accused also threatened to kill her. The accused Abdur Razzak and the victim Monowara Begum was neighbors. On July 07, 2007 at around 14.15 hours the victim Monowara was going to her family pond to take her bath and when she reached the bank of the pond, accused Razzak started abusing her in filthy language who requested the accused not to use filthy language but the accused continued abusing her. At one stage the accused Razzak stabbed the victim with dao and hit her on the head and other parts of the body. The blows fractured the victim's skull. The accused also inflicted fatal blows on other parts of the body on neck, back and armpit and his mother the victim Monowara, succumbed to her injuries. The informant received Telephonic message and rushed to the place of occurrence and found his mother's dead body.  The local people surrounded the dwelling hut of accused Razzak. He came to learn about the occurrence from his sister Nasima Begum and on the same day he lodged FIR and that the accused was arrested by the Police after filing the case.<br/>On the basis of the aforesaid fact Hizla Police Station case No. 02 dated July 07, 2007 was started under sections 448,302,326,323 and read with section 34 of the Penal Code corresponding to G.R. No. 66 of 2007.<br/>The Investigating Officer took up the case for investigation; he prepared the Inquest Report of the victim in presence of witnesses; he visited the place of occurrence; duly sent the body of the victim to the Forensic Medicine Department of Barishal Shar-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital for post mortem. Post mortem of the victim was performed by one Dr. Md. Habibur Rahman.<br/>Ultimately, on conclusion of investigation the Investigating Officer, submitted charge-sheet against accused Razzak under section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/>Later, the case was duly sent to the learned Sessions Judge, Barisal for trial. Learned Sessions Judge on taking cognizance of the offence against accused Razzak under section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/>Convict Razzak had been placed on trial and charge framed under section 302 of the Penal Code and the charge being read over and explained, the accused Razzak pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Prosecution witnesses were, thereafter examined. After completion of examination of the prosecution witnesses under section 342 of the Cr.P.C he was asked to enter upon his defence, but once again he pleaded not guilty and refused to examine any witness or to submit any document in his defence.<br/>The defence case, as it transpired from the trend of cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, is that the accused Razzak is innocent. Further the defence claim that no such occurrence took place at the time, place and in the manner stated in the FIR.<br/>During the course of trial the prosecution produced as many as 19 witnesses including the Medical Officer and the Investigating Officer. However, the defense did not adduce any defense witness. The Trial Court after considering the evidence and materials on record found the accused Razzak guilty under section 302 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to death by its judgment and order dated October 21, 2008.<br/>Death sentence matter has been referred to this Court by way of a Reference by the Trial Court and the Reference has been noted as Death Reference No. 106 of 2008. Convict  Razzak however, also carried a petition of Appeal being registered as Jail Appeal No. 1005 of 2008.<br/>Death Reference and Jail Appeal are heard together and disposed of by this single judgment.<br/>Mr. Bishmadev Chakrabortty, the learned Deputy Attorney General with Mr. Md. Atiqul Hoque and Mr. Nizamul Haque Nizam, the learned Assistant Attorney General appeared in support of the Reference. While Mr. Md. Hatem Ali, the learned Advocate appeared  in support of Jail Appeal.<br/>Mr. Biswadev Chakraborty, the learned D.A.G submits that the prosecution case being proved to the hilt, the trial court rightly found the condemned prisoner guilty under section 302 of the Penal Code and convicted and sentenced him there under; in view of the barbaric and gruesome manner in which the condemned prisoner Razzak killed the victim Monowara, the trial court rightly awarded him death sentence and as such, the order of conviction and sentence should be maintained and the Death Reference be accepted. <br/>On the other hand, Mr. Md. Hatem Ali, the learned Advocate who took us through the FIR, and the entire evidence on records including the material exhibits and submits that the learned Sessions Judge fell into error of law in convicting convict appellant basing on the statements of the witnesses who are highly interested and relatives of the victim; that the Trial Court erred in law as well as in facts in convicting and sentencing the appellant and as such, the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set aside; that the prosecution could not prove its case beyond all shadow of doubt as such, the Trial Court was not justified in awarding death sentence to the condemned prisoner. He further submits with emphasis that the sentence of death passed upon the accused is extremely harsh and too severe. Death sentence, he added, should not be passed as a routine and this is not a case in which sentence of death is wanted.<br/>Now, in order to appreciate the arguments advanced by the learned Advocates we would now discuss the evidence adduced by the prosecution in this case.<br/>P.W 1 Md.

Abul Hossain deposed that on July 07, 2007 he carried the dead body of victim Monowara for autopsy and he identified the dead body infront of the concerned doctor. He was also a seizure list witness.

He denied the defence suggestion that he did not visit the place of occurrence and held investigation in a perfunctory manner. He denied the defence suggestion that he did not investgate properly.<br/>So, these are the evidences which have been adduced by the prosecution to substantiate the guilt of the convict appellant. On the basis of the evidence this Court is to decide whether the prosecution was able to prove its case beyond all shadow of doubt; whether the impugned judgment and order is tenable in the eye of law and whether the Death Reference deserves acceptance by this Court.<br/>From the evidence on record, it is found  P.W 1, the informant Md. Habib Ullah Talukder, supported the prosecution case in his testimony stating that there was enmity between the victim and the condemned prisoner who used to steal fruit from the victim's  garden and that the convict also threatened to kill the victim. Convict Razzak and the victim Monwara were neighbours. On July 07, 2007 at around 14.15 hours the victim Monowara was going to the family pond to take her bath and when she reached the bank of the pond, convict Razzak started her in filthy language. Monwara requested the convict not to use filthy language but the convict continued doing so. At one stage convict Razzak stabbed her with a dao and hit her on the head and other parts of the body. The blows fractured her skull. He further deposed that the convict also inflicted fatal wounds on her and the victim succumbed to the injuries. He proved the FIR and his signature thereto as exhibits 1 and 1/1 respectively. P.W 2 Asadul Hakim is a neighbour of both the parties. He stated that on July 07, 2007 at around 2.15 p.m. victim Monwara was brutally murdered by convict Razzak. He deposed that after being informed at around 2.45 p.m. he rushed to the place of occurrence and found the dead body of victim Monwara. Convict Razzak was arrested by the police after filing the case. He identified his signature in the Inquest Report as exhibit 2. He proved the seizure list and his signature as exhibits 3 and 3/1 respectively. P.W 3 Nurul Alam Raju deposed that on July 07, 2007 at around 2.30 p.m. on hearing the incident he rushed to the spot and found the dead body of victim Monowara in a pool of blood. He further deposed that police rushed to the spot and arrested convict Razzak with a dao. He proved the Inquest Report, seizure list and his signatures therein as exhibits 2, 2/1, 3 and 3/2 respectively. P.W 4 Mst. Perveen Begum an eye witness of the occurrence deposed that July 07, 2007 at around 2.00 p.m victim Monowara was killed by convict Razzak and the skull of the victim was severely damaged and that she died on the spot. She deposed that local people apprehended convict Razzak and he was arrested by the police. P.W 5 Mst. Millon Tara Bagum an eye witness of the occurrence deposed that she saw convict Razzak attacked victim Monwara with a dao and hit her on the head, hand, back and ribs. P.W 6 Nasima Begum as an eye witness of the occurrence deposed that she saw convict Razzak attacked victim Monwara with a dao and hit her on the head, hand, back and ribs. In her cross-examination denied the defence suggestion that her mother died after falling to the ground with force. P.W 7 Farid Ahmed Fakir stated that the occurrence took place on July 07, 2007 at around 2.20 p.m. and he was working near the spot. He further deposed that on hearing hue and cry he rushed to the spot and found convict Razzak assaulting the victim with a dao and at that time they tried to resist the convict but he threatened them saying that if they proceed to resist him, he would killed them also. He is a witness of Inquest Report and he identified his signature thereto as exhibit 2/3. P.W 8 Anisur Rahman is an eye witness to the occurrence deposed that he saw that convict Razzak stabbed the victim Monwara with a dao and the blows fractured her skull. The victim succumbed to injuries on the spot. P.W 9 Shahid Munshi is an eye witness to occurrence deposed that he saw the accused Razzak assaulting Monwara and stabbing her with a dao and Monwara succumbed to the injuries on the spot. Accused Razzak also inflicted that fatal blows on other parts of her body. They encircled the house of the accused and later the police arrested him. P.W 13 Mst. Jahanara Begum an eye witness to the occurrence deposed in her evidence that on the date of occurrence hearing hue and cry she rushed to the spot and saw the accused Razzak stabbing the victim with a dao. The convict injured her severely and victim Monwara succumbed to injuries on the spot. P.W 14 Alamgir an eye witness to the occurrence stated that on hearing hue and cry the local people rushed to the spot. He saw the convict Razzak kill Monwara with a dao.<br/>From the evidence of the aforesaid prosecution witness, it transpires that the prosecution case finds support in their evidence. The aforesaid witnesses also corroborated the said averment of the FIR stating that convict Razzak killed the victim Monowara with a dao and they are eye witnesses to the murder. They confined convict Razzak in his dwelling hut and within a short time the police came to the place of occurrence and arrested the convict Razzak. P.W 18 Constable Md. Abul Hossain carried the dead body of victim Monwara to the morgue of Barisal Sher-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital for autopsy. The Inquest Report, the Post Mortem Report and the evidence of the PWs 19 and 17 are consistent with each other regarding death of the victim.<br/>It is also found from the materials on record that the death of the victim was due to coma haemorrhage which was caused as a result of injuries which were anti-mortem and homicidal in nature and that it is<em> ex-facie</em> clear that the victim was injured with intention to cause death. There is no extenuating circumstance that may impel this court to take a lenient view and commute the sentence on record for the purpose of commutation of the death sentence.    <br/>We find from the seizure list exhibit 3 ka that 3 pices of blood stained saree, one blood stained petticoat and one blood stained lady's gauze scarf were seized at 18.50 hours on July 10, 2007 at Hizla Police Station. <br/>However, we  put the testimonies of the P.Ws 4,5,6,7,8,9,13 and 14 namely Parveen Begum,  Mst. Milon Tara Begum, Mst. Nasima Begum, Farid Ahmed, Anisur Rahman,  Md. Shaid Munshi, Mst. Jahanara Begum and Alamgir Matubber, the most vital prosecution witnesses, to the closest scrutiny as is required by law and found the same to be quite trustworthy. In expansive, pictorial and graphic evidence of the witnesses, the substantive part touching upon the factum of occurrence, the manner, method and the sequence of it has not been shaken, deviated from or render doubtful in their cross-examination.<br/>On in depth analysis of the evidence of above P.Ws we find that there are virtually no omission, in consisting or contradiction or any material fact concerning the factum and sequence of the offence between the statements made in their examination-in-chief and cross examination. Under the circumstances we must say that such rock-like evidence of the P.Ws, whose evidence are absolutely unshaken by the cross-examination, put the prosecution case on a definite foundation and to discredit them reasonable doubt must be created in our mind based on the evidence on record itself, not on conjectures and surmises. The evidence of the above witnesses have a natural flow. It does not appear to be a labored one. <br/>In a Criminal case, time, place and manner of the occurrence are very vital factors. In the instant case, the vital factors have been brought home to us by the prosecution.<br/>From the discussion, we have no hesitation in holding that the prosecution had succeeded in proving the charge brought against convict Razzak beyond all reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we find convict appellant guilty under section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/>The fact of the case shows that the convict used a heavy and sharp cutting dao and it has been well proved that the convict had inimical relationship with the victim Monowara.<br/>The entire fact of the case shows that the convict appellant brutally killed the victim in the broad day-light and not only that he threatened the local people who tried to resist him. The convict acted with cruelty in committing murder of the victim and in view of the matter we would like to observe that the ends of justice will be met if the convict appellant is awarded the capital punishment i.e the sentence of death.<br/>We therefore, hold beyond doubt that convict Abdur Razzak is the actual perpetrator of murder as he inflicted the fatal blow on the victim causing instant death. This is a premeditated, pre-planned, preconceived and calculated act by the convict Razzak with the intention of causing death of the victim which must come within the bound of clause 1 of Section 300 of the Penal Code and punishable under section 302 of the Code.<br/>By a close study          of the facts, materials on record including evidence, it transpired from the statements of P.Ws. 4,5,6,7,8,9,13 and 14 namely Perveen Begum, Most. Milon Tara Begum, Most. Nasima Begum, Farid Ahmed, Anisur Rahman, Md. Shahid Munshi, Most. Jahanara Begum and Alamgir Matubber specifically and strongly supported the prosecution case in the same voice as eye witnesses of the occurrence. They clearly established that on July 07, 2007 at around 2.20 p.m victim Monowara Begum was killed by the condemned prisoner Abdur Razzak who assaulted the victim with a dao indiscrimi-nately. The aforesaid witnesses also clearly stated that the skull of the victim was severely damaged and that she died on the spot. They corroborated the oral evidence given by each other before the trial court and proved the prosecution case successfully.<br/>P.W. 17 Dr. Habibur Rahman supported the case by proving the injury and cause of death because of the said injuries. P.W 19  Khan Emran Hossain also supported the case by proving the Inquest Report. The chain of evidence against the convict Abdur Razzak is so complete and specific that it does not leave any reasonable doubt in finding him guilty of the charge brought against him.<br/>For all reasons stated above we are constrained to hold that the charge has been proved against the convict Abdur Razzak we do not find any cogent and legal ground to interfere with the judgment and order of conviction and sentence as stated herein before. The appeal, therefore, must fail.<br/>The question posed stands answered in the epithet that Judicial Ruling of conviction and sentence prized upon the convict-appellant are well merited and justified and banner of criminal as well as Divine Justice has been upheld by the delivery of judicious verdict manifesting wisdom and good sense and the Judicial Ruling warrants no interference by this Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.<br/>The impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on 21<sup>st</sup> of October, 2008 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Barisal in Sessions Case No. 157 of 2007 is hereby upheld.<br/>In the result, the death reference No. 106 of 2008 is accepted and the connected Jail Appeal No. 1005 of 2008 is hereby dismissed.<br/>Death sentence in respect of convict Abdur Razzak be executed in the terms noted by learned Sessions Judge, Barisal in his judgment. <br/>Let the lower court records be sent down along with copy of the judgment and order at once.<br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

No. 103 of 2003.<br/> <br/>The prosecution case, in brief, is that one Md. Shamsuddin (P.W.1) brother-in-law of the appellant lodged a First Information Report, shortly, “FIR” on 15.03.2003 with Feni Police Station against the appellant alleging, <em>inter-alia</em>, that about six years ago his youngest sister Ferdous Ara Begum alias Kazal was given into marriage with accused Nizam. She gave birth to two daughters. After her marriage the accused began demanding dowry and pressed her. On 15.03.2003 at around 7.30 A.M.  an unknown driver informed that his sister Kazal had died. On hearing this he along with other members of his family went to the house of the accused and saw dead body of his sister on the floor of the house with her head to north. He also saw the injuries on her the right side of the head and to the side of the face and bleeding cut marks under her ear. The family members of the accused Nizam said that on the night on 14.03.2003, at around 9.30 P.M. Nizam along with his wife and two daughters went to bed for the night and that at around 3.30 A.M. the husband and wife started to quarrel. At one stage accused Nizam hit his wife Kazal on the head and to the right side at her face and fled. While the people of that house were taking her to the Feni Sadar Hospital for treatment she expired. It is mentioned that after marriage the accused pressed her to bring money as dowry from her father and brother to invest in his trade and to go abroad. The informant believes that the accused Nizam had killed Kazal for dowry. Hence the case.   <br/> <br/>On the basis of the aforesaid FIR Feni Police station case No. 13 dated 15.07.2003 was started under section 11(ka) of the Ain, 2000 corresponding to G.R.No.103 of 2003.<br/> <br/>The Investigating Officer took the case for investigation; he visited the place of occurrence and prepared the Inquest Report of the dead body in presence of witnesses. He duly sent the dead body of the deceased to the Forensic Medicine Department of Feni Medical College Hospital for post mortem. Post mortem examination of the victim was performed by Dr. Md. Ayub Ali.<br/> <br/>Ultimately, on conclusion of investigation the Investigating Officer submitted charge-sheet against the accused appellant under section 11(ka) of the Ain, 2000.<br/> <br/>Later, the case was duly sent to the Tribunal for trial. Learned Judge of the Tribunal on taking cognizance of the offence against the accused under section 11(ka) of the Ain, 2000 framed charge against him under the said provision of law. On being read over and explained the charge to the accused he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/> <br/>During the course of trial the prosecution produced as many as 12 witnesses including the Medical Officer and the Investigating Officer. However, the defense but did not adduce any defense witness. The Tribunal after considering the evidence and materials on record found the accused guilty under section 11(Ka) of the Ain, 2000 and sentenced to death by its judgment and order dated 13.03.2008.<br/> <br/>Death sentence matter has been referred to this Court by way of a Reference by Tribunal and the Reference has been noted as Death Reference No. 12 of 2008. Convict Nizam presented a petition of Appeal from Jail which has been numbered as Jail Appeal No. 251 of 2008. He also carried a petition of Appeal being registered as Criminal Appeal No 935 of 2008.<br/> <br/>Death Reference, Jail Appeal and Criminal Appeal are heard together and disposed of by this common judgment.<br/> <br/>Mr. Bishmadev Chakrabortty, learned Deputy Attorney General with Mr. Md. Atiqul Hoque, the learned Assistant Attorney General appeared in support of the Reference. While Mr. A.S.M Abdul Mobin, Advocate with Mr. Mohammad Shafiqur Rahman, learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the condemned-prisoner. Mr. Md. Bahar Uddin-Al-Razi, learned Advocate appeared in support of Jail Appeal.<br/> <br/>Mr. Bishmadev Chakrabortty, the learned DAG, submits that the prosecution had successfully established his case beyond reasonable doubt and that the ingredients of the aforesaid special provision of law having been attracted the Tribunal duly found that the condemned-prisoner had committed the offence as alleged. He also submits that reason to disbelieve the witnesses nor the defence could shake the credibility of the witnesses. The story of the case is clearly suggests the involvement of the convict Nizam with the offence and also by his confessional statement made under section 164 of the Code of the convict in the preparation of the offence. In this regard learned DAG contended that the victim was an innocent village house wife who did not have any enmity with anyone and the defence has also failed to produce any evidence on that count, the alleged occurrence also took place after about six years of the marriage as meted out by the accused. Learned DAG insisted that a close reading of the statement of the P.Ws. and the confessional statement of the accused Nizam proved that he is solely responsible for the murder of victim Kazal. He finally submits that the Tribunal committed no error of law or facts in passing the judgment of conviction and sentence against the convict and, therefore, there is no justifiable reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order passed by the Tribunal.<br/> <br/>Mr. A.S.M. Abdul Mobin, learned Advocate took us through the FIR, and the entire evidence on records, including the materials exhibits and submitted that the Tribunal fell into error of law in finding the accused guilty of the charges levelled against him, for the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. He further submits that the allegation of killing the victim Kazal is not believable and the accused has been implicated by the informant out of suspicion. Considering the same the Tribunal came to its findings merely upon conjectures and surmises, not upon legal evidence on records. The taintive  relationship sought to be proved as a motive of the offence has not been proved by cogent and credible evidence. He further submits with emphasis that the sentence of death passed upon the accused is extremely harsh and too severe. Death sentence, he added, should not be passed as of routine and that this is not a case in which sentence of death is warranted.  <br/> <br/>Informant Shiekh Shamsuddin was examined as P. W.1 who identified the FIR and his sister victim, Ferdous Ara Begum @ Kazal was given into marriage with the appellant about six years ago. She gave birth to two daughters; that after he marriage the accused began demanding dowry and pressed her.

He also saw the injuries on her right side of the head  and to the side of the face and bleeding cut marks under her ear. The family members of the accused Nizam said that on the night of 14.03.2003, at around 9.30 P.M.

Mafzalur Rahman father of the accused in his examination-in-chief stated that on 14.03.2003 at around 3.30 A.M. he heard scream of his daughter-in-law. He along with his wife entered the room and his wife said that his son, accused Nizam had killed their daughter-in-law. She was lying on the bed with injuries on her. Then the accused fled. The victim died on the way to the hospital. The victim had been taken to father’s house and burried there.<br/> <br/>P.W. 7. Ayub Ali Member deposed that he did not see the occurrence, after 3/4 months of the marriage the accused was mad. Before marriage he was sound mined.<br/> <br/>P.W. 8. Md. Anisur Rahman Sub-Inspector of Police deposed that on 15.03.2003 he was with Feni Police station. On the basis of verbal allegation of informant he wrote the FIR and filled up the FIR form and he identified his signature so endorsed thereon was marked as exhibits 2 and 2/1 respectively.  <br/> <br/>P.W. 9. Dr. Md. Ayub Ali deposed that he was the Medical Officer of the Feni Modern Medical College Hospital and he performed the post mortem on 15.03.2003. Constable 525 Delwar Hossain identified dead body of the deceased. He opined that the death was due to heomrrhage and shock which was antemortem and homicidal in nature.<br/> <br/>P.W. 10 A. B. M. Shawkat Iqbal Shahin was the First Class, Magistrate of Feni. He deposed that on 16.03.2003 accused Nizam made confessional statement under section 164 of the Code where he disclosed that he injured the victim Kazal implicating by sharp cut dao for which she had died. The said statement and his signature therein was marked as exhibits 4,4/1,4/2,4/3,4/4 and 4/5 respectively.  <br/> <br/>P.W.11. Constable 976 Delwar Hossain deposed that on 15.03.2003 he was with Feni Police station. He was taken the dead body from her house to Feni Sadar Hospital. He identified c/c and his signature therein was marked as exhibits 5 and 5/1 respectively.<br/> <br/>P.W. 12. Appela Razu Naha in his examination-in-chief stated that on 15.03.2003 Sub Inspector of Police Yeasin Investigating Officer of the case was with Feni Police station who was Known to him. The signature of the said Yeasin was known to him. He identified his signature. He identified the material exhibits I-V and sketch map, index, seizure list and inquest report and his signature therein was marked as exhibits 6,6/1,7,7/1,8,8/1, 9 and 9/1 respectively.<br/> <br/>They were thoroughly cross-examined by the defence but nothing was found to doubt their evidence. Moreover, the convict appellant Nizam made confessional statement under section 164 of the Code (exhibit 5) where he had disclosed that he injured the victim Kazal with sharp dao, for which she had died.<br/> <br/>In the case there is no ocular evidence witnessing the commission of crime by convict-appellant. Prosecution relied upon circumstantial evidence in proof of its case. It is always to be remembered that there is no law that commission of a crime must by witnessed by witnesses and they are to stand in witness box to prove the crime. Commission of crime can be also, well proved by circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is more cogent and convincing than the ocular evidence. It is correctly said that witnesses may tell a lie and it is not difficult to procure false, tutored and biased witness but it was very much difficult to procure circumstantial evidence.<br/> <br/>Prosecution in proof of guilt of offence relied upon the following circumstances:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>First Circumstance:</u> Deceased and convict-appellant were admittedly husband and wife and they lived in the same house at the time of commission of offence. Ordinarily an accused has no obligation to account for the death for which he is placed on trial but in a wife murder case position of law is altogether different. The murder having taken place while the convict-appellant was living with the deceased wife Kazal in the same house, the convict-appellant had an obligation to explain how his wife met with death. From the above, the legitimate conclusion that inevitably flows is that it is the husband convict-appellant who had killed his wife deceased Kazal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>Second Circumstance: </u>Medical evidence: Dr. Ayub Ali (PW 9) found injuries on her right side of the head and to the side of face and bleeding cut marks under her ear. Dr. PW. 9 on extensin dissection there is clotted blood was found after subarachnoid space and subdural space and right eye is protruded out and lacerated and congested right mandice as fructure.  He recorded opinion that the victim died due to hemorrhage and shock which was atemortem and homicidal in nature.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>Third Circumstance:</u> Convict-appellant did not even lodge any information to police station in respect of the death of his wife deceased Kazal or took any medical help for saving the life of the deceased and this conduct speaks volumes against him and inference of guilt of convict-appellant can be easily gathered.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Circumstance noted above do not at all suggest innocence of convict-appellant rather formidably suggest his involvement in the murder of his wife deceased Kazal and all the circumstances taken together unerringly point to guilt of convict-appellant and the irresistible conclusion that flows is that convict-appellant is perpetrator of crime who killed his wife deceased Kazal. <br/> <br/>PW 6 Nurul Hoque had been tendered from prosecution. Cross-examination from the accused person had been declined. PW 1 Md. Shamsuddin and PW 2 Taslima Akter brother and sister of deceased Kazal had given a total go bye to prosecution case when they offered version that no demand of dowry had been put forward by their brother-in-law who is no other than the husband of deceased PW 9 is Doctor who proved Post Mortem Report and gave evidence that deceased Ferdous Ara Kazal died due to hemorrhage and shock which was antemortem and homicidal in nature. P.W 12 Appela Razu Naha Police Personnel who identified the signature of the Investigating Officer, inquest report of the dead body of Kazal, sketch Map, index, seizure list etc. instead of S.I Yeasin who was abroad at the moment serving with the Bangladesh Mission at the United Nations.<br/> <br/>The Tribunal found the husband Nizamuddin guilty of offence of section 11(Ka) of the Ain of 2000 and convicted him thereunder. Consequential sentence was gallows.<br/> <br/>This brings us to a legal aspect of the matter. Convict-appellant stood charged and convicted for offence of section 11(ka) of the Ain of 2000. Section 11(Ka) enjoins that if the husband of a woman or the father, mother, guardian, relations or any other person on behalf of the husband for dowry causes death to a woman or ventures to cause death or causes hurt or have a try to cause hurt that  husband, father, mother, guardian, relation or the person (a) shall stand sentenced to death for causing death or shall stand sentenced to imprisonment for life for mounting endeavor to cause death and in both the counts he shall be, also, liable to pay fine, and (b) shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life for causing hurt or be sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a period not more than fourteen (14) years and less than five (5) years for striving to cause hurt and in both counts shall be liable to fine.<br/> <br/>In order to attract section 11(Ka) it is to be proved that death was caused in view of demand of dowry put forward from the side of husband or father, mother, guardian, or relation of the husband or any person for and on behalf of husband. <br/> <br/>In the case putting forward demand of dowry by convict-appellant could not be proved by legal evidence. PW 1 and PW 2, brother and sister of deceased Kazal, would have been the best witnesses to testify the demand of dowry by convict-appellant but both PW 1 and PW 2 had totally given a go-bye to the prosecution case and betrayed the cause of their own sister who was done to death by convict-appellant.<br/> <br/>This takes us to a legal debate of fundamental character, which is,</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the convict-appellant can be graced with a verdict of acquittal when charge of section 11(Ka) of the Ain of 2000 could not be pressed into service against him.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">When a clear case of murder has been established by the confessional statement recorded under section 164 of the code by the accused and medical evidence against him whether the convict-appellant can be convicted for the offence of murder punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the case is required to be sent back to Tribunal or Court of Sessions for fresh trial. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Section 25 of the Ain of 2000 postulates that Tribunal defined section 2 (Ghha=W) shall be treated as Court of Sessions and Tribunal shall be able to exercise all powers of Sessions Court in holding trial of an offence.<br/> <br/>Section 26 of the Ain of 2000 enshrines that Tribunal so constituted shall be recorded as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal and shall be constituted with one Judge and Judge of Tribunal shall be appointed from amongst District and Sessions Judges to the Government and Government, if necessary, shall appoint any District and Sessions Judge as Tribunal Judge in addition to his charge. Section 20 further enjoins that under the section Additional District and Sessions Judge shall, also, stand included as District and Sessions Judge.<br/> <br/>From the above it becomes manifestly clear that a Tribunal trying a case under the Ain of 2000 is, also, a Court of District and Sessions Judge. When a Judge sits in a Tribunal or Special Tribunal Case holding trial of an offence under a Statute or Special Statute is a Tribunal or Special Tribunal and a Judge when sits in Sessions Case trying an offence punishable under Penal sections of Penal Code sits as Sessions Judge.<br/> <br/>The case in hand, although, tried by a Tribunal constituted under the Ain of 2000 that Tribunal was, also, the Court of sessions. In the judgment learned judge was described as District and Sessions Judge, Fani as well as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat, Feni. Judgment demonstrates that learned District and Sessions Judge had been, also, exercising the power and jurisdiction of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal. Fate of the convict-appellant and result of the case would have been the same whether it would have been tried either as a Nari-O-Shishi case by the Tribunal or as a Sessions case by learned Sessions Judge of Tribunal and if section 11(ka) of The Ain, 2000 was not attracted in respect of convict-appellant, the offence of section 302 of the Penal Code could be very much pressed into service against the convict-appellant and he could be conveniently tried and convicted for offence of section  302 of the Penal Code. <br/> <br/>In <strong><em>Asiman Begum Vs State</em></strong> represented by <strong><em>Deputy Commissioner, 51 DLR(AD) 18</em></strong> the accused-appellant along with 6 others was put on trial before Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Bishesh Adalat, Patuakhali to answer a charge of section 10(1) of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995  in Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 2 of 1996. Accused-appellant was found guilty under the first part of section 304 of the Penal Code and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for four (4) years and, also, a fine of Taka 1,000 in default of payment of fine to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one (1) year more. A single Judge of High Court Division disposing of the Criminal appeal preferred by convict-appellant observed that the trial had been vitiated for want of jurisdiction inasmuch as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Adalat, could only try an offence under the aforesaid Bishesh Bidhan Ain, 1995 and not an offence under The Penal Code, learned Single Judge sent the case back on remand to learned Sessions Judge to try it in accordance with law. Before Appellate Division it was argued from side of accused-appellant that the remand order for trial of the case as a Sessions Case in the particular circumstances of the case will be a mere formality because Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 2 of 1996, although, tried under Bishesh Bidhan Ain, 1995 by a Bishesh Adalat, the presiding officer was no other than the Sessions Judge himself and, as such, it was unlikely that the result would be anything different if the case was tried by him as a Sessions Case. Appellate Division found considerable substance in the submission of learned Advocate for accused-appellant. Appellate Division, thus sent the appeal to High Court Division to consider the case on merit and to pass whatever order or orders it might think appropriate in the interest of justice.<br/> <br/>In <strong><em>State Vs Abul Kalam</em></strong>, <strong><em>5 BLC 230</em></strong> one Abul Kalam stood convicted for offence of section 10(1) of The Ain of 1995 for murder of his wife for dowry by learned Sessions Judge and Special Tribunal No. 1, Noakhali. Consequential sentence was death. Condemned-prisoner preferred Jail appeal and, also, regular Criminal appeal before High Court Division. There had been, also, Death Reference. A Division Bench of High Court Division heard Death Reference, Jail Appeal and Criminal Appeal together and disposed of those by a common Judgment. High Court Division found that there had not been cogent evidence as to committing murder for dowry and no evidence had been led as to the real cause of killing of wife by husband and held that the case did not come under section 10(1) of The Ain of 1995 and the case comes under section 302 of The Penal Code. The High Court Division further held that Sessions Judge, in fact, was the Special Tribunal No. 1 who tried the case and for no fault of the accused the case had been tried as Special Tribunal Case. High Court Division instead of sending the case back for fresh trial under section 302 of The Penal Code by learned Sessions Judge disposed of the appeal. High Court Division altered conviction from section 10(1) of The Ain, 1995 to one under section 302 of Penal Code. Sentence of death was altered to one of imprisonment for life. The High Court Division in rendering decision took into account <strong><em>Asiman Begum vs State, (Supra).</em></strong><br/> <br/>A similar question was, also, considered in <strong><em>Shibu Pada Acharjee Vs. State, 56 DLR 285</em></strong>. In the said case, accused-appellant was convicted for offence of Section 4(c) of The Ordinance of 1983 for commission of rape upon victim Ratna Rani but ingredients of Section 4(c) of the Ordinance of 1983 could not brought home to accused appellant. In the case it had been laid down:<br/> <br/>“To take the prosecution out of Court on a question of technicality, will be a traversity of justice and technicality must bend to cause of justice inasmuch as fact of law is justice”.<br/>Accused appellant can be fastened for offence of section 376 of the Penal Code and conviction under section 4(c) of The Ordinance of 1983 can be altered to one of section 376 of the Penal Code.<br/>In the said case conviction under section 4 (c) of the Ordinace of 1983 was altered to one of section 376 of the Penal Code. <strong><em>Asiman Begum vs State, (Supra) </em></strong>and <strong><em>State Vs Abul Kalam, (Supra</em></strong>) had been, also, discussed considered and meditated in <strong><em>Shibupada Acharjee Vs. State (supra).</em></strong><br/>In the event of sending the case either to Tribunal or Court of Sessions for fresh trial proceeding would be protracted which cannot be allowed in the interest of true dispensation of criminal Justice.<br/> <br/>Since offence of murder is punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code was carried to the door of convict appellant he can be very much convicted for offence of section 302 of the Penal Code and, as such, we convert the offence of section 11(ka) of the Ain of 2000 to offence of section 302 of the Penal Code. Convict appellant, thus stands convicted for offence of section 302 of the Code.<br/> <br/>Legal debate stands solved in the following terms and language:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">Convict appellant can not be graced with a verdict of acquittal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Convict appellant can be convicted for the offence punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Case is not required to be sent either to tribunal or Court of Sessions for fresh trial. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What sentence is to be imposed upon convict-appellant—death or imprisonment for life?</strong><br/>Sentencing discretion on the part of a Judge is the most difficult task to perform. There is no system or procedure in the Criminal Justice administration method or Rule to exercise such discretion. In sentencing process, two important factors come out which shall shape appropriate sentence a. Aggravating factor, and b. Mitigating factor. These two factors control the sentencing process to a great extent. But it is always to be remembered that the object of sentence should be to see that the crime does not go unpunished and the society has the satisfaction that justice has been done and Court responded to the society’s cry for justice. Under section 302 of The Code, though, a discretion has been conferred upon the Court to award two types of sentences, death or imprisonment for life, the discretion is to be exercised in accordance with the fundamental principle of criminal justice.<br/>Convict-appellant is aged about 39 years when he was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Record indicates that convict-appellant is not a hard criminal and he cannot be at all characterised to be a menace to the society. Taking an account of aggravating and mitigating circumstance, we are of this considered view that ends of justice will be met if death sentence is altered to one at imprisonment for life. Convict-appellant thus, stands sentenced to imprisonment for life. Convict-appellant, also, is to pay a fine of Taka 10,000 and in default of payment of fine to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six (6) months more.<br/> <br/>On the premises of the foregoing discussion, the following orders are passed:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">Death Reference No.12 of 2008 is rejected.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Jail Appeal No. 251 of 2008 and Criminal Appeal No. 935 of 2008 stand dismissed with modification of conviction and sentence. Judgment of conviction and sentence dated 13<sup>th</sup> March, 2008 passed by Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat (Tribunal), Feni in Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 38 of 2003 is modified in the epithet that convict-appellant is found guilty of the offence of section 302 of the Penal Code and not for an offence of section 11(ka) of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and conviction for offence of section 11(ka) of The Ain of 2000 is altered to one of section 302 of The Penal Code and death  sentence is altered to one of sentence of imprisonment for life and he is to pay a fine of Tk. 10,000 and in default of payment of fine to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six (6) months more. Out of this awarded sentence the quantum of sentence he has already served out shall be deducted on the application of the provision of section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The period in custody before commencement of Trial and after commencement of Trial be deducted from the total sentence under section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Let a copy of the judgment be sent to the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Feni. The Jail Superintendent, Feni is directed to shift the condemned-prisoner from death cell into the common accommodation for the convict-person.  </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Send down the lower court records at once.<br/><br/>Communicate this order at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The informant heard hue and cry from the west side of his homestead and started going towards the house of his nephew Md. Shahid Miah Master, which was about 100 yards away from his own house. The informant’s neighbours Makhan Miah and Dhanu Miah also accompanied him. Entering into the house of Shahid Miah, the informant found his nephew Shahid Master, aged about 40 years, dead from bullet injuries. He noticed that bullet wounds had been inflicted on the right arm and right ribs of the deceased’s body. The informant, P.W.1 claims to have seen the wife and children of the deceased lamenting his death. However, they informed the informant that the deceased was shot by unidentified persons through one of the open windows of his house.  <br/> <br/>On the basis of the said  information Nabinagar Police Station Case bearing No. 11 dated 30.01.1995 under section 302 of the Penal Code was started which gave rise to G.R. Case No. 168 of 1994.<br/> <br/>After completion of investigation police submitted charge sheet against 5 (five) accused persons including the present respondents under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>The case record was transmitted to the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Brahmanbaria and charges was framed against all the accused persons under section 302/34 of the penal Code which was read over to the accused to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.   <br/> <br/>In order to substantiate the charge against the accused respondents the prosecution in all examined 19 (nineteen) witnesses but the defence examined none.<br/> <br/>After conclusion of examination of the witnesses, the respondents were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure during which they again pleaded their innocence.<br/> <br/>The defence case as it transpires from the trend of cross examination is that the alleged confessional statement of convict-Abul Hashem was not true and voluntary and the same is the outcome of torture of the police, and they have been falsely implicated in the case.   <br/> <br/>After conclusion of trial the learned Additional Sessions Judge by his judgement and order dated 21.06.2001 found the present respondents guilty under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced them to suffer imprisonment for life with a fine of Tk. 10,000/- each, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 6(six) months more.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the said judgement and order of conviction and sentence the respondents as appellant preferred Criminal Appeal No. 3395 of 2001 before the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>By the impugned judgement and order, the High Court Division allowed the appeal setting aside the judgement and order of conviction and sentence passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Brahmanbaria in Sessions case No. 121 of 1996 and acquitted the appellants. <br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the   judgement and order of conviction and sentence passed by the High Court Division the State as petitioner has filed the instant criminal petition for leave to appeal before this Division.  <br/> <br/>Mr. Biswajit Deb Nath, learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that the High Court Division while allowing the appeal failed to appreciate that the Investigating Officer during investigation came to know that at the instance of the accused respondent the victim was killed which was proved by the prosecution witnesses during trial. He further submitted that there is a confessional statement recorded under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which is inculpatory in nature and the prosecution was able to examine direct and corroborative evidence in support of its case considering which the learned Judge of the trial Court convicted and sentenced the accused respondents. He also submitted that the High Court Division misread and misconstrued the facts, circumstances and the evidence on record in allowing the appeal. Lastly, he submitted that the judgement and order passed by the High Court Division clearly shows non-application of judicial mind having failed to consider that in the trial the prosecution was able to prove its case beyond all shadow of doubt mentioning the time, place and manner of occurrence upon examining the independent witnesses, as such the impugned judgement and order calls for interference by this Division.  <br/> <br/>No one has appeared for the respondents.<br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned D.A.G. for the petitioner and perused the impugned judgement and other connected papers on record.<br/> <br/>It appears from the records that the informant PW 1, paternal uncle of the deceased, stated in his cross-examination that he did not see the occurrence and that Ohid Miah, brother of the deceased was present at their home in the night of occurrence and that he, the informant, went to the police station after talking to Ohid Miah. It also appears that the informant did not name any of the accused at the time of lodging the First Information Report (F I R). He further stated that the police came to the place of occurrence immediately after he lodged the F I R and that at that time Ohid Miah was at home. Even at that time, neither Ohid Miah nor the members of the victim’s family mentioned the names of any accused persons.  Ohid Miah, who deposed as PW 5, narrated the story as an eyewitness, naming some of the accused persons. He admitted that he did not name any of the accused persons to the people of the village who came to the place of occurrence, due to fear and that he told his sister-in-law 4/5 days after the occurrence that he recognised two of the accused. The High Court Division observed that save and except Ohid Miah, there was no other eyewitness and that PWs 1, 2, 3 and 6 heard the names of the assailants from Ohid Miah. After elaborate discussion of the evidence, the High Court Division concluded that the belated disclosure of the names of the assailants by PW 5, possibility of embellish-ment and concoction of the prosecution case by the said witness cannot be ruled out and accordingly no reliance was placed on his testimony.<br/> <br/>With regard to the confessional statement of Abul Hashem, the High Court Division observed that it was almost exculpatory. However, from the contents of the confessional statement, it appears to us that the statement is in fact inculpatory. There can be no such classification of a confessional statement as “almost exculpatory”. On the other hand, the fact that the accused was previously taken on remand and did not make any confessional statement and only made the confessional statement after having been taken on remand for the second time, raises doubts about the voluntariness of the confessional statement, especially when the Magistrate who recorded the statement is found to have not made a genuine effort to find out the real character of the confession. The High Court Division noted that the confessional statement was recorded in a very mechanical and casual manner.<br/> <br/>On scrutiny, we find that the High Court division has carefully assessed the evidence and materials on record and has rightly acquitted the respondents.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">We do not find any reason to interfere with the decision of the High Court Division. Accordingly, the criminal petition for leave to appeal is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
