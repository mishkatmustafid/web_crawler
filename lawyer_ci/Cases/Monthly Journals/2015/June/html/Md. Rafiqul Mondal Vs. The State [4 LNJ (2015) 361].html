Abu Zafor Siddique, J:</u></em></strong><br/> <br/>This Jail Appeal is directed against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 27.11.2006 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Nowgoan in Session Case No.115 of 2006 arising out of Niamotpur Police Station Case No.4 dated 10/04/2006 corresponding to G.R. No.36 of 2006 under section 302 of the Penal Code and sentencing the appellant to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Tk.5,000/= in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 1 year more.<br/> <br/>The prosecution case, in short, is that on 10.04.2006 one Zamal, son of deceased Kabari, as informant, lodged an ejahar with Niamathpur Police Station, Nowgong alleging inter alia, that on 18.06.2003 at about 7.00 hours, he came to know that his mother Kabari @ Zahirun died at her 2<sup>nd</sup> husband’s (Rafiqul Islam Mondal) house at Bahadurpur. Thereafter, he rushed to the place of occurrence along with his maternal uncle and other relatives and they saw the dead body. He heard from the local people that accused Md. Rafiqul Islam (husband of the deceased) had killed his mother and was trying to quickly dispose of the dead body, but he opposed. Thereafter, the elder brother of the accused started a U.D. Case with Niamatpur Police Station. The police prepared the inquest report and sent the dead body to the Sadar Hospital, Nowgong for Post Mortem. <br/> <br/>The case was investigated by the police. After investigation, the investigating officer found prima-facie case against the accused-appellant and he submitted charge-sheet against him under section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>After investigation, the case record was transmitted to the learned Sessions Judge Nowgoan for trial and it was registered as Session Case No.115 of 2006. Charge was framed against the convict appellant under section 302 of the Penal Code and the same was read over and explained to him to which he pleaded not guilty and prayed to be tried in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>During trial, the prosecution examined as many as 12 witnesses out of 24 cited witnesses in the charge-sheet, but the defence examined none.<br/> <br/>The defence case, as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, is that the appellant is completely innocent and he has been falsely implicated in the case.<br/> <br/>Considering the facts and circumstances and deposition of the prosecution witnesses and hearing the parties, the trial Court convicted and sentenced the appellant in the manner as already stated above.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentenced, the convict appellant preferred the instant Jail Appeal.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khabir Uddin Bhuiyan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that the learned Session Judge, Nowgoan has misread the evidence on record and misinterpreted the law in passing the judgment and order of conviction which is not tenable in the eye of law. He further submits that the convict appellant is innocent and he has been falsely implicated with the case out of enmity. He next submits that not a single independent witness has supported the prosecution case. Thus, the prosecution has failed to proved the allegations against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. He therefore, prayed that the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence be set-aside.<br/> <br/>Mr. Kazi Ebadat Hossain, the learned Assistant Attorney General appearing on behalf of the state, has supported the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 27.11.2006. He submits that the alleged offence has been proved by the witnesses by adducing corroborative evidence.<br/> <br/>Moreover, in the opinion of doctor “the cause of death of the deceased was due to asphyxia as a result of strangulation which is anti-mortem and homicidal in nature.” He next submits that the prosecution has been able to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubt, and as such, the appeal is liable to dismissed.<br/> <br/>We have considered the argument advanced by the learned Advocates of the both sides and perused the memorandum of Jail Appeal, impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence of the trial court, evidence on record and the relevant papers in the L.C.R.<br/> <br/>Let us now discuss the relevant evidence and others material on record.<br/> <br/>P.W.-1 Md.

It appears that while examining the appellant under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the Court properly disclosed the available evidence against the appellant who were present in the dock. In reply, the accused persons claimed to be not guilty of the offence and demanded to be tried in accordance with law.<br/><br/>Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is based on the principle “<em><u>audi alteram partem” that is no one should be condemned unheard</u>.</em> It is the utmost duty of the Court of law to give an opportunity to an accused to defend himself. The real object of section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is inviting the attention of the accused-person to the points raised in the evidence which are against him for which he may be convicted. So, it is clear from the record that the accused-person have been given a good chance to offer their explanation as to those.<br/><br/>We have scrutinized the depositions of the prosecution witnesses along with the materials on record with attending facts and circumstances of this case in our own way to ascertain whether the trial court committed any illegality in passing of the impugned judgment.<br/><br/>It appears that- P.W.-1, stated ঘটনাসহলে গিয়ে তার মায়ের শরীরের যখমের চিহু দেখে ও মায়ের কান দিয়ে রত্তু বের হতে দেখিয়াছে। আসামী রফিকুল কবর খুঁড়ে তড়িঘরি করিয়া তাহার মায়ের মরদেহ কবরসহ করিতে যাচ্ছিল। সে বাঁধা দেয় এবং থানায় খবর দেয়। P.W.-2 stated that- মৃত. কবরীর মাথা দিয়ে রত্তু বের হচ্ছে। P.W.-9 deposed that- “মৃতার কান দিয়ে রত্তু বের হয়েছে ও তাকে মেরে ফেলা হয়েছে শুনি। P.W.-11 is the medical officer of the concern medical board and he has proved the postmortem report given by them and he has also proved their opinion. “The cause of death of the deceased was due to asphyxia as a result of strangulation which is ante-mortem and homicidal in nature.” P.W.-12, investigating officer of this case. After his investigation having found a prima-facie case he submitted charge-sheet against the appellant under section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the appellant has tried to raise a question that since the witnesses are the close relatives and neighbours of the deceased, they are the interested witness of this case.<br/> <br/>On the question of interested witnesses, we have considered the case of Yogeshwar Gope -Vs.- State, reported in 58 DLR (AD) 73, wherein the Apex Court held that;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>''Only because of relationship of witnesses evidence connot be thrown away unless the evidence is found to be untrue or tainted by motive.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>We have also taken notice of the views expressed in the case of Tungo Veskata Krishnaiah –Vs.- State of Andra Prodesh (1985)29 ML.Jr(Cr) 130, at page 140-141(AP) which run as follow:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Where a witness is a natural witness to the occurrence and her evidence is consistent and it inspires confidence to accept her evidence to be truthful, her evidence alone is sufficient to base conviction.”</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">We are respectfully relying upon the views noted above. We have not found, upon scrutiny of the evidence and the materials on record, anything to show any motive or intention on the part of the prosecution witnesses to falsely implicate the appellant in this case, rather, we find strong circumstantial evidence. All the P.Ws. are natural witnesses and their evidences are consistent and inspires confidence in our mind to be accepted as truthful. Their evidence had also been corroborated by the informant. As such, we do not find any substance in the submission of the learned Advocate for the appellant. On the other hand, we find that the prosecution witnesses have been able to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The medical report also has supported the prosecution story.<br/><br/>We have also taken notice of the views expressed in the case of Sheik Muksed Ali -Vs.- The State reported in 10 M.L.R. (AD) 27, which run as follow:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“When it is established that the husband and his deceased wife were residing in the same house at the time of the occurrence the husband owes an </em><em>obligation to explain the circumstance under which his wife died. When the explanation so offered is proved false and the victim is found to have died due to injuries which were ante mortem and homicidal in nature, the conviction and sentence of the convict husband is held by the apex court to be perfectly justified.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Considering the fact and circumstances of the case, we are of the  view that the trial Court has rightly found the accused-appellant guilty of murder as charged as per section 302 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to imprisonment for life and a fine of Tk.5,000/-.<br/><br/>Therefore, we do not find any illegality in the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 27.11.2006 and consequently, it does not call for any interference by this Court.<br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is dismissed.<br/><br/>The order of conviction and sentence dated 27.11.2006 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Nowgaon in Session Case No.115 of 2006, arising out of Niamotpur P.S. Case No.4 dated 10.4.2006, corresponding to G.R. No.36 of 2006 is hereby affirmed.<br/><br/>Send down the lower Court records to the concerned Court along with a copy of the judgment at-once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
