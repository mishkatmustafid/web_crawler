K. M. Zahirul Hoque, J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This Rule was issued calling upon the opposite party to show cause as to why the impugned judgment and order dated 06.09.2006 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Court No. 1, Satkhira in Criminal Appeal No. 33 of 2004 affirming the judgment and order dated 12.05.2006 passed by the Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class, Satkhira in C. R. Case No. 136 of 1999 corresponding to T. R. No. 809 of 2003 acquitting the opposite party No. 1 from the charge under section 406 and 420 of the Penal Code should not be set aside and/or such other or further order orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/> <br/>The prosecution case in short is that the petitioner filed a petition of complaint on 21.03.1999 being C. R. Case No. 136 of 1999 under section 406 and 420 of the Penal Code (corresponding to T. R. No. 809 of 2003) in the Court of Cognizance Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class having jurisdiction at Satkhira, (District-Satkhira) alleging inter-alia that the accused opposite party No. 1 being prior known person with friendly understanding to the complainant petitioner, asked him (petitioner) for loan of cash Tk. 2,50,000/- for his fish businesses and the complainant petitioner in good faith agreed to give Tk. 2,10,000/- and subsequently gave him the said amount on 15.12.997. On which date in return, the accused falsely with ill motive issued two cheques being Nos. <sup>NL/</sup>10 49994517 and <sup>NL/</sup>10 49994518 from his cheque book No. 259/1 for Tk. 1,30,000/- and Tk. 80,000/- (total 1,30,000+80,000=Tk. 2,10,000/-) respectively competent to the encash on 30.10.1998. Subsequently, the accused opposite party No. 1 asked the complainant petitioner for extention of time which he allowed and accordingly letter on sought for encashment of the cheque of Tk. 1,30,000/- and on 01.02.1999, 17.02.1999 and 28.02.1999 and the cheque of Tk. 80,000/- on 07.03.1999 respectively were deposited for encashment and the said cheques were dishonored for want of sufficient fund from the Bank. Hence the case under section 406 and 420 of the Penal Code against the accused opposite party No. 1.<br/> <br/>In course of trial the trial Court framed charge against the accused under section 406 and 420 of the Penal Code. The complainant petitioner examined five eye-witnesses as P. Ws and while the accused examined none.<br/> <br/>After trial the Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class, passed the judgment and order by acquitting the accused under section 245(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On appeal by complainant being Criminal Appeal No. 33 of 2006 the appellate Court affirmed the judgment and order of the trial Court thereby dismissed the appeal in his judgment and order dated 06.09.2006.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“অাসামী উক্ত টাকা পরিশোধ না করিয়া থাকিলে বাদীপক্ষ উপযুক্ত আদালতে দেওয়ানী মামলা দায়ের করিয়া প্রতিকার প্রার্থনা করিতে পারিবেনz”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 06.09.2006 the petitioner filed this a revisional application under Section 439 read with Section 435 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Helal, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner after drawing our attention upon the petition of complaint as well as evidences as led by the complainant including the relevant law submits that the opposite party entrusted the money amounting to Tk. 2,10,000/-(two lacs and ten thousand) and thereby intentionally misappro-priate the same and that charges have well proved by the prosecution by adducing impartial, reliable and corroborative witnesses but the Court of trial as well as Court of appeal below without considering those materials as well as legal aspect came to a wrong and illegal finding by acquitting the accused opposite party from the charges which cannot be sustained in the eye of law. He further drawing our attention of the judgment of the Courts of appeal below that who relied upon some photostat copy of cheques as filed by the opposite party No. 1 and found that the accused opposite party repaid Tk. 1,95,000/- in different dates and since the said photstate copy cannot be treated as a legal evidence within the meaning of Evidence Act and thereby the findings of the Court below is apparently wrong and misconception of law and thereby the impugned judgment is also illegal and liable to be set aside. He further submits that the Court below also found that the transaction was made as a business transaction between the parties but fact remains there is no any materials on record to show that the said transaction was made for businesses purpose therefore the findings in respect of business transaction of the Court below is also erroneous and result of misreading of the evidence on record and thus committed an illegal and wrong decision which is liable to be set aside. He lastly submits that the court below also committed erred in law in passing the impugned judgment and order by misconce-ption of relevant law.<br/> <br/>Mr. Muhammad Shahidul Islam, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite party No. 1 submits that the complainant failed to prove the charge against the accused opposite party and thereby the Court below rightly and properly acquitted the accused-opposite party from the charges. He further submits that the transaction was business one therefore no criminal offence has been committed by the accused opposite party and if anything has been disclosed about transaction which is termed as business transaction and for that reason opposite party No. 1 might be committed civil liability not any criminal liability. Thus the impugned judgment is legal and proper one and as such the instant Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/>Mr. Sheikh A. K. M. Moniruzzaman, (Kabir) the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the opposite party adopted the submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/> <br/>Heard the learned Advocate of both the sides, perused the materials on record including the petition of complaint, deposition of witnesses alongwith other materials on records. For proper and effective adjudication of the matter we should discuss about the petition of complaint first than the evidences as led by parties and thus the relevant portion of petition of complaint of the petitioner is as under,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“আমি সাতক্ষীরা শহরের হক ষ্টোরের কর্মচারী হিসাবে নিয়োজিত থাকাকালে আসামী উক্ত দোকানের মালিকের নিকট প্রায়ই আসা যাওয়া করিত সেই সুবাদে বহু পূর্ব হইতে আসামীর সহিত পরিচয় সুসম্পর্ক গড়িয়া উঠেz পরবর্তীতে আমি স্বাধীন ভাবে ষ্টেশনারি মালামালের ব্যবসা করাকালীন আসামীর সহিত আমার সুসম্পর্ক বজায় ছিল<br/>এমতাবসÛায় গত ১ম ঘটনার তারিখ অর্থ্যাৎ ১৫/১২/৯৭ তারিখে আমার নিকট আসিয়া মাছের ব্যবসা করিবে বলিয়া এবং ঘের ভেড়ীর প্রয়োজনের কথা জানইয়া ঋণ হিসাবে আমার নিকট হইতে নগদ ২,৫০,০০০/= (আড়াই লক্ষ) টাকা দাবী করেz গৃহীত টাকা মাস দশকের মধ্যে ২ কিসি¹তে পরিশোধ করিবে বলিয়া অংগীকার করে কি অাসামীর দাবী অনুযায়ী সমুদয় টাকা না থাকায় আমি তাহাকে সাতক্ষীরা শহরে পাকা পুলের মাথায় অবসিত নিউ গুলশান নামক দোকানে বসিয়া প্রথম ঘটনার তারিখে ও সময় অনুমান ১০/১০|৩০ ঘটিকার সময় আসামীকে নগদ ২,১০,০০০/= (দুই লক্ষ দশ হাজার) টাকা প্রদান করিলে আসামী নিজ হাতে উক্ত টাকা গননা করিয়া নেয়z টাকা বুঝিয়া লইয়া আসামী তাহার চামড়ার হাত ব্যাগ হইতে আসামীর নিজ নামীয় ও পরিচালিত পারুলিয়া সোনালী ব্যাংকের চলতি হিসাব নং ২৫৯/১ এর একটি চেক বই বাহির করিয়া দুই কিসি¹তে পরিশোধের অংগীকারে <sup>গক/</sup>১০ ৪৯৯৯৪৫১৭ চেকে ১,৩০,০০০/= (এক লক্ষ ত্রিশ হাজার) টাকা ৩০/৮/৯৮ তারিখে এবং <sup>গক/</sup>১০ ৪৯৯৯৪৫১৮ নম্বরে চেকে ৮০,০০০/= (আশি হাজার) টাকা ৩০/১০/৯৮ তারিখে পরিশোধ যোগ্য হিসাবে চেক দুইটিতে আসামী তাহার নিজ নাম স্বাক্ষর পূর্বক আমার বরাবরে পরিশোধ যোগ্য হিসাবে আমার নাম উল্লেখ করিয়া বর্ণিত তারিখ লিখিয়া চেক ২টি আমার নিকট প্রদান করিয়া আসামী টাকা লইয়া চলিয়া যায়<br/>পরবর্তীতে নির্দিষ্ট সময়ে অতিবাহিত হওয়ার পর আসামীর ব্যবসায়িক অসুবিধার কথা জানাইয়া চেক দুইটি কিছুদিন পরে ব্যাংকে জমা করিয়া ক্যাশ করার জন্য অনুরোধ করিলে সেই মোতাবেক ১,৩০,০০০/= (এক লক্ষ ত্রিশ হাজার) টাকার চেকটি সংশ্লিষ্ট ব্যাংকে ইং ০১/০২/৯৯, ১৭/২/৯৯ এবং ২৮/০২/৯৯ তারিখে এবং ৮০,০০০/= (আশি হাজার) টাকার চেকটি সংশ্লিষ্ট ব্যাংকে ০৭/০৩/৯৯ তারিখে ক্যাশে পরিনত করার জন্য জমা প্রদান করিলে আসামীর নামীয় একাউন্টে চেক দুইটিতে উল্লেখিত পরিমান টাকা না থাকায় প্রতিবারই চেক গুলো ডিজঅনার হয়z<br/>পরবর্তীতে আসামীর অংগীকার অনুযায়ী টাকা না পাইয়া এবং ব্যাংক কর্তৃপক্ষ হইতে চেক ডিজঅনার হওয়ায় গত সেব ঘটনার অর্থ্যাৎ ইংরাজী ১৭/০৩/৯৯ তারিখে অনুমান ৪/৪|৩০ ঘটিকায় কতক স্বাক্ষী সহ আসামীর বাড়ী (হাল ঠিকানা) যাইয়া তাহাকে দেখা পাইয়া আমার নিকট হইতে ঋণ হিসাবে গৃহিত নগদ ২,১০,০০০/= (দুই লক্ষ দশ হাজার) টাকা পরিশোধ করিয়া দেওয়ার জন্য বলিলে আসামী বিভিন্ন প্রকার টাল বাহানা মূলক কথাবার্তার এক পর্যায়ে উত্তেজিত হইয়া আমার কোন টাকাই সে পরিশোধ করিবে না বলিয়া আমাকে হাকাইয়া দেয়”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears from the petition of complaint in where mentioning specific date as 15.12.1997 the accused made a request to the complaint for cash Tk. 250000/- for the necessity of business of the accused opposite party No. 1 along with a oral promise to back the same amount by next 10 months in two installments. Thereafter on good faith the complainant gave Tk. 210000/- on 15.12.1997 at 10/10½ an hours on setting at a shop he gave Tk. 210000/- in cash to the accused opposite party who took the same as cash and issued 2 cheques in favour of him for the said amount as per his oral assurance but the complainant did not get back his money neither his assurance nor by the said cheques and hence the case. Thus we find that the petition of complaint itself disclosed the criminal offence of cheating and misappropriation of money by way of breach of trust.   <br/> <br/>Subsequently the trial Court framed the charge against the accused-opposite party No. 1 under section 406 and 420 of the Penal Code accordingly.<br/> <br/>During the course of Trial the complainant Md. Abdul Kader was examined as P. W. 1 who stated in his deposition to the effect that;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“আমি বাদী আসামী গফফার সানা গত ১৫/১২/৯৭ তাং বেলা ১০|০০টার সময় সাতক্ষীরা পাকা পুলের মোড়ে নিউ গুলশান দোকানে আসামী নগদ ২,১০,০০০/- টাকা দেই আসামীকে ব্যবসার জন্য দেই আসামী ঐ তারিখেই আসামী পারুলিয়া সোনালী বাংক শাখায় ১,৩০,০০০/-টাকার চেক এবং অপরটি ৮০,০০০/-চেক দেয়z চেক নিয়ে আমি ব্যাংকে গেলে চেকটি ব্যাংক হতে ডিজঅনার হয়z ১/২/৯৯, ১৫/২/৯৯ ও ২৮/২/৯৯ তাং ১,৩০,০০০/- টি ব্যাংক হতে ডিজঅনার হ|যz ৭/৩/৯৯ তাং ৮০,০০০/-চেকটি ব্যাংক হতে ডিজঅনার হয়z ১৭/৩/৯৯ তাং বিকাল ৪/৪|৩০টার সময় এ্যাডঃ মোস্তাফিজুর রহমানকে নিয়ে আসামীর বাড়ী যাইz সেদিন আসামী গালাগালি করে টাকা দিবেনা বলে হাকিয়ে দেয়”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>That is the P. W. 1 stated in his chief that on 15.12.1997 at 10.30 am he gave Tk. 2,10,000/- to the accused near crossing of pucca School in the shop of New Gulshan.<br/> <br/>In his cross-examination on behalf of the accused-opposite party he denied the suggestion that the accused-opposite party repaid the amount of Tk. 1,95,000/- in different dates to the complainant, so the complainant deposed before the Court on oath by mentioning time, place and manner of occurrence by corroborating the petition of complaint and the payment was made in presence of P.W.2 and P.W.3. But subsequently the opposite party No. 1 denied to repay the said amount on 17.03.1999 in pursuance of P.W.2.<br/> <br/>P. W. 2, Advocate Mustafizur Rahman, who stated in his deposition that on the request of the accused the complainant gave Tk. 2,10,000/- to the accused seating at the shop of P.W.3 in where the P.W.3 were present and also stated that the accused received the money by issuing two cheques and the accused promised to give back the said money within 8/9 months but he did not do so. Thereafter on 17.03.1999 at 4/4.30 pm he along with the P.W.1 went to the house of accused by his own motorcycle, in where the accused denied to repay the said money to the complainant.<br/> <br/>He was cross-examined by the defence and denied the suggestion of the defence.<br/> <br/>P. W. 3, Sheikh A. Aziz, who is the owner of New Gulshan shop and he stated that he knows the complainant and accused. He also stated that in 1997 on sitting at his shop the complainant gave Tk. 2,10,000 to the accused but he did not remember that date thereafter he heard that the accused did not repay the said money.<br/> <br/>He was cross-examined by the defence and further stated that the complainant informed him that the accused did not repay his money.<br/> <br/>P. W. 4, Aktarul Karim Lablu, who stated in his deposition that in 1997 sitting on the New Gulshan shop at 10/10.30 the complainant gave Tk. 2,10,000/- and he also stated that the accused gave two cheques to the complainant.<br/> <br/>He was cross-examined and denied the suggestion of the defence rather he stated that the informant informed him that the accused did not repay the money.<br/> <br/>P. W. 5 Akbar Ali Gazi, was tendered and cross-examination was declined by the defence.<br/> <br/>The defence examined none. However it appears form the trained of cross examination of the prosecution witnesses the defence case was that the accused opposite party admitted to take the said amount from the complainant but he took an alibi that he repaid TK. 195000/- through deferent cheques.<br/> <br/>On careful examination of the evidences as well as petition of complainant it appears that the complainant filed the petition of complaint with the allegation that Tk. 2,10,000/-(two lac ten thousand) has taken by the accused-opposite party on 15.12.1997 at 10.30 A.M. by sitting in the shop of Abdul Aziz at New Gulshan within the district of Satkhira and this material fact was  by the complainant P.W.1 and which also corrobo-rated by P.Ws 2 and 3 by their evidences. P. W. 2 is an Advocate and P. W. 3 is the shop owner namely Abdul Aziz and in their cross-examination nothing was recovered or discovered by the accused-opposite party. So their Evidence cannot be said as unbelievable. It further appears that the accused-opposite party was not denied in any point of time that he did not take the said amount and it was also  not denied that he did not issue the cheques as alleged by the complainant. It further appears that on the second date of occurrence i. e. on 17.03.1999 at 4/4.30 P.M. the informant along with P. W. 2 went to the house of the accused-opposite party in where he refused to repay the said amount to the complainant and these material fact also corroborated by P. W. 2 with the evidence of P. W. 1, D. W. 2 is an advocate and he has not relation with P.W. 1. Thus he is a dignified impartial person. It also appears from the evidence of P.Ws 2-4 that they also supported and corroborated the evidence of P. W. 1 the complainant that the accused opposite party was also refused to pay the said money on 17.03.1999. It further appears from the trained of the cross-examination of the accused-opposite party that he did not deny to take the money from the P. W. 1 and also admitted about the issuance of cheques in favour of the P. W. 1. But the accused took an alibi that he repaid Tk. 1,95,000/- prior to the period of 2<sup>nd</sup> occurrence. But the said alibi of the defence was denied by the complainant. The cardinal principle of law that the prosecution must prove the charge beyond the reasonable doubt against the accused of his guilt. But when alibi is taken by the accused that he repaid the amount of Tk. 1,95,000/- to the complainant in such circumstances  the accused opposite party is required to prove the said fact of alibi. It appears from the records that only a suggestion was offered to the complainant P.W.1 without giving any specific suggestion by mentioning time, place and manner of repayment the said amount to the P.W.1 though the same was denied by P.W.1 and nothing is a available to us for consideration of the said plea of alibi of the accused opposite party and no attempt was made by the accused to prove the  said alibi of the accused-opposite party. It also appears from the judgment of the Courts below that both the Courts below found that the transaction was made for the purpose of business but it appears from the petition of complaint as well as deposition of P. W. 1 that transaction was not made for the purpose of business but it was the assertion of the petition of complaint that he was requested for the money by the accused due to necessity of the business of the accused alone and also for cultivation of fish (Beri Gher) of the accused opposite party.<br/> <br/>The contention of the petition of complainant to the effect that;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“এমতাবসয় গত ১ম ঘটনার তারিখ অর্থ্যাৎ ১৫/১২/৯৭ তারিখে আমার নিকট আসিয়া মাছের ব্যবসা করিবে বলিয়া এবং ঘের ভেড়ীর প্রয়োজনের কথা জানইয়া ঋণ হিসাবে আমার নিকট হইতে নগদ ২,৫০,০০০/= (আড়াই লক্ষ) টাকা দাবী করেz”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is the assertion of the accused-opposite party for his necessity money was taken as disclosed in the petition of complaint but the same assertion can not be said the same was taken for the business transaction of the parties and in where the complainant is not a party in the business with the accused opposite party. Moreover, the deposition of P. W. 1 did not disclose any such assertion thus the transaction was not made for business purpose of the parties.<br/> <br/>It appears from the judgment of the Courts below in where the trial Court as well as the appellate Court found that some photo copies of the cheques were submitted by the accused opposite party by way of firisty.  In pursuance of that photo copies of cheques the lower appellate Court found that the accused-opposite party made repayment to the complainant but that Photostat copy was not filed in support of the statement of the accused opposite party in his examination under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the said photocopies of the documents are not evidence within the meaning of Evidence Act. Therefore, consideration of the said photocopies and reliance of that photo copy is totally baseless. So, the findings of the trial Court including the lower appellate Court to that effect can not be sustained in the eye of law.<br/> <br/>It further appears from the record as well as conduct of the opposite party No. 1 itself shows that he took the money from the complainant on the date of occurrence in presence of P.Ws 2 and 3 and subsequently refused to pay the same in presence of P. W. 2 and most intentionally issued two cheques by mentioning two dates and which were not honoured by the bank. Subsequently on trial he took a plea of alibi that he paid more than that which amounting of Tk. 1,95,000/- in different dates to P.W.1 complainant. The said alibi of the defence was not admitted by the compliant P.W.1. Even no explanation was made by the accused opposite party in support of his documents at the time of his examination under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Thus the same can not be considered by any courts of law. Since the opposite party took plea that he repaid the enter amount to the complainant therefore he admitted that he took money amounting Tk. 2,10,000/- from the complaint as alleged by him and that materials fact also proved by the complainant (P.W.1) by adducing reliable and believable evideneces as P. Ws. 2, 4 who corroborated with the evidence of P. W. 1. We have considered the evidences of complainant P. W. 1 along with other P. Ws and found that the accused opposite party with a criminal intention by way of cheating could able to take Tk. 2,10,000/- from the complainant as well as in his deposition  by mentioning date and place as also mentioned by the complainant in the petition of complaint and by the fact of misappropriation of said money by deceitful meaning with a criminal intention has well proved by the complainant. But the Court below failed to consider this legal aspect and erred in law thus occasioning a miscarriage of justice. (We also find that as the allegations made in the petition of complaint and which is supported and corroborated by the P. Ws 1 to 4.) As the money was taken by the accused opposite party No. 1 in presence of the witnesses examined as P. Ws. 2-4 from the complainant P. W. 1 after giving a specific promise of returning it within a specified time within 10 (ten) months by issuance of cheques constituted faith upon the complainant to give the money to the opposite party No. 1 and accordingly payment was made. But no repayment was made as per the promise or act of the opposite party No. 1 and refused to repay in the specific date well proved by the prosecution that the opposite party No. 1 with an intention by way of cheat misappropriate the money from the complainant P. W. 1. While taking of money from the complainant P. W. 1 with a promise to returning the same and that act of the opposite party was followed by cheques are admitted by the opposite party No. 1 in that case the burden of proof lies upon him to prove that he returned the said money in time to the complainant P.W.1 but in the case the opposite party No. 1 failed to prove also failed to give explanation the same.

Said Roushan Ara Khatun while in peaceful possession and enjoyment of the property entered into an agreement with the petitioner to sell the property for TK= 2,00,000/= (Taka Two Lac). Thereafter, said Roushan Ara Khatun obtained permission from the Government to sell the property to the petitioner vide a Memo dated 26.06.1985 and transferred the property to the petitioner vide Registered Deeds No. 17161 dated 01.08.1985 and 17376 dated 05.08.1985 respectively and delivered possession to the petitioner on 04.08.1985.<br/> <br/>After purchase as aforesaid the petitioner got her name mutated in the Housing Department as evident from memo dated 04.09.1985 issued by the Assistant Commissioner, settlement and paid rent regularly to the Government.<br/> <br/>Thereafter, the petitioner has constructed a five-storied building upon taking loan from the House Building Finance Corporation and obtaining Building construction plan from Dhaka Improvement Trust (now RAJUK) with the written consent of the Settlement Department given vide its memo dated 29.10.1985.<br/> <br/>Predicated on the above facts, the petitioner contends that the property in question was never treated as abandoned nor it could be so treated. It is also asserted that the petitioner through her vendor has been continuously possessing the property which is evident from an inquiry report dated 16.03.1985 submitted by one Nurul Alam, Administrative Officer, Mohammedpur Housing Estate, Dhaka. Given that no notice under Section 5(1) (b) of the Abandoned Building (Supplementary Provisions) Ordinance, 1985 (Ordinance No. LIV of 1985) (“Ordinance”) was issued to the petitioner regarding inclusion of the property in “Ka” list of the abandoned buildings, it is further submitted that the property in question was never declared as abandoned nor treated as such nor possession of the said property was taken by the Government at any time. It is against this backdrop that the petitioner Begum Nahed Afroz instituted case No. 40 of 1996 (Ka-45).<br/> <br/>It is noted that the Government actively contested the case without, however filing a written statement. The Court of Settlement after contested hearing dismissed the case of the petitioner by its Impugned Judgment and Order dated 21.09.2000. At this stage the petitioner moved this court against the Judgment and order of the Court of Settlement under Article 102 of the Constitution and obtained the present Rule and order of injunction.<br/> <br/>The respondent No. 2, Government of Bangladesh filed Affidavit in opposition denying all the material allegations made in the petition contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the original allottee, Raushan Ara Khatun after emergence of Bangladesh left the country leaving the property uncared for and consequent upon which Government of Bangladesh declared the case property as an abandoned property under the provision of Article 2(1) of the President’s Order No. 16 of 1972. It is asserted that the Government after completing all formalities published Gazette under the provision of Section 5(1) of the Ordinance LIV of 1985 which is conclusive evidence of the fact of the abandoned status of the case property under Section 5 (2) of the Ordinance. Given further that the claimant petitioner has totally failed to prove her vendor’s whereabouts by adducing evidence and hence listing of the property in the Gazette is lawful and a conclusive proof of facts.  <br/> <br/>Mr. M.I. Farooqui, Senior Advocate with Mr. Shaheed Alam, learned advocates appearing on behalf of the petitioner, submit that the Court of Settlement while passing the impugned Judgment did not consider the relevant question whether the property was left uncared for at any time when the P.O. No. 16 of 1972 came into force on 28.02.1972, the preamble of which clearly states that the said Order was to make provision for the control, management and disposal of certain property by certain persons who were not known or who had ceased to occupy or supervise or manage in person their property or who were enemy alien. They submit that in the present case, the petitioner’s vendor Roushan Ara was in possession of the property and has never ceased to supervise and manage her property at the time when the abandoned property Order came into force. Moreover, the original lessee Roushan Ara it is pointed out, was accorded permission by the lessor, the respondent no. 2 upon due inquiry to sell the property to the petitioner which amply proves that Roushan Ara is a citizen of Bangladesh and had active possession, ownership and management of the case property on all material dates. Learned advocates for the petitioner referring to relevant evidences adduced and produced before the Court of Settlement to substantiate the claim of the petitioner further submit that the petitioner while deposing as PW-1 has proved all the relevant papers and documents in substantiation of not only the issue of an unbroken chain of title from 1968 onwards, but also to establish the presence of the vendor in Bangladesh on material dates and her active possession. The petitioner was also cross-examined by the Respondent no. 2, the Government but nothing said by the PW-1 either during her examination -in-chief or, significantly, during cross-examination on behalf of the Government contradicts or dislodges the factual basis of Begum Nahed Afroz’s claim that the property is not abandoned one. It is also argued that the Court of Settlement arrived at findings without considering material evidences and facts causing prejudice to the petitioner and as such the judgment and Order of the Court of Settlement is liable to be declared illegal and to be set aside.<br/> <br/>Mr. Sukumar Biswas, learned Assistant Attorney General appearing on behalf of the Respondent No. 2, the Government opposing the Rule submits that this Court in the exercise of its Writ Jurisdiction is not required to sit on appeal over the Judgment and Order of the court of Settlement unless it could be shown that the tribunal had acted without Jurisdiction or made any finding upon no evidence or without considering any material  evidence/ facts or that it  had acted malafide or in violation of any principle of natural Justice. Mr. Biswas further submits that Section 5(2) of the Ordinance clearly provides that the list published under sub-section (1) shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that the building included therein is an abandoned property and has vested in the Government as such. The onus, therefore, it is argued squarely lies on the claimant of the building to prove that the building is not an abandoned property. It is asserted in the regard that the Government has no obligation either to deny the facts alleged by the claimant or disclose the basis of treating the property as abandoned property merely because the same is disputed by the claimant. It is also argued that no rebuttable evidence could be adduced by the petitioner to show that original owner Roushan Ara Khatun was present in Bangladesh and that she occupied, managed or supervised the disputed building when President’s Order 16 of 1972 came into operation. Hence the listing of the property as an abandoned property under the Ordinance, was lawful as it was an abandoned property by operation of law. In support of his submissions Mr. Biswas referred to the cases Government -Vs- Md. Jalil and others reported in 48 DLR (AD) 10, Government -Vs- Ashrf Ali reported in 49 DLR (AD) 161, Asma Begum -Vs- Bangladesh and others reported in 21 BLD (AD) 134, and Secretary, Ministry of Works -Vs- Roushan Ara Begum reported in 57 DLR (AD) 167.<br/> <br/>We have heard the learned advocates for the parties, perused the Impugned Judgment and Order, application and Records of the Court of Settlement.<br/> <br/>At the very outset this Court notes, by reference, in particular, to the <em>ratio decidendi</em> of the Appellate Division’s judgments in <em>Government of Bangladesh vs. Md. Jalil and others</em> reported in 48 DLR (AD) (1986), 10 and in <em>Government of Bangladesh vs. Ashraf Ali</em> reported in 49 DLR (AD) (1997), 161, that this Court in the exercise of its Writ Jurisdiction is not necessarily to sit on appeal over the judgment and order of the Court of Settlement. Instead, this Court in considering a Writ of Certiorari as this needs to be conscious of the necessity to fundamentally ascertain the extent to which the judgment of the Court of the Settlement may have been perverse. The scope and objective of that limited execise of jurisdiction has, for example, been clearly spelt out by the Appellate Division in the <em>Md. Jalil Case</em> limiting intervention under Article 102 of the Constitution in cases whether the Court of Settlement’s findings may be said to have been based on no  evidence or proceeded upon non-consideration of material evidence or facts or whether the Court of Settlement may be found to have acted mala fide or in violation of any principle of natural justice, thereby, these grounds individually or cumulatively  contributing to a scenario where the Court of Settlement may be found to have acted without jurisdiction.<br/> <br/>Mr. Biswas further submits that a fairly entrenched Judicial view endorses the statutory sanction provided under Section 5(2) of the Ordinance to be conclusive as to the inclusion of buildings in Section 5- lists of abandoned buildings as being in evidence of both their abandoned status and their consequential vesting in the Government. In reply to this, Mr. M.I. Farooqui submits that, for all its apparent certainty of purpose and object, Section 5(2) of the Ordinance has but a rebuttable presumption attached to it and it is for the affected party to prove by adducing evidence to the satisfaction of the Court of Settlement that the case property is not indeed an abandoned property.<br/> <br/>This Court  notes that without detracting in any way from such entrenched judicial views pertaining to Section 5(2) of the Ordinance, due significance has necessarily to be attached to the fact that the burden of proof so to be discharged by a claimant affected party has one primary purpose which has to do with establishing the basic fact that at the time of the promulgation of President’s Order No.16 of 1972 as applicable to the present facts and circumstances, the petitioner, Begum Nahid Afroz or her predecessors-in-interest, as identified through an unbroken chain of title, were indeed in possession of the case property. In other words, the burden of proof may be found to be discharged duly should it be established that the said petitioner or her predecessors-in-interest occupied, supervised or managed the case property before and after 28.2.1972, that is the date on which the P.O. 16 of 1972 came into force.<br/> <br/>It is predicated on the above principle and standards of interpretation and application of law that this Court has perused the contents of the Judgment and Order of 21.09.2000.<br/> <br/>It appears from the Judgment and additional reference to the Records of the Court of Settlement as called for and made available to this Court, the Court of Settlement was unmindful of ensuring that the claimant Begum Nahed Afroz before it took all steps to place relevant  evidence to substantiate her claim e.g., original lease deed of Mrs. Raushan Ara Khatun dated 12.12.1968, an enquiry report submitted by the Administrative Officer, Mohammedpur Housing Estate, dated 17.03.1985 to the effect that Roushan Ara Khatun is in possession, to the Assistant Commissioner Settlement (Annexure-G), Memo dated 16.06.1985 according permission to sell the property, Memo dated 04.09.1985 issued by the Assistant Commissioner Settlement mutating the name of the petitioner, NOC/permission dated 29.10.1985 issued by the Assistant Commissioner Settlement to mortgage the property to the  House Building Finance Corporation (HBFC) as security against loan, sanction letter issued by RAJUK approving building plan, sanction letter dated 16.06.1986 issued by HBFC evidencing granting of loan, deeds of sale dated 01.08.1985 and 06.08.1985 respectively as are otherwise found in the Records of the Court of Settlement Additionally the petitioner adduced evidence particularly in the form of the deposition and was also cross-examined by the Government. Apart from this the petitioner, to substantiate her claim,  called for the original documents from HBFC and the records of the Government as well as from the Housing Department but the Government did not submit its records in the Court of Settlement as evident from the Order No. 27 dated 20.08.2000. Non-submission of records before the Court of Settlement by the Government, in this Court’s view, itself strengthened the claim of the petitioner. It appears that the court of Settlement consequentially remained silent about those documents and continuous private ownership and management of the property from 1968 onwards with title and possession eventually devolving unto the petitioner, Nahed Afroz as a bona fide subsequent purchaser for value upon a chronological examination of the initial lease granted to Roushan Ara Khatun in 1968 by the Governor, East Pakistan through an indenture of agreement of that date produced in court. The statement of PW-1 given in deposition generally reads as an affirmation of the facts as above given as significantly confirmed during cross-examination and in particular proves the presence of Roushan Ara Khatun in Bangladesh at all material times as evident, in particular, from the inquiry report dated- 17.03.1985 (Annexure-G) which is quoted below:<br/> </div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;">গণপ্রজাতÇএী বাংলাদেশ সরকার<br/>প্রশাসনিক কর্মকর্তার কার্য্যালয়<br/>মোহাম্মদপুর হাইজিং এষ্টেট  ঢাকা<br/>স্বারক নং- ১৫৩/এ, ও            তারিখ- ১৭/৩/৮৫</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">বরাবর,<br/>সহকারী কমিশনার সেটেলমেন্ট,<br/>পুর্ত মÇএনালয়,<br/>সেগুনবাগিচা, ঢাকা<br/><br/>বিষয়ঃ  <u>মোহাম্মদপুরসহ </u><u>“</u><u>সি</u><u>”</u> <u>ব্লকের ১৪/৪ নং প্লট বাড়ীর তদ প্রসংগে </u><br/><br/>সুত্রঃ- স্বারক নং-১৩৬২/কসে, তাং ৮/৩৮৫ ইং<br/>অাপনার উপরোও্র প্রেরিত স্বারক মোতাবেক মোহাম্মদপুরসহ ঞ্ছ সিঞ্জ-ব্লকের ১৪/৪ প্লট বাড়ীটি তদ¿¹ করিয়া দেখা যায় যে, জনাবা মিসেস রওশন আরা খাতুন, স্বামী- আবদুল্লাহ ড~ও্র প্লটের মূল বরাদ্দ গ্রহিতা z বরাদ্দ পত্র নং -১৫৭৫/সি, এইচ,এস, তাং  ১৬-৮-৬৮ ইং এবং লিজ দলিল নং-১৮২১৫ তাং ১২/১২/৬৮ ইং z প্লট বাড়ীর খাতে  সরকারের সম্পুর্ন কিসি¹র টাকা পরিশোধ করা আছে z দায়মুও্রি ছাড় পত্র নং ২২৬০/উ তাং ১৫/৭/৭৭ ইং z বর্তমানে উও্র প্লট বাড়ীটি মালিক জনাবা মিসেস রওশন আরা খাতুনের দখলাধীন আছে<br/>সদয় অবগতি ও প্রয়োজনীয় ব্যবসহা গ্রহনের জন্য প্রেরন করা হইল</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: right;">স্বাক্ষর<br/>(নুর্রল আলম)<br/>প্রশাসনিক কর্মকর্তা,<br/>মোহাম্মদপুর হাউজিং এষ্টেট,<br/>ঢাকা</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Mr. M. I. Farooqui now stresses the fact that by issuing in due course the permission to sell the property upon such inquiry by the Administrative Officer, the Government is now estopped from raising any objection regarding the whereabouts of the original lessee Mrs. Roushan Ara Khatun. Equally nothing said by PW-1 either during examination-in-chief or during cross-examination on behalf of the Government contradicts or dislodges the basic facts as above as could otherwise have reasonably led the Court of Settlement to question the very factual basis of Nahed Afroz’s claim that the case property is not an abandoned one. But evidently all these evidences and facts have been ignored by the Court of Settlement by making a third case of its own questioning the power and authority of the Assistant Commissioner Settlement to give permission to the lessee to sell the property though no such case or argument made out on behalf of the Government. It appears that the Government only argued that the papers and documents submitted on behalf of the petitioner claimant are all false and fabricated. In that  situations, the law says that the burden of proof lies on the person who claims and or pleads fraud. The Government could not prove such allegations by any means or even, in the very minimum, produce the record lying with them though it was called for by the Court of Settlement. <br/> <br/>Given this Court’s understanding of the essentials of enquiry as to the status of any property under the relevant provisions of the Ordinance as above explained, it is found that the claimant Nahed Afroz had duly discharged her onus of proving her case independently of the Government and that in doing so she had by a set of mutually reinforcing evidence produced generally established a continuous scenario of active ownership, occupation, supervision and management of the said property both before and after the promulgation of President Order 16 of 1972.<br/> <br/>This Court finds further that there was nothing on record that could have reasonably led the Court of Settlement to find otherwise. But the Court of Settlement without following a judicial approach in determining the question of facts involved in this case, unfortunately passed the judgment without giving a due judicial consideration of the whole dispute between the parties and decided the matter erroneously. By that reason, and by confining this Court’s scrutiny to the objective of finding whether the impugned judgment is perverse or not, this Court has inevitably arrived at the conclusion that the Court of Settlement’s judgment and Order dated 21.09.2000 is indeed a perverse one being contrary to the facts circumstances and evidences on record. By, that reason, we are inclined to interfere with the impugned judgment of the Court of Settlement as prayed for.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, this Court finds merit in the application and substance in the Rule Nisi issued.<br/> <br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute however, without any order as to costs. The Judgment and Order dated 21.09.2000 passed by the First Court of Settlement, Dhaka, in Settlement Case No. 40 of 1996(Ka-45) in respect of House No.14/4, Block-C, Mohammadpur, Dhka, is hereby set aside and the respondents are directed to delete/withdraw and rescind the property from the list published in Bangladesh Gazette dated 23.09.1986 immediately upon receipt of this Judgment.<br/> <br/>Send down the Records received from the First Court of Settlement, Segunbagicha, P.S.

Now the question is whether the High Court Division committed an error of law resulting an error in the decision by rejecting the application for adducing additional evidence occasioning failure of justice. The genuineness of the agreement for sale could not be questioned by the defendants, what they did question was the authority and capacity of Kazi Golam Hussain to execute such a contract. Exbt.6 is a letter issued by the Chairman of the defendant No.1-Company to the Managing Director, Uttara Bank dated 16.09.1990. This letter shows that Kazi Golam Hussain was chairman of the Company. For this reason, there is nothing left for the appellate Court that could require them further evidence to adjudge whether Kazi Golam Hussain was chairman of the company and that’s why the High Court Division did not feel the necessity of any additional evidence and therefore there was no illegality in rejecting the prayer for adducing evidence by the defendants at the appellate stage.</em><strong>          . . .

Muzammel Hossain, J: </u></strong><br/><br/>This petition for leave to appeal under Article 103 of the Constitution of People’s Republic of Bangladesh is directed against the judgment and decree dated 31.05.2010 passed by the High Court Division in F.A. No.216 of 2007 allowing the appeal and setting aside the judgment and decree dated 19.06.2007 passed by the learned Joint District Judge and Arbitration Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No.102 of 2004 dismissing the suit.<br/> <br/>The present respondent Nos.1-6 as plaintiffs filed Title Suit No.119 of 2002 in the 4<sup>th</sup> Court of Joint District Judge, Dhaka for Specific Performance of Contract in respect of the suit property which was subsequently transferred to the Court of Joint District Judge, Arbitration Court, Dhaka and renumbered as Title Suit No.102 of 2004. In the plaint the plaintiffs stated, interalia, that the defendant No.1-petitioner No.1 being a private limited company got allotment of the scheduled property on 30.07.1985 and as per Board Resolution of the Company one Kazi Golam Hussain being the Chairman of the company on 19.03.1990 entered into an agreement for sale of the said property with Alhaj Mansur Rahman for Tk.35,40,000/-. Thereafter Alhaj Mansur Rahman paid Tk.18.50 lacs through cheques as earnest money and possession of the property was delivered to him with a condition that outstanding dues of Tk.11.00 lacs out of the total consideration money be paid to RAJUK by him for which Tk.11 lacs would be excluded from total consideration money and the defendant No.1 would execute the deed receiving the balance consideration money of Tk.5 lacs. The price was re-fixed at Tk.33.00 lacs out of which Tk.19.00 lacs was already paid by the plaintiff Mansur Rahman to the defendant and the outstanding amount of Tk.14,29,373/- was paid by Mansur Rahman to the RAJUK. The defendant Nos.1 and 2 and Kazi Golam Hussain executed a security bond on 18.03.1992 admitting the agreement. Kazi Golam Hussain died leaving behind defendant Nos.2-4 as his heirs who are all Directors of the defendant No.1-company. The plaintiffs-respondents requested the defendants to execute and register the deed but they refused to execute and register the deed of sale on 30.03.2002 and hence the suit for Specific Performance of Contract.<br/> <br/>The defendant Nos.1-2-petitioners contested the suit denying the statements made in the plaint stating, interalia, that as per Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company there is no post of Chairman of the defendant No.1-petitioner-company rather there is a post of Managing Director; that the defendant No.2 is the Managing Director of the company having overall supervision and control over the company. Kazi Golam Hussain was the father of the defendant No.2 who at the relevant time used to serve in the Investment Board of Bangladesh as a Director and as such he was neither Chairman nor Director nor anybody in the said company and there is no such expression in the company law, namely, "Authority". In order to grab the property the predecessor of the plaintiffs-respondents, Mansur Rahman, managed to obtain an unregistered deed of agreement executed by Kazi Golam Hussain alleging that he was the Chairman of the M/S Hussain Fabrics Ltd. although Kazi Golam Hussain had no authority to deal with the matter as well as to transfer or enter into any contract with anybody for any share or portion of M/S Hussain Fabrics Ltd. and the alleged contract is not a contract in the eye of law and as such the same is not legally enforceable. On 18.03.1992 the plaintiff No.3 with a group of miscreants came to the residence of the defendants and took their signature in a security bond under threat of gun point. Thereafter the plaintiff, not being the owner and possessor and having no right, title, interest and possession over the assets of Hussain Fabrics Ltd. got 10 Ansars posted therein. Some unscrupulous persons had tried to dispossess the defendants from the land allotted to the defendant No.1-the company and finding no other way the defendant No.2 filed a petition case bearing No.5877 of 2001 before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka alleging, interalia, that there is a possibility to break the peace and tranquility and prayed for necessary order and the learned Magistrate passed an order of status quo. Shyampur Police Station Case No.32(12)2001 was started by the plaintiffs wherein the defendant Nos.2-4 were falsely implicated. The plaintiff No.2 with the help of police raided the said land and also arrested the employees of the defendant No.2. Finding no other alternative the defendant No.2 filed Writ Petition No.242 of 2002 and got an order of injunction against the plaintiff. The plaintiff No.2-Mahbubur Rahman with the help of bad elements, police force and Ansars entered into the industry of M/S Hussain Fabrics Ltd and looted away valuable goods and machineries violating the order of injunction of the High Court Division and the order of maintaining status quo granted by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka and thereafter, the defendant No.2 filed Contempt Petition being No.9 of 2002 in the High Court Division wherein a Rule Nisi has been issued. One Mahamuda Begum also filed Petition Case No. 255 of 2002 in the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka against Mahbubur Rahman and others. The defendant stated that there was no contract for sale of the suit property and as such the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>However, the defendants did not adduce any evidence, oral or documentary, before the trial Court. The learned Joint District Judge dismissed the suit on contest against the defendant Nos.1 and 2 and exparte against the rest by the judgment and decree dated 19.06.2007.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 19.06.2007 the plaintiff preferred an appeal being First Appeal No.216 of 2007 before the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>While the appeal was pending, the defendant-respondents-petitioners filed an application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure for adducing additional evidence on the ground that the plaintiffs filed various false cases against the Managing Director of Hussain Fabrics Limited and against Darwan, Guard and other employees of the company and out of fear of the plaintiffs, the defendant could not attend the Court and could not examine their witnesses, produce documents in the Court, mark the same as exhibits and also could not cross-examined two witnesses out of four produced by the plaintiffs. A Division Bench of the High Court Division kept the application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 pending for consideration at the time of hearing of the appeal.<br/> <br/>Subsequently, a Division Bench of the High Court Division by the judgment and decree dated 31.05.2010 allowed the appeal being No.F.A. No.216 of 2007 upon setting aside the judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court and decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiffs-respondents without considering the relevant papers and documents as well as the application submitted by the defendants-petitioners under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure for additional evidence on the grounds stated therein.<br/> <br/>Thereafter the defendants-petitioners being aggrieved by the impugned judgment and decree passed by the High Court Division preferred the instant Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal before this Division.<br/> <br/>Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, the learned Advocate appearing for the defendants-petitioners submits that the High Court Division failed to consider that in the Memorandum and Articles of Association, the name of Kazi Golam Hussain does not appear as Chairman of Hussain Fabrics Limited and as such said Kazi Golam Hussain has no authority to enter into any agreement for sale on behalf of Hussain Fabrics Limited. He submits that admittedly series of litigations have been going on between the parties and because of threat by the plaintiffs-respondents, the defendants-petitioners failed to adduce both oral and documentary evidence before the Trial Court and get them marked as exhibits and that considering the above facts and circumstances an opportunity ought to have been given to the defendants-petitioners to adduce additional evidence but the High Court Division having failed to do so committed an illegality and as such the impugned judgment and decree is liable to be set aside. He submits that Kazi Golam Hussain was the Director of the Investment Board and that he could not be the Director/ Chairman of Hussain Fabrics Limited and as such he has no authority to enter into an agreement for sale in respect of the property of Hussain Fabrics Limited but the High Court Division decreed the suit by ignoring the same and as such the impugned judgment and decree is liable to be set aside. He then submits that the alleged deed of agreement dated 19.03.1990 alleging delivery of possession is totally false. He contends that had the agreement dated 19.03.1990 been genuine, then there would have been no need of any Security Bond on 18.03.1992 from the plaintiffs-respondents for Holding No.14, Satish Sarker Road, Gandaria, Dhaka but the High Court Division totally failed to consider the same and illegally allowed the appeal. He contends that the observation made by the Division Bench of the High Court Division that the defendants-petitioners are required to prove the facts that Kazi Golam Hossain was not the Chairman is totally misleading inasmuch as the plaintiffs-respondents must prove their own case and the weakness of the defendants-petitioners will not in any way improve the case of the plaintiffs-respondents and that the defendants-petitioners filed an application under order 41 rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure along with important documents, namely, Memorandum and Articles of Association to show that Kazi Golam Hossain was not the Chairman and some other papers to prove that the defendants were prevented by sufficient cause from attending the Court but the High Court Division did not accept those documents and delivered the judgment without considering the same and wrongly shifted the burden of proof on the defendants-petitioners and as such the judgment and decree is liable to be set aside. He then submits that the High Court Division illegally rejected the application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure, inasmuch, the High Court Division found difficulties for the defendants-petitioners to attend the Court along with witnesses and as such the High Court Division ought to have considered the same and allowed the application for additional evidence and should have sent back the case on remand giving an opportunity to the defendants-petitioners for proving their case as the High Court Division came to the finding that the defendants-petitioners failed to prove that Kazi Golam Hossain was not the Chairman, and as such the impugned judgment and decree is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>Dr. M. Zahir, the learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff-respondent No.2 submits that there is no illegality in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and as such the leave petition is liable to be dismissed. He submits that the plaintiffs-respondents by adducing evidence and examining natural witnesses proved the original documents and the case. Dr. Zahir then submits that since the defendants-petitioners failed to produce the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company to prove the fact that the defendants’ predecessor was actually not the Chairman of the defendant No.1-company, the bainapatra can be treated as proper document to be enforceable in law. Dr. Zahir contends that in order to prove that Kazi Golam Hossain was not Chairman of the defendant No.1-company the evidence should have been laid on behalf of the defendants-petitioners to that effect. Dr. Zahir submits that the High Court Division rightly found that the learned Subordinate Judge misread the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiffs-respondents and thereby wrongly held that the plaintiff is to prove that Kazi Golam Hossain, the predecessor of the defendant-petitioner Nos.2 and 3 was the Chariman of the defendant No.1-company as the plaintiffs did not produce the Memorandum and the Articles of Association of the defendant No.1-company. Dr. Zahir on behalf of the plaintiffs-respondents submits that the High Court Division having considered the provisions of section 102 of the Evidence Act to the effect that a person who alleges certain illegality or challenges the correctness of certain fact must prove the allegation of the same or correctness of the said fact and that to prove that Kazi Golam Hossain was not Chairman of the defendant No.1-company the onus squarely lies on the defendant No.1-company to discharge such onus to that effect as they raised the question and as such the High Court Division rightly held that the defendant No.1-company ought to have led evidence to the effect that Kazi Golam Hossain was not Chairman of the defendant No.1-company who was required to submit the company’s documents including Memorandum and Articles of Association of the defendant No.1-company. Dr. Zahir further submits that the High Court Division rightly found that the plaintiffs-respondents proved their possession on the suit land by examining witnesses and they proved the execution of bainapatro by both oral and documentary evidence and that they were inducted into possession pursuant to the bainapatra executed by the defendants. He also submits that the High Court Division having considered material evidence on record found that the learned Judge of the trial court correctly found the possession of the plaintiffs-respondents in the suit land but the trial Court wrongly held that the plaintiffs-respondents got possession through muscleman without the basis of any material evidence on record as the defendants did not examine any witness. Dr. Zahir also asserts that the High Court Division on the question of additional evidence rightly referred to the provision of Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure which contemplates two preconditions in accepting the additional evidence, namely, where the trial court refused to admit evidence which ought to have been admitted or the appellate court requires the additional evidence to pronounce judgment or for any other substantial cause. He finally asserts that it is to be seen whether the required documents were in possession of the parties when the trial was held and that the defendants-petitioners at the appellate stage admitted that the said documents were very much in their custody but they did not produce before the trial Court and as such they should not be allowed to adduce additional evidence to fill up the lacuna by sending back the case on remand to the trial Court and as such the High Court Division rightly allowed the appeal in decreeing the suit.<br/> <br/>We have perused the Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal, impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, the judgment and decree passed by the learned Joint District Judge and other materials on record. It appears that in order to prove their case the plaintiffs-respondents examined four witnesses and submitted to the trial Court a number of documents which were formally exhibited. These documents include General Power of Attorney (Exbt.1), photocopy of allotment letter dated 30.07.1985 (Exbt.2), original bainapatra dated 19.03.1990 (Exbt.3), original receipt of money issued by City Bank dated 26.08.1993 (Exbt.4), original paper of handing over machineries and others (Exbt.5), letter issued by chairman of defendant No.1 to the Managing Director, Uttara Bank dated 16.09.1990 (Exbt.6), pay orders, cheques and chalans for payment of Tk.14,29,303/-(Exbt.8 series), original security bond (Exbt.9) original lease deed (Exbt.10), letters issued by defendant No.2 to Alhaj Monsurur Rahman (Exbt.11 series), complaint petition case No.5877 of 2001 (Exbt.14), order of appointment of 10 Ansars with payment receipt (Exbt.15 series), plaint of Title Suit No.1 of 1994 in the Court of 4<sup>th</sup> Artho Rin Adalat (Exbt.17), Vokalatnama by the chairman (Exbt.18) and statement filed by the Chairman of defendant No.1 in Title Suit No.1 of 1994 (Exbt.19) and other relevant documents. The plaintiffs-respondents before the trial Court by adducing both oral and documentary evidence on record proved that there was an agreement for sale of the suit land on 19.03.1990 by the defendants-petitioners to the plaintiffs-respondents at a consideration of Tk. 34,54,300/- and the plaintiffs paid earnest money of Tk.18,50,000/- and the bainapatra was executed on the same date and the possession was delivered to the plaintiffs-respondents by the defendant No.1-petitioner in presence of witnesses. The plaintiffs-respondents also proved their case by adducing evidence to the effect that the Managing Director of Uttara Bank in his letter dated 16.09.1990 (Exbt.6) admitted the agreement for sale dated 19.03.1990 and also admitted their possession. The defendants-petitioners in their written statement admitted possession of the plaintiffs-respondents in the suit land but did not adduce any evidence in support of the written statement to that effect. It appears that in this particular case the defendants-petitioners did neither examine any witness nor submit any document before the trial Court in support of their case. The learned Advocate for the defendants-petitioners only made submissions relying on the written statement which has no legal basis in the eye of law because pleading of the defendants is not a legal piece of evidence and as such on the basis of the pleading of the defendants-petitioners their case could not be proved before the Trial Court.<br/> <br/>What is the true import of “pleadings” has been discussed by the Supreme Court of India in Kalyan Singh Chouhan –Vs- C.P. Joshi, AIR 2011 SC 1127 in the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Pleadings and particulars are required to enable the court to decide the rights of the parties in the trial. Thus, the pleadings are more to help the court in narrowing the controversy involved and to inform the parties concerned to the question in issue, so that the parties may adduce appropriate evidence on the said issue. It is settled legal proposition that “as a rule relief not founded on the pleadings should not be granted.” Therefore, a decision of a case cannot be based on grounds outside the pleadings of the parties. The pleadings and issues are to ascertain the real dispute between the parties to narrow the area of conflict and to see just where the two sides differ.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In Ram Sarup Gupta (dead) by L.Rs. –Vs- Bishun Narain Inter College &amp; Ors, AIR 1987 SC 1242 it was held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“It is well settled that in the absence of pleading, evidence, if any, produced by the parties cannot be considered. It is also equally settled that no party should be permitted to travel beyond its pleading and that all necessary and material facts should be pleaded by the party in support of the case set up by it. The object and purpose of pleading is to enable the adversary party to know the case it has to meet.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In Bachhaj Nahar –Vs- Nilima Mandal &amp; Ors., AIR 2009 SC 1103, it was held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The object and purpose of pleadings and issues is to ensure that the litigants come to trial with all issues clearly defined and to prevent cases being expanded or grounds being shifted during trial. Its object is also to ensure that each side is fully alive to the questions that are likely to be raised or considered so that they may have an opportunity of placing the relevant evidence appropriate to the issues before the court for its consideration. This Court has repeatedly held that the pleadings are meant to give to each side intimation of the case of the other so that it may be met, to enable courts to determine what is really at issue between the parties, and to prevent any deviation from the course which litigation on particular causes must take. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>The object of issues is to identify from the pleadings the question or points required to be decided by the courts so as to enable parties to let in evidence thereon. .......... it is said that no amount of evidence, on a plea that is not put forward in the pleadings, can be looked into to grant any relief.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The cumulative effect of the above mentioned decisions is that pleadings and evidence are completely two different things. Pleadings prepare the suit for contest and evidence adduced in the case in line with the claims and denials stated in pleadings, actually contest the suit. In pleadings facts are to be described and relieves are to be sought which will narrow the controversy between and among the parties concerned, and will inform each of them of the extent to which they need to adduce evidence in support of their respective claim to prove their case. Where there is no pleading, evidence to that effect can not be considered and where there is no evidence, pleadings can not prove the fact and claim.<br/> <br/>Defendant-petitioner Nos.2 and 3 did not adduce any evidence whether oral or documentary, before the trial court but their learned Counsel cross-examined two of the witnesses for the plaintiffs-respondents and argued before the Court. True effect of this cross-examination is that if it is able to shake the credibility of the witnesses examined on behalf of the plaintiffs-respondents, it can create a doubt about the case of the plaintiffs-respondents; but it can not prove the case of the defendants-petitioners.<br/> <br/>However, at a belated stage when appeal was filed against the decision of the trial Court the defendants-petitioners filed an application for adducing additional evidence by submitting Articles of Association and Memorandum of the defendant No.1-company and other documents to show that Kazi Golam Hussain was not the chairman of the company at the relevant time and therefore he did not have any authority to transfer the suit property. Additional evidence can be adduced under Order 41, rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908. But there are certain preconditions that are to be fulfilled to enable a party to adduce additional evidence. This Division in the case of Sunil Krishna Banik &amp; Ors –Vs- Kailash Chandra Saha &amp; Ors, 36 DLR (AD) 220 held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Clause (b) of rule 27(1) appears to have conferred discretion on the Appellate Court to allow additional evidence in order “to enable it to pronounce judgment, or for any other substantial cause”. This discretion is not subject to any other limitation or restriction excepting what is indicated by the words used therein. To do justice is the special preserve or domain of a court of law and this has been stressed by the words used in clause (b) as aforesaid. Since the point raised by the appellants required the determination of the Court before pre-emption could be allowed, the expression of hesitation and refusal to admit the additional evidence does not seem to be justified. This may have occasioned </em><em>failure of justice instead of doing it. Before judgment is pronounced by the Court there may be no harm if it considers a vital piece of evidence produced before it, though late, so that it may prevent an injustice being done. It is true that such admission should not be encouraged. Power to admit additional evidence should, therefore, be sparingly used.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the above quoted paragraph it has been clearly identified that for the ends of justice an Appellate Court can allow additional evidence to be adduced subject to the limitations or restrictions provided in the rule 27 of Order 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908 and such admission should not be encouraged and power to admit additional evidence should be sparingly used. What the limitations are-have also been pointed out in the same judgment referring to a decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Muhammad Siddiq Muhammad Umar –Vs- Australisia Bank Ltd., PLD 1966 SC 684, wherein it was observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The rule merely prescribes that the requirement must be a genuine one and that the need for the additional evidence must be felt by the Court itself after it has examined the evidence already on the record and come to the conclusion that there is apparent some inherent lacuna or defect which hinders the due administration of justice. If it comes to this conclusion, then it has the power to call for additional evidence subject to the condition that it must record its reasons for doing so, in order that a higher Court may be able to ascertain that the need was not merely imaginary but based upon factual grounds.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Supreme Court of India in Arjan Singh –Vs- Kartar Singh and Others, 1951 AIR SC 193 held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The discretion to receive and admit additional evidence is not an arbitrary one, but is a judicial one circumscribed by the limitations specified in O. 41, R. 27, Civil P. C. If the additional evidence was allowed to be adduced contrary to the principles governing the reception of such evidence, it would be a case of improper exercise of discretion, and the additional evidence so brought on the record will have to be ignored and the case decided as if it was non-existent. Under O. 41, R. 27, it is the appellate Court that must require the evidence to enable it to pronounce judgment. As laid down by the P.C. in the well-known case of Kessowji v. G. I. P. Railway, 34 I.A. 115: (31 Bom. 381 (P.C.)), “the legitimate occasion for the appln. of the present rule is when, on examining the evidence as it stands, some inherent lacuna or defect becomes apparent, not where a discovery is made, outside the Court, of fresh evidence and the application is made to import it.”, and they reiterated this view in stronger terms even in the later case of Parsotim v. Lal Mohan 58 I.A. 254: (A.I.R. (18) 1931 P.C. 143). The true test, therefore, is whether the appellate Court is able to pronounce judgment on the materials before it without taking into consideration the additional evidence sought to be adduced.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Supreme Court of India in Syed Abdul Khader vs. Rami Reddy &amp; Ors, AIR 1979 SC 553 explaining the scope of allowing additional evidence observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Order 41, Rule 27, C.P.C. enables the appellate Court to admit additional evidence in the circumstances or situation therein mentioned one such being where the appellate court requires any document to be produced or any witness to be examined to enable it to pronounce judgment or for any other substantial cause. By a catena of decisions of this Court, it is well established that Order 41, Rule 27, C.P.C. does not confer a right on the party to produce additional evidence. But if the Court hearing the action requires any document so as to enable it to pronounce judgment, it has the jurisdiction to permit additional evidence to be produced.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the above discussions it is abundantly clear that Order 41, Rule 27 of the C.P.C. does not confer any right to the party to adduce additional evidence. The need for additional evidence must be felt by the Court itself. When evidence was not adduced by the defendant at the trial stages, at the appellate stage he cannot claim as of his right, an opportunity to adduce evidence. Now the question is whether the High Court Division committed an error of law resulting an error in the decision by rejecting the application for adducing additional evidence occasioning failure of justice. In other words whether the plaintiffs failed to prove their case or by cross-examining the witnesses of the plaintiffs and by arguing at the argument stage of the case learned Counsel of the defendants was able to create any shadow of doubt against the claim of the plaintiffs so as to require the court evidence at appellate stage as applied by the defendants. This is a suit for specific performance of contract and this Division in the case of Government of Bangladesh –Vs- Mrs. Noorjahan Khan and others, 8 BLT (AD) 1 held that in a suit for specific performance of contract the genuineness of the agreement for sale is the prime consideration. The genuineness of the agreement for sale could not be questioned by the defendants, what they did question was the authority and capacity of Kazi Golam Hussain to execute such a contract. The defendant Nos.2 and 3 did not adduce evidence to prove that Kazi Golam Hussain was not the Chairman of the company at the relevant time. It is to be seen whether the plaintiffs were able to prove that Kazi Golam Hussain was the chairman of the company and he did hold the capacity and authority to enter into the contract on behalf of the company. Exbt.6 is a letter issued by the Chairman of the defendant No.1-Company to the Managing Director, Uttara Bank dated 16.09.1990. This letter shows that Kazi Golam Hussain was chairman of the Company. For this reason, there is nothing left for the appellate Court that could require them further evidence to adjudge whether Kazi Golam Hussain was chairman of the company and that’s why the High Court Division did not feel the necessity of any additional evidence and therefore there was no illegality in rejecting the prayer for adducing evidence by the defendants at the appellate stage.<br/> <br/>As to the argument pressed by the learned Advocate for the defendants-petitioners to the effect that they were prevented by sufficient cause from attending court at the trial stage, as they were threatened by the plaintiffs-respondents and as such the High Court Division ought to have allowed evidence at the appellate stage, we are of the view that threat by the plaintiffs-respondents cannot be a sufficient ground for not examining witnesses or for not adducing documentary evidence before the trial Court. Because, if threat had been so predominant, the defendants-petitioners would have filed a case or G.D. entry and would not have been able to file written statement and subsequently contest the suit.<br/> <br/>We have seen that before the trial Court the plaintiffs-respondents by adducing both oral and documentary evidence proved the agreement for sale, payment of earnest money, delivery of possession and their continuous possession in the suit land and finally defendants’ refusal to execute and register the deed of sale. But the defendants without adducing any evidence or examining any witness in the trial court in support of their case could not dislodge the plaintiffs’ contention. The submissions made by the learned Advocate for the defendants-petitioners or the defendants case as narrated in the written statement not being a legal piece of evidence cannot be considered by the trial Court unless it is supported by both oral and documentary evidence adduced on behalf of the defendants-petitioners. We find that in the instant case, plaintiffs-respondents having proved their case by adducing both oral and documentary evidence which went unchallenged because of non-examination of any witness on behalf of the defendants, inasmuch as, in the eye of law there is no legal evidence before the trial Court on behalf of the defendants-petitioners. In other words, the plaintiffs-respondents’ case was proved unchallenged. As regards the question of additional evidence, we find that the High Court Division rightly dismissed the defendants-petitioners prayer for allowing additional evidence. For the aforesaid reasons, we do not find any illegality in the impugned judgment and decree dated 31.05.2010 passed by the High Court Division in F.A. No. 216 of 2007. In consideration thereof, we do not find any substance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioners.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the leave petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Reference: 4 LNJ AD (2015) 114</strong>.</div></div></div>

No.458 of 1999 corresponding to Palashbari P.S. Case No. 15 dated 24.08.1999 should not be set aside and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this court may seem fit and proper.<br/> <br/>Facts relevant for disposal of this rule, in short, is that the petitioner as an informant lodged an F.I.R. on 24.08.1999 with Palashbari Police Station against 17 persons alleging interalia that while the people of Ambari village raised a protest, against the order of termination of service of his neighbor Md. Abdul Mannan, Principal of Palashbari Adarsha Degree Collage, the activists of Jamat Shibir became angry and threatened them with the dire consequences, as a result of which on 22.08.1999 at about 1.00 P.M. the activists of Jamat Shibir attacked Hasan Ali, brother of informant and amongst them accused Abdur Rouf gave a Hocky stick blow on the head of Hasan Ali, accused Jalal caught hold of his hand and accused Golam Mostafa dealt a ramda blow on the hand  and other accused also beaten him with lathi causing serious injuries. When the witnesses came forward in aid of him, the accused persons also attacked and injured them and left the place of occurrence exploding bomb. The injured persons were taken to hospital wherein Hasan Ali died at about 10.00 p.m. The police station registered the same as Polashbari P.S. case No.15 dated 24.08.1999 under section 147/ 148/149/323/325/326/302/109/114 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>The police after investigation submitted charge sheet being No. 56 dated 31.05.2000 against all the 17 accused under sections 147/148/149/323/325/326/302/109/114 of the Penal Code. Learned Magistrate upon receipt of the charge sheet sent the case record to the Sessions Judge, Gaibandha wherein the case was registered as Sessions Case No. 22 of 2005 and the learned Sessions Judge upon hearing the parties framed charge on 09.05.2005 against the 17 accused persons under sections 302/ 149/326/114 of the Penal Code and in course of trial prosecution examined 6 P.Ws. who categorically stated in their deposition that the accused opposite parties were involved in the said occurrence. At the midst of the trial, the public prosecutor filed an application on 31.10.2006 praying for withdrawal from the prosecution of the accused opposite parties No.1-8 referring memo dated 19.10.2006 and 30.10.2006 issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs. The informant petitioner filed written objection on 06.11.2006 against the said application filed by the public prosecutor. The learned Sessions Judge, Gaibandha upon hearing allowed the withdrawal of the prosecution case of opposite parties no. 1 to 8 by the impugned order dated 08.11.2006.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by this order of withdrawal the informant moved this court and obtained the present rule.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Sagir Anwar, the learned advocate appearing for the informant-petitioner submits that the learned Sessions Judge, Gaihandha has committed error of law in according permission for withdrawal  from the prosecution of the accused-opposite parties  who are the principal accused against whom the fatal injuries have attributed in the First Information report  and the investigating agencies  after investigation have also found their comp-licity in the offence. Moreover, prosecution witnesses specifically mentioned the names of the accused and deposed stating their complicity in the occurrence. The learned Advocate further submits that in the application for withdrawal from the prosec-ution the learned Public Prosecutor  has not assigned proper and sufficient reasons required by law calling for the withdrawal from the prosecution and the learned Sessions Judge, has accorded permission without application of judicial mind but passed the impugned order as if he was  performing a routine work. He further submits that the withdrawal from the prosecution is subject to consent by the trial Court and when a portion of accused persons are still absconding the trial court ought not to have exercised his discretion  in withdrawal of the case. In support of his contention he referred to the cases of Moezuddin Vs. The State reported in 59 D.L.R. 222, Abdul Hakim Chowdhury vs Ruhul Amin and the State reported in 40 D.L.R. (HED) page- 259 and State Vs. Md. Amir Hamza, reported in 57 D.L.R (AD) 26.<br/> <br/>Mr. Amit Talukder, the learned Deputy Attorney General, appearing for the State finds it difficult to oppose the rule and  candidly submits that the trial court committed  error  of law in allowing withd-rawal from prosecution against accused persons. He further submits that the application filed by the learned Public Prosecutor  suffers from proper materials which are required   to be made in order to secure the consent of the court but in the instant case the learned Public Prosecutor only communicated the decision of the Government without disclosing any material in support of the application. He also submits that the learned Public Prosecutor is not bound to make any application unless he is satisfied that there is no legal ground for prosecution of the accused persons of the offences for which they are tried.<br/> <br/>To appreciate the above submissions we like to reproduce the contents of the application filed by the learned Public Prosecutor praying for withdrawal from the prosecution.<br/> </div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;"><strong>এ্রমিক নং ২৯/০৭ (ফৌজঃ)</strong><br/><strong>মোকাম বিজ্ঞ জেলা ও দায়রা জজ আদালত, গাইবান্ধা</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>সুত্রঃ  গণপ্রজাতএী বাংলাদেশ সরকারের স্বরাষ্ট্র মএনালয় এর আইন শাখা-১ এর স্বারক নং স্বঃ মঃ (আইন-১) মাঃ প্রঃ-৮/২০০৬/(সভা-৭)/৬২৮ তারিখ ১৯/১০/০৬ এবং স্বারক নং জেঃ প্রঃ/গাঃ/জে এম/২০০৬/১৩৫১ তারিখ ৩০/১০/২০০৬ ইং ও সেশন মামলা নং ২২/০৫, জি, আর নং ১১৫৮/৯৯ পলাশবাড়ী থানা </strong><br/><strong>বিষয়ঃ ফোঃ কাঃ বিধি ৪৯৪ ধারা মোতাবেক আসামী (১) মোঃ গোলাম মোস্তফা, (২) জালাল, (৩) আঃ রউফ, (৪) শাহ আলম, (৫) আবু বকর, (৬) বাবর আলী, (৭) ফার্রক ও (৮) এ, কে,এম, লুৎফর রহমান গনের নাম প্রত্যাহার প্রসংগে আবেদন </strong><br/><strong>বিনীত নিববেদন এই যে, হয়রানীমূলক ভাবে উপরোও্র ব্যও্রিগনকে অত্র মোকদ্দমায় আসামী করা হইয়াছে হেতু  গণপ্রজাতÇএী বাংলাদেশ সরকারের স্বরাষ্ট্র মÇএনালয় উল্লেখিত সুত্রে উল্লেখিত আসামীদের নাম প্রত্যাহারের সিদ্ধা¿¹ প্রদান করি|যাছেন  তৎকারনে অত্র মামলা হইতে উপরোও্র আসামীগনের নাম ফৌঃ কাঃ বিধির ৪৯৪ ধারা মোতাবেক প্রত্যাহার করিয়া লওয়া আবশ্যক </strong><br/><strong>বিধায় প্রার্থনা অনুগ্রহ পূর্বক উপরোক্ত কারনে ও অবসÛাধীনে ফৌঃ কাঃ বিধির ৪৯৪ ধারা মোতাবেক আসামীগনের নাম প্রত্যাহার করিবার যথাবিহীত আদেশ দানে সুবিচার করিতে হুজুরের মর্জি হয় </strong><br/><strong>এতদ্বসংগে অত্র দরখাসে¹র সংগে গণপ্রজাত¿»ী বাংলাদেশ সরকারের স্বরাষ্ট্র ম¿»নালয়ের প্রেরিত স্বারকের কপি সংযুক্ত করা হইল </strong></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>পাবলিক প্রসিকিউটর</strong><br/><strong>গাইবান্ধা</strong><br/><strong>৩১/১০/২০০৬ইং</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The learned Public Prosecutor filed the above quoted application stating only reason that the case is harassing one and as such the Government has decided to withdraw the case from prosecution against the accused persons.

On perusal of the First Information Report and the Police Report as well as deposition of the prosecution witnesses, we find that the accused-opposite parties were involved in the cause of death of the victims and injuries to other witnesses.<br/> <br/>The learned Sessions Judge, Gaibandha allowed the prayer observing as follows:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>এই নরহত্যার মামলায় এজাহারে সুনির্দিষ্টভাবে উল্লেখ আছে যে এজাহারে উল্লিখিত আসামীগন জামাত ও শিবির চত্র্রের আসামী মোঃ গোলাম মোস¹ফা, জালাল, আঃ রউফ, শাহ আলম, আবু বককর, বাবর আলী, ফারুক ও এ, কে, এম, লুৎফর রহমান এর বিরুদ্ধে মামলা প্রত্যাহারের বিষয়ে সরকার সিদ্ধাগ্রহন করিয়াছে  উক্ত সিদ্ধাটি স্বঃ মঃ (আইন-১) মাঃ প্রঃ- ৮/২০০৬/(সভা-৭)/ ৬২৮ নং স্বারক পত্রের মাধ্যমে স্বরাষ্ট মণালয় বিজ্ঞ জেলা ম্যাজিস্ট্রেটকে অবহিত করিয়াছে উক্ত সিদ্ধা  গ্রহন সংত্র্রা পত্রে উল্লেখ করা হইয়াছে যে উল্লিখিত আসামী গনের বিরুদ্ধে সাক্ষ্য প্রামাণ অপর্যাপ্ত এবং হয়রানী মুলক বিধায় সরকার তাহাদের বিরুদ্ধে মামলা প্রত্যাহারের সিদ্ধা¿¹ গ্রহন করিয়াছে  ফৌজঃ কার্য বিধির ৪৯৪ ধারার বিধান অনুযায়ী বিজ্ঞ পাবলিক প্রসিকিউটর অভিযোগ প্রত্যাহার সংত্র্রা¿¹ দরখাস¹ দাখিলের জন্য একমাত্র উপযুক্ত কর্তৃপক্ষ  মোকদ্দমার যে কোন পর্যায়ে এই ধারার অনুবলে বিজ্ঞ পাবলিক প্রসিকিউটর দরখাস¹ দাখিল করিতে পারেন  স্বরাষ্ট মণালয় অর্থাৎ সরকারের সিদ্ধার অনুবলে বিজ্ঞ পাবলিক প্রসিকিউটর বিবেচ্য এই মোকদ্দমায় দরখাস¹ দাখিল করিয়াছেন  সরকারের সিদ্ধা¹, বিজ্ঞ পাবলিক প্রসিকিউটর দাখিলকৃত দরখাস¹ এবং নথিসÛ সাক্ষীদের জবানবন্দি ও অন্যান্য দালিলিক প্রমানাদি পর্যালোচনায় বিজ্ঞ পাবলিক প্রসিকিউটরের দাখিলকৃত দরখাস¹টির সাথে দ্বিমত পোষন করিবার কোন যৌক্তিক কারণ বিদ্যমান না থাকায় উক্ত দরখাস¹টি মনজুর যোগ্য বলিয়া আমি মনে করি। </strong><br/><strong>আদেশ হয় যে,</strong><br/><strong>আসামী (১) মোঃ গোলাম মোস¹ফা, (২) জালাল, (৩) আঃ রউফ, (৪) শাহ আলম, (৫) আবু বককর, (৬) বাবর আলী, (৭) ফারুক ও (৮) এ, কে, এম লুৎফর রহমানের বিরুদ্ধে অভিযোগ প্রত্যাহার ত্র্রমে অভিযোগের দায় হইতে অব্যাহতি প্রদান করা হইল।</strong><br/><strong>অন্যান্য আসামীদের বিরুদ্ধে মামলাটি যথারীতি পরিচালিত</strong><strong> হইবে। আগামী ১৭/০১/২০০৭ইং তারিখ পরবর্তী বিচারের জন্য দিন ধার্য্য হইল। </strong><br/><br/><strong>স্বাক্ষর/ মোহম্মদ সাহাবুদ্দিন </strong><br/><strong>দায়রা জজ, গাইবান্দা</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The order shows that the basis of according permission for withdrawal from the prosecution is the desire of the Ministry of Home Affairs.  From perusal of the order we find that the learned Sessions Judge, has accorded permission mechanically without application of judicial mind. The court of law can not give its consent for withdrawal from prosecution of the accused persons  who allegedly committed offence like the present one on the ground that the case was harassing one  and evidence are insufficient and the learned Public Prosecutor can not seek withdrawal  without assigning proper reasons .<br/> <br/>We have gone through the decisions referred by the learned Advocate for the petitioner. It appears that though section 494 confers on the learned Public Prosecutor, the wide power to withdraw from the prosecution but the court has to exercise its power in relation to the facts and circumstances of the case in furtherance of cause of justice rather than as hindrance to the object of law. In those decision it has been held that the consent mentioned in section 494 is not to be given mechanically or that it should not be given merely on the asking of the learned Public Prosecutor but the court is required to exercise its function judicially before giving such consent. The learned Sessions Judge has failed to notice that in the application filed by the  learned Public Prosecutor, no proper reasons have been given and also failed to notice that in the event of discharging the accused there will be no avenue  open for the victims and persons aggrieved to ventilate their grievances. In this connection the case of Moezuddin Vs.  State reported in 59 D.L.R. (HCD)-222 may be referred to wherein their Lordships observed that,<br/> <br/>“The Additional Sessions Judge consented to the withdrawal from the prosecution of the accused opposite party No.1 merely on the ground that the Ministry of Home Affairs decided to withdraw from the prosecution. The order can not be said to be a legal one and the same is liable to be interfered with”.   Whenever a criminal offence is committed, the offender becomes liable to punishment by the State not for the purpose of affording compensation or restitution to anyone who may have been injured but as a penalty for the offence and in order to deter the commission of similar offences. <br/>So, from the Ministry’s order as well as the petition filed by the Public Prosecutor and the order of withdrawal passed by the Sessions Judge, it appears that the provision of section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has not been followed by the concerned court and there was no consideration and examination of the materials on which the Government decides withdrawal of the case. In that view of the matter we hold that such order of withdrawal can not be supported and maintained.<br/> <br/>It also appears that the Government issued the memo for withdrawal from prosecution of the aforementioned accused opposite parties no. 1 to 8, mainly on the ground of insufficient evidence but 6 PWs examined on behalf of prosecution specifically mentioned their names and clearly deposed that the accused opposite parties no. 1 to 8 have complicity and they have taken active part in the occurrence and committed offence. <br/> <br/>In the light of the aforesaid decisions and having given our anxious consideration to the materials on record we are of the opinion that the judgment and order of the learned  Sessions Judge, Gaibandha can not be said to be legal and judicious one and the same is liable to be interfered with and liable to be set aside and hence we find merit in this rule.<br/> <br/>In the result the rule is made absolute. <br/> <br/>The impugned order dated 08.11.2006  passed by of the learned Sessions Judge, Gaibandha in Sessions Case No.22 of 2005 according consent and permission to withdraw from the prosecution of the accused persons, the opposite parties No. 1 to 8 is hereby set aside.<br/> <br/>The order of stay granted at the time of issuance of the rule is hereby vacated. The accused opposite parties no. 1 to 8 namely (1) Md. Golam Mostafa (2) Jalal (3) A. Rouf (4) Shah Alam (5) Abu Bakar (6) Babar Ali (7) Faruque and (8) A.K.M Lutfur Rahman are directed to surrender before the trial court within 10 days from the date of receipt of this Judgment by the trial court. The trial court is directed to proceed with the case in accordance with law and conclude the trial expeditiously considering long pendency of the case without allowing any adjournment.<br/> <br/>Communicate the Judgment at once to the court concerned.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.<br/><br/>Reference: 4 LNJ (2015) 82.</strong></div></div></div>

Manjur Murshed, Deputy Director, Anti Corruption Commission, Coordinated District Office, Rajshahi, as an informant lodged a First Information Report, (FIR) with Shah Makhdum Police Station, Metropolitan, Rajshahi against one Md. Eklash Uddin as accused No. 1 and one Mr. Aminur Rahman, Manager NCC Bank Ltd., Rajshahi  as accused No. 2 alleging, <em>interalia</em>, that accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin illegally earned great deal of money amounting to Tk. 8,22,55,098.00 through committing predicate offence during the tenure of his holding the post of Cashier in Rajshahi Unnayan Kortipakhhya (RDA) and by laundering the said money through the Bank account maintained in the NCC Bank Ltd., Rajshahi with the collaboration of the accused No. 2 Manager of the said branch of NCC Bank Limited, Rajshahi Branch. Mr. Aminur Rahman upon which the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin laundered Tk. 82255098/- (eight crore twenty two lac fifty five thousand and ninety eight taka) in the name of fake businessman, thereby committed offence under section 4 (2) of the <strong>মানি লন্ডারিং প্রতিরোধ আইন, ২০০৯</strong> read with section 109 of Penal Code, 1860 since 1979. The accused  No. 1 was holding the post of Cashier in RDA at a basic salary of Tk. 9,435.00 P. M. in the scale of Tk. 5500-345 X 7-7915-eb-380 X 11-12095. In that period, the accused No. 1 illegally earned Tk. 7,68,00000 ( seven crore and sixty eight lacs) through committing predicate offence. The authority of Rajshahi Unnayan Kortipakhaya (RDA) has already lodged a criminal case against the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin, with the Shah Mokhdom Police Station, being No. 06 dated 11-07-2011 under Sections 409/486/477 of Penal Code 1860 and under Section 5 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and prior to that also sent a letter to the Bangladesh Bank, through memo No. 040.001.000. 137.000.2011-4038 dated 19-04-2011, to freeze his accounts for recovering the illegally earned money, pursuant to which the Bangladesh Bank instructed, through Memo No. AMLD-23/2011-2143-2190 dated 20.04.2011, all the scheduled Banks to stop the transaction of all Bank accounts in the name of accused No. 1 Md. Eklasuddin or in the name of his family members. Later, the Bangladesh Bank sent the report to Anti Corruption Commission regarding 31 Bank accounts in 9 banks in the name of either the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin or in the name of his six family members. The informant, thereafter, himself made an enquiry, through office order No. E/R No. 15/2011 and during the enquiry the informant found existence of different bank accounts in the name of the accused No. 1, Md. Eklas Uddin in different banks which was shown in the table described in the FIR.<br/> <br/>The accused No. 1 Eklas Uddin (not the petitioner) deposited Tk. 1,12,96000 + 51,12,500+ 51,12,500 as FDR in three different accounts in NCC Bank Ltd., Rajshahi Branch. He returned from his account No. 004103101 0014062 an amount of 2 corrore twenty two lacs to the authority of RDA and deposited twice an amount of Tk. 2,15,21,000.00 in NCC Bank for which the same is required to be deducted from the total laundered amount. The accused Md. Eklas Uddin practically deposited a total money of Tk. 11,36,87,586-3,00,61,000 =8,36,26,586 in the said NCC Bank. He purchased landed property in Mouza Gheepara through deed No. 3554 of 2009, registered in Sadar Sub Registry Office, Rajshahi by investing Tk. 6,00,000.00. During his service tenure the accused No. 1 received a total amount as salary Tk. 19,71,488 and as such he laundered an amount of total money (a) During his service tenure Tk. 8,36,26,586 (b) By purchasing wealth at Tk. 6,00,000 (c) Total (a+b)= Tk. 8,42,26,586 (d) He got total salary and allowances of Tk. 19,71,488 (e) During his service tenure he withdrawn money from his account of different bank of Tk. XXX (f) He laundered total money of Tk. (c-d-e)= Tk. 8,22,55,098. The accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin had no source of income other than the salary and allowances yet during his service tenure, since 1979 to 2011, he deposited in the Bank total amount of Tk. 11,36,87,586 in different bank among them he laundered an amount of Tk. 8,22,55,098. Now Tk. 2,35.31,622 has been freezed in different banks and he returned Tk. 2,22,00,000 to the authority of RDA. Currently, there remains a balance of Tk. 2, 35,31,622 in 21 accounts in different bank in the name of the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin and those accounts were opened during his service tenure. Among these accounts there is loan account where Tk. 5,02,276 is overdue in respect of car purchasing. During the enquiry of the informant, it appears that the accused  No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin could not have any savings out of his monthly salary of Tk. 9,435.00, after making family expenditure for his two wife and childrens. The deposited money in the Bank are illegally earned money of the accused No. 1, who procured a trade license on 14.05.2009 in the name of "Mia Khamar Bari" from Nauhat Pauroshova, Poba, Rajshahi but he is not a real businessman but service holder. The accused Eklas Uddin earned the alleged money illegally from RDA and he did not submit any documents to the NCC bank about earning of the said money. On 18.10.2009 he procured an Income Tax Identification Number being 469-106-0191 and he showed his wealth valued at only Tk. 5,05,119.00 in the fiscal year 2009-2010. He has no business, Bank balance and other property except his service, which is the lone source of his income which has been mentioned in the income tax return. In 2010-2011 fiscal, year the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin disclosed his wealth valued at Tk. 6,50,087.00. But during that time he deposited crores of money in the bank but he did not mention the same in the return. With the collaboration of the accused No. 2 Mr. Aminur Rahman, Branch Manager, NCC Bank Ltd., Rajshahi the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin opened account, being No. 0041-0310014062 on 03.06.2010 and he deposited most of the money in that account of the bank. During the enquiry it appears that on 03.06.2010 to March 2011 (in 9 months) the accused No. 1 deposited Tk. 4,55,53,00 in that account and he withdrawn Tk. 3,96,00,000 in different times from the said account of the bank. The accused No. 2 Md. Aminur Rahman Branch Manager of the said bank, did not discharge his official liability properly although suspicious transaction was taken place in that account and even the said Manager did not send any report to Bangladesh Bank of the two accounts of the accused No. 1 where Tk. 2 crores were kept as FDR.  The aforesaid Branch Manager accused No. 2, assisted the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin to launder the alleged money knowing fully his social status, service and income source.  Even though the said Branch Manager adjusted the debt of Tk. 44,72,576 as a guarantor before expiring the term loan taken by the accused No. 1, by breaching the banking regulation. The informant sent the enquiry report to the Head Office, ACC, Dhaka though Memo No. 1442 dated 24.10.2011. The accused Md. Eklas Uddin committed offence under Section 4(2) of the Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2009 read with section 109 of the Penal Code, 1860 for which the authority of  ACC, Dhaka lodged the instant case against the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin and the accused No. 2 Mr. Aminur Rahman on the basis of Memo being No<strong>. </strong><strong>দুদক/বিঃ অনুঊ ও তদ¿¹ ১/মানি লন্ডারিং/২৭-২০১১/২২৯৩৬</strong>  dated 15.11.2011 and <strong>দুদক/বিকা/বগুড়া/২২০৭</strong> dated 21.11.2011.<br/> <br/>The aforesaid FIR was registered as Shah Makhdum Police Station Case No. 07 dated 21.11.2011 corresponding to M. G. R No. 1369 of 2011 under Section 4(2) of the <strong>মানি লন্ডারিং প্রতিরোধ আইন, ২০০৯</strong> read with Section 109 of the Penal Code. The said case was investigated by the informant himself who examined the witnesses, confiscated the relevant records in the Bank and upon finding the guilt of the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin submitted charge sheet against the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas uddin and recommended for exoneration of the accused No. 2 Md. Aminur Rahman as no evidence of offence was found against him. The said charge was numbered as Shah Mukdum Police Station Charge Sheet No. 82 dated 01.10.2012 under Section 4(2) of the <strong>মানি লন্ডারিং প্রতিরোধ আইন, ২০০৯</strong> read with Section 109 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>On 04.07.2013 the said case, being Money Laundering No. 1/2012, was fixed for charge hearing whereupon the public prosecutor on behalf of the Anti Corruption Commission, Rajshahi, filed two applications, one praying for further investigation of the case stating the reason that Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit has found some other Bank accounts which are connected with the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin and through other application prayed for freezing seven accounts in the name of one Mosammat Nasrin and eight accounts in the name of the instant petitioner Md. Ariful Hoque in Marchantile Bank, Rajshahi branch and one account in the name of Sahana Pervin, the  daughter of accused No. 1, Eklas Uddin in Marchantile Bank, Satmoshjid Road     Branch, Dhaka stating that the accused Md. Eklas Uddin has interest in those bank accounts.<br/> <br/>Upon hearing the said applications the learned District and Sessions Judge, Rajshahi by his order No. 8 dated 04.07.2013 allowed the application, praying for freezing seven bank accounts in the name of Mosammat Nasrin and  eight accounts in the name of the instant petitioner Md. Ariful Hoque and one account in the name of Sahana Parvin, as aforesaid, on the ground that the financial intelligence unit  has discovered those accounts as connected with the accused   No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin. Later, the application praying for further investigation was also allowed by the order dated 09.09.2013.<br/> <br/>Challenging the said order No. 8 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Rajshahi, in Money Laundering Case No. 01 of 2012 the instant petitioner Md. Ariful Hoque filed this instant application under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and obtained the Rule.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Shah Monjurul Hoque appearing on behalf of the accused-petitioner in order to substantiate as to the maintainability of the instant application under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 submits that the petitioner has been seriously prejudiced by the impugned order which was unknown to him due to violation of the Provision of Section 14(3) of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012, since neither any gazette notification was made nor the impugned order was published in two widely circulated National News Paper. The impugned order No. 8 was passed on 04.07.2013 by the learned District and Sessions Judge, Rajshahi, and the petitioner came to know about that order on 01.09.2013 though a letter issued by a Bank Manager, in the meantime, the statutory period of 30 days for preferring appeal under Section 16 of the <strong>“</strong><strong>মানি লন্ডারিং প্রতিরোধ আইন, ২০১২</strong><strong>”</strong> has elapsed and now the petitioner has no other alternative but to file this instant application under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 for securing ends of justice. The learned Advocate Mr. Monjurul Hoque contends that the process of the Court has been abused by the impugned order No. 08 due to violation of statutory provision and as such the petitioners is entitled to invoke the inherent jurisdiction of this highest Court.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Shah Monjurul Hoque strenuously argued that the petitioner was neither an accused in the Money Laundering Case No. 01 of 2012 nor the petitioner has any connection or relationship with the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin nor any money was ever transferred from the account of the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin to the accounts of the instant petitioner nor any proof of such transfer submitted by the ACC along with the application under Section 14 of the Act. The eight bank accounts belonging to the petitioner are independent accounts of the instant petitioner, out of which seven accounts are FDR account and one is savings account and therefore, the claim of transferring money from the account of accused Md. Eklas Uddin to the account of the petitioner does not arise at all as same is inconsistent with the banking rules and practice.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Monjurul Hoque categorically argued that excepting mentioning vaguely in the application as to so called “directly or indirectly transferring money” nothing evidence was produced or stated by the ACC in the application and as such the same was not allowable under Section 14 of the Money Laundering Act, 2012.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Monjurul Hoque further vigorously argued that the order of learned District and Sessions Judge, Rajshahi  freezing the bank accounts of the petitioner is absolutely illegal and the same was passed without having any jurisdiction in as much as only the Special Judge appointed under Section 3 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 has jurisdiction to pass an order for freezing a bank account upon an application filed under Section 14 of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012. The learned District and Sessions Judge, Rajshahi did not pass the order in such capacity of Special Judge, which is apparent on the face of the order. Hence, the impugned order is liable to be quashed.<br/> <br/>On the other hand the learned Advocate Mr. Khorshed Alam Khan appearing on behalf of the Anti Corruption Commission heavily assailed the maintainability of the instant petition under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and argued that the petitioner Md. Ariful Hoque is not an accused in the Money Laundering Case No. 01 of 2012 and as such there is no <em>locus standi</em> of the petitioner to file the instant application under <em>Section</em> 561A of the of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and his relief, if any, lies in an appeal which may be filed under the Provision of Section 16 of the “<strong>মানি লন্ডারিং প্রতিরোধ আইন ২০১২</strong><strong>”,</strong> which since became time barred the instant petition under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 is not Maintainable.<br/> <br/>Mr. Khorshed Alam Khan further strenuously argued that the bank accounts of the petitioner are connected to the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin in as much as money from the accounts of the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin were transferred to eight accounts of the petitioner maintained in Marchantile Bank, Rajshahi Branch, directly or indirectly which was categorically mentioned in the application along with the submission of the report prepared by the Financial  Intelligence unit of the Government as such the learned Sessions Judge rightly passed the impugned order. The learned District and Sessions Judge, Rajshahi is a Special Judge, appointed under Section 3 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 and as such the impugned order No. 8 was lawfully passed by the Special Judge, Rajshahi. <br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Khorshed Alam Khan candidly submits that if the Rule is made absolute then an avenue will be opened through which any person may come before the High Court Division under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure without being an accused and in that case the purpose of prevention of money laundering statute will be frustrated.<br/> <br/>The learned Assistant Attorney General Mr. Md. Zakir Hossain Ripon, appearing on behalf of the State, adopted the arguments as advanced by of the learned Advocate Mr. Khoshed Alam Khan.<br/> <br/>We have heard the learned Advocate of both the parties. Perused the impugned order and other materials on record. We have also considered  the purpose and object of the money laundering prevention statute.  <br/> <br/>Admittedly, the Money laundering Case No. 01 of 2012 has been pending before senior Special Judge, Rajshahi and the impugned order No. 8 was passed not by the Senior Special Judge, Rajshahi in Money Laundering Case No. 01 of 2012 on 04.07.2013, but by the learned District and Sessions Judge, Rajshahi. Whether the learned District and Sessions Judge, Rajshahi was appointed as Special Judge, under the provision of Section 3 Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 is not the question to be considered, but question to be considered is whether the petitioner is satisfied that he has been dealt with by a proper Court as “justice not only to be done but also must be seen to have been done”. The order sheet containing the impugned order No. 8 does not show that the same was passed by the Special Judge, rather it is apparently clear that the learned District and Sessions Judge has passed the impugned order. Therefore, this Court find merit in the submissions made by the petitioner in this respect.  <br/> <br/>The Provision of Section 16 of the <strong>মানি লন্ডারিং প্রতিরোধ আইন ২০১২</strong> requires any person aggrieved by any order passed in money laundering case, to file appeal against the order within 30 days before the High Court Division. The said Provision of Section 16 of the aforesaid Act reads as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">মানি লন্ডারিং প্রতিরোধ আইন ২০১২<br/>ধারা-১৬- সম্পত্তি  অবরুদ্ধকরণ বা এ্রোক আদেশের বিরুদ্ধে আপীল- (১) এই আইনের অধীন আদালত কোন সম্পত্তির অবরুদ্ধকরণ বা এ্রোক আদেশ প্রদান করিলে উও্ররুপ আদেশের বিরুদ্ধে সংক্ষুব্ধ ব্যও্রি বা সত্তা ৩০  (এিশ) দিনের মধ্যে হাইকোর্ট বিভাগে আপীল করিতে পারিবেনz<br/>  (২) উপ-ধারা (১)   এর অধীন কোন আপীল দায়ের করা হইলে আপীল আদালত পক্ষবৃন্দকে,  শুানানীর জন্য যুও্রিসঙ্গত সময় দিয়া, শুনানী অ¿¿¹ যেইরুপ উপযুও্র মনে করিবে সেইরুপ আদেশ প্রদান করিতে পারিবেz<br/>(৩) ধারা ১৪  এর অধীন কোন সম্পত্তির বিষয়ে আদালত কর্তৃক প্রদত্ত অবরুদ্ধকরণ বা ত্র্রোক আদেশের বিরুদ্ধে কোন সংক্ষুব্ধ ব্যও্রি বা সত্তা আপীল করিলে এবং আপীল আদালত কর্তৃক ভিন্নরুপ কোন আদেশ প্রদান করা না হইলে আপীল নিষ্পত্তি না হওয়া পর্য¿¹ উও্ররুপ অবরুদ্ধকরণ বা ত্র্রোক আদেশ কার্যকর থাকিবেz</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The maintainability of the instant petition under Section 561A of the Code has been seriously assailed by the ACC on two grounds. First being that there is Appeal provision in the Statute and the 2<sup>nd</sup> being that the petitioner is not an accused in the Money Laundering Case No. 01 of 2012. Both these two grounds appears to have no merit in as much as the opposite party could not produce any evidence to show that the impugned order was published either in the official gazette or in two daily national newspaper complying the provision of Section 14 (3) of the <strong>মানি লন্ডারিং প্রতিরোধ আইন</strong> ২০১২, wherefrom it may be treated that the petitioner became aware of the fact of passing the impugned order, mandating him to avail the opportunity of preferring appeal, thereby to make the instant petition under Section 561A non-maintainable. Secondly, the learned Advocate Mr. Khorshed Alam Khan did not notice that the provision of Section 16 of the said Act entitled ‘any person aggrieved’ “ <strong>(সংক্ষুব্ধ ব্যও্রি বা সত্তা)</strong><strong>”</strong> to file an appeal before the High Court Division, subject to the fact that the “person aggrieved” is aware of such order through the published Gazette Notification or from publication in two national daily news paper. This has since not been done, the abuse of the process of the Court is apparent on the face of the circumstances, thereby entitling the petitioner to prefer an application under Section 561A of the Code in order to prevent the abuse of the process of the court. Therefore, this Court finds that the instant petition under Section 561A is squarely maintainable.<br/> <br/>Admittedly, the petitioner is not an accused in the Money Laundering Case No. 01 of 2012. Upon application,  filed by the ACC under the provision of Section 14 of the <strong>মানি লন্ডারিং প্রতিরোধ আইন ২০১২</strong><strong>,</strong> the learned District and Sessions Judge,  Rajshahi, freezed the Bank accounts of the petitioner, eight is number, by the impugned order No. 8. The contents of the application reads as follows: <br/> </div>The provision of Section 14(2) of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012 requires that the Anti Corruption Commission produce some information and evidence as to the liability under the money laundering law with the application   praying for freezing or attachment of property before the Court.

Eklas Uddin has interest in these accounts of the instant petitioner, the freezing of the accounts appear to be not legal. The legislature has protected the citizens from being harassed by any money laundering case by providing certain protection in the Provision of Section 14 of the <strong>মানি লন্ডারিং প্রতিরোধ আইন ২০১২</strong><strong>,</strong> which must be taken into consideration by trial Court when considering an application praying for freezing the bank account of a 3<sup>rd</sup> party not apparently connected to the money laundering case, to the effect that the ACC has brought <strong>“</strong><strong>ত্র্রোকযোগ্য এর সপক্ষে যুও্রি ও প্রাথমিক প্রমানাদি</strong><strong>”.</strong><br/> <br/>In the instant case the ACC has failed to mention the minimum proof as to the transfer of money from the account of the accused No. 1 Md. Eklas Uddin to the account of the instant petitioner. The ACC neither mention the account number of the accused No. 1 wherefrom the money was transferred nor mentioned the particulars of such transfer in any manner. The vague assertion that <strong>"প্রত্যক্ষ ও পরোক্ষভাবে অর্থ সহানা¿¹রিত হয়েছে"</strong> cannot be a ground for allowing an application under Section 14 of the <strong>মানি লন্ডারিং প্রতিরোধ আইন, ২০১২</strong><strong>,</strong> The financial affairs of the citizen cannot be left to the whim and caprice of ACC to raise allegation vaguely that the same has connection with any money laundering case. That being happened in the instant case, this Court finds merit in the rule and accordingly, the rule is required to be made absolute.<br/> <br/>In the result, the rule is made absolute.

No. 403 of 2006 which arose out of Badda Police Station Case No. 43 dated 28.11.2006 under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code withdrawing the opposite party no. 2 from prosecution should not be set aside and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/> <br/>By the Rule issuing order dated 24.5.2010 operation of the aforesaid impugned order dated 29.04.2010 and all further proceedings of Druto Bichar Tribunal Case No. 03 of 2009 were initially stayed for a period of 3(three) months. Thereafter it was further extended on 10.10.2010 till disposal of the Rule from the date of expiry.<br/> <br/>The facts, relevant for the purpose of disposal of this Rule, are that the petitioner as informant lodged a first information report on 28.11.2006 with Badda Police Station about killing of his younger brother Md. Mostafizur Rahman alias Sharif aged about 27 years alleging an offence under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code against 5 accused persons including the opposite party no. 2. The informant alleged that his younger brother had been living with him and running a constr-uction goods supply business. The accused persons, namely, 1) Kowsar @ Golakata Kowsar (28), 2) Babu @ Guti Babu (30), 3) Topu @ Langra (45), 4) Kala Ripon @ Kailla Ripon (26) and 5) Kailla Masud (25) were used to demand ransom from his brother. When brother of the informant Mostafizur Rahman alias Sharif denied to pay the said ransom the accused persons threatened to kill the brother of the informant. On 27.11.2006 at about 11:45 accused Topu @ Langra Topu took the brother of the informant at a place namely Sohag Tailors near Huda's House of Link Road of Comilla Para of Modhya Badda and accused Kowsar @ Galakata Kowsar and Kailla Ripon in a bid to kill the brother of the informant shot by firearms upon the head, neck and back side of the brother of informant Mustafizur Rahman. Upon hearing the gunshot and utter, the informant then and there rushed to the place of occurrence and found the accused persons were fleeing away throwing blank fire. Then the informant with the help of neighbor Ripon took his severely injured brother to a Doctor where victim was declared dead. The accused persons in a body in order to materialize their pre-plan shot his brother and killed him.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, Badda Police Station Case No. 43 dated 28.11.2006 was recorded against the accused opposite party No. 2 and other accused persons under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code which subsequently gave rise to G.R. No. 406 of 2006.<br/> <br/>Police after investigation submitted charge-sheet on 07.09.2008 against 8 accused persons including the accused opposite party No. 2 under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>When the said G.R. Case was ready for trial, it was sent to the Druto Bichar Tribunal No. 3, Dhaka for trial and disposal wherein Druto Bichar Tribunal Case No. 3 of 2009 was recorded. The Tribunal framed charge against the accused opposite party No. 2 and others under aforesaid section of the Penal Code and the prosecution in the meantime produced 11 P.Ws. in support of its case.  At this stage Government took a decision not to proceed with the case against the accused opposite party no. 2 Kowsar alias Golakata Kowsar invoking provision of section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and by the impugned order dated 24.09.2010 the Tribunal allowed the above withdrawal prayer of the prosecution.<br/> <br/>Mr. M.A. Muntakim and Mr. Abdullah-Al-Bakee, learned Advocates have appeared on behalf of the informant-petitioner. In support of the Rule the learned Advocate submitted that the Tribunal did not at all look into the gravity of the offence of the accused opposite party no. 2 as disclosed in the first information report and in the meantime 11 prosecution witnesses have already been examined and even did not take into consideration that the accused opposite party no. 2 was very much absent when he was discharged from prosecution and hence the order of the tribunal is ex-facie illegal and not tenable in law and on fact thus, it is liable to be set-aside in the interest of justice. The learned Advocate further submitted that the Tribunal failed to record essential finding while allowing the application of the learned Public Prosecutor for non prosecution of the case and as such, the order of the Tribunal was mechanical once, which is not sustainable in the eye of law.<br/> <br/>Mr. Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, learned Advocate, on the other hand, appearing on behalf of the accused-opposite party no. 2 Kowsar @ Galakata Kowsar submited that since the case is a political one and as such on consideration of the harassment of the accused opposite party No. 2 the Government has rightly taken decision to withdraw the case. Accordingly, learned Public Prosecutor placed the matter along with the decision of the Government, and the Tribunal on consideration of the submission of the Public Prosecutor passed the impugned order and thereby affirmed the decision of the Government and thus, the Tribunal did not commit any illegality in passing the impugned order.<br/> <br/>Heard the learned Advocates, of both the parties, perused the materials on record placed before us including the impugned order dated 29.4.2010 passed by the Druto Bichar Tribunal, Dhaka. Section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has given power to any Public Prosecutor to withdraw any case from the prosecution but this sort of decision should be materialized by the concerned court judiciously.  The consent mentioned in section 494 of the Code is not to be given mechanically rather the court is to exercise its function judiciously before giving such consent which implies that the court will have to examine the materials on which the Government decides withdrawal of the case. <br/> <br/>It appears from the impugned order no. 51 dated 29.04.2010 that the accused opposite party no. 2 was very much absent from the Tribunal when the Tribunal dealt with the matter and acquitted the accused opposite party No. 2 from the prosecution. But a long standing practice and decision of the Apex Court, withdrawal from  prosecution is subject to consent by the trial Judge and when the accused person or persons is/are absconding the discretions ought not to have been exercised.<br/> <br/>It also appears from the materials on record that there is a direct and specific allegation against the accused opposite party no. 2 to kill the victim Md. Mustafizur Rahman @ Sharir and upon such allegation police inquiring into the matter submitted charge-sheet against this opposite party no. 2 and others and in the meantime 11 prosecution witnesses  have been examined. But while dealing with this matter the Tribunal only held that there was a long standing dispute between the parties and the learned Public Prosecutor filed an application for withdrawal of the case thus it is allowed. No reason or ground has been assigned for the withdrawal of the case from the prosecution and there is no indication that materials were considered before taking the decision and thus the Druto Bichar Tribunal No. 3, Dhaka committed illegality in allowing the withdrawal under the given circumstances of the instant case.<br/> <br/>In the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the instant case, now let us consider whether on the basis of the decision of the Government the case can be allowed to be withdrawn. It appears from the impugned judgment of the Druto Bichar Tribunal that it allowed withdrawal of the case   from the prosecution as a matter of course.             It is now well-settled that the Court is required to exercise its function judicially to accord withdrawal of any accused from prosecution. In other words the consent should not be given mechanically.<br/> <br/>Above view of ours finds support in the case of Sreemati Prativa Rani Dey Vs. Dr. Mohammad Yousuf reported in 52 DLR(AD) 8 wherein their Lordships observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"It further appears that the accused persons in this case are all along absconding. And while they are still absconding the Government decided to withdraw from the prosecution which was allowed. It is now well settled that such withdrawals subject to consent by the trial Judge and when the accused persons are still absconding the discretion ought not to have been exercised by the Divisional Special Judge in the present case.</em><br/><em>It is well settled that the consent mentioned in section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not to be given mechanically. The Court is to exercise its function judicially before giving such consent which implies that the Court will have to examine the materials on which the Government decides withdrawal of a case."</em></div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the facts and circumstances of the instant case and in the impugned order it appears that the learned Tribunal without giving any reason, just on taking into consideration of the Memo of the Ministry of Home Affairs filed by the learned Public Prosecutor, mechanically allowed the same as like as a routine work and accorded permission for non prosecution which is neither sustainable in law nor maintainable on the facts of the given case.<br/> <br/>In view of what has been stated above we find merit in this Rule, and thus the Rule should be made absolute.<br/> <br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute.<br/> <br/>The impugned order No. 51 dated 29.4.2010 passed by the Druto Bichar Tribunal No. 3, Dhaka in Druto Bichar Case No. 03 of 2009 arising out of G.R. No. 403 of 2006 which arose out of Badda Police Station Case No. 43 dated 28.11.2006 under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code then pending in the Druto Bichar Tribunal No. 3, Dhaka is hereby set-aside.<br/> <br/>The order of stay granted at the time of issuance of the Rule and its subsequently extention stands recalled and vacated.<br/> <br/>The Druto Bichar Tribunal No. 3, Dhaka is directed to conclude the trial in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>The opposite party No. 2 Kowsar @ Galakata Kowsar son of Md.

The plaintiff’s case, in brief, is that the schedule land belonged to the defendant No.1, who proposed to sell the same to the plaintiff and  plaintiff agreed to purchase the same at a consideration of Tk. 81,00,000/-and the defendant No.1 received  Tk. 10,00,000/- as earnest money and a registered bainapatro dated 08.10.2009 was executed between them. It was stipulated that balance consideration of Tk. 71,00,000/- would be paid within 07.04.2010 and after receipt of the balance consideration, the defendant would execute and  register sale deed in favour of the plaintiff. But the defendant took time on various pretexts and the plaintiff on 30.03.2010 approached the defendant to execute and register the sale deed but the defendant No. 1 delayed the matter for going to perform Hajj and thereafter, the plaintiff on December, 2010 again approached the defendant to execute and register the sale deed as per terms of the bainapatro. But the defendant denied to execute the same, which constrained the plaintiff to file the suit for specific performance of contract. After filing the suit the plaintiff filed an application for injunction under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/>The petitioner entered appearance and on 15.04.2012 filed an application under Order 7 Rule 11 (d) of the Code of Civil Procedure praying for rejection of plaint stating inter alia that the plaintiff failed to deposit the balance consideration money amounting to Tk. 71,00,000/- at the time of filing of the suit and as such the plaint is liable to be rejected.   <br/> <br/>The plaintiff prayed for adjournment for filing written objection against the prayer for rejection of the plaint and also prayed for 1 months time to deposit the balance consideration of bainapatro. Accordingly, on 26.04.2012 the date was fixed for filing written objection against the application for rejection of plaint filed by the defendant. But the plaintiff again sought for adjournment and next date was fixed on 10.05.2012 and on that date the plaintiff filed an application under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure to allow him to deposit the balance consideration of the bainapatro and the learned Joint District Judge, by his impugned order dated 10.05.2012 allowed the plaintiff to deposit the balance consideration and the next date was fixed on 06.06.2012 for filing written objection and hearing the application for rejection of plaint.<br/> <br/>Against the said order dated 10.05.2012 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, the defendant approached this Court and the Rule was issued and order of stay was passed as stated above.<br/> <br/>Mr. Khijir Ahmed, learned Advocate appearing with Mr. Dider Alom on behalf of the defendant- petitioner submits that the very specific provision of proviso (b) of section 21A of the Specific Relief Act, provides that the balance consideration is required to be deposited at the time of filing of the suit for specific performance of contract and as such there is no scope for a purchaser to make deposit of the balance consideration money beyond the statutory period of limitation. Consequently, allowing the plaintiff to make deposit of balance consideration money is liable to be set-aside as being barred under section 21A of the Specific Relief Act.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate for the petitioner submits further that the defendant filed an application for rejection of plaint invoking Order 7 Rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure and the learned Joint District Judge, by his order dated 15.04.2012 fixed for hearing the said application for rejection of plaint and kept the application in the record filed by the plaintiff praying time for depositing balance consideration. But subsequently on 10.05.2012 the learned Joint District Judge, most illegally allowed the plaintiff to deposit the balance consideration of the bainapatro which is tantamount to rejection of the application for rejection of plaint filed by the defendant-petitioner.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate for the defendant-petitioner lastly submits that the plaint is liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule II(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure as the plaintiff failed to make statutory deposit at the time of filing of the suit.<br/> <br/>In support of his submission the learned Advocate for the petitioner placed reliance on the case of Imran (Md) Vs.- Shamim Kamal and others reported in 60 DLR (2008) 597.<br/> <br/>None appears for the plaintiff-opposite party No. 1 although notice has been served upon him.<br/> <br/>We have heard the learned Advocate for the petitioner, perused the impugned order and other materials on record and have gone through the decision referred to, wherefrom it transpires that the suit was filed on 19.01.2011 without depositing the balance consideration of the registered bainapatro dated 08.10.2009 and the plaintiff for the 1<sup>st</sup> time on 15.04.2012 prayed 1months time for depositing the balance consideration. In the meantime the defendant filed an application for rejection of plaint and the learned Joint District Judge, ought to have taken a decision about maintainability of the suit at first. But it appears that the learned Joint District Judge, without hearing the application for rejection of plaint allowed the plaintiff to deposit the balance consideration of the bainapatro upon allowing an application filed by the plaintiff under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure by his impugned order dated 10.05.2012 and fixed 6.6.2012 for depositing the balance consideration of contract. But the specific provision of section 21A of the Specific Relief Act provides that the balance consideration money is required to be deposited at the time of filing of the suit.<br/> <br/>The Specific Relief Act, 1877 has been amended by adding section 21A by Act 27 of 2004 which runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“21A. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Act or any other law for the time being in force, no contract for sale of any immovable property can be specifically enforced unless-</em><br/><em>(a) the contract is in writing and registered under the Registration Act, 1908, whether or not the transferee has taken possession of the property or any part thereof; and</em><br/><em>(b) the balance amount of conside-ration of the contract is deposited in the court at the time of filing the suit for specific performance of contract.”</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">The above amended provision of section 21A of the Specific Relief Act, came into effect from 1.7.2005.<br/> <br/>In view of the language used in section 21A of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (as amended) with a non-obstinate clause the ouster of jurisdiction is manifestly clear in entraining suit for specific performance of contract filed after 01.07.2005 without depositing the balance consideration money in the court at the time of filing of the suit.<br/> <br/>In the instant case admittedly the contract for sale was registered on 8.1.2009 and the suit was filed on 19.1.2011 without depositing the balance consideration of the contract. Now the question is whether non-depositing of the balance consideration of the contract at the time of filing of the suit, the plaint is liable to be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure or in other words whether the plaintiff is entitled to make deposit the balance consideration of the contract long after filing of the suit. On a careful reading of section 21A of the Specific Relief Act it appears that the provision for depositing the balance consideration money is a condition precedent failing which it would not be possible to enforce the contract by filing a suit.<br/> <br/>We find support of the above contention in the case of Imran (Md) Vs- Shamim Kamal and others reported in 60 DLR 597. In the said reported decision it has been held that:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“The very specific provisions of section 21A(b) provides that the</em><em> balance</em><em> consideration money is required to be deposited at the time of filing of the suit. In view of the above there is no scope for a purchaser to make deposit of the consideration money beyond the statutory period of limitation. Consequently the application submitted for allowing the plaintiff appellant to make deposit of the balance consideration money is rejected as being time barred.”</em></div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Similar views were also expressed in the case of Faquir Ashraf Vs.- Mrs. Bilkis Banu reported in 2 ALR (2012) 21.<br/> <br/>In the above facts and circumstances of the case, the provisions of law, and the decisions referred to above, we hold that after the amendment of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 by Act No. XXVII of 2004 incorporating a new section, namely, section 21A which came into effect from 1<sup>st</sup> July, 2005 and the same being a mandatory provision of law the plaintiff has no other alternative but to deposit the balance amount of the consideration money of the contract in the court below at the time of filing of the suit, and the same having not been deposited in the court at the time of filing of the suit, the court below most illegally allowed the plaintiff to deposit the balance considera-tion of the contract and thereby the court below committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/>In the above facts and circumstances of the case and the provision of law, we find merit in the Rule. Accordingly, the Rule is made absolute however without any order as to costs. The impugned order dated 10.05.2012 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, Chandpur in Civil Suit No. 6 of 2011 is hereby set-aside.<br/> <br/>Now the question is whether the plaint of the suit is liable to be rejected as submitted by the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/> <br/>Although allowing the plaintiff to deposit the balance consideration money of the contract is tantamount to rejection of the application filed by the defendant for rejection of plaint, the settled principle of law is that the question of maintainability of the suit should be decided at first. We have already decided that the plaintiff is not competent to deposit the balance consideration of the registered contract long after filing of the suit, so we have to consider the question of maintainability of the suit as well.<br/> <br/>It is well settled that the rejection of plaint is not confined to the provision of Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In an appropriate case while the proceeding itself is barred or an abuse of the process of the court, the court having recourse of section 151 will be competent to reject the plaint.<br/> <br/>Moreover, when the ultimate result of the suit is as clear as day light such suit should be buried at its inception. So that no further time is consumed in fruitless litigation.Thus we feel it proper to reject the plaint of the suit as it is barred under section 21A of the Specific Relief of Act, 1877.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the plaint of Civil Suit No. 6 of 2011 pending in the court of learned Joint District Judge, Chandpur is rejected under section 151 of the Code read with under Order VII Rule II(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/>Send copy of this judgment to the learned Joint District Judge, Chandpur.<br/>       <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reference: 4 LNJ (2015) 157.</strong></div></div></div>

Rezaul Hasan, J. </u></strong><br/> <br/>This Rule has arisen out of the petition for drawing up contempt proceeding, filed by the petitioner, against the accused-contemner Mr. S.O.M. Kalimullah, Managing Director, Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Limited (BTCL) and 3 other officials of BTCL, alleging, amongst other that, this contempt petition is directed against the contemner-opposite parties, for committing contempt of this Court, by not obeying this Court’s order dated 23<sup>rd</sup> of July, 2013 as regards admitting a new Bank Guarantee and adjust with the previous bank Guarantee and to return back the remaining amount to the petitioner; that the contemner-opposite party No. 1 Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as BTCL) is a company incorporated under the Companies Act 1994  represented by (1)  Mr. S.O.M. Kalimullah, Managing Director, BTCL , son of late Mohammad Dayem Mia, 28/2, Baily Road, Dhaka-1000,  No. 2 Mr. Md. Bahadur Ali, Member (Finance) of BTCL,  No. 3 Mr. Md. Moyez Mollah, Director (Finance &amp; Accounts) of BTCL,  and  No.4 Mr. Shah Farid,  son of late Saiful Islam, Deputy Director (Accounts-1), Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited of 37/E, Eskaton Garden, Telejogajog Bhaban, Dhaka; that the petitioner in the course of business furnished a Bank Guarantee being BG No. IFIC/ STOCK/BG /07/2011 dated 04.05.2011 issued by IFIC Bank Limited for TK. 14,000,000.00 (One crore forty lac) with BTCL; that during the continuance of the business, without having reasonable cause, BTCL has asked the IFIC Bank Limited to encash the said Bank Guarantee; that the amount (USD83,142.33 = BDT68,17,617.00) claimed by BTCL was a disputed one and also much less than the amount of the said Bank Guarantee for Tk.1.40 crore; that this petitioner, having no other alternative, sought relief from this Court for justice; that upon hearing the grievance of the petitioner, this Court was pleased to pass order of injunction, on 30.10.2012, against the encashment of the Bank Guarantee by the BTCL; that as the disputed amount was much less than the amount of the Bank Guarantee, the petitioner filed a petition for reducing the said Bank Guarantee; that the petitioner in its petition applied for reducing the amount of the Bank Guarantee upto the disputed amount and to return the rest of the amount to the petitioner; that upon hearing the petition, this Court was pleased to pass an order on 23.07.2013. In the said order it is clearly stated that, “Accordingly the petition to reduce the amount of Bank Guarantee from TK. 14,000,000.00 is allowed and the petitioner is permitted to submit a fresh Bank Guarantee, containing similar terms and conditions, for Tk. 68,17,617.00 in favour of the BTCL and then to withdraw the existing one and to renew the same from time to time, till the dispute is resolved finally.”; that thereafter the said order passed by this Court was communicated to BTCL and IFIC Bank; that having knowledge of the said order, <u>the IFIC Bank Limited issued a fresh Bank Guarantee being No. IFIC/ STOCK /BG/05/2013 dated 01.10.2013 for BDT.68, 17,671.00 (Sixty Eight Lac Seventeen Thousand Six Hundred and Seventy One Taka) only on A/C of the petitioner complying this Court order and sent the same to BTCL for acknowledgement vide letter No. IFICB/ ADV/BG /2013/1973 dated 30.09.2013</u>. But it is very unfortunate that the BTCL had neither crried out this Court’s order, nor acknowledged the Bank Guarantee issued by the IFIC Bank Limited; that the conduct and attitude of the BTCL towards the order passed by this Court certainly falls under the offence of Contempt of the court. The said Bank Guarantee and letter for acknowledgement dated 30.09.2013 is annexed herewith this petition as “annexure: “B” and “B(1)”; that it is pertinent to mention here, that despite the fact that the contemners are very much aware of the concerned order, they have shown utmost disregard to the order passed by this Court and that this conduct amounts to gross Contempt of this Court; that the contemners-opposite parties are guilty of contempt of Court; that almost 6 (Six) months have already been elapsed but the said order by this Court has not been complied with as yet; that, instead of complying the said order, the contemner-opposite parties have sent a letter being No. IAS/8-6/2011/67 dated 30.09.2013 to IFIC Bank Limited by clearly stating that “We would like to inform you that BTCL has objection regarding reduce the amount of Bank Guarantee Tk. 14,000,000.00 (One crore forty lac) and we will inform you in this regard later on.” that BTCL was given reasonable time, by this court, by an order dated 13.6.2014, to submit their objection, if any, within which they did neither appear nor show any cause, and, in the result, this Court was pleased to passed the said order dated 23.07.2013 for the petitioner; that abovementioned reply by BTCL certainly poses a serious challenge to the dignity, authority and majesty of this Court as well as to the  rule of law; that the said letter dated 30.09.2013 is annexed herewith as “Annexure: “C”; that it is settled principle of law that “Disobedience to or failure to obey an interim order constitutes contempt of Court; that there can be no laxity in such a situation because otherwise the Court orders would become the subject of mockery.” It is also a settled principle of law that “Undue delay in complying with the judgment of the Court may render a party guilty of contempt of Court,” that it is crystal clear that the contemner-opposite parties could never be able to show any reasonable cause regarding the non-compliance of the Court order; that the contemner-opposite parties were given a legal notice dated 23.11.2013 as a caution so that they without making any further delay comply with the said order of this court; that even then the contemner-opposite parties have not taken any positive step towards the compliance of the Court order. The copy of the legal notice is annexed as “Annexure: “D” (underlining is mine).<br/> <br/>Upon hearing the said petition, and having considered the relevant materials on record, this court found a prima facie case to issue a Rule. Hence, a rule was issued, on 23.01.2014, against the accused-contemner Nos. 1 and 4 in the following terms:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Accordingly, let a Rule be issued upon the contemner-respondents No.1. Mr. S.O.M. Kalimullah Managing Director, Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Limited (BTCL), Telejogajog Bhaban, 37/E, Eskaton Garden, Dhaka-1000 and (2) Mr. Shah Farid, Deputy Director (Accounts-1), Bangladesh Telecomm-unication Company Limited (BTCL), Telejogajog Bhaban 37/E, Eskaton Garden, Dhaka-1000, to show cause as to why the proceedings for contempt of court shall not be drawn up against  them for writing letter No.IAS/8-6/2011/67 dated 30.9.2013 signed by Md. Shah Farid  (Contemner No.2), with the approval of the contemner No.1, that prima-facie shows willful and flagrant violation of  order dated 23.7.2013 passed by this Court and amounts to committing contempt of court  in the manner specified herein above and as to why they should not be convicted for committing contempt of court and be sentenced to suffer imprisonment and be fined   for such term and/or for such amount, as this court may deem fit and proper.<br/>The contemners are directed to appear before this court, in person, to answer the Rule on 19.2.2014 at 10-30 A.M. It should also be noted that, should the contemners fail to appear in person, a warrant of arrest may be issued to secure their presence, in Form No.1 (contempt), Appendix-III, of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, (High Court Division) Rules, 1973.<br/>I find no prima-facie case, at this stage, against 2(two) other persons alleged to have committed contempt. So, no Rule is issued, at this stage, against them.<br/>This matter will appear in the cause list on 19.2.2014.<br/>Let a copy of this order, enclosing the contempt petition, be served upon the Respondent-contemners through special messenger at the cost of the petitioner.”<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">The contemner No. 1 and 2 have appeared in person before this Court and have filed an affidavit, sworn on 10.04.2014, through their learned advocate Mr. Rais Uddin Ahmed, stating that the contemners-opposite parties have already complied with this court’s order, vide a letter dated 12.02.2014 (Annexure-1), sought unconditional apology and further stating that the contemners undertake that they will not do such act in future and that they express their deep regrets, without any attempt on their part to justify their conduct, and beg to submit that they have got their highest respect towards the Court and that they, under no circumstances, had any remotest intent to show any disrespect to the Court.<br/> <br/>Considering the importance and anxiety of this Court in the matter of contempt of court, and also having taken into consideration the caution uttered in 1 DLR (1949) 177, Mr. Rafique-ul Huq (Senior Advocate), Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud (Senior Advocate), Mr. Ajmalul Hossain QC (Senior Advocate), Dr. Kazi Aktar Hamid (Advocate) and Mr. Manzil Murshid (Advocate), were appointed as amicus curiae, particularly to reflect upon the contempt jurisprudence, in the facts and circumstances of this case, as well as to reflect upon (1) as to whether the act of contempt of court committed by  persons who are parties to the proceeding before the court and by  persons who are not parties to the proceeding shall be weighed on the same scale and (2) as to whether unconditional apology shall be accepted in all cases as if it is a matter of routine job for this court.<br/> <br/>The learned advocate Mr. Aneek R. Huq, appearing for the petitioner, having placed the rule and the petition for drawing up contempt proceeding, first of all submits that the petitioner had filed an application, in Arbitration Application No. 27 of 2012, for reducing the amount of bank guarantee issued in favour of BTCL, from Tk. 1,40,00,000.00 to Tk. 68,17,671.00, being the amount claimed by the BTCL, vide their letter dated 22.10.2012. This Court, having received and heard the application, passed an order, on 13.06.2013, requiring BTCL to show cause as to why the bank guarantee amount shall not be reduced as prayed for by the petitioner and further ordered to keep this petition on record, for hearing, so that this Court may arrive at a decision after perusal of the BTCL’s statements / explanation that was called for by the Court and the Court had also directed that this order dated 13.06.2013 shall be served upon BTCL through special messenger and 21.07.2013 was fixed as the next date. In the Court’s order dated 13.06.2013 it was also recorded that should BTCL fails to show any cause against the prayer for reduction of the amount of the bank guarantee, then the court shall presume that BTCL has no objection in reducing the amount of the bank guarantee to the amount in excess of their claim. He next submits that, although BTCL has received the order dated 13.6.2013, served upon them through special messenger on 14.7.2013, they however, did not come up with any explanation or objection to the prayer for reducing the amount of bank guarantee. Accordingly, this Court has passed an order on 23.07.2013, in the said Arbitration Application No. 27 of 2012, reducing the amount of the bank guarantee from Tk.1,40,00,000.00 to Tk.68,17,617.00, i.e. conversion of the disputed amount equivalent to USD83,142.33. The BTCL did not come up, he continues, even thereafter, either to modify or to review the aforesaid order dated 23.07.2013 passed by this Court, nor they went to the Appellate Division against the said order dated 23.7.2013. As such, the order dated 23.7.2013 has become final and conclusive and the contemners were legally bound to comply with the same. But, to the utter surprise of the petitioner and in an unprecedented manner, the contemner No. 1 and 2 have refused to obey the Court’s order dated 23.7.2013 by writing a letter No. IAS/8-6/2011/67, dated 30.09.2013, to the Manager, IFIC Bank, Stock Exchange Branch, annexed as Annexure-C to the petition for drawing up contempt proceeding. He next submits that the said letter was signed by the accused contemner Mr. Shah Farid, Deputy Director (Accounts-1), BTCL (herein after referred to as the contemner No. 2), with the approval of the then Managing Director BTCL (contemner No.1). In that letter it has been stated that BTCL has objection regarding reduction of the Bank Guarantee. The petitioner had issued a legal notice dated 19.11.2013 (Annexure-D) calling upon the contemners to complying with this courts order dated 23.07.2013, but they have not at all pay any heed to the same as well, to show the degree of their arrogance and disrespect to this court order, he adds. The learned advocate further submits that the petitioner being a party to the proceedings and they having received the Court’s order dated 13.07.2013 as well as being aware of this Court’s order dated 23.7.2013, they have deliberately flouted this Court’s order dated 23.7.2013, by refusing to obey the same, vide their letter dated 30.09.2013 (Annexure-C). The conduct of the contemners amounts to willful defiance of this Court’s order, whereby they have chosen to act according to their own decision in clear disregard of the Court’s order dated 23.7.2013, he points out. Such act of willful disregard of the order of the highest Court of the country, he proceeds, is not only unprecedented, but it is a foreshadow of the reign of lawlessness to begin and this kind of conduct can never be indulged by this court in the interest of justice and to protect the dignity and authority of this Court passing orders of binding character as contemplated in Article 112 read with Article 108 of the Constitution. He also submits that the unconditional apology offered by the contemners is not a sincere one and it has been offered only to avoid the consequence of the offending conduct of the contemners. In support of his case, the learned advocate has cited the decisions reported in 35 DLR (AD) 290: Moazzem Hossain DAG Vs. State; 1 DLR (1949) 177: Crown Vs. Moulvi Abdul Rashid Tarkabagish; 38 DLR (AD) 188: Abdul Karim Vs. State; 44 DLR (AD) 237: Shamsur Rahman vs. Tahera Nargis; AIR 1983 SC 1151: Ashram M Jain Vs. A T Gufta and AIR 1984 (SC) 1374: LD Jaidwal Vs. State of UP and prayed for imprisonment of the contemners awarding the highest terms and for imposing exemplary fine, which is just and proper in this case, so that the would be violators of this Court’s order can be dettered from committing contempt of court so grievous in nature.<br/> <br/>The learned advocate Mr. Rais Uddin Ahmed, appearing for the contemner Nos. 1 and 2, submits that the contemners have offered unconditional apology and further submits that the contemners even do not justify their conduct on any excuse whatever, that they have full respect to the Court and they will never repeat such conduct in future. He also adds that, indeed, the contemners No. 1 and 2 were misguided by a letter No. IFCB/STOCK/ CREDIT/2013/1888, dated 16.09.2013 of the Manager, IFIC Bank, Stock Exchange Branch. Accordingly, he has prayed for exemption of these two contemners from the charge of contempt of court brought against them.<br/> <br/>Having considered the contents of the letter dated 16.09.2013, Reference No. IFCB/STOCK/CREDIT/2013/1888, of the Manager, IFIC Bank, addressed to BTCL, this Court has issued a separate Rule upon one Mr. Helal Ahmed, Manger, IFIC Bank Limited, Stock Exchange Branch, 16 Motijheel C/A, Dhaka-1000, on 21.05.2014. That Rule, forming part of the same cause of action, is to be disposed of simultaneously with the instant Rule.<br/> <br/>The Rule issued upon Mr. Helaluddin Ahmed on 21.5.2014 read as follows:<br/> <br/>“In the course of argument made in contempt petition No. 2 of 2014 (arising out of Arbitration Application No. 27 of 2012) it has been pointed out by the learned advocate for the petitioner as well as the learned advocate for the contemner that a letter No. IAS/8-6/2011/67 dated 30.09.2013, addressed by the Contemner No. 2 to IFIC Bank Limited, Stock Exchange Branch, 16, Motijheel C/A, Dhaka-1000, reference has been made to a letter No. IFCB/ STOCK/CREDIT /2013/1888 dated 16.09.2013. In that letter one Mr. Helal Ahmed, VP &amp; Relationship Manager, IFIC Bank Limited, Stock Exchange Branch, Motijheel C/A, Dhaka-1000, asked BTCL as to whether BTCL had any objection regarding a fresh Bank guarantee for the reduced amount (as per order dated 23.7.2013 of this court).<br/> <br/>Since, by an order dated 21.07.2013, this court has allowed the application for reduced Bank guarantee, so it was legal duty of all concerned to abide by the said order, which had acquired finality and become conclusive, since no petition to modify the said order was filed before this court, nor any appeal against said order was preferred before the Appellate Division. In the facts and circumstance recorded above, said Mr. Helal Ahmed, has prima facie, committed contempt of court by bluntly asking BTCL as to whether BTCL had any objection regarding a fresh guarantee with the reduced amount, knowing it fully well that this order was passed by the Supreme Court and it was duty of all to abide by the court’s order dated 23.07.2013 and to the act in aid of the Supreme Court, instead of preventing the course of justice or rendering the courts’ order ineffective or nullity or ridicule the court by undermining its authority. Hence, I considered it indispensable to issue a Suomoto Rule upon aforesaid Mr. Helal Ahmed, VP &amp; Relationship Manager, IFIC Bank Limited, Stock Exchange Branch, 16, Motijheel C/A, Dhaka-1000, to show cause as to why he should not convicted for committing contempt of Court, in the manner herein above stated, and be sentenced to suffer imprisonment and be fined for such term and/or for such amount, as this court may deem fit and proper.<br/> <br/>The contemner is directed to appear in person before this court on 29.05.2014 at 10.30 a.m. in person.<br/> <br/>All the learned Amicus Curiae have made their invaluable submissions, in the course of which they have cited relevant decisions and have also referred to the relevant Articles of the Constitution and of the law, duly noted by this Court.<br/> <br/>The learned Amicus Curiae Mr. Rafique-Ul Huq, in the course of his submission, has made it clear that the act of contempt committed by persons who are parties to the proceeding is, no doubt, more grave in nature and is punishable accordingly. However, he has made it a point that, in the disposal of the rule the court should ascertain, on the facts and circumstances of each case, as to whether the apology offered by the petitioner is true-hearted or not. When attention of the learned Amicus Curiae was drawn to the cases reported in 1 DLR (1949) 177, 44 DLR (AD) 237 and in the AIR 1984 SC 1374, the learned Amicus Curiae has unhesitantly asserted that the views taken in those decisions, indeed, represents the correct views on the contempt jurisprudence and provides valuable guideline in arriving at decision by tis court in a contempt proceeding.<br/> <br/>Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud, learned Amicus Curiae, has made his submission at length. He has also referred to the cases reported in 44 DLR (AD) 237, 1 DLR (1949) 177, AIR 1984 SC 1374, 18 DLR SC 124 and 34 DLR 223. <u>In the facts and circumstances of this case, the learned Amicus Curiae submits that, this is a clear case of defying this court’s order by the parties to the proceeding. The learned amicus curiae has posed a question as to how the contemner No. 2 has issued this letter dated 30.09.2013, raising objection to the courts order dated 23.07.2013, after long time having been ran away since the order was passed and, moreso, when the contemnors were very much aware of the order flouted by them</u>. He next submits that the court shall take decision based on the facts and circumstances peculiar to this case. He also submits that, the court has heard at length the application, in which the petitioner prayed for reduction of the bank guarantee amount and the contemners were asked by an order dated 13.6.2013,  to show cause within stipulated time, as to why the guarantee amount should not be reduced and further recorded that the court shall presume that the BTCL has no objection in reducing the bank guarantee amount if they default in showing any cause, . <u>As such, it was duty of the contemner to abide by the Court’s order, to show cause, as called for by this court. But, they did not come up to show cause against the reduction prayed for,  neither they had come before this court for setting aside or modifying the order dated 23.07.2013, nor they had preferred any appeal against the said order before the Appellate Division and, in consequence, the said order has acquired finality. They have no scope to raise any objection as if a supra body to the apex court. If apology is accepted in such a case, he submits, then it would destroy the social fabric, the litigating people will be deprived of the fruits of a proceedings decided in their favour and the rule of law will never get rooted in this country.</u> This is a case, the learned Amicus Curiae continues, where the contemners have offered apology to avoid the consequence of committing so clear a case of contempt of court. Therefore, in this case, he maintains, the apology offered must be rejected, in the light of the ratio laid down in 44 DLR (AD) 237: Shamsur Rahman Vs. Tahera Nargis. <u>Referring to the alarming speed of escalation of contemptuous attitude in certain quarters, the learned advocate further submits that, the court should not act mechanically to make it a routine job to accept the apology offered by the contemner</u>s<u>. He has, rather, emphasised, that the letters and spirit of Article 112 of the Constitution should be respected and upheld by all quarters, government and nongovernment</u>. Otherwise judgments and order of this court will have no binding character or effect, rendering the entire system of administration of justice a mere nullity. <u>Moreover, he continued that, as has been laid down in 1 DLR (1949) 177: Crown Vs. Moulvi Abdul Rashid Tarkabagish, this case is glaring instance that shows how much correct was the apprehension of the learned Judge expressed in 1 DLR (1949) 177</u>.<u> He has concluded submitting that, this case justifiably warrants punishment for contempt, least to ensure an ordered society, based on rule of law, to exist and that the law abiding people should not loose their trust in the authority of this court or in the system of administration of justice.</u> (underlining is mine)<br/> <br/>Learned Amicus Curiae Mr. Ajmalul Hossain Q.C., commenced his submission, first of all, by addressing the issue if this Court shall, in all cases, accept the unconditional apology offered by the contemners. <u>He maintains, that, the fact of offering apology by the Court per se proves commission of the offence of contempt and, in that event, no further investigation is required as to the factum of contempt. This alone gives rise to the liability for committing contempt</u>. Investigation relates to ascertaining the guilt and punishment relates to the consequence, once the liability is established, he continues. <u>Apology offered, he further submits, may be taken as a mitigating factor, but not to discharge the offenders from their liability, though it is within discretion of this court to decide whether the contemners will be exonerated and, if not, to ascertain the quantum of the punishment</u>. The contemners had chance to avoid the act of committing contempt, he adds, by showing cause, as called for by this court, or by coming up with an appropriate application for review or modification; but they did  neither. Nor they went to the Appellate Division which they ought to have done had they had any fear of consequence of flouting this Court’s order. No one can escape the obligation to comply with this Court’s order as long as it exists. He also submits that this Courts order, even if it were wrong or without jurisdiction, is binding on all concerned till the same is set aside or vacated or modified. Once the order has been passed the accused contemners were bound to obey the same. The learned amicus curiae next submits, referring to Article 39(2) of the Constitution, that the fundamental right guaranteed in that article (regarding freedom, speech, expression and the press) is also subject to the law relating to contempt of court. <u>He then, referring to Article 7 read with Articles 39(2) and 108 of the Constitution, submits that the provisions of these Articles, considered together and with reference to the scheme of the Constitution, make it abundantly clear that the peoples power to punish the contemner has been invested in the apex Court to be exercised by the honourable Judges  of this Court, so that the authority, dignity and majesty of this Court, is upheld, the rule of law and an ordered society can exist and the justice is secured to those who deserve. The people’s ‘will’, reflected in these Articles shall not be undermined, he emphasised</u>. He has also pointed out that the contemnors have accepted this Court’s order dated 23.07.2013, by way their conduct in abstaining from showing cause, and they are bound to obey the same, and <u>that non-compliance of this Court’s order is not a matter of option for the contemners. The unconditional apology offered, weighed in facts and circumstance of this case, has not come from heart, he adds. He has viewed, in conclusion, that this is a fit case of awarding punishment</u> (underling is mine).<br/> <br/>Learned amicus curiae Dr. Kazi Aktar Hamid, in his turn, submits that, <u>the persons obliged to obey this Court’s order can defy the same only subject to undergoing the consequences that are bound to follow</u>. If they refuse to obey or do create any obstruction in the implementation of this Court’s order then they are liable to be held guilty for and be punished for committing contempt. <u>Once this Court passes any order then it, in substance, becomes a public order and the Court has to implement the same in the public interest, none the less to maintain an ordered society as well.  So, the contemners are liable to be punished, in the facts and circumstances in this case, in the public interest and to maintain public order, trust and confidence in this Court, he emphatically argued. If this Court allows its order to be flouted in this way, as the contemners have done, then to whom the seekers of justice shall take resort to, he posed the question. Then should the people suffer injustice in despair or take the law into their own hands? He could not suppress his anxiety. Should not, inaction or indulgence on the part of this Court, in such cases, give way to the collapse of an ordered society, otherwise to be flourish and exist under our legal systems, his concern had yet to be expressed. He has asserted that, refusal to obey the Court’s order is an explicit challenge to it authority and is a breach of public order by an arrogant party having no fear in undermining and in ridiculing the authority of this Court and this cannot go unpunished with impunity</u>. He has made submission distinguishing the civil and criminal contempt.<u> He has concluded that this is a case where apology has been offered to escape the consequences and that cannot discharge the offenders and that appropriate punishment for committing criminal contempt would be justifiable, in this case, inasmuch as their conducts on their very face , constitute a challenge to the order passed by this Court and stand as obstruction to the administration of justice, which comes within the meaning of criminal contempt</u>. Towards the clarification of and supporting his contention, he has referred to the ratio of the cases reported in AIR 1983 SC 1151: Ashram M. Jain Vs. AT Gupta, AIR 1943 PC 203: 19 BLT (AD) 54: Md. Riaz Uddin Khan Vs. Mahmuder Rahman and ors and the 2011 ADC 175: Shahudul Haque, IGP &amp; another Vs. the State. He has also read out the principles laid down in those cases, duly noted by this Court (underling is mine).<br/> <br/>The leaned amicus curiae, Mr. Manzill Murshid, with reference to the Rule, the affidavit offering unconditional apology and the queries  made from the Bench, submits that, in the facts and circumstances of this case, the question is whether both the actions and the inactions of the respondents tantamount to contempt of court or not and if it does, whether acceptance of unconditional apology shall advance the cause of justice by ensuring compliance of this Court’s Order, shall uphold the rule of law or maintain the dignity of this Court as the custodian of the Constitution and protector of the Rule of law. In the present legal jurisprudence, he submits, “Contempt of Court” is nowhere defined in any statutes of the land. However, in the case of Moazzem Hossain Vs State: 35 DLR (AD) (1983) 290, 293, F. Munim, C.J. (as his lordship then was) held that, Contempt may be constituted by any conduct that brings authority of the Court into disrespect or disregard or undermines its dignity and prestige …... conduct or action causing obstructions or interfering with the course of justice is contempt. He next submits that, on the other hand, Oswald defined contempt of court as follows: “It may be said to be constituted by any conduct that tends to bring the authority and administration of law into disrespect or disregard or interfere with or prejudice parties, litigant or their witnesses during the litigation” [Contempt of Court, 1910, p.6]. He then adds that, contempt has been classified into three categories in the case of Abdul Halim (Md) vs Dr. Md. Tareque, reported in 63 DLR 465 (para-13), such as-</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">Scandalization of court</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Disobedience to the orders of the court and</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Interference with the due course of justice. In the instant case, he points out, the actions of the contemnor-respondents falls within the mischief of the last two categories.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Mr. Murshid has also cited the case of Mahbubur Rahman Sikder and ors vs Mujibur Rahman Sikder and Ors: 35 DLR (AD) 203, wherein it was held that willful disobedience to the order of the court or willful breach of the undertaking given to the court is contempt of Court.<br/> <br/>He then, referring to the facts of this case, continued that the respondent’s actions i.e. informing the IFIC Bank, vide their objection raised in their letter dated 30.09.13 (Annexure-C), as to the reduction of the amount of the Bank Guarantee (BG), is as a clear obstruction, indeed giving damn, to the order dated 23.07.13 of this Court. This refusal to comply with the courts order, when it has become final, discloses a serious case of committing contempt of court by the contemners. On the other hand, their inactions to give reply to the order to show cause as per, dated 13.06.2013 as well as non-appearance before this Court, for explaining as to why the amount of the BG shall not be reduced to BDT: 68,17,671.00, is also a clear and deliberate refusal to obey order of this Court and, moreover, ignoring the initial or first stage to avoid the contempt proceeding. The contemnor-respondents had full knowledge of the orders of this Court, and the contemners Nos. 1 and 2 have defied this Court’s order as many as on 4(four) occasions. This not only aggravates their offence, but, at the same time shows the extent of their arrogance and attitude of the contemners in showing disrespect to the authority of this court. The respondents have repeatedly shown utmost disregard towards their duty to implement the binding order of this Court and committed contempt on the face of the court, in substance. In the said premises, Mr. Murshid argues, the contemnor-respondents appeared before this court on 19.02.14 and sought unconditional apology stating that they have already complied with the order of the Court dated 23.07.13. But, this is done only after the proceedings for contempt had been initiated, by issuing a Rule.<br/> <br/>Next, in the facts and circumstances of this case, the learned Amicus Curiae, Mr. Murshid has placed series of decisions of Appellate Division in the matter of accepting of apology. In considering whether the apology should be accepted or not, the learned Amicus Curiae points out that, in the case of Abdul Karim Sarekr v the State and another: 38 DLR (AD) 188, Fazle Munim C.J. (as his lordship then was) mentioned five facts to be considered. They are:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">whether  the appellant appreciated that his act was within the mischief of contempt;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">whether he regretted it ;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">whether his regret was sincere;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">whether it was accompanied with expression of the resolution never to repeat again and</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether he made humble submission to the authority of the court.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In view of the above noted five criteria vis-à-vis their conduct, he continues, the apology of the contemnor-respondents does not seem to be sincere. Rather their apology was a paper apology ‘coming from the pen not from his heart’ as is observed in the case of L.D. Jaikwal v State of UP: AIR 1984 SC 1374, relied upon in 38 DLR (AD) 188. Since, inspite of having full knowledge of the order dated 23.07.13, the respondents have repeatedly obstructed implementation of the said order in the manner aforesaid, so the apology offered cannot be considered as sincere apology, he submits. <u>Rather, the prayer for unconditional apology has been made only, after issuance of the Rule, he points out, to escape the consequences for committing contempt. No other coherent conclusion but this can be drawn in the facts and circumstances of the instant case</u>.  The learned amicus curiae, next submits, on this issue, that in the case of The State Vs Nazrul Islam, Advocate: 37 DLR 200, (paragraph-7), it was held that a court of law will not be satisfied with a mechanical offer of an unconditional apology unless the contemnor purges himself of the offence of contempt of Court.  In the case of A.K. M.A Awal v The State: 16 DLR (SC) 429 (para-20), it was held that in contempt cases courts have never accepted the apology of a person who does not admit that he has committed any offence. What is called unconditional apology necessarily means that there should be an admission as to the commission of contempt. <br/> <br/>Learned amicus curiae Mr. Murshid elaborates, that, in spite of being unconditional apology, it was not accepted in the case of Vineet Kumar Mathur v India: 7 SCC 714 (para-10). In that case it was held that where the violation of the court’s order was deliberate and pre-planned indicating certain defiant attitude on the part of the contemnors, the court refused to accept the unconditional apology. In the similar way, he adds to the series, the case of Shamsur Rahman Vs Tahera Nargis: 44 DLR (AD) 237 (para-12), per A. T. M. Afzal, J (as his lordship then was), where the apex court has held that apology is an act of contrition and continued further that if the apology is qualified, hesitating and sought to be used as a device to escape the consequences of the contemnor’s action, it must be rejected. Here, he submits, the apology has been used as a device to escape the consequence of the contemner’s action.<br/> <br/>Next, referring to the facts and circumstances peculiar to this case, Mr. Murshid, next submits that, <u>in the instant case, this Court </u><u>allowed</u><u> the application for reduction of BG considering the fact that the reduced amount covers the disputed claim and after allowing the contemners an opportunity to show cause as to why the amount of BG should not be reduced. But, the contemners did not come up to show any cause against reduction of BG amount, inspite of the fact that this court has recorded, in order dated 23.07.2013, that should they fail to show cause then it will be deemed that they have no objection in  reducing the amount of BG, as prayed for. To my view, he adds, this Court passed the order on merit and considering that the disputed amount of BDT68,17,671.00 covers the amount which the BTCL has claimed and which is subject matter of arbitration. However, in spite of having full knowledge of the order dated 23.07.13 and received a legal notice dated 19.11.2013 (Annexure-D), the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have flatly refused implementation of the said order, as if it was a matter of their sweet will, and having done so, the respondent came before this Court with unconditional apology; the intent of which is obvious</u>. He went on to submit, that the contemnor-respondents did not comply with the order of this Court and have challenged the authority of this Court and thereby attempted to frustrate the administration of justice and the rule of law. <u>Besides, in this case, the contemnor-respondents, though did not justify their action at the time of seeking apology, however, before offering that apology they have raised objection as to reduction of BG defying the written order of this court, dated 23.07.13</u> <u>and paying no heed to the legal notice dated 19.11.2013 (Annexure-D) demanding compliance, yet not coming up with any explanation as to why the BG amount should not be reduced, pursuant to this court’s order dated 13.06.2013. Hence, their apology has been offered just to avoid the consequences of contempt of grave nature, he reiterated, and the contemnor-respondents should not be exonerated. Rather they should be punished for repeated disobedience and disregarding the order of this Court as well as for undermining the dignity and majesty of this court. He next adds, the case of Elders Ltd. v Sunil Chandra Chowdhury and another: 54 DLR 226, (para 5), Syed Amirul Islam, J. (as his lordship then was), emphasized on the action rather than intention of the contemnors. His Lordship held that it is the effect of the contemnor’s action which is to be taken into consideration in deciding whether contempt was committed or not</u>. In the instant case the actions and inactions of the contemnor-respondents will also have to be considered in assessing and determination of the gravity of the offence and the punishment to be awarded.  <u>He has, referring to the leading case of The Crown Vs. Moulvi Abdul Rashid Tarkabagish M.L.A. of Serajgonj: 1 DLR (1949) 177, 181, submits that, Ellis J. while refusing to accept the apology observed that: “To accept it, would inevitably create the impression that contempt of this kind, however much they may be condemned in theory, can in practice be purged by an expression of regret. Such an impression would be indeed disastrous and would do nothing to deter others in the position of the Moulvi Sahib from interfering with the course of justice. From our part, we are determined to see that such interference shall be visited with a prompt and deterrent punishment</u>.” In the facts and in view of the decisions cited, being clearly applicable to the case in hand, the apology offered by the contemners is liable to be rejected, he concludes. (emphasis added)<br/> <br/>I have heard the learned amicus curiae, perused the order dated 13.06.2013 and 23.7.2013 passed in Arbitration Application No. 27 of 2012, the petition for drawing contempt proceeding alongwith the documents annexed, the Rule, the affidavit filed by the contemners and have also consulted the decision cited above.<br/> <br/>The facts leading to issuance of the Rule, registered as Contempt Petition No. 2 of 2014 has been recorded herein above as well as the facts and arguments have also been noted, alongwith the case law referred to in the course of arguments.  <br/> <br/>In the instant case, as revealed from the materials on record, the contemnor-respondents had full knowledge of both orders dated 13.06.2013 and 23.07.2013, contents of which have been noted herein above. The contemnors Nos. 1 and 2 have (1) willfully and deliberately violated the orders of this Court;  (2) they did not come up to show cause as to why the BG amount should not be reduced, as they were required to, vide order dated 13.06.2013 passed in the Arbitration Application No. 27 of 2012;(3) they have refused to comply with the order dated 23.07.2013, passed in the said Arbitration Application, reducing the BG amount to the extent that covers the disputed claim, vide their letter dated 30.09.2013 (Annexure-C) addressed to the Manager, IFIC Bank, Stock Exchange Branch; (4) they did not come up before this court to review or to modify or to set aside the order dated 23.7.2014; (5) they did not go to the Appellate Division against said order, though they could have taken any of these steps if they had minimum fear about the consequence of flouting this court’s order; (6) They were not hesitant to wield their muscle in that they even did not pay any heed to the legal notice dated 19.11.2013 (Annexure-D), issued upon them (contemners Nos. 1 and 2) demanding that they should comply with the order dated 23.07.2013, passed by this court, quoting the very order in the legal notice, setting forth the facts and law in detail: (7) in doing so, in a repeated fashion, the contemners have flouted the aforesaid orders of the Court and the demand made in the legal notice showing a degree of arrogance hitherto unknown and gave a damn to this Court’s order of binding character and (8) thereby, they have deliberately defied to comply with same.<br/> <br/>In the facts and circumstances of this case, this Court does not consider their apology, as sincere one. Besides, the apology, in my considered view, has been offered only to escape the consequence of committing contempt of this court, showing utter disrespect and giving clear damn to the authority and dignity of this court. It is not material in such a case at what stage the apology has been offered, though in the instant case the contemners had four occasions to comply with this court’s order, before seeking apology after issuance of the Rule on 23.01.2014.<br/> <br/>I have also considered the views expressed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Re: contempt of court proceedings against General (Retd) Mirza Aslam Beg. It has been held in that case (at paragraph No. 8) that, “It is accepted as legal proposition that a Judge who stops summarily (brevi manu), any attempt (contempt) to interfere with the course of justice actually performs his Constitutional and public duty. The duty of a Judge sitting to punish the Court’s own contempt, therefore, means to prevent and stifle any damage to public confidence in an important organ of the State and not the protection of the individual Judges. No personal interest is therefore involved. These are accepted rules in the dispensation of justice in contempt cases. It may be emphasized here that in this context when the Judge takes up the proceedings or acts in response to direct contempt the proceedings are not to take the form of the trial and the same may be concluded <em>brevi manu </em>which means “summarily”. It is not thus necessary that there be a written charge, framing of issues, or to hold regular trial or examination – No other proof is necessary when it is a case of direct contempt.”<br/> <br/>In the facts and circumstances of this case, I find all the decisions cited above apply to this case. The contemners No. 1 and 2 have, by their repeated defiance have aggravated the offence, gave an impression that they have unquestionable might and power to flout orders of this court giving a damn to it, that they are persons superior to this court and that they are untouchable or that the hands of the court are too short to reach them.<br/> <br/>Hence, in a case like this, as has been rightly pointed out by the learned amicus curiae, this court should not accept the apology offered as a routine job or without taking into consideration the conduct of the contemners and its effect in defeating the course of justice. In respectful allegiance to the ratio decided in the cases cited above, and being anxious that least it will disseminate an impression that this Court’s orders can be flouted at one’s sweet will, subject only to taking a bit discomfort in filing an affidavit seeking unconditional apology, will no doubt ridicule this Court and render its authority exists in theory only, resulting to the deteriation of an ordered society to exist and grow, based on the rule of law.  To give way to such arrogant, audacious and repeated acts of defiance, as recorded hereinabove, would no doubt result in indulging many others, of any stratum of the society, to flout this court’s order of binding charter and to allow an era of lawlessness to begin, which this court is oath bound to prevent. This court’s voice must be louder enough to be heard by those who are bound to comply with the same.<br/> <br/>This Court should ensure effectiveness and workability of the administration of justice system and the rule of law to sustain in this country, by awarding appropriate punishment to the offenders, without discrimination as well as letting all concerned to hear the voice of this Court and to understand that the age old proverb that the hands of this court is long enough to reach any offender. At the same time the admonition of Mr. Elis J (as his lordship then was) should be given weight to, albeit it is too late an stage to realize the truth and accuracy in his lordship’s admonition, vide 1 DLR (1949) 177, quoted above.<br/> <br/>I have considered the conduct of contemner No. 2, Mr. Shah Farid Deputy Director, (Accounts-1) of BTCL, at the relevant time. <u>He has, in my view, as a subordinate officer, complied with the instruction of the contemner No. 1, in writing letter dated 30.09.2013 under ref No. IAS/8-6/2011/67, (Annexure-C), raising objection to the bank concerned and thereby defying to obey this court’s order dated 23.07.2013</u>. Similarly, I have also reviewed the conduct of Mr. Helal Ahmed, Manager, IFIC Bank, Stock Exchange Branch, 16, Motijheel C/A, Dhaka-1000. In the petition for drawing contempt proceeding it has been stated that he has complied with this court’s order. Besides, his explanation that, by his aforesaid letter he has only wanted to know from BTCL if they had taken any step to modify or review or set aside the order dated 23.07.2013, although the expression was not proper, it was candidly admitted. Considering this explanation, alongwith the statements made in the petition that he has complied with court’s order, <u>I am inclined to give him benefit of doubt</u>. Therefore the apology offered by Mr. Shah Farid of BTCL, being a subordinate officer, and Mr. Helal Ahmed of IFIC Bank are accepted and they are hereby discharged from the charges, with warning to be cautious in future in their dealings in court matters. (underling is mine)<br/> <br/>However, for the reasons as well as in the facts and circumstances recorded hereinbefore and having considered the degree of proof required to decide such a case alongwith the nature of this proceedings, I find, on the contrary, that Mr. S.O.M. Kalimullah, Managing Director, BTCL, (retired after the proceedings was initiated), is guilty of repeatedly committing the offence of contempt of court. Besides, I have considered the aggravating and extenuating circumstances. I find no extenuating circumstances in this case. The aggravating factors, has been noted hereinabove. <u>Moreover, Contemner No. 1, instead of prohibiting defiance of this Court’s order dated 23.7.2013, knowingly gave approval to his subordinate Officer, to write the letter dated 30.09.2013 (Annexure-C), for which he alone should be saddled with the liability for committing Contempt of Court</u>. (emphasis added)<br/> <br/>Before parting of, in view of the provisions laid down in Article 111 read with Article 108 of the Constitution, in the facts and circumstances of this case, I further declare, as law forming part of the contempt jurisprudence and jurisdiction, so far as the nature, duty of this court and procedure is concerned that,</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">This court should not act mechanically, to make it a routine job, in accepting the apology offered by the contemners, in each and every case. Rather, this Court has to ensure that the letters and spirit of Article 112 and Article 109 of the Constitution are respected and upheld by all quarters, government and non-government;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Apology offered may be taken as a mitigating factor, but not to discharge the contemner from their liability, though it is within discretion of this court to decide whether the contemners will be discharged or not and, if not, to ascertain the quantum of the punishment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Article 7 read with Articles 39(2), 108, 111 and 112 of the Constitution, considered together and with reference to the scheme of the Constitution, make it abundantly clear that the peoples power to punish the contemner has been invested in the Supreme Court to be exercised by the honourable Judges of this Court, so that the authority, dignity and majesty of this Court is upheld, an ordered society based on the rule of law can exist and the justice is even handedly secured to those who deserve. The people’s ‘will’, reflected in the Articles, referred to hereinabove, should be given effect to by this Court, without any discrimination.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Once this Court passes any binding order in any proceeding then it, in substance, becomes a public order and this Court is legally entrusted to implement the same in the public interest and the rule of law to prevail.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Refusal to obey this Court’s order is an explicit challenge to it’s authority and is a breach of public order by an arrogant party having no fear in undermining and in ridiculing the authority of this Court, rendering its judgment and order a nullity and such conduct cannot go unpunished with impunity, moreover, in such a case it is immaterial at what stage the apology is offered.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">That the power of the Supreme court, the Appellate Division  and the  High Court Division, being the court of records, as embodied under Article 108 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, cannot be restricted and trammeled by any ordinary legislation including the  Contempt of Courts Act[even if enacted] and their inherent power is elastic, unfettered and not subjected to any time limit. [Following the ratio decided in the case of Pritam Pal v. High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur, AIR 1992 SC 904,with reference to Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution of India].</li><li style="text-align: justify;">“It is accepted as legal proposition that a Judge who stops summarily (<em>brevi manu</em>), any attempt (contempt) to interfere with the course of justice actually performs his Constitutional and public duty. The duty of a Judge sitting to punish the Court’s own contempt, therefore, means to prevent and stifle any damage to public confidence in an important organ of the State and not the protection of the individual Judges. No personal interest is therefore involved. These are accepted rules in the dispensation of justice in contempt cases. It may be emphasized here that in this context when the Judge takes up the proceedings or acts in response to direct contempt the proceedings are not to take the form of the trial and the same may be concluded <em>brevi manu </em>which means “summarily”. It is not thus necessary that there be a written charge, framing of issues, or to hold regular trial or examination – No other proof is necessary when it is a case of direct contempt.”, as has been held by his lordship Mr. Justice Muhammad Asfzal Zullah, the Chief Justice of Pakistan (as his lordship then was) in Re: Contempt of court proceedings against General (Retd) Mirza Aslam Beg.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Compliance of the Court’s order cannot be treated as an extenuating circumstances in all cases, since it is duty of the person concerned to obey the same. However, if the Court is satisfied that non-compliance was not deliberate or international, or that the contemner was not at all aware of the order required to be complied with or if the order to be complied with was lacking clarity to such an extent that the duty to comply with the same was honestly not comprehensible to the person(s) obliged to comply the court’s order, then the court should take lenient view.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Contempt by a person who is a party to the proceedings and contempt by a person who is not such a party, cannot be weighed on the same scale. However, gravity of the offence does not depend on the question as to whether the contemner was a party or act, but upon the nature of the offence.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In the result, the Rule issued in Contempt Petition No. 2 of 2014 is made absolute-in-part. The Suomoto Rule No. 2 of 2014 is discharged.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br/><strong>ORDER:</strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">In view of the applicable law and the findings recorded herein above, Mr. S.O.M. Kalimullah, son of late Mohammad Dayem Mia, 28/2, Baily Road, Dhaka-1000, Managing Director, BTCL, at the time of drawing the proceeding, (now retired), is hereby held guilty of committing contempt of this court. His apology is rejected. Further, considering the aggravating factors, hereinbefore recorded at paragraph number 23, he is hereby sentenced to suffer simple imprisonment for a period of 4(four) months, with immediate effect and to pay a fine of Taka 1,00,000.00 (one lac), to be deposited in Bangladesh Bank under the concerned.</div></div></div>

It is contemplated only on a situation where the Arbitrator corrects or interprets and/or add or decide to add any additional claims and modified the award as only in such cases the original award losses its originality and therefore an application for setting aside the award needs to be filed within three months from the date of receipt of such corrected or modified award.

Since, section 42(2) of the Act has prescribed special period of limitation, the Act itself being a special law, the petitioner ought to have filed its petition for setting aside the award within 60 days from 29.11.11, i.e. within 28.1.2012. For not filing the petition within 28.1.2012 the same is clearly barred by special limitation prescribed under section 42(2) of the Act. The petitioner cannot be allowed to be benefited from its own default, least it will be a convenient excuse to any unscrupulous person to frustrate the special limitation by resorting to such tactics and because there is no proviso to section 42(2) of the Act making any room for exclusion of time on this or any other ground. </em><strong><em>. . .

Therefore, it can be safely concluded the petitioner had no cause of action to file this petition for setting aside the award.

All the above contracts were planned as short term contracts with completion period of 12 months only. The period of Contract No.1 and 2 was, during the pre-bid meeting, increased from 12 months to 15 months as these contracts involved importation of cold milling and recycling machineries. Thus the stipulated time for completion of contract No.1 and 2 was fifteen (15) months, whereas the duration for contract No.3, 4 and 5 was twelve (12) months only.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The arbitrations arises from 04(four) contracts of Road Maintenance Component (RMC). The request for arbitration was initially filed on behalf of five claimants, including AKT-Xerbel JV which withdrew from the arbitration with consent of all the parties. No party objected to commencing one arbitration in respect of all four contracts. The project under the contracts were jointly funded by Government of Bangladesh (GOB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The said four contractors, being M/S. Nazir Basic Joint venture, M/S. OSE and CPC Joint Venture, M/S. Islam Trading Corporation Limited (ITCL) and M/S. Bengal Development Corporation Ltd. (BDC) (herein after collectively referred to as the contractors or claimants), vide their letter dated 20 May 2008, bearing ref coc/ Dhaka/1358(02) referred the instant contractual dispute with the present petitioners to arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in force as from 1<sup>st</sup> January 1998 (ICC Rules of  Arbitration) as per clause 67.3 common to all the contracts.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The claimants and the present petitioners jointly nominated that Arbitration Tribunal consisting of a sole arbitrator which nomination was then confirmed by the Secretary General of the International Chamber of Commerce International Court of Arbitration (ICC Court) on 3<sup>rd</sup> October 2008 pursuant to Article 9(2) of the ICC Rules of Arbitration. The Terms of Reference in the arbitration (“TOR”) were finalized and signed in a meeting with the claimants and the respondents on 31 March 2009, and were communicated to the ICC Court on 23 April 2009 pursuant to Article 18(2) of the ICC Rules of Arbitration. According to the TOR, the following issues were formulated for determination in that arbitration:</li><li style="text-align: justify;">“It is to be ascertained whether the claimant under the tender clause 70.2 regarding changes in cost due to subsequent legislation, which reads as follows: If, after the date 28 days prior to the latest date for submission of tenders for the contract there occur in the country in which the works are being or are to be executed changes to any National or State Statute, Ordinance, Decree or other Law or any regulation or bye-law (sic) of any local or other duly constituted authority, or the introduction of any such State Statute, Subsequent Ordinance, Decree, Law, regulation or bye-law (sic) which causes additional or reduced cost to the contractor, other than under sub-clause 70.1 in the execution of the contract, such additional or reduced cost shall, after due consultation with the employer and the contractor, be determined by the engineer and shall be added to or deducted from the Contract price, is entitled to any additional costs.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The claimants took the position that gazette notification published by the government and the orders passed on the recommendation of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation, effecting changes in the prices of fuel and bitumen are to be treated as falling within the scope of clause 70.2 and, therefore, additional cost shall have to be paid to the contractors by the employer due to increases in the prices of fuel and bitumen as per clause 70.2.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The present petitioner took the position that clause 70.2 of FIDIC is not made applicable to procurement process. Price variation under clause 70.2 of FIDIC is applicable only in the case of change in the cost of the contract due to introduction, amendment or repeal of any law relating to revenue matter or changes in the currency rates etc in the country in which the works is being performed. Determination of construction inputs i.e. price of materials and labour are not the area of legislation and thus such determination cannot be considered in the calculation of cost variation under clause 70.2 of FIDIC. Administrative decision based on market economy determines prices of construction inputs if and when necessary and such determination of prices in respect of construction inputs (material and labour) are considerable issues in calculating the price variation under clause 70.1 of GCOC, which is not applicable in the present contracts.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">That the work under the instant contracts constitutes mainly recycling of old pavement of the roads under the contracts and asphalt overlay thereafter i.e. mostly machine oriented and bituminous works. The prices of fuel and bitumen were increased during implementation of the work. The Ministry of Power, Fuel and Mineral Resources, Government of Bangladesh, through gazette notifications are effecting change in price of fuel from time to time. The changes in the price of bitumen were also effected by the said Ministry through office orders on the advice of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation ( in short ‘BPC). Subsequently, the said Ministry, vide paragraph (b) of its memo No. Jalani/(op-1) BPC-29/2001 (part-1) 504 dated 21.11.2001 authorized BPC to fix internal sale price of bitumen depending on the international price of bitumen from time to time in future, Since then BPC has been publishing change in the price of bitumen. BPC by notification dated 18.07.2006 has increased the domestic price of bitumen from the price under its previous notification dated 09.11.2004 with reference to the memo No. Jalani (op-1) BPC-29/2001) (part-1) 504 dated 21.11.2001 of the Fuel and Mineral Resources Division, Ministry of Power, Fuel and Mineral Resources of the Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">That the contractor claimed price variation under clause 70.2 of FIDIC claming additional cost due to increase of price of fuel and bitumen referring the above notifications. Apart from bitumen and fuel the contractors in their claim have included increase in cost in other materials as well. The consultant rejected the additional claim of the contractors/ claimants due to increase of price of construction materials except the additional claim for fuel and bitumen purportedly under clause 70.2 and certified and forwarded the same for approval of the respondents/employer. The respondent /employer, vide memo No. Mate-4/02 394-CE dated 13.07.2008, conveyed non eligibility of contractor’s claims and thereby rejected the additional claim of the contractors considering the same being not entitled by the contractors under clause 70.2 of COPA. Subsequently the engineer, vide his memo No.2348 dated 15.07.2008 addressed to M/S. Nazir Basic Joint Venture, Contractor of Contract No.1, memo No.2349 dated 15.07.2008 addressed to M/S. OSE &amp; CPC Joint Venture. Contractors No.2, memo No.2350 dated 15.07.2008 addressed to M/S Islam Trading Consortium Limited, Contractor of Contract No.3, memo No.2352 dated 15.07.2008 addressed to M/S. Bengal Development Corporation Ltd. Contractor of Contract No.5. conveyed the decision of the engineer to the contractors, hence the arbitration.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">That then an arbitration proceeding was started against the petitioner Roads and Highways Department (i.e. the respondent before the ICC Court of Arbitration) under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the dispute was heard by an Arbitral Tribunal comprising of a sole arbitrator Mr. Sheik Fazlur Rahman PE of House No.48B, Road No.35A, Gulshan, Dhaka-1212 Bangladesh. The Arbitral Tribunal by a decision rendered <em>Final</em> <em>Award,</em> on 27.11.2011.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the <em>final award</em> dated 27.11.2011 (Annexure-A to the petition), after giving description of the parties, reference has been made to the procedural history, the terms of reference (TOR), referred to at paragraph No. 6 of the award, settled on consensus of all parties to the arbitration, name of the learned Advocates representing the parties i.e. claimants and the respondent (petitioner before this court), the learned arbitrator has recorded in paragraph No. 7 of the award that, after examination of the pleadings of both the parties (claimants and respondent) and the statement of expert witness of both the parties it is observed that applicability of tender clause 70.2 is the main issue which is to be settled by the Arbitrator and there is no other issue and to this both the parties agreed. At paragraph No. 11 of the award, it has been recorded that the claimant No. 3 had lodged challenge vide a letter dated 29.12.2010 as to the appointment of the sole arbitrator and he, alongwith the claimants No. 1,2 &amp; 4 and the respondents (the petitioner before this court) was requested by the Secretariat of the ICC court to offer their comments as per Article 11(3) of the ICC Rules of Arbitration in respect of the issue raised by the claimant No. 3. The sole arbitrator and claimants No. 1, 2 and 4 submitted their comments, but the respondent (petitioner in the case before this court) did not submit any comment. The sole arbitrator also refrained from holding further hearing in the interest of justice. Considering the representations and all facts, ICC International Court of Arbitration, in its session held on 27 January 2011, rejected the challenged lodged on behalf of claimant No.3. The claimant No. 3 thereafter did not participate in the hearing, but has not withdrawn it’s claim either. Similarly, at paragraph No. 17 of the award it has been recorded that it was decided in the Review Meeting held on 31<sup>st</sup> July 2010 that the only issue before the Tribunal was applicability of GCOC Clause 70.2 as amended by COPA and there was no other issue. It has further been recorded in the award at paragraph No. 13 of the award that an expert witness Mr. Ibne Alam Hasan made the deposition at the instance of the respondent (petitioner in this case) and the said expert witness was cross-examined by the counsel for the claimants No.1, 2 and 4. In paragraph No. 14 it has been stated that the hearing was recorded in audio CD (Compact Disk). It was decided, in the course of arbitration, that the parties would submit their closing statements simultaneously on 26 March 2011. Claimants No.1, 2, 4 and Respondent sought a time extension for the said step, which was allowed until 16 April 2011. After receipt of the closing statements on the said date, the same were exchanged and the proceedings were declared closed on 20 April 2011 as per Article 22(1) of the ICC Rules of Arbitration. The award has also referred to the claim and to the provisions of the original clauses 70.1 and 70.2 of the GCOC, as amended by COPA, and have also quoted the contents there of at paragraph No. 74 of the award and gave interpretation of the said clauses at paragraph No. 75 and 77 of the award. Paragraph Nos. 76 and 78 of the award contain the arbitration’s deliberation on the claim. Thereafter, narrating the summary of facts, the submission of the claimants and of the respondents the learned arbitrator has made reference to section 3 of the Petroleum Act, 1974 that empowers the Government to regulate and marketing of petroleum and has also referred to the provisions of section 6 of Bangladesh Petroleum Ordinance, 1976 narrating the functions of the BPC. He has also considered the definition of “local authority” given in section 3 (28) of General Clauses Act, 1897 and placed reliance upon the decision reported in 32 DLR(AD) 83 to arrive at the conclusion if the BPC is a ‘local authority’. In order to ascertain the meaning of the word ‘law’, the learned Arbitrator has referred to Article 152 of the Constitution and the decision reported in 47 DLR 309. In the premise recorded therein, the learned arbitrator has passed the award as follows:</li><li style="text-align: justify;">“It is hereby decided that in view of the reasons stated hereinabove, the claim of the three Claimants No.1, 2 and 4 has succeeded, and it is awarded that the said three Claimants are entitled to additional cost in accordance with Clause 70.2 of the GCOC as amended by the COPA. Since the claim of the Claimants No.1, 2 and 4 has succeeded, the claim of Claimant No.3 also succeeds for the same reasons.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Each party shall bear its own legal and other costs in relation to this arbitration.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The costs of arbitration fixed by the ICC Court as US$ 136,000 shall be borne by both sides equally.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">All other claims are rejected.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">That the present petitioners thereafter filed an application before the ICC Arbitral Tribunal under Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules of Arbitration on 28.12.2011 seeking interpret-ation of the award. But ultimately Mr. Khong Chong Yee counsel, Secretariat of the ICC International Court of Arbitration, through a letter dated 17.4.2012 (Annexure-‘B’ to the petition) stated as follows:</li><li style="text-align: justify;">“Respondents requests a further extension of time of 8 weeks from 16 April 2012 within which to pay the additional advance on costs fixed by the Court at US$ 5000. We note that since the Court fixed the additional advance on costs on 19 January 2012, some four months ago, no payment of US$ 5000 has been received. In light of all the circumstances, Respondent’s Article 29 application is considered withdrawn.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The petitioners states, at paragraph No. 13 of the petition, that since the ICC Arbitral Tribunal final order in review application was received by this petitioner after 17.04.2012 the limitation at 60 days to be counted at least from 17.04.2012 instead of 27.11.2011 and this petitioner prays for accepting this application.   </li><li style="text-align: justify;">The opposite party No.4 has filed an application for rejection of the substantive petition alleging, amongst other, that the above application has been filed by the petitioner under Section 42(2) read with Section 43 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 for setting aside the award dated 27.11.2011 passed by an Arbitration Tribunal comprising of Mr. Sheikh Fazlur Rahman PE in favour of the opposite party Nos. 1 to 4 and against the petitioner in ICC International Court Arbitration Case No. 15642/JEM/MLK/CYK; that the arbitration arose from 4 (four) contracts of the Road Maintenance Component (RMC) under the Road Maintenance and Improvement Project awarded to four different contractors, being the opposite party Nos. 1 to 4, by the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) of the Ministry of Communication of the Government of Bangladesh. The parties did not object to the commencement of one arbitration proceeding in respect of all four contracts. The General Conditions  of Contract (GCOC) as amended by the Conditions of Particular Application (COPA) in the four contracts were common/similar. The arbitration was an “international commercial arbitration” within the definition given in Section 2(c) of the Arbitration Act, 2001 since the claimants in the proceeding included two joint ventures having parties incorporated in a country other than Bangladesh; that by the award, the Arbitration Tribunal ordered that the opposite party Nos. 1 to 4, i.e. the claimants in the arbitration proceeding, are entitled to additional cost in accordance with the Clause 70.2 of GCOC as amended by the COPA, that the parties are to bear their own legal and other costs and that the costs of the arbitration fixed at US<s>S</s> 136,000.00 shall be borne by both sides equally; that Clause 67 of the GCOC provided for Settlement of Disputes; Clause 67.3 provided, amongst others, that where the decision of the Engineer under the GCOC had not become final and binding and amicable settlement has not been reached, the dispute shall be finally settled under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) by one or more arbitrators appointed under such Rule; that in the instant case, a reference to arbitration was made in accordance with Clause 67 to a sole arbitrator appointed as per the said Rules by the Court of Arbitration of the (ICC); that section 42(2) of the Arbitration Act, 2001 provides that the High Court Division may set aside any arbitral award made in an international commercial arbitration held in Bangladesh on the application of a party within sixty days from the receipt of the award; that the application filed by the petitioner does not state the date on which it received the award; hence, it shall be deemed that the award was received on the date on which it was made, i.e. 27.11.2011; that it may be noted that the application for setting aside the arbitration award dated 27.11.2011 was filed on 14.06.2012, i.e. 200 (two hundred) days after the said award was passed; that in paragraph No. 11 of the application, the petitioner has stated that it filed a review application before the ICC Tribunal under Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules of Arbitration on 28.12.2011, but that the said application was considered withdrawn by the ICC International Court of Arbitration as stated in its letter dated 17.04.2012 for the petitioner not having complied with an order of the said Court passed on 19.01.2012 for payment of additional costs; that the petitioner in paragraph No. 12 of the application has contended that since it received the final order in the review application after 17.04.2012, therefore limitation of 60 days for filing the application to set aside should be counted from 17.04.2012 instead of 27.11.2011. However, no prayer has been made for setting aside such order dated 17.04.2012; that while admitting the application by order dated 19.06.2012, the Hon’ble Court admitted it subject to any objection which may be raised by the opposite parties with regard to limitation at the time of hearing; that it is submitted that the application filed by the petitioner is liable to be rejected inasmuch that it has been filed beyond the limitation period prescribed by law for filing an application for setting aside an arbitration award rendered in an international arbitration proceeding; that it is submitted that there is no scope under the Arbitration Act, 2001 to construe a subsequent order recording withdrawal of an application for review of an arbitration award as extending the time within which any application for setting aside such arbitration award has to be filed; that it is submitted that the Arbitration Act, 2001 is a special law, and hence there is no scope for application of the provisions Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1908 to extend the time for filing an application to have such award set aside.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The petitioner (respondent in the ICC International Court of Arbitration) has filed an affidavit-in-opposition, sworn on 6.12.12, against the application for rejection of the substantive petition denying all the material allegations made in the application for rejection of the petition filed under section 42(2) of the Act and further stating that Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules for Arbitration provides for filing of an application before the secretariat of ICC for interpretation of any part of the award by the Tribunal within 30 days from receipt of the award, which is corresponding to the provisions of section 40(2) of the Arbitration Act, 2001 of Bangladesh. According to the provisions of Article 29(2) of ICC Rules the petitioner, on 28.12.2011, filed an application for clarification of the award dated 27.11.2011. In paragraph No. 1 of the said application it was clearly stated that the petitioner received the award on 29.11.2011 and the application dated 28.12.2011 was thus well within time as per Article 29 of the said ICC Rules. After receipt of the said application the Secretariat required the petitioner to remit US$. 5000/- as additional advance on costs subject to later readjustment in respect of the said application under Article 29 of the ICC Rules and pursuant to Appendix II to the said Rules. The petitioner took immediate step to pay the said amount but could not able to make the payment within time as fixed by ICC because, being a government entity the petitioner requires approval from the concerned authorities through several official process for sanction of fund and remitting foreign exchange abroad and that in order to complete the process of the governmental formalities regarding approval of fund and remittance of foreign exchange the petitioner needs more time to comply with the ICC instruction. Therefore, the petitioner further prayed for 8 weeks time to pay the additional advance on costs of US$. 5000/- by letter dated 13.04.2012 pin pointing the aforesaid difficulties. But the said application was rejected by the ICC by order dated 16.4.2012 declaring the application of the petitioner for clarification of award as withdrawn. It is further stated that as per the provision of Article 29(3) of the ICC Rules and section 40(4) of the Arbitration Act, 2001, the decision to correct or to interpret the award shall take the form of an addendum and shall constitute part of the award. Therefore, the said order dated 16.4.2012 of ICC deciding the application of the petitioner under Article 29 of the ICC Rules for interpretation of award has been culminated with the provision of ‘termination of the proceeding’ by declaring/ passing the final award under section 41 of the Arbitration Act, 2001. As such the period of limitation is to be computed from the date of finality of the award i.e. from the date of termination of the proceeding on 16.4.2012. The instant Arbitration application under section 42 has been filed by the petitioner on 14.6.12 i.e. within 60 days from the date of final award/termination of the proceeding dated 16.4.2012 and as such the same is very much within time; that it is submitted that the contention of the opposite party No. 4 that the provisions of Limitation Act is not applicable in the present case is not correct as because section 55 of the Arbitration Act 2001, makes the Limitation Act applicable as they apply to the court proceedings subject to the provisions of the Arbitration Act. Therefore, all the subm-issions made by the opposite party No. 4 in its application for rejection of the Arbitration application have no substance and misconst-rued and as such the said application is liable to be rejected.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> The matter has been taken up for hearing and the learned Advocate for the applicant-opposite party No.1 has drawn attention of the court to the admission order dated 19.6.2012, wherein it has been recorded that “Let this application be admitted for hearing subject to any objection which may be raised by the opposite parties with regards to limitation at the time of hearing of the application”. He has also made reference to the application for rejection of the substantive petition as well as to the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the petitioner against the application for rejection. Accordingly, all the parties have agreed that the issue regarding limitation shall be decided first, for the reason that if the substantive petition is found to have been barred by limitation then there is no scope to enter into the merit of the petition. Accordingly the issue as to whether the substantive petition is barred by limitation has been taken for decision as a preliminary issue.<br/> <br/>At the out set, the learned Advocate for the petitioner Mr. A. F. Hassan Arif, appearing along with Mr. Md.Ashik Al Jalil, having read out the application for rejection of the substantive petition and the affidavit-in-opposition filed against the same as well as drawing my attention to the statements made in the substantive petition, first of all submits that the petitioner has received the award on 29.11.2011. Thereafter the petitioner has filed an application to the secretariat of the ICC International Court of Arbitration, as per Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules, on 28.12.2011, ‘for clarification of the Award dated 27.11.2011’. Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules make provisions for filing an application, within 30 days, seeking interpretation of the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal. Accordingly, the petitioner has filed an application seeking interpretation of the award within 30 days time i.e. on 28.12.2011 from the date of the receiving the award. As such, he further submits, the step taken before the secretariat of the ICC Court of Arbitration for interpretation of the award was quite within time limit prescribed by Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules. Thereafter, the Counsel, Secretariat of the of ICC International Court of Arbitration, that owing to the respondent’s (petitioner’s) default to pay the additional advanced cost US$ 5,000/- fixed by the court, respondent’s Article 29 application is considered withdrawn, vide the letter dated 17.4.2012 reference 15642/JEM/MLK/CYK (Annexure-B to the substantive petition), although in affidavit-in-opposition this date has been erroneously written as 16.4.2012. However, the petitioner thereafter has filed the substantive application, under section 42(2) read with section 43 of the Act, on 14.6.2012, before the High Court Division and that was admitted on 19.6.2012. He further submits that the decision of the arbitral tribunal, Communicated by it’s letter dated 27.4.2012 (Annexure-B), in substance is to be treated as addendum to the award and the period of limitation shall start from 17.4.2012. Counting the date from 17.4.2012, he continues, the petitioner has filed the petition within 60 (sixty) from receiving the award days i.e. on 14.6.2012. Accordingly, he submits that the petition is not barred by limitation prescribed under section 42 sub-section (2) of the Act, that requires that an application to set aside the award should be filed within 60 (sixty) days from receiving the award. The learned Advocate further submits that even if the petition is otherwise treated to have been filed after 200 days from receiving the award on 29.11.2011, as claimed by the applicant-opposite parties, the same will not render this substantive petition barred by limitation in as much as sub-section (1) of section 55 of the Act provides that the provision of Limitation Act, 1908 shall be applicable in respect of any proceeding before this court. That being so, the petitioner has adequately explained the reason as to why and under what circumstances it has filed the petition on 14.6.2012. He also submits that the step taken before the Arbitral Tribunal, as per Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules, was taken bonafide by the petitioner and the delay took place in the process of termination of the arbitration proceeding on 17.4.2012 (Annexure-B) has been sufficiently explained in paragraph 4 of the affidavit-in-opposition. Hence, he also submits, that the delay occurred is liable to be condoned under section 5 of the Limitation Act read with section 55(1) of the Arbitration Act (the Act). However, the learned Advocate for the petitioner has frankly conceded that if the petition is barred by limitation then there is no scope to enter into the merit of the petition for the purpose of the disposal of the same. In reply to a query made from the Bench the learned advocate has also frankly conceded that it is difficult to fit the decision dated 17.4.2012 (Annexure-B) within the meaning or definition of ‘award’. In view of the submission made and in the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned Advocate emphatically submits, that the petition is not barred by limitation and it has been duly admitted by the court on 19.6.2012. Accordingly he has prayed that the petition for rejection has not merit and the same is liable to be rejected. <br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Rafiq-ul Haque, alongwith learned advocates Mr. Fahimul Haque and Mr. Marub Kabir, appearing for the applicant-respondent No.4, on the other hand, submits that, admittedly and as per record, the petitioner has received the award on 29.11.2011. After expiry of 29 days the petitioner has filed an application on 28.12.2011 before the secretariat of the ICC International Court of Arbitration, as per Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules, seeking interpretation of the award. It is also admitted by the petitioner that they have received a letter dated 17.4.2012 (annexed to the substantive petition as Annexure-B) whereby the Secretariat of the ICC International Court of Arbitration has communicated its decision that for non-payment of the additional cost being US $ 5,000, fixed by the ICC court of arbitration, even after expiry of 4 months, their application under Article 29(2) is considered withdrawn. Thereafter the petitioner claims that they have filed this application on 14.6.2012. In between 17.4.12 (the date of filing application under Article 29) to 14.6.2012 (the date of letter of the ICC Secretariat), the learned advocate goes ahead, 58 days time has elapsed. This 58 days time and previous 28 days time [gone before filing application under Articles 29(2) of the ICC Rules] counted together arrives at 86 days. At least this 86 days time has elapsed before 14.6.2012, on which the petitioner claims to have submitted its petition. As such, according to the petitioner’s own admission, the petition has not been filed within 60 days time prescribed in section 42 sub section (2) of the Act. In otherwords, the petition is not filed within 60 days of receiving the award on 29.11.2011, even if reliance is placed on the petitioner’s own admission. Indeed, the learned Advocate further submits, there is no scope to exclude the time that was wasted in the course of filing application under Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules on 28.12.2011 to 17.4.2012, because the decision of the secretariat of ICC International Court of Arbitration, communicated in their letter dated 17.4.2012 (Annexure-B), has not modified, amended or interpreted the award. By that letter dated 17.4.12 (Annexure-B) the application filed by the respondent-petitioner was only ‘considered withdrawn’ for non-payment cost fixed by the ICC Court of Arbitration, even after lapse of 4 months. Hence the intimation conveyed in letter dated 17.4.12 (Annexure-B) does not, in any way, affected the originality of the award, nor it can be treated as an award or it’s interpretation or modification, whatsoever. More so, the decision conveyed in letter dated 17.4.2012 that the Article 29(2) was ‘considered withdrawn’ was conveyed for the default of the petitioner in depositing the additional advanced cost US$ 5,000 on 19.1.2012. The petitioner cannot take advantage of their own default, nor they can interpret the same as an addendum to the original award. As such the entire period of 200 days, that has elapsed before filing this petition under section 42(2) read with section 43, is to be counted and  ex-facie the petition is barred by special period of limitation prescribed in sub-section (2) of section 42. In support of his contention the learned Advocate for the applicant-respondent No.4 has referred to the decision reported in 2011 (2)R.A.J. 142 (Bom): Amit Suryakant Lunavat Vs. Kotak Securities, Mumbai, and another decision reported in 7 BLT (HCD) 1999 page 265: Mol Enterprises Inc. Vs. Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. The learned Advocate also submits that the application dated 28.12.2011 was filed by the petitioner under Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules for interpretation of the award and not for setting aside the award. As such, admittedly there was no cause of action to file any application for setting aside the award and if the petitioner had any cause of action at all to file a petition for setting aside the award then they would have filed this petition under section 42 (2) read with section 43 of the Arbitration Act within 60 days from 27.11.2011, the date of receiving the award, instead of filing the application under Article 29 (2) seeking interpretation of the award. There is no other forum, he continues, to file the petition for setting aside the award except that as provided for under section 42(2) of the Act. Since the petitioner has not come before this court with this application under section 42(2) read with section 43, within the period of 60 days, as prescribed in section 42(2) of the Act, so this petition is hopelessly barred by limitation and there is no cause of action for filing this petition. He also submits that because of the inordinate delay in the disposal of this matter the opposite parties have been prejudiced seriously due to financial hardship for non-payment of their claim and in the filed of trade and commerce time is an essence. Besides, the futile step taken by the petitioner, he submits, is bound to frustrate the spirit of introducing the scheme of ADR/ Arbitration in several statute as a matter of public policy for settlement of disputes within the soonest possible time. In that this view of the matter, the learned counsel has prayed for rejection of this substantive petition as barred by limitation and for want of cause of action as well as for appropriate order to implementing the award.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Mehedi Hasan Chowdhury, appearing for respondent No.2, while expressed his concurrence with the submissions advanced by the learned Advocate for the respondent No.4, has further added that the letter dated 17.4.2012 (Annexure-D) has been issued owing to the default of the petitioner in depositing the cost fixed by the court of Arbitration, within the time. The cost was due pursuant to filing of the application under Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules, seeking interpretation of the award. The aforesaid letter dated 17.4.2012 cannot be interpreted to mean that the ICC Court of Arbitration has rejected the application considering the same as <em>unnecessary</em> or <em>impossible</em>, to invoke the provisions of clause (c) of section 41(2) of the Act. As such the submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioner that the arbitration proceedings should be deemed to have been terminated on 17.4.2012 as per clause-(c) of sub-section (2) of section 41 of the Act is devoid of any substance and far from the facts on record. In fact, he further submits, the arbitration proceedings has been concluded or came to an end upon passing of the award on 27.11.2011 and the limitation period shall be counted from the date of receiving the award on 29.11.2011 by the petitioner, as admitted by the petitioner at paragraph No. 4 of their affidavit in opposition filed against the petition for rejection. Hence, limitation period of 60 days is to be counted from 29.11.2011, on which date the petitioner has admittedly received the award. In either circumstances the petition is barred by limitation as has been rightly pointed out by the learned Advocate for the applicant- respondent No.4, he also adds. If there were any scope to accept the submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioner that the time elapsed between 28.12.2011 to 17.4.2012 is to be excluded then, he continues, the petition is filed, at least after 88 days. Whereas, in fact it has been filed after 200 days. Next, referring to an unreported decision of this Division, passed in Arbitration Application case No.9 of 2013 and Arbitration Application Case No.10 of 2013, in which the Roads and High ways Department was opposite parties, this court has decided in a single judgment that the time limit of 60 days shall be counted from date the petition has been posted in the daily cause list for admission hearing, not from the date of swearing affidavit and in those cases both the petitions were found time barred since those were filed after expiry of 60 days period and the awards given in favour of the Roads and High way Department sustained. The same principle shall apply to the facts and circumstances of the present case. He, also submits that the award dated 27.11.2011 (Annexure-A to the petition) is very much clear and complete in itself. Hence, the respondent-petitioner did not pursue their application dated 28.12.2011 filed under Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules, nor deposited the cost fixed by the ICC court of Arbitration, in the result that application seeking interpretation of the award was considered withdrawn. As, such the petitioner should not deprive the Claimants from the fruit of the ‘award’ given in their favour by further lingering their claim. Accordingly he prays that the petition is liable to be rejected as barred by limitation and not filed bonafide.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Fida M. Kamal, appearing alongwith the learned Advocate Dr. A.K.M.Ali for respondent No.1, has adopted the submissions made by the learned counsels for the respondent No.4 and respondent No.2 that the petition is barred by limitation in the facts and circumstances of this case considered with reference to the special periods of limitation prescribed in section 42(2) of the Act. <br/> <br/>I have heard the learned Advocates appearing for the petitioner, the learned advocate appearing for applicant-respondent No. 4 as well as the learned advocates appearing for the other respondents. I have perused the petition filed by the respondent No.4 for rejection of the petition filed for setting aside award, the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the petitioner against the said application alongwith the substantive application and the documents annexed therewith.<br/> <br/>At the out set it should be recorded that whether the petition is barred by limitation or not is a mixed question law and facts. However, there are adequate materials on record as well as the statements made in the pleadings to decide about the factual aspect of this issue, whereas for legal aspect the provisions of section 42(2) and 55(1) of the Act is to be looked into.<br/> <br/>Since all the parties have agreed and since it is expressly stipulated in the admission order dated 19.06.2012 of this court that “let the application be admitted, subject to any objection which may be raised by the opposite-parties with regard to limitation at the time of hearing”, therefore, I am of the opinion that the issues of limitation has to be taken first. In other words, the issues as to whether the petition is barred by limitation has been taken as the preliminary issue. Because, if the petition is found barred by limitation then the petition will be liable to be rejected on this ground alone.<br/> <br/>It is admitted by the petitioner (respondent before the International Court of Arbitration) that the arbitrations arose from 04 (four) contracts of Road Maintenance Component (RMC). The request for arbitration was initially filed on behalf of five claimants, including AKT-Xerbel JV which withdrew from the arbitration with consent of all the parties. No party objected to commencing one arbitration in respect of all four contracts. The claimants and the present petitioner jointly nominated that Arbitration Tribunal consisting of a sole arbitrator which nomination was then confirmed by the Secretary General of the International Chamber of Commerce Interna-tional Court of Arbitration (ICC Court) on 3<sup>rd</sup> October 2008 pursuant to Article 9(2) of the ICC Rules of Arbitration. The Terms of Reference in the arbitration (“TOR”) were finalized and signed in a meeting with the claimants and the respondent on 31 March 2009 and were communicated to the ICC Court on 23 April 2009 pursuant to Article 18(2) of the ICC Rules of Arbitration.<br/> <br/>Next, having considered the statements made in paragraph No.10 of the petition, I find that it has also been admitted by the petitioner that the final award was given on 27.11.2011. It has been admitted to by the petitioner, at paragraph No. 4 of the affidavit in opposition, that the petitioner has received the award on 29.1.2011. But, admittedly the petitioner has not filed this petition within 60 days from date of receiving the award, as prescribed by section 42(2) of the Act.<br/> <br/>It has been stated in paragraph No.11 of the substantive petition as well as in paragraph No.4 of the affidavit-in-opposition of the petitioner that the respondent-petitioner had filed an application under Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules of Arbitration on 28.12.2011 <u>for interpretation of the award</u>. But the Secretariat of the ICC International Court of the Arbitration, through it’s letter dated 17.4.2012 (Annexure-B), has communicated to the respondent-petitioner that “Respondent’s requests to further extension of time for 8 weeks from 16.4.2012. Respondent requests a further extension of time of 8 weeks from 16 April 2012 within which of pay the additional advance on cost fixed by the court at US$ 5000. We note that since the court fixed the additional advance on costs on 19 January 2012, some four months ago, no payment of US$ 5000 has been received. In light of all the circumstances, Respondent’s Article 29 Application is <u>considered withdrawn</u>.” The learned advocate Mr. A. F. Hasan Arif, appearing for the petitioner, has frankly conceded that this intimation of decision, considering the application under Article 29(2) as withdrawn, does not fit in the definition or meaning of award. (emphasis added)<br/> <br/>Apart from what is conceded, I am of the considered view that the decision commu-nicated in letter dated 17.4.2012 (Annexure-B) cannot be treated or termed as an ‘award’ for the reason that in that letter the ICC Secretariat has only informed that the petition filed under Article 29(2) of ICC Rule is ‘considered withdrawn’ for not depositing the cost on 1.9.2011, as fixed by ICC International Court of Arbitration. This decision was not formed by the Arbitrator appointed by the parties, nor the application under Article 29(2) was referred to the Arbitrator appointed by the parties, nor the decision dated 17.4.2012 decides or disposes of any dispute between the parties or otherwise modify, review or adds to the award originally passed. Hence, the award passed on 27.11.2011 retains its originality as has been held in 2011(2) R.A.J 142 (BOM), at paragraph 13, that “there is no justification, as contended, to accept the submission in view of the mandate of section 34 and considering the scheme and purpose of the Arbitration Act that because the application under section 33 of the Act was filed and it was rejected subsequently, therefore, the limitation period commenced afresh from the date of such decision of the award. In my view, it is contemplated only on a situation where the Arbitrator corrects or interprets and/or add or decide to add any additional claims and modified the award as only in such cases the original award losses its originality and therefore an application for setting aside the award needs to be filed within three months from the date of receipt of such corrected or modified award. Therefore the party who received the award after deciding the application under section 34(3) of the Act, may get the benefit of fresh commencement of limitation from the receipt of the modified and/or corrected award and not otherwise.” In 7 BLT (HCD) 265, it has been held that the application (under section 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940) challenging the validity of the Award having been filed after a period of 30 days as enshrined in Article-158 of the Limitation Act, the same could not be entertained and section 5 of the Limitation Act was not at all applicable for condonation of delay”. I respectfully agree with the views expressed in these two cases decided under the Arbitration Act, 1940 and accordingly hold that the limitation period, in facts and circumstances of this case, shall be counted from the date of receiving the award on 29.11.2011 by the petitioner (as admitted in paragraph No. 4 of its affidavit in opposition filed against the application for rejection) and that the petitioner ought to have filed it’s petition under section 42(2) read with section 43 of the Act within 60 days from the date of receiving the award (i.e. within 60 days from 29.11.2011) as prescribed in subsection (2) of section 42 of the Act. Hence, for not filing the petition within 60 days from 29.11.2011 the same is clearly barred by special limitation prescribed under section 42(2) of the Act.<br/> <br/>The words occurring in section 55(1) of the Act that “HC BC­el ¢hd¡e¡hm£ ü¡­f­r”, unambiguously and clearly indicates that the Limitation Act, 1908 will apply only subject to the special limitation prescribed in the Arbitration Act 2011 (the Act). Since, section 42(2) of the Act has prescribed special period of limitation, the Act itself being a special law, the petitioner ought to have filed its petition for setting aside the award within 60 days from 29.11.11, i.e. within 28.1.2012. For not filing the petition within 28.1.2012 the same is clearly barred by special limitation prescribed under section 42(2) of the Act.<br/> <br/>Besides, the period elapsed between 28.12.2011 [the date of filing application under sub-article (2) of Article 29 of the ICC Rules] and 17.4.2012 [the date of the letter of the secretariat of ICC International Court of Arbitration] intimating that the Article 29 application of the respondent (petitioner in this case) is ‘<em>considered</em> <em>withdrawn’</em> for not depositing the cost, shall not be excluded in counting the period of limitation. Because, the petitioner cannot be allowed to be benefited from its own default, least it will be a convenient excuse to any unscrupulous person to frustrate the special limitation by resorting to such tactics and because there is no proviso to section 42(2) of the Act making any room for exclusion of time on this or any other ground.<br/> <br/>Moreover, the letter dated 17.4.2012 (Annexure-B) and the message it conveyed is neither an award nor modification, addendum or correction of the award. So, the award retains it’s originality and the time, for the purpose of limitation, is to be counted from 29.11.2011 and I also hold that the arbitration proceeding was terminated on 27.11.2011, the date of passing the award.<br/> <br/>Besides, as alleged in paragraph No. 13 of the petition, the application dated 28.12.2011 filed under Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules is not a review application. This was an application for ‘interpretation of the award’ dated 27.11.2011, as admitted in paragraph No. 4 of the affidavit in opposition filed by the petitioner. Sub-Article (2) of Article 29 of the ICC Rules reads as follow: “Any application of a party <u>for the correction of an error of the kind referred to in Article 29(1), or for the interpretation of an Award</u>, must be made to the Secretariat within 30 days of the receipt of the Award by such party, in a number of copies as stated in Article 3(1). After transmittal of the application to the Arbitral Tribunal, the latter shall grant the other party a short time limit, normally not exceeding 30 days, from the receipt of the application by that party, to submit any comments thereon. If the Arbitral Tribunal decides to correct or interpret the award, it shall submit its decision in draft from to the court not later than 30 days following the expiration of the time limit for the receipt of any comments from the other party or within such other period as the court may decide.” As such, the application dated 28.12.2011 was not a review application, since Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules does not make any provision for ‘review’ of the award, nor the same was disposed of in the manner laid down in sub-article (2) of Article 29 of the ICC Rules. Hence, neither the said application dated 28.11.2012 of the petitioner, nor the decision/ letter dated 17.4.2012 (Annexure-B) is of any help to the petitioner to overcome the period of special limitation prescribed under section 42(2) of the Act, while on the admitted position of the petitioner the petition is filed after 86 (eighty six) days, as recorded herein before, though the facts on record shows that the petition was filed after 200 days. (emphasis added)<br/> <br/>Next, having considered the judgment dated 31.07.2013 passed in two unreported cases, viz Arbitration Application No.9 of 2013 and Arbitration Application No.10 of 2013, in which two applications filed for setting aside of the award under Section 42(2) of the Act was rejected by this court as barred by limitation and it has been held in those 2(two) cases, disposed of by the single judgment, that the time limit of 60 days shall be counted from the date the applications have been posted in the daily cause list for admission hearing and not for the date of swearing affidavit. I see no reason to depart from the views taken in the judgment dated 31.7.2013 passed in Arbitration Application No.9 of 2013. Even though, the date of swearing affidavit is taken into consideration this petition is also hopelessly barred by limitation.<br/> <br/>I also find substance in the submission of the learned Advocate for the applicant-respondent No.4 that there is no cause of action for filling this petition under section 42 sub-section (2) read with section 43 of the Act. Because, admittedly the petitioner has filed an application Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules seeking the interpretation of the award, not seeking to set-aside the award if the petitioner had any cause of action for filling an application to set aside award then they would have file this petition immediately after receiving the award on 29.11.2011, at least within 60 days there from, but they did not. Therefore, it can be safely concluded the petitioner had no cause of action to file this petition for setting aside the award. Moreover, the respondent-petitioner (Roads &amp; High Ways) having not deposited the additional cost fixed by the ICC court of Arbitration, for hearing of the application filed under Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules of Arbitration seeking interpretation of the award dated 27.11.2011, the submission of the learned advocate for the petitioner that the said application was filed bonafide can hardly make any favourable impression. I must refer to the decision reported in 44 DLR(AD) page 260: Rupali Bank Limited and other Vs. Tafazal Hossain and others, also referred to in the judgment dated 31.7.2013 passed while disposing of Arbitration Application No.9 of 2013 and Arbitration Application No.10 of 2013. In that case it has been held by the Appellate Division that “Jurisdiction of a Court goes to the very root of a matter brought before it and if the Court got no jurisdiction everything shall fall through. The Court who got no jurisdiction over a matter shall not get into the merit of the matter.” Accordingly I am of the view that although this court has jurisdiction to decide whether it has jurisdiction, however, once it has arrived at conclusion that the substantive petition is barred by limitation then it does not have jurisdiction to get into the merit of this matter.<br/> <br/>In view of the deliberation recorded above, I am of the view that the application for rejection of the substantive petition has merit and the substantive petition is barred by limitation.<br/> <br/>In the result the petition is allowed and the substantive petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/>The order of stay passed at the time of admission of this application is hereby vacated and the award is restored. The petitioner shall take immediate steps towards marking payment as per the award, passed long back on 27.11.2011.<br/> <br/>The parties will bear their respective cost.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.<br/><br/>Reference: 4 LNJ (2015) 110.</strong><br/><br/> </div></div></div>

The machineries were to be installed under the direction of one Mr. A.H.M. Aminur Rahman, Executive Engineer and Mr. Imam Ali, Deputy Manager, BADC. The defendant also directed the plaintiff to install a rolling shutter at the cost of Tk. 1,00,000/- as non-tender item. The plaintiff respondent completed the work in terms of the specification mentioned in the tender notice and submitted bill of Tk. 8,79,000/- but the defendant did not pay the bill without any reason. In such facts and circums-tances the plaintiff prayed for appointment of an Arbitrator in terms of the agreement between the parties and claimed an amount of Tk. 8,79,000/- being the cost against the work done in terms of the tender notice, Tk. 1,00,000/- for non-tender item, interest of Tk. 32,00,000/- for withholding the amount for about 12 years and also Tk. 30,00,000/- for damaging plaintiff’s reputation in the form of business loss and loss of goodwill.<br/><br/>The defendant being the second party filed written objection in the arbitration proceeding and Mr. Israil Hossain a retired District Judge was appointed Arbitrator by order dated 11.12.1986. This appointment was challenged before the High Court Division and the appointment was cancelled and the learned Sub-ordinate Judge was directed to appoint a new Arbitrator Mr. Moksudur Rahman, learned Advocate, who was then appointed Arbitrator, but this order was again challenged and the High Court Division set aside the appointment of Mr. Moksudur Rahman as Arbitrator and directed the learned Sub-ordinate Judge to appoint a new Arbitrator. Thereafter, the learned Sub-ordinate Judge upon hearing the parties by order dated 25.02.1997 appointed Mr. Israil Hossain, Advocate as Arbitrator and fixed 02.05.1997 to file the award. The Arbitrator accordingly entered into the reference and filed the award before the court on 30.04.1997.<br/><br/>The plaintiff-respondent then made a prayer for making the award rule of the court and the defendant-appellant filed an application on 01.06.1997 under section 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, for setting aside the award dated 28.04.1997. On these two applications Title Suit No. 191 of 2001 of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Court of the Joint District Judge, Dhaka was started. The learned Joint District Judge, by the impugned order dated 21.10.2001 found that the learned Arbitrator filed the award in accordance with law and committed no misconduct and the award was proper and valid. Accordingly by judgement and order dated 21.10.2001 the learned Joint District Judge made the award dated 28.04.1997 rule of the court.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgement and order the defendant as appellant has preferred First Miscellaneous Appeal under section 39 (I)(VI) of the  Arbitration Act, 1940.  <br/><br/>By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court Division dismissed the appeal with cost of Tk. 10,000/- which was to be deposited by the appellant before the trial court within a period of 3 months from the date of the receipt of this order by the trial court.<br/><br/>The defendant then filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 472 of 2004 before this Division. Leave was granted to consider the following grounds:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“I. Whether the Arbitrator committed misconduct in making the award ex-parte depriving the petitioner BADC of the opportunity to take the matter before the High Court Division and it will be seen on the face of the record that the Arbitrator made the award ex-parte on 28.04.1997 rejecting the prayer for adjournment on 27.04.1997 on the ground that 02.05.1997 was fixed for filing the award although the order of appointment of Arbitrator was stayed till 02.05.1997 and the High Court Division committed an error of law in dismissing the appeal without considering that in view of the facts and circumstances the ex-parte award in not sustainable; and<br/>II. Whether the High Court Division committed an error of law in arriving at a finding that the order of stay has not been brought to the notice of the Arbitrator without considering that on 27.04.1997 an adjournment was sought for bringing the matter to the notice of the Arbitrator that the learned Sub-ordinate Judge stayed the appointment of Arbitrator for moving a revisional application before the High Court Division; hence the Arbitrator committed legal misconduct in rejecting the application for adjournment and in making the award.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant made submissions in line with the grounds upon which leave was granted. He submitted that the Arbitrator committed misconduct in making the award on 28.04.1997 where on the face of the record the learned Subordinate Judge had stayed the matter till 02.05.1997. He submitted that the order of stay was communicated to the Arbitrator on 27.04.1997 when a prayer for adjournment of the arbitration was moved. He submitted that the High Court Division committed an error of law in dismissing the appeal without considering the facts and circumstances especially since the award was made when there was an existing order of stay by the learned Subordinate Judge whereby the order to file the award by 02.05.1997 was stayed till 02.05.1997. Hence, the filing of the award on 30.04.1997 was in contravention of the order of stay. The learned Advocate further submitted that the High Court Division committed an error of law in arriving at a finding that the order of stay has not been brought to the notice of the Arbitrator when the facts disclose that on 27.04.1997 an adjourn-ment was sought bringing the matter to the notice of the Arbitrator that the learned Sub-ordinate Judge stayed the appointment of Arbitrator for moving a revisional application before the High Court Division; hence the Arbitrator committed legal misconduct in rejecting the application for adjournment and in making the award. The learned Advocate lastly submitted that the High Court Division committed an error of law in dismissing the appeal without considering that Mr. Md. Israil Hossain (retired District Judge) was appointed Arbitrator by an order dated 03.12.1986 which order was set aside by the High Court Division on 28.04.1994 in Civil Revision No. 653 of 1991 and the same Mr. Md. Israil Hossain was again appointed Arbitrator by an order dated 25.02.1997. He was, therefore obliged to start that arbitration proceedings afresh by issuing fresh notices on the parties. The award shows that the arbitration was started in 1991 which is an illegality since the earlier appointment was cancelled by order of the High Court Division. <br/><br/>Mr. Nurul Amin, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent made submission in support of the impugned judgement and order of the High Division. He submitted that the order of stay was not communicated to the arbitrator; only an adjournment was sought. He further submitted the re-appointment of the arbitrator was not illegal since the second appointment was made after hearing both parties.   <br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates appearing for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/><br/>The High Court Division noted that the learned Subordinate Judge himself stayed operation of his own order dated 25.02.1997 appointing Mr. Md. Israil Hossain as Arbitrator. However, the High Court Division dismissed the appeal upon finding that there was nothing on record to indicate that the order of stay was served on the learned Arbitrator or that any party to the arbitration proceeding brought the stay order to the notice of the Arbitrator.<br/><br/>Upon scrutiny of the papers on record, it is apparent from the order of the learned Arbitrator dated 27.04.1997 that the second party (defendant) prayed for adjournment. It further appears that, in his application dated 27.04.1997 addressed to the learned Arbitrator, the defendant made a prayer to the learned Arbitrator not to proceed with the arbitration in view of the fact that he (defendant) had taken steps to file a civil revision before the High Court Division in connection with appointment of the Arbitrator. The defendant further pointed out in his application for adjournment that the Third Court of Subordinate Judge had stayed the matter for 10 days. It appears to us quite clear that the defendant had categorically intimated to the learned Arbitrator that his appointment was under challenge and that there was an order of stay by the learned Subordinate Judge.<br/><br/>In view of the above, it is patently clear that the order appointing the learned Arbitrator was stayed by the court making the appointment and the fact of the stay order and the challenge against the appointment before the High Court Division was brought to the notice of the learned Arbitrator. It appears that the High Court Division has overlooked this aspect of the case. It is also apparent that the learned Arbitrator acted beyond his jurisdiction when the order appointing him as Arbitrator was stayed. These facts having been brought to his notice in the application for adjournment, it was clearly misconduct on the part of the learned Arbitrator to proceed with hearing the arbitration and making an award during the pendency of the order of stay.<br/><br/>We find substance in the submission of the learned advocate for the appellant and for the reasons stated above we find merit in the appeal, which is, accordingly, allowed, without however any order as to costs. The parties are at liberty to take steps for appointment of a new Arbitrator, if so advised.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.<br/><br/>Reference: 4 LNJ AD (2015) 125</strong></div><div><div id="ftn1"> </div></div></div></div>
