The wife of the informant Ayatun Nahar protested. Then the accused persons attacked her. Accused Abdul Mannan gave a spade blow causing grievous bleeding injury on her left arm and she fell down. Other accused persons also assaulted her. They also outraged her modesty and took away a gold necklace from her neck. His (informant’s) six year old daughter, Ripa Mani Akter came forward to rescue her mother when accused Abdul Mannan struck on her head with the back of a spade causing fracture of her head and her brain came out. Other accused persons also beat her. She died instantaneously. Hearing hue and cry the witnesses, namely Amiruddin Master, Enam, Abul Kalam, Hasan and Md. Nurul Islam came forward. Then the accused persons fled away. The informant upon receiving the information returned home and heard the occurrence from his wife and other witnesses.<br/><br/>Accordingly Chakaria Police Station Case No. 21 dated 20.1.2001 under sections 143/447/323/354/379/302/ 34 of the Penal Code against six accused persons was recorded.<br/><br/>After completion of investigation the Investigating Officer submitted charge-sheet No. 113 dated 23.05.2002  under sections 143/447/323/324/354/379/302 of the Penal Code against 6 (six) FIR named accused.<br/><br/>The learned Magistrate concerned accepted the police report and issued warrant of arrest against the accused persons. Thereafter, one Inspector of CID with reference to a letter of Police Head Quarters, Dhaka, filed an application to the Magistrate concerned seeking permission for re-investigation and to have the case docket. This application was allowed. An Inspector of CID after re-investigation submitted “supplementary” charge sheet No. 18 dated 28.02.2004 under section 302 of the Penal Code against Ayatun Nahar, the wife of the informant and mother of the deceased while stating that during his investigation he did not find any evidence against the six accused named in the earlier charge sheet. The Magistrate concerned accepted that supplementary charge sheet, issued warrant of arrest against Ayatun Nahar and discharged the six accused persons, against whom the earlier charge sheet had been submitted.<br/><br/>Against that order the informant preferred Criminal Revision No. 49 of 2004 under section 439A of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the Sessions Judge, Cox’s Bazar, which was summarily rejected.<br/><br/>Thereafter, the informant moved the High Court Division filing an application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the proceeding of the case pending against accused Ayatun Nahar and obtained Rule.<br/><br/>By the impugned judgement and order the High Court Division discharged the Rule and set aside the order dated 29.3.2004 passed by the learned Magistrate in the aforesaid case so far as it relates to discharging the six accused persons, against whom the earlier charge sheet had been submitted. The High Court Division also ordered that two cases, the one against the six accused persons charge-sheeted earlier and the other against Ayatun Nahar will be tried simultaneously by the same Court as cross-cases in accordance with law.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division the petitioner has filed the instant criminal petition for leave to appeal before this Division.<br/><br/>Mr. Jamiruddin Sirker, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that once a charge sheet had been submitted and accepted by the court, under the scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is no scope for reinvestigation into the case, and the submission of a supplementary charge sheet after reinvestigation, and the proceeding on the basis of such supplementary charge sheet is illegal, without jurisdiction and an abuse of the process of the court. He further submitted that the CID filed the application for reinvestigation into the case with ulterior motive in order to exonerate the real culprits and included the name of the informant’s wife as an accused in the so-called supplementary charge sheet in order to screen the real offenders. The learned Advocate pointed out that the earlier charge sheet clearly implicated the six accused persons with <em>prima facie</em> evidence, which was accepted by the learned Magistrate. In such event, even further investigation would not justify a final report against those accused persons who had been included in the earlier charge sheet on the basis of evidence gathered as a result of the first investigation. He also submitted that the High Court Division failed to appreciate that there is no provision for reinvestigation upon scrapping the earlier investigation report. Referring to section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, he submitted that there is no provision for reinvestigation of any case once a charge sheet has been submitted and accepted by the court. He pointed out that section 173 (3B) of the said Code provides for further investigation, but there is no scope for reinvestigation. In support, he referred to the case of Afia Khatoon versus Mobasswir Ali and others, reported in 3 BLT (AD) 74.<br/><br/>Mr. Khondaker Mahbub Hossain, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents submitted that the criminal miscellaneous case filed by the petitioner before the High Court Division was not maintainable since the petitioner had earlier filed two separate criminal revisions before the Sessions Judge without filing any Naraji Petition against the acceptance of the second charge sheet and these facts were suppressed. He further submitted that since the investigation by the CID has revealed prima facie evidence against the informant’s wife, there is no reason why the proceedings against her could not continue.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates for the parties concerned, perused the impugned judgement as well as the evidence and materials on record.<br/><br/>There is no gainsaying that the Code of Criminal Procedure does not provide for reinvestigation of any case. Whether or not the investigation done in any case subsequent to the submission of a charge sheet after the initial investigation is completed, is the result of a “reinvestigation” or a “further investigation” is a matter of semantics. The question that may be posed is whether or not there would be any prejudice if instead of calling it “reinvestigation”, the second investigation was termed “further investigation”, which is allowed by the law. Under normal circumstances, if on the basis of fresh evidence a supplementary charge sheet is submitted, for example by adding names of accused person(s) who had not been included in the initial charge sheet, there would be no questioning the legality of the supplementary charge sheet. That clearly is the purpose of section 173 (3B) of the Code.<br/><br/>However, in the facts of the instant case, it appears that although the initial charge sheet was submitted naming six accused persons upon finding <em>prima facie</em> evidence against them, the CID filed an application categorically for “reinvestigation” and thereafter went on to exonerate those six persons  against whom charge sheet had been submitted and accepted by the learned Magistrate, while at the same time implicating the informant’s wife as an accused in the case. To our mind, the action of the CID smacks of <em>mala fide</em> which leads us to conclude that the subsequent charge sheet was indeed the result of reinvestigation, especially when we note that the subsequent charge sheet dated 28.02.2004 bears a new and independent number. Clearly it is not a supplementary charge sheet.<br/><br/>In view of the above discussion, we are of the opinion that the High Court Division was correct in directing the trial to proceed against the six accused persons who were named in the first charge sheet. However, we are of the view that the second charge sheet is not one contemplated under the law and hence it is illegal. No trial can take place against accused Ayatun Nahar, on the basis of such illegal and palpably motivated charge sheet. Accordingly the impugned judgement and order passed by the High Court Division is modified. The direction of the High Court Division so far as it relates to Ayatun Nahar is set aside.<br/><br/>We would again reiterate that section 173 (3B) of the Code allows for further investigation and submission of a further report with further evidence, oral or documentary in respect of an offence, even after a report had been forwarded to the Magistrate under section 173 (1) of the Code. Hence, in this case, if it is felt necessary, a further investigation may be carried out and any other person or persons implicated as accused for the offence, if <em>prima facie</em> evidence is found against him/her/them.<br/><br/>With the above observations, this criminal petition for leave to appeal is disposed of.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Section 3 of the said Act has been amendment on 14.7.2009 by inserting the provision to prosecute “individual or group of individuals” with immediate effect. Thereafter 15<sup>th</sup> amendment of the constitution was made on 3.7.2011 by amending Article 47 (3) adding and making amendment into the Constitution to try the “individual or group of individuals or organization”.<br/> <br/>Now the question has been raised by the learned Advocate for the petitioner, whether the amendment of section 3 of the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act shall operate retrospectively or prospectively and that during amendment of the ICT Act it had any constitutional Sanction. This question should be examined by this Court.<br/> <br/>The learned Attorney General has referred 3 decisions passed in W.P. No. 7353 of 2010, W.P. No. 5391/2010 and the judgment and order passed in Criminal Misc. Case No. 34345 of 2010.

The petitioner further challenges the constitutionality of section 19 of the Constitution (Fifteenth) Amendment Act, 2011 amending Article 47(3) of the Constitution by inserting therein the expressions “or any indiv-idual, group of individuals or organization”<br/> <br/>Mr. T.H. Khan, learned senior counsel appearing along with Mr. A.K.M. Fakrul Islam, learned advocate, for the petitioner, submits that the impugned amendments have been made for bringing some new persons into the scope of the trial by the International Crimes Tribunal (“I.C.T”) with malafide intention. He submits that since the said amendments have been given retrospective effect, the same should be declared ultra virus the Constitution. Learned advocate further submits that the impugned amendments have abridged the fundamental rights of the millions of citizens of this country as the same placed them at the mercy of the executive authority and as such the same is a colourable exercise of legislative power and a fraud on the Constitution. Referring to the Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order, 1972 (P.O. 8 of 1972), Mr. Khan argues that the impugned amendments have been done for usurpation of the jurisdiction of the Tribunals which may be constituted under the P.O. 8 of 1972 as the P.O. 8 of 1972 is meant for the trial of individual or group of individuals for the same offence. Learned advocate finally submits that the impugned amendments have also dismantled the basic structure of the Constitution and as such the same should be declared ultra virus the Constitution.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Attorney General for Bangladesh, seriously opposes the issuance of Rule Nisi on the ground that the instant writ petition is a frivolous one being devised by the same learned advocate, namely Mr. A.K.M. Fakrul Islam, who has been taking recourse to the same practice and filing applications one after another before this Court only to jeopardise the trial of some individuals who allegedly committed crimes against humanity and war crimes during our war of liberation. Referring to the rejection orders passed in Writ Petition No.6836 of 2010, Writ Petition No.5391 of 2010, Writ Petition No.7353 of 2010 and Criminal Miscellaneous Case No 34345 of 2010 (Moulana Motiur Rahman Nizami-petitioner), learned Attorney General submits that in all those matters the trial by the ICT of persons for committing war crimes and the crimes against humanity was challenged on several pretexts, but this Court rejected those applications summarily. Mr. Alam further raises serious objection as to the Locus Standi of the petitioner for filing the instant application on the ground that the petitioner is a busy-body and just being used for moving this Court under Article 102 to circumvent the complete bar against such petitions as provided under Articles 47(3) and 47A of the Constitution.<br/> <br/>Heard the submissions of the learned advocates, perused the writ petition and papers annexed thereto. On the issue of Locus Standi Mr. T.H. Khan submits that since one Advocate’s Locus Standi in Beru Bari Case was allowed by our Appellate Division, the petitioner, being an advocate, should also be allowed locus standi since the matter involves important questions of law regarding the interpretation of the Constitution. It appears from the decision in Beru Bari Case [reported in 26 DLR (AD)-44] that the circumstances for allowing locus standi to the learned advocate in that case were totally different from the present ones. In Beru Bari case, the fundamental rights of the said Advocate to move freely through out the territory of Bangladesh, to reside and settle in any place therein as well as his right of franchise were affected and as such he was allowed to challenge an international treaty. In this matter before us, the petitioner, under paragraph-3 of the writ petition, has explained his locus standi. Having gone through the said statements, I am of the view that the same are amorphous and vague. Neither he is an accused, nor a prospective accused before the ICT nor he has any possibility of being implicated in any case before the International Crime Tribunal as his present age, according to him, is 41 years. The milestone case in our jurisdiction on the question of locus standi in public interest litigation is <strong>Dr. Mohiuddin Faroque’s case [49 DLR (AD)-1],</strong> which expanded the then existed restricted view of locus standi. Even after such expansion, our Appellate Division cautioned about the busy-bodies of this Court who might come up with frivolous applications under the garb of public interest litigation. In this regard, paragraph 50 of the said judgment may be referred to. This being the factual and legal position, the petitioner is no better than a busy-body and as such has no Locus standi to move this petition.<br/> <br/>Now, the question of retrospectivity. The crimes against humanity or war crimes normally do not exist in the statute book of a country as the war crime or crimes against humanity do not occur often. Parliament of a State is not prescient of everything. Those abominable crimes are exceptional and they only take place in a war or a war like situation. For that reason even the Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order 1972 (P.O. 8 of 1972) was given retrospective effect for punishing the abettors or collaborators of war crimes or crimes against humanity, although the said crimes took place before the promulgation of the said P.O. 8 of 1972. Immediately after the promulgation of P.O. 8 of 1972, the first Parliament of the newly borned Bangladesh gave complete protection to the trial of the said crimes vide Article 47(2) of the unamended Constitution. Thereafter, the first amendment to the Constitution inserted therein sub-article (3) after sub-article (2) of Article 47, and a separate Article, being Article 47A, was added giving complete protection to any trial of persons who had allegedly committed crimes against humanity or war crimes etc. This protection even extends against any challenge on the ground of retrospectivity. Just after five days of the 1<sup>st</sup> amendment to the Constitution, i.e. on 20.07.1973, International Crimes (Tribunal) Act, 1973 (“ICT Act, 1973”) was enacted making provisions for the trial and punishment of persons accused of committing war crimes or crimes against humanity etc.<br/> <br/>It is well established principle of law and interpretation that the preamble of an Act discloses the intention of the Legislature for enacting the said Act. The preamble of the ICT Act, 1973 is quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>An <u>Act to provide for the detention, prosecution and punishment of persons for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes</u> and other  crimes under international law.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Whereas <u>it is expedient to provide for the detention, prosecution and punishment</u></em><em><u> of persons for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes</u></em><em> and other crimes under international law, and for matters connected therewith;” </em>(Underline supplied)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears from the above quoted preamble that the Legislature enacted the ICT Act, 1973 to provide for the detention, prosecution and punishment of persons for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other crimes under international law. Although, initially, section 3 of the ICT Act, 1973 gave jurisdiction upon the ICT to try and punish only the members of armed, defence or auxiliary forces, the impugned amendments extended its jurisdiction to try and punish any individuals or group of individuals. According to Mr. Khan, this can not be done after 40 years of the liberation war. His apprehension is that it well give the executive authority an unfettered power to bring any one within the scope of the I.C.T. If this argument is accepted, it will apply to any provisions of the Penal Code as well. This scurrilous disbelief towards all the institutions, investigating agencies, the ICT and the judiciary of this country in such a sweeping way is not acceptable. On the other hand, criminal liability does not lapse with the efflux of time. Therefore, this argument has no substance.<br/> <br/>Again, although the petitioner has raised the issue of dismantling the basic structure of the Constitution, apart from a mere statement, neither the petitioner in the petition nor the learned advocate for the petitioner has been able to substantiate it. Further, the question of usurpation of jurisdiction of the Tribunal under Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order, 1972 does also not arise as the P.O. 8 of 1972 does not contain any provision debarring inclusion of any individual or group of individuals within the scope of the I.C.T. Act, 1973 by subsequent amendments.<br/> <br/>It further appears from the order dated 02.02.2011 passed in Writ Petition No. 7353 of 2010 that the Hon’ble 3<sup>rd</sup> Judge of this Court, in rejecting the same summarily, has already expressed anger about the retrograde conduct of the learned advocate Mr. A.K.M. Fakrul Islam. In this regard, his Lordship Mr. Justice Md. Imman Ali observed that the said learned advocate “must take care that this type of conduct should never recur in future”. His Lordship also warned the petitioner of that writ petition about his derogatory comments against the liberation war of Bangladesh holding that the comments were utter distortion of historical facts and brought into question the ethos of liberation war and was a slur on Bengali nationalism. I have also perused the orders passed by this court in other matters as referred to by the learned Attorney General. It appears that the instant writ petition is another frivolous attempt just to jeopardise the long cherished trial of war criminals. Although the name of Mr. A.K.M. Fakrul Islam, learned advocate, is cunningly absent from the record, it is him who has been seeking adjournments etc. since filing of this writ petition. Even today he has been actively assisting Mr. Khan as a junior counsel. Thus, it is clear that it is him who is behind this time consuming and outrageous exercise.<br/> <br/>Since Articles 47(3) and 47 A of the Constitution  have completely debarred any challenge against the trial of crimes against humanity and war crimes by the ICT, and I am of the view that the petitioner does not have locus standi even to move the petition as public interest litigation, this petition does not deserve any Rule.<br/>Accordingly, the Writ Petition is rejected summarily.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Editors Note: </u></strong><br/> <br/><strong><em>The matter was referred to the Hon’ble Chief Justice for steps to settle the case by a third opinion.

According to the petitioner this amendment is likely to usurp the jurisdiction of Tribunals created under the Collaborators (Special Tribunal) Order, 1972, and subject citizens to double jeopardy without discrimination. More so, this will offend against the basic structure of the Constitution.</strong><br/><strong>The International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973, for that matter the International Crimes (Tribunals) (Amendment) Act, 2009 are meant for trial of offences recognized under the international law irrespective of violation of domestic law.  Section 3(2) of the ICT Act has enumerated a list of crimes recognized under the international law, and says, inter alia, that it shall be competent for the ICT to try “murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, abduction, confinement, torture, rape or other inhuman acts committed against any certain population or persecution on political, social, ethical, or religious grounds whether or not in violation  of domestic law of the country where perpetrated. The crime sought to be tried by the ICT is pre-existing under the international law. The international law is to be found not only in treatise but also in customs and practices of states which gradually obtained universal recognition, and from the general principles of justice applied by jurists and practiced by the military courts.</strong><br/><strong>This law is not static, but by continual adaptation follows the needs of a changing world. The crimes under international law are found in the customary international law.  And all the charters of trial of war crimes or crimes against humanity are the expressions of the then existing customary international law. The Nuremberg trial is the first of its kind in the international level where trial of crimes under international law took place. Therefore, the maxim “nullum crimen sine lege” (no punishment of crime without a pre-existing law) has no application since the charter did not create any post facto law. </strong><br/><strong>In the words of Prof. Hans Kelsen ‘the objection most frequently put forward that the law applied by the judgment of Nuremberg is an ex post facto law. There can be little doubt that the London agreement provides individual punishment for acts which, at the time they were performed were not punishable either under international law or under national law. However, this rule against retrospective legislation is not valid at all within international law, and is valid within national law only with important exception.’ </strong><br/><strong>Crime against humanity is an anti-thesis of civilized existence of human race committed as a matter either of the government policy or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by governments or a de facto authority. For the precise reason penal law for punishment of the crime of the kind may not exist in the statute book.  Non-existence of preventive or penal clauses in the statute book cannot mean that the perpetrators will go scot-free. As is earlier said the offence is ingrained in customary international law. And the offenders may be tried under the international law. Rule against retrospectivity, therefore, has no manner of application in such cases. Nuremberg trial, International Criminal Tribunal for the Yugoslavia (ICTY), and International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) are illustrative of the point. </strong><br/><strong>No case of double jeopardy and offending against basic structure could be made out. The Collaborators (Special Tribunal) Order is not in operation now. Question of double jeopardy may fairly be dealt with in an appropriate case should occasion arise. Furthermore, a plain reading of Articles 47 and 47A of the Constitution it becomes amply clear that no law touching upon trial of persons indicted for crimes against humanity can be challenged on ground of constitutionality. The instant writ petition is filed seemingly for delaying and/or disturbing the trial of the persons now facing trial before the ICT. The petitioner appears to be a busy body just meddling with the process of the Court. He does have no locus standi to move this petition. This is an application which does not call for issuance of rule and do reject the application summarily. . . . (2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12 and 14)</strong><br/><br/><br/><span style="font-size:16px"><strong><u>M. Moazzam Husain, J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This application under Article 102 of the Constitution is made seeking to challenge <em>vires </em>of section 3 of the International Crimes (Tribunals) (Amendment) Act, 2009 so far as it relates to amendment of section 3 (1) of the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973 and also<em> vires </em>of section 19 of the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment)Act, 2011, so far it relates to the amendment of Article 47 (3) of the Constitution.<br/> <br/>By the amendment of section 3(1) of the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the “ICT Act”) a new section 3(1) is substituted whereby the expression “any individual or group of individuals” is added to the original section. Which means that the tribunal’s original jurisdiction to try any member of any armed, defense or auxiliary forces is extended to ‘any individual or group of individuals’ who commits or has committed in the territory of Bangladesh any of the crimes mentioned in sub-section (2). <br/> <br/>A corresponding amendment is brought in the Article 47 (3) of the Constitution by section 19 of the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 2011. By the amendment after the words “auxiliary forces” occurring in sub-article (3) the words and comma “or any individual, group of individuals or organization” was added. This means that the immunity of law providing, <em>inter alia,</em> for prosecution of any member of any armed, defence of auxiliary forces from being challenged is extended to prosecution of “any individual, group of individuals or organization.”    <br/> <br/>The challenge sought to be made herein is to the <em>vires</em> of the law seeking to extend the ambit of the category of persons to be brought under trial by the  International Crimes Tribunals (hereinafter referred to as the “ICT”) by addition of the expression “any individual or group of individuals” to the original expression “any member of any armed, defence or auxiliary forces”. The exception taken to the amendments because, according to the petitioner, those expressions were brought in with retrospective effect an in colorable exercise of legislative power without any guideline. The foremost concern of the petitioner is that the amendments have abridged the guarantees of fundamental rights of millions of citizens placing them at the mercy of the prosecuting agencies.<br/> <br/>Mr. T.H. Khan learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the impugned amendments have been made for bringing some new persons into the mischief of International Crimes (Tribunals) Act with <em>mala fide </em>intention. Since the amendment is effected with retrospective effect the amendment should be declared <em>ultra vires </em>as being inconsistent with the Constitution. Learned Counsel further submits that the impugned amendments have abridge the fundamental rights of millions of citizens of this country as the same placed them at the mercy of the prosecuting agencies and as such the same is a colorable exercise of legislative power and fraud upon the Constitution. Mr. Khan next submits by reference to the Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order, 1972 (PO 8 of 1972) that the impugned amendments have been done for usurpation of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal which could be constituted under PO 8 of 1972 as PO 8 of 1972 is meant for trial of individuals or group of individuals for the same offence. Learned Counsel finally submits that the impugned amendments have also dismantled the basic structures of the Constitution as such the same should be declared <em>ultra vires. </em><br/> <br/>Mr. Mahbubey Alam learned Attorney General, opposes the issuance of rule on the ground that the instant petition is a frivolous one being devised by the same learned Advocate, namely Mr. AKM Fakrul Islam who has been filing similar applications one after another before this court only to jeopardize the trial of some individuals who allegedly committed crimes against humanity and war crimes during our war of liberation. Learned Attorney General referred to orders passed in Writ Petition No.6836 of 2010, Writ Petition No.5391 of 2010, Writ Petition No.7353 of 2010 and Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.35345 of 2010 and submits that in all those matters the Trial by the ICT of persons for committing crimes against humanity and war crimes was challenged on different pretext, but the respective courts rejected those applications summarily. Learned Attorney General raises objection as to the standing of the petitioner for filing the instant petition on the ground that the petitioner is an out and out busy body and just set up for moving this court on behalf of the quarters desperately trying to foil the trial of the persons indicted for crime against humanity and war crimes. Mr. Attorney General pointed out that any such application seeking to challenge the <em>vires</em> of law is completely barred under article 47 (3) and 47A of the Constitution.<br/> <br/>I have heard the learned Counsel. It seems to me that Mr. Khan has tried to assail the amendments primarily on the rule against retrospectivity. The International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973 for that matter the International Crimes (Tribunals) (Amendment) Act, 2009 are meant for trial of offences recognized under the international law irrespective of violation of the domestic law. Section 3 (2) of the ICT Act has enumerated a list of crimes recognized under the international law and says, <em>inter alia, </em>that it shall be competent for the ICT to try “murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, abduction, confinement, torture, rape or other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population or persecution on political, racial, ethical or religious grounds, whether or not in violation of domestic law of the country where perpetrated.” The crimes sought to be tried by the ICT are pre- existing under the international law. The international law is to be found not only in treatise, but also in the customs and practices of states, which gradually obtained universal recognition, and from the general principle of justice applied by jurists and practiced by military courts. This law is not static, but by continual adaptation follows the needs of a changing world. The crimes under international law are found in the customary international law. And all the charters for trial of war crimes or crimes against humanity are the expression of the then existing customary international law. The Nuremberg trial is the first of its kind in the international level where trial of crimes under international law took place. Therefore the maxim <em>“nullum crimen sine lege”</em> (no punishment of crime without a pre-existing law) has no application since the charter did not create any <em>post facto</em> law. Professor Hans Kelsen (a jurist &amp; legal philosopher) wrote:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>The objection most frequently put forward … is that the law applied by the judgment of Nuremberg is an ex post facto law. There can be little doubt that the London Agreement provides individual punishment for acts which, at the time they were performed were not punishable, either under international or under national law… However, this rule [against retroactive legislation] is not valid at all within international law, and is valid within national law only with important exceptions.” [quoted from “ International Human Rights in Context, Law, Politics, Morals” by Henry, J, Steiner and Phillip Alston, Second Edition, Oxford University, Press, Page-124]</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Secondly<em>, </em>crime against humanity is an antithesis of civilized existence of human race committed as a matter either of government policy or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by the governments or a <em>de facto </em>authority. For the precise reason penal law for punishment of the crime of the kind may not exist in the statute book. Non- existence of preventive or penal law in the statute book cannot mean that the perpetrators will go scot-free. As is earlier said the offence is ingrained in customary international law. And the offenders may be tried under the international law. Rule against retrospectivity, therefore, has no manner of application in such cases. Nuremberg trial, International Criminal Tribunal For the Former Yugoslavia (“ICTY”) and international Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (“ICTR”) are illustrative of the point. I have, for the reason, no hesitation to reject the contention raised by Mr. Khan on this point.<br/> <br/>The next point raised by Mr. Khan is that the amendments have abridged the fundamental rights of the millions of citizens in that the amendments are so over- broad and vague that same have thrown the citizens at the mercy of the prosecuting agencies. This seems to be a concern having had no substance. ICT is meant for trial of individual or group of individuals against whom the prosecution would be able to submit specific allegation of commission of any one or more of the crimes enumerated in sub-section (2) of section 3 of the ICT Act. Power conferred upon the prosecuting agencies is not unfettered or unguided. Millions of citizens have no reason to feel vulnerable to supposed persecution by any agency. Furthermore, introduction of the expressions “any individual or group of individuals” in the amendments is nothing new and compatible with international practices. Trial and punishment of individuals for committing war crimes and crime against humanity are recognized in international law. Individual cannot escape his liability for committing war crimes or crime against humanity. In all the international tribunals including the Nuremberg, ICTY and ICTR one thing was done in common that is the trial of individuals for war crimes and crimes against humanity. No question was ever raised disputing ‘individual liability’ in war crimes or crime against humanity.<br/> <br/>As for the usurpation of jurisdiction of special tribunals set up under Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order, 1972 raised by Mr. Khan I feel far from being convinced. There is no scope for the persons put to trial to be victim of double jeopardy precisely for the reason that the Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order in not in operation at the moment nor there any tribunal under the Order now functioning. Should occasion arise question of double jeopardy for that matter usurpation may be raised and settled. On the basic structure question, Mr. Khan has not elaborated how the amendments have dismantled the basic structure of the Constitution. It is also difficult to conceive how the widening of the sweep of the law from members of armed, defense or auxiliary forces to any ‘individual or group of individuals’ can offend against basic structure of the Constitution.<br/> <br/>Now turning to the bar created by the Constitution, it is seen that our Constitution under article 47(3) has made the law for detention, prosecution or punishment of any person who is a prisoner of war, for genocide, crime against humanity or war crimes and other crimes under international law immune from attack on the ground that such law or provision of any such law is inconsistent with, or repugnant to, any of the provision of the Constitution. With a view to ensuring smooth and unhindered trial of the offenders the drafters of the Constitution have taken further care by inserting new article 47A in the Constitution. Article 47A has sought to shut out the persons to whom law specified in clause (3) applies from moving the Supreme Court for any of the remedies under the Constitution.<br/> <br/>Article 47A of the Constitution may aptly be quoted:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>47A. (1) The rights guaranteed under article 31, clauses (1) and (3) of article 35 and article 44 shall not apply to any person to whom a law specified in clause (3) of article 47 applies. </em><br/><em>(2) Notwithstanding anything contained</em><em> in this Constitution, no person to whom a law specified in Clause (3) of article 47 applies shall have the right to move the Supreme Court for any of the remedies under the Constitution. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>A plain reading of article 47 and 47A make it amply clear that no law touching upon trial of the persons indicted for crime against humanity or war crimes can be challenged on ground of constitutionality.  And any person to whom any such law applies cannot take recourse to article 31, clauses (1) and (3) of article 35 and article 34 of the Constitution. The writ petition itself is, therefore no sustainable in law.<br/> <br/>Back to the question of standing so seriously argued by the learned Attorney General it appears that one “Advocate Murshedur Rahman Chowdhury” is the petitioner of the writ petition. He has signed the affidavit as “Advocate Murshedur Rahman Chowdhury”. It is not clear he is an advocate by profession or advocate by name. What is found mentioned is that he is 41 years of age and hails from a village of Chittagong district. Over the decades question of standing has been dealt with by the superior courts of the sub-continent and even by the House of Lords in England. True it is that courts of different jurisdictions have taken view in favour of liberalization of standing. But without exception all the courts have expressed their words of caution about meddling with the process of court by meddlesome interloper or busy body. Mr. Khan has referred to the famously known Beru Bari case, 26 DLR (AD) 44, where an Advocate brought the writ petition for vindicating his right to move freely throughout the territory of Bangladesh, to reside and settle in any place therein as well as his right to franchise. His <em>locus standi</em>  to move the Supreme Court was allowed. The Beru Bari case is far distinguishable with the present case. In the Beru Bari case the Advocate was a person personally aggrieved for violation of his fundamental rights. Here in this case  a citizen of Bangladesh with the status of millions of other citizens have come up with this writ petition alleging that amendment brought into the ICT Act and in the Constitution by impugned Amendment Acts have thrown him with millions of others at the mercy of the prosecuting agencies. Thus their fundamental rights are infringed. He has therefore, challenged the vires of law.<br/> <br/>The impugned amendments are concerned about trial of the persons who commits or have committed, amongst others, crimes against humanity as described in section 3 (2) of the ICT Act, 1973. The petitioner is a person of 41 years of age. He does have no chance of being implicated for any such crime committed during liberation war. If upon investigation any such offence committed after the law came into force is found to have been <em>prima facie </em>established against him or any other citizen like him appropriate legal consequence will follow. Prosecution against commission of specific offences has nothing to do with violation of fundamental rights.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile a number of petitions were filed in different jurisdictions of the High Court Division on different pretext. The present writ petition is the last in the sequel filed seemingly for delaying and/or disturbing the trial of the persons now facing trial before the ICT. The petitioner appears to be a busy body just meddling with the process of the court. He does have no <em>locus standi</em> to move this petition.<br/> <br/>For all the reasons stated above I agree with my learned brother Sheikh Hassan Arif, J, that this is an application which does not call for issuance of rule and do reject the application summarily.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

In the first place, the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be firmly established by unimpeachable evidence; secondly, the circumstances are of a determinative tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused; and thirdly, the circumstances taken cumulatively are incapable of explanation of any reasonable hypothesis save and except that of the guilt sought to be proved against the accused. The circumstances should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the probability that the crime was committed by the accused and no one else. . . .

(183)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 103</strong><br/><strong>The non-finding of any blood-stain at the place of occurrence and the non-seizure of any wet earth or sand there from, in our estimation, do not render the prosecution case doubtful.         . . . (192)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 3 and 8</strong><br/><strong>It is true that immediately after the occurrence, the accused Selim absconded and has been on the run as of now. This long unexplained abscondence of the accused Selim is, no doubt, a relevant fact under Section 8 of the Evidence Act and favours the prosecution pointing a finger at his alleged guilt, though abscondence by itself is not conclusive of one’s guilt. This unexplained abscondence of the accused Selim, in our view, is a supporting circumstance which must be considered along with the substantive evidence on record, if any, forthcoming against the accused Selim. The implication of the accused Selim in the commission of the offence in the confessions of the two co-accused, namely, Al Amin and Lalu, it is well-settled, is not a piece of substantive evidence within the meaning of Section 3 of the Evidence Act. . . . (199)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 396</strong><br/><strong>As there are three options in respect of awarding of sentence in Section 396 of the Penal Code, it lies at the discretion of the Court to award an appropriate sentence to each of the accused, regard being had to his individual culpability and role in the commission of the offence, though dacoity is a conjoint offence. The measure of punishment in a given case must depend upon the atrocity of the crime; the conduct of the criminal and the defenceless and unprotected state of the victim. Imposition of appropriate punishment is the manner in which the Court responds to the society’s cry for justice against the criminals. Justice demands that the Court should impose punishment befitting the crime so that the Court reflects public abhorrence of the crime. The Court must not only keep in view the rights of the criminal, but also the rights of the victim of the crime and the society at large while considering imposition of appropriate punishment.  . . .

R. Case No. 156 of 2012 corresponding to Gulshan Police Station Case No. 15 dated 07.03.2012. By the impugned judgment and order, the learned Tribunal Judge convicted the accused-appellants and the co-accused Md. Selim Chowdhury under Section 396 of the Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced each of them thereunder to death. The learned Tribunal Judge also made a Reference to the High Court Division under Section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for confirmation of the death sentence imposed upon them.<br/><br/>All the appeals and the Death Reference have been heard together and are disposed of by this consolidated judgment.<br/><br/>The prosecution version of the case, in short, is as follows:<br/>One Mr. Khalaf Mohammed S. Al Ali, Head of Saudi Citizens’ Affairs, The Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia, Dhaka, Bangladesh went for a nocturnal walk in the late hours of 05.03.2012 and while he was on the nocturnal walk at 01.00 A.M. on 06.03.2012 in the vicinity of his rented flat in Gulshan, the accused Saiful Islam alias Mamun, Md. Al Amin, Akbar Ali Lalu alias Roni, Md. Rafiqul Islam alias Khokon and Md. Selim Chowdhury alias Selim Ahmed came to the northern side of Road No. 120 which is on the southern side of House No. 19/B, Road No. 117, Gulshan Police Station, DMP, Dhaka by a car bearing registration no. Dhaka Metro-Ga-12-9688 and encircled the Saudi diplomat Khalaf. At one stage, the accused attempted to commit dacoity and to that end, some of them started grappling with Khalaf. Finding no valuables in the possession of Khalaf, the accused Saiful Islam fired a shot on Khalaf with a .22 calibre 8-chamber revolver bearing No. 1616819-ARMINIUS-Made in Germany. As a result of the revolver shot, Khalaf fell down on the drain-slab on the northern side of Road No. 120, Gulshan-2. Thereafter he was whisked away to the near-by United Hospital wherein he succumbed to his injury. Eventually the informant Sub-Inspector Md. Mosharraf Hossain of Gulshan Police Station lodged a First Information Report (FIR) therewith. In this connection, it may be noted that at the time of lodgment of the FIR, the names of the accused did not transpire. Anyway, during the investigation of the case, their names transpired and excepting Selim Chowdhury, all the remaining four accused were tracked down by the police and two of them, namely, Md. Al Amin and Akbar Ali Lalu made judicial confessions under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure making a clean breast of the whole incident.<br/><br/>The Investigating Officers of the case are the P. W. 31 Inspector Md. Nure Azam Miah, P. W. 32 Inspector Md. Azizul Haque and P. W. 33 Assistant Commissioner Md. Obaidul Haque. They investigated the case by visiting the place of occurrence. During the investigation of the case, a sketch-map of the place of occurrence along with a separate index was made, witnesses were examined and their statements were recorded under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A copy of the autopsy-report of the deceased Khalaf was procured. Having found a prima facie case, the last Investigating Officer Md. Obaidul Haque (P. W. 33) submitted charge-sheet no. 379 dated 19.09.2012 against all the accused including the absconding accused Md. Selim Chowdhury alias Selim Ahmed under Section 396 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>At the commencement of the trial of the case, the learned Trial Judge charged all the accused-appellants and the co-accused Md. Selim Chowdhury under Section 396 of the Penal Code. The charge was read over and explained to the accused present in the dock; but they pleaded not guilty thereto and claimed to be tried as per law.<br/><br/>The defence version of the case, as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, is that the accused are innocent and have been falsely implicated in the case out of oblique motives and the victim Khalaf was a man of immoral character and his maid-servant was a call-girl and she along with others caused the death of Khalaf at the relevant time and the alleged confessional statements of the accused Md. Al Amin and Akbar Ali Lalu are the products of police torture, oppression and maltreatment.<br/><br/>After hearing both the prosecution and the defence and on an in-depth appraisal of the evidence and materials on record and having regard to the attending circumstances of the case, the learned Tribunal Judge came to the finding that the prosecution brought the charge home against the appellants and the co-accused Selim and accordingly, he convicted and sentenced them by the impugned judgment and order as aforesaid.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved at and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order, the convict-appellants have preferred the instant appeals. As already observed, the Tribunal below has also made a Statutory Reference to the High Court Division for confirmation of the death sentence imposed upon the appellants and the co-accused Selim.<br/><br/>The only point for determination in the appeals and the Death Reference is whether the impugned judgment and order dated 30.12.2012 is sustainable in law or not?<br/><br/>At the outset, Mr. Khandker Mahbub Hossain, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant Akbar Ali Lalu alias Roni in Criminal Appeal No. 251 of 2013, candidly submits that he does not dispute the time, place and manner of the occurrence and also the finding of conviction arrived at against his client Lalu, but the fact remains that the Tribunal below overlooked the individual culpability of Lalu in sentencing him along with the co-accused and in view of the role played by Lalu in the commission of the offence as manifested from his judicial confession dated 01.08.2012, he should have been sentenced to 10(ten) years’ rigorous imprisonment at the most. In this connection, Mr. Khandker Mahbub Hossain relies on the decisions in the cases of Geedo and others Vs. The State, 1986 P. Cr. L. J Karachi 2192 and Lal Singh Vs. Emperor, 40 Cr. L. J Allahabad 132.<br/><br/>Mr. Khandker Mahbub Hossain also submits that as per Section 396 of the Penal Code, three options in respect of awarding of sentence to the accused have been provided depending upon the degree of culpability of each individual accused, though indisputably ‘dacoity’ is a conjoint offence and the learned Tribunal Judge failed to exercise his discretion properly in sentencing the accused Lalu and that being so, the sentence recorded against the accused Lalu is liable to be reviewed by this Appellate Court.<br/><br/>Mr. Khandker Mahbub Hossain further submits that he only challenges the propriety and correctness of the sentence imposed upon the accused Lalu in view of his self-inculpatory confessional statement made under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and having regard to the role played by the accused Lalu in the commission of the offence, the capital sentence awarded to him appears to the very harsh.<br/><br/>Mr. Yusuf Hossain Humayun, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the condemned-appellants Saiful Islam alias Mamun, Md. Al Amin and Md. Rafiqul Islam alias Khokon in Criminal Appeal No. 273 of 2013, contends that admittedly the finger-prints on the revolver bearing no. 1616819 allegedly used by the accused Saiful in firing the fatal shot on the victim Khalaf were not examined by any expert and in this perspective, there is a room for doubt as to whether the accused Saiful fired the fatal shot on Khalaf resulting in his ultimate death at the United Hospital, Gulshan, Dhaka and this being the scenario, the accused Saiful should be awarded the benefit of doubt.<br/><br/>Mr. Yusuf Hossain Humayun further contends that the confession of the accused Md. Al Amin dated 30.07.2012 (Exhibit-11) is a product of police torture, oppression and maltreatment and that is why, he filed a petition on 02.12.2012 retracting the earlier confessional statement dated 30.07.2012, but the learned Tribunal Judge did not consider this dimension of the case resulting in a miscarriage of justice.<br/><br/>Mr. Yusuf Hossain Humayun also contends that the P. W. 31 Md. Nure Azam Miah (1<sup>st</sup> Investigating Officer) did not seize any wet earth from the place of occurrence nor did he seize any blood-stain therefrom and this being the position, it can not be said that the alleged occurrence took place on the drain-slab on the northern side of Road No. 120 which is on the southern side of House No. 19/B, Road No. 117, Gulshan Police Station , DMP, Dhaka and if the place of occurrence can not be pinpointed by that reason, his clients, namely, Saiful Islam, Al Amin and Khokon are entitled to an order of acquittal.<br/><br/>Mr. Yusuf Hossain Humayun next contends that there is hardly any credible evidence on record connecting the accused Khokon with the commission of the offence, though allegedly at his showing and identification, the private car bearing no. Dhaka Metro-Ga-12-9688 was recovered from Manikdi area of Dhaka Cantonment on 24.07.2012, but the Tribunal below caused a failure of justice by convicting and sentencing him by the impugned judgment.<br/><br/>Mr. Yusuf Hossain Humayun further contends that there does not appear to be any corroboration of the alleged confessional statement of the accused Al Amin made under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and because of this lack of corroboration, Al Amin can not be fastened with any criminal liability in the commission of the offence and above all, his confession being involuntary in character ought to have been discarded by the Tribunal below.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Khabir Uddin Bhuiyan, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant Saiful Islam alias Mamun in Jail Appeal No. 08 of 2013 and the appellant Akbar Ali Lalu alias Roni in Jail Appeal No. 10 of 2013, submits that it is an admitted fact that the finger-prints on the revolver with which the accused Saiful allegedly fired the fatal shot on the Saudi diplomat Khalaf were not examined by any expert and the non-examination of the finger-prints on the revolver renders the prosecution case topsy-turvy entitling the accused Saiful to an order of acquittal.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Khabir Uddin Bhuiyan also submits that in the facts and circumstances of the case and having regard to the culpability of the accused Lalu in the commission of the offence as is apparent from his judicial confession dated 01.08.2012, his capital punishment under Section 396 of the Penal Code is shockingly severe.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Aminur Rashid (Razu), learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the  appellant Md. Rafiqul Islam alias Khokon in Jail Appeal No. 07 of 2013 and the appellant Md. Al Amin in Jail Appeal No. 09 of 2013, argues that admittedly there is no eye-witness in this case and the accused Khokon is not a confessing accused and according to the judicial confessions of the co-accused Lalu and Al Amin, Khokon drove the car on the fateful night; but no other evidence is forthcoming on record against the accused Khokon  and this being the landscape, the accused Khokon should have been acquitted of the charge by the learned Tribunal Judge.<br/><br/>Mrs. Mahmuda Khatun, learned State Defence Advocate appearing on behalf of the absconding-accused Md. Selim Chowdhury alias Selim Ahmed, argues that it is true that the accused Selim is still on the run and an accused may be on the run for a variety of reasons including  his fear of police harassment and it seems that the co-accused Lalu and Al Amin have implicated the accused Selim in their respective judicial confessions and these circumstances per se are not sufficient for the conviction of Selim; but the learned Tribunal Judge failed to appreciate  the circumstances in their proper perspective and came to an erroneous finding that the accused Selim was very much involved in the offence resulting in the awarding of the death sentence to him.<br/><br/>Mrs. Mahmuda Khatun also argues that confessions of the co-accused Lalu and Al Amin can not be used against the absconding accused Selim as substantive evidence and the confessions were extracted from Lalu and Al Amin under coercion and physical torture and as the confessing accused (Lalu and Al Almin) were kept in police custody more than three days preceding their judicial confessions, the same are necessarily involuntary in character and as such the prosecution can not capitalize on the judicial confessions against the absconding accused Selim and in view of the facts and circumstances of the present case, Mrs. Mahmuda Khatun emphatically banks upon the decisions in the cases of Alaluddin alias Alauddin and others Vs. The State, 49 DLR (HCD) 66; Md. Rezaul Karim alias Rezaul Aalm Rikshawala Vs. The State, 23 BLD (HCD) 255 and Md. Akbar Ali Vs. The State, 19 BLD (HCD) 268.<br/><br/>In contrast, Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam, learned Deputy Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the State-respondent and in support of the Death Reference, submits that the accused Lalu, Al Amin, Saiful and Khokon were shown arrested in this case on 24.07.2012 and the Investigating Officer concerned prayed for ten days’ remand, but the Court allowed them eight days’ remand and Al Amin and Lalu made their judicial confessions on 30.07.2012 and 01.08.2012 respectively and it transpires that the learned confession- recording Magistrate Mr. Shahriar Mahmud Adnan (P. W. 20) recorded their confessions by complying with all legal formalities and in such a situation, it can not be said that the confessions of the accused Al Amin and Lalu are involuntary.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam further submits that it appears from the cross-examination of the P. W. 20 Shahriar Mahmud Adnan that no suggestion has been put to him to the effect that the judicial confession of Lalu was obtained from him under duress and probably for that reason, the learned Advocate Mr. Khandaker Mahbub Hossain does not challenge the voluntariness and truth of the judicial confession of the accused Lalu.<br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam next submits that a revolver bearing no. 1616819 was recovered from the rented flat of Saiful at his instance in presence of the P. W. 23 Md. Atiqur Rahman Munshi (owner of the flat) and his son Md. Faisal Ahmed Munshi (P. W. 24) and the members of the raiding party, that is to say, P. W. 25 Md. Mosleh Uddin, P. W. 26 Md. Mahbubur Rahman Tarafdar, P. W. 27 Kazi Haniful Islam and P. W. 28 K. M. Robiul Islam and that revolver was previously looted away by Saiful and others at the time of commission of  dacoity in the house of one Md. Abul Hossain (P. W. 21) of Khilkhet, Dhaka and  this is why, Md. Abul Hossain initiated Khilkhet Police Station Case No. 16 dated 30.09.2011 under Sections 395/397 of the Penal Code and in that case Saiful and Khokon made judicial confessions under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and in view of the Forensic Ballistic Report dated 18.03.2012 (Exhibit-16) and Forensic Ballistic Report dated 19.07.2012 (Exhibit-17), it is manifestly clear that the accused Saiful fired the fatal shot on Khalaf   at the material time and the learned Tribunal Judge rightly found him guilty along with others.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam further submits that the place of occurrence has been pinpointed by the relevant evidence on record and the letter ‘A’ in the sketch-map as indicated by the index thereto and in this view of the matter, no doubt arises at to the place of occurrence.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam next submits that it is in the evidence of the P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque that at the showing of the accused Khokon, the car bearing no. Dhaka Metro-Ga-12-9688 was recovered from Manikdi area and thereafter it was seized as per seizure-list dated 24.07.2012 (Exhibit-10) and in his petition of Jail Appeal,  Khokon has  claimed that he is a driver by profession and he drives in the Cantonment Manikdi Bazar area and it is also apparent from the confessions of the accused Al Amin and Lalu that  the accused Khokon drove the car which was used in the commission of the dacoity  at the relevant time and against this backdrop, it is palpably clear that the accused Khokon was very much connected with the commission of the offence and considered from this point of view, the accused Khokon can not get off scot-free.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam further submits that there is no gainsaying the fact that the revolver was recovered from the rented flat of the accused Saiful after about three months of the occurrence and no useful purpose would be served by examining the finger-prints on the revolver inasmuch as the accused Saiful might have used the revolver in the commission of other offences after the commission of the present one and taking the whole gamut of the facts and circumstances of the case into consideration, the prosecution did not take any step for examination of the finger-prints on the revolver; but on that account, the prosecution case can not be rendered doubtful in the perspective of the unimpeachable, unblemished and invincible evidence on record.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam also submits that it is true that there are three options with regard to awarding of sentence to the accused in Section 396 of the Penal Code and since dacoity with murder as contemplated by Section 396 of the Penal Code is a grave offence, it can not be said that the Tribunal Judge exercised his discretion improperly in sentencing all the accused to death and as such no exception can be taken to the impugned judgment.<br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam next submits that at the time of examination of the accused Lalu and Al Amin under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, they did not complain of any police torture or oppression to the Tribunal Judge vis-à-vis their confessions; rather they remained conspicuously silent thereabout and this circumstance is indicative of the truth and voluntary character of their confessions.<br/><br/>In support of the above submissions, the learned Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khursedul Alam refers to the decisions in the cases of The State Vs. Md. Gaush Meah alias Rana and others, 10 BLC (HCD) 74; The State Vs. Abul Khair and 2 others, 44 DLR (HCD) 284; Khalil Mia (condemned-prisoner) Vs. The State, 4 BLC (AD) 223 and The State Vs. Moslem, 55 DLR (HCD) 116.<br/><br/>Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the State-respondent and in support of the Death Reference, submits that as dacoity with murder is a grave offence, all the accused have been rightly served by awarding capital punishment and this is why, the sentence of death imposed upon the convicts should be maintained by this Appellate Court.<br/><br/>Mr. Mahbubey Alam also submits that the absconding accused Selim lived with Saiful in his rented flat as per the evidence of the P. W. 23 Md. Atiqur Rahman Munshi and P. W. 24 Md. Faisal Ahmed Munshi and presumably they were hand in glove with each other and Selim was an accused in an earlier criminal case, namely, Pallabi Police Station Case No. 22(1)11 under Sections 395/397/412 of the Penal Code and the unexplained continuous abscondence of the accused Selim together with his implication in the commission of the offence in the confessions of the two co-accused, namely, Lalu and Al Amin conclusively go to show that Selim was very much concerned with the offence and the learned Tribunal Judge did not commit any illegality in convicting and sentencing Selim to death by the impugned judgment. With regard to awarding of capital sentence to all the accused including Selim, Mr. Mahbubey Alam relies upon the decision in the case of Emperor Vs. Nga Tha Hmwe and others, AIR 1935 Rangoon 504.<br/><br/>We have heard the submissions of the learned Advocates Mr. Khandker Mahbub Hossain, Mr. Yusuf Hossain Humayun, Mr. Md. Khabir Uddin Bhuiyan, Mr. Md. Aminur Rashid (Razu) and Mrs. Mahmuda Khatun and the counter-submissions of the learned Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam and the learned Attorney-General Mr. Mahbubey Alam.<br/><br/>However, with a view to arriving at a correct decision, we are to advert to and scrutinize the relevant evidence and attending circumstances by way of juxtaposing both the prosecution and defence versions of the case.<br/>At the trial, the prosecution has examined 32 (thirty-two) witnesses and tendered 1 (one) witness in all on its side. But the defence has examined none.<br/><br/>Anyway, the informant Md. Mosharraf Hossain has examined himself as P. W. 1 in this case. He deposes that while he was on patrol duty pursuant to Gulshan Police Station General Diary No. 452 dated 05.03.2012, the Duty Officer of the Police Station, namely, Sub-Inspector Robiul informed him between 01.05 A. M.  and 01.10 A.M. on 06.03.2012 over wireless that an unknown person had been shot at  on Road No. 117, Gulshan and on receipt of that message, he (P. W. 1) along with the accompanying force  rushed there and saw an unknown person with a bullet injury on his left chest on the drain-slab on Road No. 120 which is on the southern side of House No. 120/B, Road No. 117 and then and there, he brought the wounded person to the United Hospital  for treatment and while the wounded person was under treatment at the United Hospital, he succumbed to his injury at 05.15 A. M. on 06.03.2012.<br/><br/>The P. W. 1 Md. Mosharraf Hossain also deposes that at 09.30 A. M. on 06.03.2012, he returned to the place of occurrence with a photograph of the deceased and the driver of the vehicle of the deceased identified the photograph as that of a senior officer of the Saudi Embassy whose name was Md. Khalaf Ali and thereafter he (P. W. 1) informed the concerned officials of the Saudi Embassy of the occurrence and on coming back to the United Hospital, in presence of the officials of the Saudi Embassy and at their identification, he held an inquest on the deceased and found a bullet injury on the left side of his chest and  seized a pair of trousers, a vest, a pair of keds, a pair of spectacles and an underwear as per seizure-list (Exhibit-2).<br/><br/>The P. W. 1 Md. Mosharraf Hossain further deposes that the driver of the deceased told him that the deceased used to reside in a flat bearing No. A/4 of House No. 22/A,  Road No. 122, Gulshan and the security guard of that house intimated him that on 05.03.2012 at 11.00 P. M., the deceased went out from his flat and since, however, no officer or employee of the Saudi Embassy came forward to initiate any case, he (P. W. 1) himself lodged a First Information Report (FIR) (Exhibit-1) with Gulshan Police Station and  sent the dead body of Khalaf to the morgue of Dhaka Medical College Hospital for autopsy through Constable No. 7454 Md. Baseth.<br/><br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 1 Md. Mosharraf Hossain states that after one minute of the receipt of the wireless message, he rushed to the place of occurrence and the flat of the victim Khalaf is near the place of occurrence.<br/><br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 1 Md. Mosharraf Hossain denies a defence suggestion that he has fabricated the case falsely being influenced by some quarters.<br/><br/>The P. W. 2 is Abu Ansar. The sum and substance of his testimony is that on 07.03.2012, he was on duty as Duty Officer at Gulshan Police Station and at 13.00 hours on that day, on receipt of a written ejahar from the informant Md. Mosharraf Hossain, he registered Gulshan Police Station Case No. 15 dated 07.03.2012 under Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code by filling in the prescribed form of the First Information Report.<br/><br/>The P. W. 3 is Md. Abdul Baseth Miah. He testifies that on 06.03.2012, he was on duty at Gulshan Police Station and at 09.30 hours, he went to the United Hospital and at 14.30 hours on that day, he carried the dead body of Khalaf to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital for post-mortem examination and after the post-mortem examination, he handed over the dead body to the officials of the Saudi Embassy.<br/><br/>The P. W. 3 Md. Abdul Baseth Miah also testifies that the autopsy-holding doctor told him that there was a bullet lodged in the body of the deceased and the doctor handed over the bullet to him (P. W. 3)  under sealed cover after extraction  and he brought the same to the Police Station and handed it over to the Investigating Officer Nure Azam Miah at 09.15 hours on 07.03.2012 and in his presence, the Investigating Officer opened the packet containing the bullet, showed it to him (P. W. 3) and  seized it as per seizure-list (Exhibit-6).<br/><br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 3 Md. Abdul Baseth Miah denies the defence suggestions that the doctor concerned did not hand over the bullet to him or that he did not hand over the bullet to the Investigating Officer concerned or that the Investigating Officer concerned did not seize it as per seizure-list.<br/><br/>The P. W. 4 is Md. Abu Nur Shafiuzzaman. The long and the short of his deposition is that on 07.03.2012, he was on duty at Gulshan Police Station and while he was on duty, he came to the office chamber of the Investigating Officer Nure Azam Miah and then Constable Abdul Baseth handed over a sealed packet to the Investigating Officer and the Investigating Officer opened it, brought out a bullet therefrom, seized it as per seizure-list and he (P. W. 4) signed the seizure-list as a witness.<br/><br/>The P. W. 5 is Abu Sayeed. The gist of his evidence is that on 06.03.2012, he was on duty at the United Hospital and one Khalaf Mohammed S. Al Ali was admitted thereto at 01.15 A. M. and died there at 05.15 A. M. on that date and accordingly he (P. W. 5) issued a death report of Khalaf bearing passport no. S 025550 (Exhibit-7).<br/><br/>The P. W. 6 is Md. Ripon. He states in his evidence that while he was on duty as Ward Boy at the United Hospital after 01.00 A.M. on 06.03.2012, one patient was admitted to the hospital and he shifted the patient to a bed of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and at 05.00 A. M., the patient died and subsequently the police came to the hospital and seized the wearing-apparels of the deceased, namely, one pair of trousers, a vest and an underwear and  his other articles, namely, a pair of keds and a pair of spectacles from a staffer of the hospital, that is to say, Solaiman Miah as per seizure-list (Exhibit-2).<br/><br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 6 Md. Ripon denies a defence suggestion that on 06.03.2012, no alamats were seized in his presence.<br/><br/>The P. W. 7 is Md. Maksudur Rahman. He gives out in his evidence that he has been a Ward Boy of the United Hospital and at 07.00 A.M. on 06.03.2012, he was on duty at the hospital and came to know that one patient had died who was a Saudi national and the police held an inquest on the dead body and seized the wearing-apparels and other articles of the patient from the Ward Boy Solaiman as per seizure-list (Exhibit-2) and he (P. W. 7) signed the same as a witness.<br/><br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 7 Md. Maksudur Rahman denies a defence suggestion that he has deposed falsely at the instance of the hospital authority.<br/><br/>The P. W. 8 is Md. Motiur Rahman, son of Abdul Malek Sheikh. He claims in his evidence that he is a Duty Manager of the United Hospital and at 08.00 A.M. on 06.03.2012, he came to the hospital and learnt that a patient had been admitted to the hospital on the previous night at 01.15 o’clock and died at 05.15 o’clock and at 09.30/10.00 A. M., he went to the ICU and saw some police personnel of Gulshan Police Station and the driver of the deceased there.<br/><br/>The P. W. 8 Md. Motiur Rahman also claims in his evidence that the police held an inquest on the deceased and he saw a hole beneath the left nipple and an abrasion beneath the knee of the deceased and he signed the inquest-report (Exhibit-3) as a witness.<br/><br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 8 Md. Motiur Rahman states that he saw the abrasion on the right knee of the deceased and he himself did not turn over the dead body for the purpose of inquest.<br/><br/>In his cross-examination, the P.

Azizul Haque also states in his evidence that he sent the alamats of the case, namely, trousers, underwear, vest, keds etc. to the National Forensic DNA Profiling Laboratory (NFDPL), Dhaka for DNA test and he perused the report of the DNA test and  the opinions of the ballistic experts with reference to the seized bullet and by using Mobile Information Technology, he searched and procured various types of photographs from C. C. Televisions and on 13.06.2012, he handed over the docket of the case to the DB.<br/><br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 32 Md. Azizul Haque states that he procured the photographs from C. C. Televisions, but he did not seize them and he did not send the bullet which was extracted from the deceased Khalaf for DNA test along with his trousers, underwear etc. in that the bullet was not blood-stained.<br/><br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 32 Md. Azizul Haque denies the defence suggestions that he carried out the investigation of the case in a perfunctory manner or that he has deposed falsely.<br/><br/>The P. W. 33 is Md. Obaidul Haque. He deposes that he has been an Assistant Police Commissioner in the Dhaka Metropolitan Detective Branch since 2008 and as per the order of the higher authority dated 12.06.2012, he was entrusted with the task of investigation of Gulshan Police Station Case No. 15 dated 07.03.2012 and on 13.06.2012, he received the docket of the case from the previous Investigating Officer, namely, Mr. Md. Azizul Haque, perused the docket, visited the place of occurrence on 14.06.2012, consulted the informant and previous Investigating Officers of the case and found the narration of the place of occurrence and the sketch-map and the index thereto proper during his investigation of the case.<br/><br/>The P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque further deposes that during investigation, he interrogated the owner of the seized revolver Mr. Md. Abul Hossain and examined his licence and became satisfied that the revolver belonged to him which had been looted away earlier.<br/><br/>The P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque also deposes that on 20.06.2012, he sent the seized revolver and the fired bullet which was extracted  from the body of the deceased to the Ballistic Experts of the CID, Dhaka for verification as to whether the said bullet was fired from the revolver.<br/><br/>The P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque further deposes that on 19.07.2012, he got the reports of the Ballistic Experts of the CID together with the seized revolver, fired bullet and four test-fired bullets, namely, T-1, T-2, T-3 and T-4 and it transpired from the opinions of the Ballistic Experts that the fired bullet was fired from the seized revolver.<br/><br/>The P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque next deposes that on 24.07.2012, he took the accused Saiful Islam, Al Amin, Akbar Ali Lalu and Rafiqul Islam alias Khokon on remand and interrogated them and at the initial stage of interrogation, the accused Khokon told that the private car bearing no. Dhaka Metro-Ga-12-9688 which was used in the commission of the instant offence had been under the control of his father and on the basis of this information of the accused Khokon, he (P. W. 33) took the accused Khokon to Manikdi area under Dhaka Cantonment Police Station and at his showing,  the private car was recovered therefrom in presence of witnesses and he seized the keys, registration papers, tax token, insurance certificate etc. of the car as per seizure-list (Exhibit-10) and afterwards he brought the car along with those articles to the DB office and handed over the same to the Officer-in-Charge of DB Malkhana for safe-keeping vide DB P. R. No. 524/12 (north).<br/><br/>The P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque further deposes that on 25.07.2012, he called the witness Anwar Hossain who saw the private car speeding away immediately after the occurrence and showed the car to him under electric light and he identified the private car as the car which was used for the commission of the offence at the relevant time.<br/><br/>The P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque also deposes that the accused Al Amin wished to make a confession voluntarily in the Court and accordingly he was produced before the Court of the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka for recording his confession under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on 30.07.2012 and the learned Metropolitan Magistrate Mr. Shahriar Mahmud Adnan recorded his confessional statement on that day.<br/>The P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque next deposes that on 01.08.2012, the accused Akbar Ali Lalu wished to make a judicial confession and accordingly he was produced before the Court of the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka and he made his judicial confession under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on that day.<br/><br/>The P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque also deposes that having found a prima facie case, he submitted charge-sheet No. 379 dated 19.09.2012 against the accused Saiful Islam alias Mamun, Md. Al Amin, Akbar Ali Lalu alias Roni, Md. Rafiqul Islam alias Khokon and Selim Chowdhury alias Selim Ahmed under Section 396 of the Penal Code, 1860.<br/><br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque denies the defence suggestions that he compelled the accused Akbar Ali Lalu and Al Amin to make their confessions by resorting to various forms of torture or that Lalu did not make the confession voluntarily or that Lalu made the confession being tutored by him and in fear of death.<br/><br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque also denies the defence suggestions that the maid-servant who was employed in the house of the deceased Khalaf was virtually a call- girl or that she used to respond to the calls of rich people.<br/><br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque states that during investigation, he consulted with Saudi Embassy officials, but he did not cite them as witnesses in the charge-sheet.<br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque further denies a defence suggestion that the character of the deceased Khalaf was not good and because of disputes with his maid-servant and internal bickerings, Khalaf was killed by her cohorts.<br/><br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque further states: <strong>“</strong><strong>বহু প­র উদ্ধার হওয়ায় আঙ্গু­লর ছাপ প্রমাণ হ­ব না জে­ন এক্সপা­র্ট দেয়া হয়নি</strong><strong>”</strong><br/><br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque further states that the seized car was not white, but it was olive- coloured and since it was seized during night-time, it looked like a light white car and he saw the car in sunlight.<br/><br/>Out of 33 (thirty-three) prosecution witnesses, the P. W. 1 Md. Mosharraf Hossain is the informant of the case. As the informant of the case, he has just set the criminal law in motion. Admittedly there is no eye-witness to the occurrence. That being so, the names of the accused-appellants and the absconding accused Selim have not found any place in the FIR. However, the confessional statements of the accused Al Amin and Lalu made under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure have formed a part of the prosecution version of the case. In such view of the matter, the truth and voluntariness or otherwise of their confessional statements are of paramount importance. Besides, the various alamats seized by the Investigating Officer concerned and produced before the Tribunal below during the trial of the case are to be considered along with the relevant prosecution evidence on record.<br/><br/>There are certain criteria for assessment of the judicial confession of an accused. In the case of Habibur Rahman @ Habib….Vs…The State reported in 8 BLD (HCD) 210, it has been observed in paragraph 15:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“15………………………………………….………………………………………………………………………………………….<br/>Before a Court acts upon a confessional statement, it has to affirmatively satisfy that the statement is voluntary and true. In this regard, the judicial authorities always insist on the meticulous observance of all necessary formalities and precautions provided in Section 164 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure with minute particularity so as to ensure that the confession is absolutely free from the slightest tinge or taint of extraneous influence. ‘It is a settled principle of law’ as pointed out by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of Zaheda Bewa and another…Vs…The State reported in 1985 BLD 9 ‘that the requirement of adherence to the provisions of Section 164 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not a mere matter of form, but of substance. Section 164 (3) is a mandatory provision of law as has been settled by the Privy Council in the case of Nazir Ahmed…Vs…The King Emperor, AIR 1936 P.C 253’. Before recording a confession, a Magistrate is bound to make a real and substantial enquiry as to the voluntariness of the confession. In so doing, he must put questions to the accused with a view to finding out the real object of the confession, whether it is made out of repentance or for any other such good reason or whether it is the result of torture or tutoring by some body or whether it has been caused by any inducement, threat or promise. The questions put by the Magistrate and the answers given by the accused furnish sufficient data for coming to the conclusion whether the statement was voluntary or not.”<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the decision in the case of Abul Hossain and others Vs. The State reported in 13 BLD (HCD) 311, it has been held, inter alia, in paragraph 7 that Sub-Section (3) of Section 164 speaks of the manner as to how the confession of an accused is to be recorded by a Magistrate and this is a mandatory provision and failure to comply therewith shall make the confession invalid and unreliable. It has been further held therein that this provision of law together with the provisions of Section 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure require to be strictly observed and followed to make the confession voluntary and true in the real sense to be fit for reliance for convicting an accused on his confession.<br/><br/>In the case of Nurul Haque and another Vs. The State reported in 20 DLR (HCD) 780, it has been spelt out:<br/>“Before recording the confession, it must be explained to the accused that he is not bound to make a confession and if he makes a confession, it may be used as evidence against him. It is a mandatory provision of law. No Magistrate should record any confession unless, upon putting questions to the accused, he has reason to believe that the confession was made voluntarily. Any defect arising out of violation of any mandatory provision of law is not curable under Section 533 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”<br/><br/>A reference may be made to the decision reported in 1986 (BLD) 436 (Ali Asgar and another Vs. The State). In the said decision at page 438, it has been held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Now let us consider the value of a retracted confession as against the maker. On consideration of evidence on record, if it is found that a confession is voluntary and true, conviction of the maker himself can solely be based upon the same, no matter whether it is retracted or not. In the case of the State…Vs…Minbun alias Gul Hassan reported in 16 DLR (Supreme Court) page 598, their Lordships of the Supreme Court held as follows:<br/>‘As against the maker himself, his confession, judicial or extra-judicial, whether retracted, or not retracted, can in law validly form the sole basis of his conviction.’ So we are also of the opinion that a confession, if proved true and voluntary, can be the sole basis for conviction of the maker of the confession.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of the State Vs. Punardhar Joydhar alias Kudu and Shefali reported in 31 DLR (HCD) 312, it has been held that the accused first made a confessional statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that he committed that murder, although subsequently he retracted his confessional statement before the Court and the confession being found voluntary and without any threat, coercion or inducement, conviction of the accused based on his confession, though subsequently retracted by him, is valid in law.<br/><br/>The principle that has been enunciated in the case of Hazrat Ali and another Vs. The State reported in 1990 BLD (HCD) 38 is that once a confession has been found to be true and voluntary, conviction can be based solely on the confession, even if it is retracted.<br/><br/>The ‘ratio decidendi’ of the case of Bakul Chandra Sarkar Vs. The State reported in 45 DLR (HCD) 260 is that if a confession recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is true and voluntary, the same alone is sufficient for convicting the confessing accused and retraction of confession is immaterial, once it is found to be true and voluntary.<br/><br/>The confession of a co-accused is a matter for consideration against another accused if tried jointly with him. By the way, Section 30 of the Evidence Act, 1872 may be referred to:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“30. When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the Court may take into consideration such confession as against such other of such persons as well as against the person who makes such confession.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>This Section simply makes the confession of a co-accused a relevant fact. In other words, the confessional statement of a co-accused is admissible against other accused persons in the sense that it may be taken into consideration against them along with other evidence. But for this Section 30, the confessional statement of one accused will be inadmissible in evidence against another accused in view of Section 3 of the Evidence Act.<br/><br/>In the case of Bhuboni Sahu Vs. The King, 76 Indian Appeals, 147, the Privy Council has observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“But a confession of a co-accused is obviously ‘evidence’ of a very weak type. It does not indeed come within the definition of ‘evidence’ contained in Section 3 of the Evidence Act. It is not required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the accused, and it can not be tested by cross-examination. Section 30, however, provides that the Court may take the confession into consideration and thereby, no doubt, makes it evidence on which the Court may act; but the Section does not say that the confession is to amount to proof. Clearly there must be other evidence. The confession is only one element in the consideration of the facts proved in the case; it can be put into the scale and weighed with the other evidence.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the decision in the case of Emran Ali @ Md. Emran &amp; others Vs. The State reported in 37 DLR (HCD) 1, it has been held that the statement of a co-accused is not a piece of evidence, because it is not made on oath and also not subjected to cross-examination and the confessional statement of a co-accused can not be the basis of conviction of another accused.<br/><br/>In the decision in the case of Amir Hossain Howlader &amp; others Vs. The State reported in 37 DLR (AD) 139, it has been opined that the statement of a co-accused does not fall within the definition of ‘evidence’ as it is not made on oath in presence of the person affected and its veracity is not tested by way of cross-examination.<br/><br/>In the decision in the case of Rezaul Karim (Md) Vs. The State reported in 55 DLR (HCD) 382, it has been observed that the confession of an accused is not a substantive piece of evidence against the co-accused and as such the confession alone without any substantive corroborative evidence can not form the basis of conviction of a co-accused.<br/><br/>In the decision in the case of The State Vs. Abul Khair and others reported in 44 DLR (HCD) 284, it has been held, inter alia, in paragraph 9 that it is clear from the terms of Section 30 of the Evidence Act that where more persons than one  are being tried jointly for the same offence, a confession made by any one of them affecting himself and any one of the co-accused can be taken into consideration by the Court not only against the maker of the confession, but also against the co-accused. Strictly speaking, it may not be a piece of evidence within the meaning of the term, but it lends assurance to the other evidence on record.<br/><br/>In the decision in the case of The State Vs. Mir Hossain @ Mira and others reported in 56 DLR (HCD) 124, it has been held in paragraph 34:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“34. Under Section 30 of the Evidence Act, confession of a co-accused can be taken into consideration and on the strength of that confession, another co-accused can be convicted provided the said confession is corroborated by any other evidence, either direct and circumstantial.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the decision in the case of Joygun Bibi Vs. The State reported in 12 DLR (SC) 156, it has been held, amongst others, in paragraph 9 that the retraction of the confession is wholly immaterial, once it is found that it is voluntary as well as true.<br/><br/>At this stage, let us address the confessional statements of the accused Md. Al Amin and Akbar Ali Lalu alias Roni one by one.<br/><br/>The confession of the accused Md. Al Amin dated 30.07.2012 (Exhibit-11) runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>“</strong><strong>আমি টঙ্গীবাজার এলাকায় মোবাইল এর দোকানে  কাজ করতামz আমি ইয়াবা ট্যাব­লট খাইz প্রায়  দেড়  দুই বৎসর আ­গ থে­ক সাইফুল ইসলাম, আকবর আলী @ লালু ভাই,  সেলিম @  সানি এবং রফিকুল ইসলাম খোকন সহ তা­দর কিছু বন্ধু বান্ধ­বর সা­থ আমার ইয়াবা খাই­ত গি­য় পরিচয় হয়z আমি তা­দর জন্য ইয়াবা যোগাড় ক­র দিতাম টঙ্গীবাজার  মুরগী  দোকানদার রিয়া­জর কাছ থে­কz তারা বিভিন্ন ডাকাতি ও ছিনতাই এর সা­থ জড়িত ছিল- এ কথা আমি জানিz গত বছ­রর শে­ষর দি­ক তারা খিল­ক্ষত এলাকায় ডাকাতি ক­র একটা রিভলবার নি­য় আ­সz আমা­র সাইফুল ভাই অস»টি দেখায়z খোক­নর একটা পুরাতন প্রাই­ভট কার আ­ছz সে তার বিভিন্ন বন্ধু  নি­য় আমার কা­ছ ইয়াবা খাই­ত আসতz গত চার মাস পূ­র্ব সন্ধ্যার পর তারা আমা­ক ইয়াবা যোগাড় ক­র রাখ­ত ব­লz অনুমান রাত ১০.০০ টার দি­ক খোক­নর গাড়ী­ত ক­র সাইফুল ভাই, লালু  ভাই, সেলিম ও খোকন কুড়িল বিশ্ব­রা­ডর পা­শ সাঈ­দর ভাঙ্গারীর দোকা­নর পিছ­ন ইয়াবা খে­ত আ­সz আমরা সবাই মি­ল এক সা­থ ব­স ইয়াবা খাই,  অনুমান  রাত সা­ড় এগারটার দি­ক আমি সহ সবাই খোক­নর গাড়ী­ত বের হইz আমি, সেলিম, লালু ভাই  গাড়ীর পিছ­নর সি­ট বসি এবং খোকন গাড়ী চালাচ্ছিল; সাইফুল ভাই তার পা­শ বসা ছিলz ঘুর­ত  ঘুর­ত  রাত ১.০০ টার দি­ক গুলশান এর ০১ নং রো­ড উঁচা-লম্বামতন এক বি­দশী লোক­ক আস­ত ­দখিz তার ব্যায়া­মর পোশাক পরা ছিলz তা­ক আস­ত দে­খ লালু ভাই ব­ল তা­ক ধর­ল  ডলার পাওয়া যাই­বz এরপর খোকন গাড়ীটি ঐ ­লাকটার পা­শ নি­য় গি­য় থামায় z তখন সাইফুল, লালু ভাই ও সেলিম গাড়ী থে­ক নে­ম লোকটি­ক ঘি­র ধ­রz আমি গাড়ী­তই বসা ছিলাম z আমি নামি নাই মাথা  ধর­ছ দে­খz খোকনও গাড়ী ষ্টার্ট অবসÛায় গাড়ী থে­ক নে­ম লোকটির কা­ছ যায়z হঠাৎ দেখি ধস¹াধসি¹ হ­চ্ছz ধস¹াধসি¹র এক পর্যা­য় সাইফুল ভাই গুলি ক­র লোকটা­কz আমি দেখি লোকটা মাটি­ত প­ড় যায়z সবাই খুব âুত গাড়ী­ত উ­ঠ প­ড়z খোকন âুত গাড়ী চালি­য় গুলশান-১ হ­য় কুড়িল বিশ্ব­রাড মো­ড় আমা­ক নামি­য় দি­য় তারা সবাই চ­ল যায়z যাওয়ার সময় সাইফুল  ভাই এই ঘটনা কাউ­ক না বলার জন্য ব­ল ­দয়z প­রর দিন শুনি যে, লোকটি সৌদি আর­বরz এরপর সাইফুল আমার কা­ছ আবার এ­স ইয়াবা ট্যাব­লট নি­য় যায়z  আমা­কও ৫/৬ টা দি­য় যায়z প­র পুলিশ আমা­ক এরেস্ট ক­রz</strong><strong>”</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The confession of the accused Akbar Ali Lalu alias Roni dated 01.08.2012 (Exhibit-12) is in the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>“</strong><strong>আমি বর্তমা­ন আমার ২য় স»ী­ক নিয়া জয়­দবপুর থানার বোর্ড বাজার থাকিz প্রায় দুই বছর পূ­র্ব থে­ক আমার সা­থ সাইফুল, আল-আমিন, সেলিম @ সানি এবং রফিকুল ইসলাম খোক­নর সা­থ পরিচয়z আমি এর পূ­র্ব  সাইফুল, সোহা­নর সা­থ মহাখালীর নৌ বাহিনীর বাসায় ডাকাতি করিz তা­দর সা­থ আমি নিয়মিত কুড়িল বিশ্ব­রা­ডর  সাঈ­দর  ভাঙ্গারীর  দোকা­নর পিছ­ন ব­স আড্ডা দিতাম এবং ইয়াবা খাইতামz আমি টুকটাক ইয়াবা বেচতামz ঘটনার দিন খোক­নর প্রাই­ভট কা­র ক­র যাই সন্ধ্যার পরz রাত ১১.০০ টা কি ১১.৩০ ঘটিকার সময় সেখা­ন আমি, সাইফুল, আল-আমিন, সেলিম এবং খোকন ব­স ইয়াবা  খাইz পূ­র্ব  খিল­ক্ষত সেবা ক্লিনি­কর বাসায় ডাকতি ক­র সাইফুল একটি অস» নি­য় আ­সz ঘটনার দিন অস»টি তার সা­থ ছিলz আমরা ইয়াবা খে­য় খোক­নর গাড়ী­ত ক­র বের হ­য় ঘুর­ত থাকিz ঘুর­ত ঘুর­ত গুলশান আবাসি­কর একটি রো­ড যাইz গাড়ী­ত আমরা ঠ্যাগ দেয়ার চি¿¹া করিz ঐ সময় রাত ১.০০ টা বা­জz একজন  বি­দশী লোক­ক দেখ­ত পাইz ডলার পাওয়া যাওয়ার কথা চি¿¹া ক­র আমরা গাড়ী থে­ক  নে­ম তা­ক ঘি­র ধরিz  সেলিম তার প­কট হাতা­ত চাই­ল লোকটি বাধা দেয় এবং  চিৎকার ও ধস¹াধসি¹ কর­ত থা­কz তখন সাইফুল গুলি ক­রz আমি গাড়ীর কা­ছ ছিলামz প­র âুত লোকটি মাটি­ত প­ড় গে­ল আমি গাড়ী­ত উ­ঠ যাইz সবাই âুত উ­ঠ প­র ষ্টার্ট দি­য় আমরা চ­ল যাইz আমা­ক খোকন টঙ্গী নামি­য় দি­য় চ­ল যায়z আমি লোকটি­ক কিছু করি নাই z যা ক­র­ছ সব সাইফুল, সেলিম এবং খোকন মি­ল ক­র­ছz তারা সব সময় ডাকাতি ও ছিনতাই ক­রz আমি ঐ দিন সা­থ গেছি এটাই দোষ হই­ছz</strong><strong>”</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>There is no denying the fact that the confessional statements of the accused Md. Al Amin and Akbar Ali Lalu have been recorded in the prescribed forms. A reference to the confessional statements clearly and unmist-akably shows that the learned Magistrate Mr. Shahriar Mahmud Adnan (P. W. 20) has recorded the same after substantially complying with all legal formalities. It seems that he has given all statutory warnings to the confessing accused before recording their confessions. Mr. Shahriar Mahmud Adnan, before recording the confessions, has explained to the confessing accused Md. Al Amin and Akbar Ali Lalu that they are not bound to make any confessions and if they do so, those may be used as evidence against them and thereafter he has become satisfied upon questioning them that they are making the confessions voluntarily.<br/><br/>It may be recalled that Mr. Khandker Mahbub Hossain does not dispute the voluntariness and truth of the confessional statement of the accused Akbar Ali Lalu dated 01.08.2012 (Exhibit-12). It has been stated earlier that Mr. Khandker Mahbub Hossain has challenged the propriety and correctness of the sentence of death imposed upon his client Lalu.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it is the contention of the learned Advocate Mr. Yusuf Hossain Humayun that the confessional statement of the accused Md. Al Amin dated 30.07.2012 (Exhibit-11) is a product of police torture, oppression and maltreatment and as such he submitted a petition in the Tribunal below for retraction of his confession on 02.12.2012. But it does not transpire from the evidence of the P. W. 20 Shahriar Mahmud Adnan that he has found any marks of injuries on the accused Al Amin at the time of recording of his confession. Besides, the accused Al Amin has not complained of any police torture or intimidation to the P. W. 20. The P. W. 20 has recorded the reasons for believing the confessional statement of the accused Al Amin to be voluntary.<br/><br/>Of course, a suggestion has been put to the P. W. 20 Shahriar Mahmud Adnan in his cross-examination on behalf of the accused Al Amin that there were marks of injuries on his person, but that suggestion has been squarely denied by the P. W. 20. Again a suggestion has been put to the Investigating Officer Md. Obaidul Haque (P. W. 33) in his cross-examination that the confession of Al Amin was procured by torture, but that suggestion has been flatly denied by the P. W. 33.<br/><br/> As a matter of fact, we do not find anything on record that the learned Magistrate Mr. Shahriar Mahmud Adnan (P. W. 20) has recorded the confessional statements of the accused Al Amin and Akbar Ali Lalu in contravention of the mandatory provisions of Sub-Section (3) of Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Moreover, the confession-recording Magistrate, after recording the confessions of the accused Al Amin and Lalu, has appended certificates thereto that they have made the confessions voluntarily. On top of that, at the time of their examination under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, neither the accused Al Amin nor the accused Lalu has made any allegation about perpetration of any torture upon them by the police before recording of their confessional statements by the P. W. 20 Shahriar Mahmud Adnan. It appears that the learned Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam has rightly relied upon the decision in the case of Khalil Mia (condemned-prisoner Vs. The State reported in 4 BLC (AD) 223 in this regard. In that decision, our Appellate Division has held, inter alia, in paragraph 8 that the confession was specifically brought to the notice of the condemned-prisoner while examining him under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; but he did not complain anything regarding the nature of his confession. Both the trial Court and the High Court Division, therefore, rightly believed the confession to be true and voluntary.<br/><br/>The record shows that the four accused, namely, Saiful, Al Amin, Lalu and Khokon were shown arrested in this case on 24.07.2012 and the Investigating Officer concerned prayed for ten days’ remand, but the Court of 1<sup>st</sup> instance allowed eight days’ police remand and ultimately the accused Al Amin and Lalu made judicial confessions to the P. W. 20 Mr. Shahriar Mahmud Adnan under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Had the police really perpetrated torture and oppression upon all the four accused, then the accused Saiful and Khokon would have made confessional statements. The non-making of any judicial confessions by the accused Saiful and Khokon following their police remand is undoubtedly a circumstance to be reckoned with. This circumstance also goes to show that the police did not torture the accused Al Amin and Lalu while on remand before recording of their confessions by the P. W. 20 Mr. Shahriar Mahmud Adnan.<br/><br/>In the decision in the case of Md. Shahidul Islam @ Shahid Vs. The State reported in 8 BLT (HCD) 150, it has been observed that an application for retraction of the confession was made at a belated stage, that is to say, after more than two months of making the confession and if the confession was obtained under duress, there was no reason on the part of the accused to take such a long time for retraction. We are in respectful agreement with this observation.<br/><br/>In the instant case, the confessing accused Al Amin admittedly took more than four months’ time to retract his confession by filing an application on 02.12.2012. Had the police actually obtained the confession from the accused Al Amin under duress, he would not have taken such a long time for retraction of his confession. This aspect of the case can not be lost sight of in any view of the matter. So the allegation of the perpetration of any torture on the accused Al Amin by the police before recording of his confessional statement does not inspire any confidence in us.<br/><br/>It transpires from the confessions of the accused Al Amin and Akbar Ali Lalu that each of them has given a blow-by-blow account of dacoity in the course of which the co-accused Saiful fired the revolver shot on the victim (Khalaf) at the place of occurrence in the early hours of 06.03.2012. Their accounts of the incident of dacoity, as we see them, are very vivid, graphic, pictorial and expansive. It is manifestly clear from their confessions that the victim was fired upon by the co-accused Saiful while committing dacoity by all the accused.<br/><br/>The confessions of the accused Al Amin and Lalu, according to us, stand corroborated by the evidence of the P. W. 16 Dr. Md. Kamrul Hassan Sardar and the autopsy-report. It is the opinion of the P. W. 16 Dr. Md. Kamrul Hassan Sardar that the death of the victim Khalaf was due to haemorrhage and shock resulting from the bullet injury which was ante-mortem and homicidal in nature. Furthermore, recovery of the revolver bearing no. 1616819 from the rented flat of the accused Saiful and the car bearing registration no. Dhaka Metro-Ga-12-9688 from the Cantonment Manikdi area, Dhaka at the showing and identification of the accused Khokon has supported the confessions too.<br/><br/>Let us now scrutinize the decisions referred to by Mrs. Mahmuda Khatun in the cases of Md. Rezaul Karim alias Rezaul Aalm Rikshawala Vs. The State, 23 BLD (HCD) 255; Md. Akbar Ali Vs. The State, 19 BLD (HCD) 268 and Alaluddin alias Alauddin and others Vs. The State, 49 DLR (HCD) 66.<br/><br/>In the decision reported in 23 BLD (HCD) 255, it has been held, inter alia, in paragraph 26 that the confessional statement of a co-accused can not be the basis of conviction of another co-accused and the confession of one co-accused can not be used for corroborating the confession of another co-accused, as both are tainted evidence. There is no dispute about this proposition of law. But in that decision, the learned Additional Sessions Judge solely relied upon the alleged confessional statements of the co-accused in convicting the accused-appellant under Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and thereby committed an illegality. Taking a cue from this finding in the reported decision, Mrs. Mahmuda Khatun has urged that her client Selim can not be convicted on the basis of his implication in the commission of the offence in the confessional statements of the two co-accused, that is to say, Al Amin and Akbar Ali Lalu. We shall discuss the involvement or otherwise of her client Selim in the commission of the offence at a later stage.<br/><br/>In the decision reported in 19 BLD (HCD) 268 (supra) relied on by Mrs. Mahmuda Khatun, we find that in that decision, there is no independent evidence to corroborate the confessional statement of the accused and secondly the confessional statement appears to be exculpatory in nature and accordingly the conviction on the basis of the exculpatory confession of the accused was overturned by the High Court Division. The reference to this decision by Mrs. Mahmuda Khatun does not appear to be of any avail to her.<br/><br/>The last decision that Mrs. Mahmuda Khatun adverts to has been reported in 49 DLR (HCD) 66. On perusal of that decision, we find that the accused was kept in police custody for 3(three) days preceding his confession and the forwarding report mentioned injuries on his person and that is why, the confession was found to be involuntary. But coming back to the present case, we do not find that the forwarding reports of the accused Al Amin and Lalu mentioned any injuries on their person, albeit they were placed on eight days’ police remand. In the absence of any injuries on the person of the accused Al Amin and Lalu and in view of the unimpeachable, invincible and unblemished evidence of the P. W. 20 Shariar Mahmud Adnan, it can not be held that their confessions were involuntary in character.  Over and above, as already mentioned, Mr. Khandker Mahbub Hossain does not dispute the voluntariness and truth of the confessional statement of his client Akbar Ali Lalu. Against this backdrop, the reference to the decision reported in 49 DLR (HCD) 66 appears to be a shot in the dark.<br/><br/>From the foregoing discussions and regard being had to the facts and circumstances of the case, we are led to hold that the judicial confessions of the accused Al Amin and Lalu are voluntary as well as true.<br/>It has already been stated that there is no eye-witness in this case. This case is essentially grounded upon circumstantial evidence as regards the involvement of the accused Saiful, Khokon and Selim in the commission of the offence. Incidentally we would like to observe that it is well-settled that when a case rests on circumstantial evidence, such evidence must satisfy three tests. In the first place, the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be firmly established by unimpeachable evidence; secondly, the circumstances are of a determinative tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused; and thirdly, the circumstances taken cumulatively are incapable of explanation of any reasonable hypothesis save and except that of the guilt sought to be proved against the accused. The circumstances should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the probability that the crime was committed by the accused and no one else.<br/><br/>By the way, we would like to say that we are clearly conscious that a conviction on circumstantial evidence can not be based unless and until all the inferences to be drawn from the whole history of the case point so strongly to the commission of the crime by the accused that the defence version appears on the face of it impossible or highly improbable. We are also conscious of the principle stated in the case of Md. Luqman Vs. The State, 21 DLR (SC) 461 that a finding of guilt against the accused can not be based merely on the high probabilities that may be inferred from the evidence in a given case. Mere conjectures and probabilities can not take the place of proof. We are also not unmindful of the principle enunciated in the case of Alkas Mia and others Vs. The State, 25 DLR 398 that the Court of law has to  dispense justice in accordance with law and not according to the moral conviction of the Judge with regard to the occurrence.<br/><br/>At this juncture, let us turn to the professed role of the accused Saiful in the commission of the offence. The evidence on record unerringly shows that after apprehension of the accused Saiful in the early hours of 04.06.2012, he told the police party that he had a revolver in his rented flat at 132, Gaoyair Madrasha Road under Dakkhin Khan Police Station, DMP, Dhaka and on the basis of that information, the police party, namely, P. W. 25 Md. Mosleh Uddin, P. W. 26 Md. Mahbubur Rahman Tarafdar, P. W. 27 Kazi Haniful Islam and P. W. 28 K. M. Robiul Islam took the accused Saiful to his rented flat and in presence of the landlord Md. Atiqur Rahman Munshi (P. W. 23) and his son Md. Faisal Ahmed Munshi (P. W. 24), the accused Saiful himself brought out the revolver bearing no. 1616819 from a rack of his kitchen. It appears that the recovery of the revolver has been conclusively proved by the evidence of the P. W. 23 Md. Atiqur Rahman Munshi, P. W. 24 Md. Faisal Ahmed Munshi, P. W. 25 Md. Mosleh Uddin, P. W. 26 Md. Mahbubur Rahman Tarafdar and P. W. 27 Kazi Haniful Islam. Moreover, the P. W. 21 Md. Abul Hossain has identified the revolver as his licensed revolver which was looted away in the course of commission of dacoity from his Khilkhet house previously. A reference to Exhibit-13 indicates that the licence of the revolver is in the name of the P. W. 21.<br/><br/>Precisely speaking, it is the claim of the prosecution that the accused Saiful fired the fatal shot on the victim Khalaf with the revolver bearing no. 1616819. In this connection, the evidence of the P. W. 29 Md. Sabdar Ali and P. W. 30 Md. Jamal Uddin, two Forensic Ballistic Experts, seems to be of vital importance. We do not find any earthly reason on their part to depose falsely or to make any false statements in their respective Forensic Ballistic Reports. There is no evidence or material on record to indicate that they are ill-disposed towards the accused Saiful. The seizure of the four test-fired bullets, namely, T-1, T-2, T-3 and T-4 by the P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque as per seizure-list dated 19.07.2012 (Exhibit-15) has been well proved by the evidence of the P. W. 27 Kazi Haniful Islam and P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque. From a combined reading of the evidence of the P. W. 29 Md. Sabdar Ali and P. W. 30 Md. Jamal Uddin coupled with the Forensic Ballistic Report dated 18.03.2012 (Exhibit-16) and Forensic Ballistic Report dated 19.07.2012 (Exhibit-17), we find that the accused Saiful fired the fatal shot on the victim Khalaf from the revolver bearing no. 1616819.<br/><br/>What we are driving at boils down to this: the evidence of the P. W. 21 Md. Abul Hossain, P.W. 23 Md. Atiqur Rahman Munshi, P. W. 24 Md. Faisal Ahmed Munshi, P. W. 25 Md. Mosleh Uddin, P. W. 26 Md. Mahbubur Rahman Tarafdar, P. W. 27 Kazi Haniful Islam, P. W. 29 Md. Sabdar Ali, P. W. 30 Md. Jamal Uddin and P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque  and the attending circumstances of the case are so intertwined and  interwoven that  a man of ordinary prudence will come to the conclusion that no one else, but the accused Saiful himself fired the fatal revolver shot on the victim Khalaf on the drain-slab on the northern side of Road No. 120 which is on the southern side of House No. 19/B, Road No. 117, Gulshan Police Station, DMP, Dhaka at the  time of commission of dacoity.<br/><br/>It transpires from the record that the accused Khokon is a driver by profession and he has also stated so in his petition of appeal. It is in the evidence of the P. W. 33 Md. Obaidul Haque that at the instance of the accused Khokon, the car bearing no. Dhaka Metro-Ga-12-9688 was recovered from Manikdi area and he seized the same as per seizure-list dated 24.07.2012 (Exhibit-10) in presence of the P. W. 18 Abul Hossain and P. W. 19 Md. Motiur Rahman. The recovery of the car at the showing and identification of the accused Khokon from the Cantonment Manikdi area, Dhaka, in our opinion, has been proved by the evidence of the P. Ws. 18, 19 and 33 beyond any shadow of doubt. The seizure-list dated 24.07.2012 (Exhibit-10), it goes without saying, is a corroboration of the substantive evidence adduced by all these three prosecution witnesses. What is more, on 25.07.2012, the P. W. 22 Md. Anwar Hossain identified the car at the DB office which he saw immediately after the occurrence while it was speeding away. The evidence of the P. W. 22 Md. Anwar Hossain to that effect can not be brushed aside at all.<br/><br/>In the case of Kashmira Singh Vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh reported in AIR 1952 SC 474, the Indian Supreme Court has spelt out:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“The confession of an accused person can only be used against a co-accused to lend assurance to other evidence against the co-accused. The proper way to approach a case of this kind is, first, to marshal the evidence against the co-accused excluding the confession altogether from consideration and see whether, if it is believed, a conviction could safely be based on it. If it is capable of belief independently of the confession, then it is not necessary to call the confession in aid. But cases may arise where the Judge is not prepared to act on the other evidence as it stands even though, if believed, it would be sufficient to sustain a conviction. In such an event, the Judge may call in aid the confession and use it to lend assurance to other evidence and thus fortify himself in believing that without the aid of the confession, he would not be prepared to accept.”  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Moqbul Hossain Vs. The State reported in 12 DLR SC 217, the Pakistan Supreme Court has held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The language of the section (Section 30 of the Evidence Act) is very guarded and lends no warrant to the inference that such a statement made by a co-accused could be treated as substantive evidence against the other person sufficient to sustain his conviction. It is well-settled that there ought to be other evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, linking such a person with the crime, before a confession made by a co-accused could be adverted to, in adjudging the guilt of that person.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We have already found the judicial confessions of the co-accused Al Amin and Lalu voluntary and true. Those confessions obviously lend assurance to the overwhelm-ingly incriminating evidence on record against the accused Saiful and Khokon as detailed above. We call in aid the confessions of the co-accused Al Amin and Lalu only to fortify ourselves in our finding that the accused Saiful and Khokon were very much connected with the commission of dacoity in the course of which Khalaf was shot at by the accused Saiful. The incriminating circumstances appearing against the accused Saiful and Khokon, to be sure, are full, complete and self-contained. They are of a conclusive nature. We do not find any missing link in those circumstances. The circumstances taken cumulatively are incapable of explanation of any reasonable hypothesis save and except that of the guilt of the accused Saiful and Khokon. In such a posture of things, they can not eschew their penal liability. In a word, the culpability of the accused Saiful and Khokon vis-à-vis the occurrence has been brought home to us, apart from the involvement of the accused Al Amin and Lalu therein.<br/><br/>It is the contention of Mr. Yusuf Hossain Humayun and Mr. Md. Khabir Uddin Bhuiyan that admittedly the finger-prints on the revolver were not examined by any expert and in the absence of examination of the finger-prints on the revolver, the prosecution case is suspect entitling the accused Saiful to acquittal on the score of benefit of doubt. The evidence on record shows that the revolver was recovered from the rented flat of the accused Saiful long after three months of the occurrence. During this long interval, the revolver might have been used either by Saiful or by his cohorts at some points of time making the earlier finger-prints thereon blurred. By that reason, the Investigating Officer Md. Obaidul Haque (P. W. 33) did not think it proper to get the finger-prints on the revolver examined in this case. In such a situation, we hold that the prosecution case has not been affected on merit in the absence of examination of the finger-prints on the revolver bearing no. 1616819 which was used in the commission of the offence.<br/><br/>As to the argument of Mr. Yusuf Hossain Humayun that the P. W. 31 Md. Nure Azam Miah (1<sup>st</sup> Investigating Officer) did not seize any wet earth from the place of occurrence nor did he seize any blood-stain therefrom rendering the prosecution case doubtful, it is in the cross-examination of the P. W. 31 that he did not find any blood-stain at the place of occurrence at the time of his visit and although there were wet earth and sand there, he did not seize and just observed the  same. In the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the evidence on record, the non-finding of any blood-stain at the place of occurrence and the non-seizure of any wet earth or sand therefrom, in our estimation, do not render the prosecution case doubtful. So we are not impressed by this contention of Mr. Yusuf Hossain Humayun.<br/><br/>A question may arise as to the colour of the car bearing registration no. Dhaka Metro-Ga-12-9688─ whether it is white or olive-coloured? In this context, the finding of the learned Tribunal Judge appears to be very well-reasoned which is as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>“</strong><strong>আসামী পক্ষ শুধু দাবী ক­র­ছ জব্দকৃত গাড়ীর রং জলপাই রং­য়রz বাস¹বতার নিরি­খ বি­শ্লষণ কর­ল প্রতীয়মান হয় যে, জলপাই রং­য়র গাড়ী রা­তর বেলায় সাদা রং­য়র ম­তা ব­লই প্রতীয়মান হয়z সাক্ষীরা জব্দকৃত গাড়ী­ক সম্পূর্ণ সাদা রং ব­ল নাইz তারা ব­ল­ছ সাদা রং­য়র ম­তা গাড়ীz সুতরাং জব্দকৃত গাড়ী ঘটনার সময় ব্যবহ্রত গাড়ী এ বিষ­য় কোন স­ন্দহ নাইz</strong><strong>”</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The reason assigned in support of the above finding, to our mind, is realistic, pragmatic and very much in consonance with the relevant prosecution evidence on record. Besides, as already found, the car in question was recovered from the Cantonment Manikdi area at the showing of the accused Khokon and subsequently indentified by the P. W. 22 Md. Anwar Hossain at the DB Office, Minto Road, Dhaka. So we are completely at one with the learned Tribunal Judge on this point.<br/><br/>It is on record that the P. W. 1 Sub-Inspector Md. Mosharraf Hossain (informant) seized a pair of trousers, a pair of keds, a torn vest, a torn underwear etc. as per seizure-list dated 06.03.2012 (Exhibit-2). Needless to say, the seizure of those articles has been proved by the P. W. 1 Sub-Inspector Md. Mosharraf Hossain himself, P. W. 6 Md. Ripon and P. W. 7 Md. Maksudur Rahman. The seized wearing-apparels and keds of the deceased Khalaf were sent for chemical examination and the chemical examination report dated 12.03.2012 is self-explanatory being a proved document under Section 510 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As per the chemical examination report dated 12.03.2012, the seized keds and wearing-apparels contained human blood. So there can not be any shred of doubt that the keds and wearing-apparels contained the blood of the Saudi diplomat Khalaf.<br/><br/>We have mentioned earlier that Mr. Khandker Mahbub Hossain does not dispute the time, place and manner of the occurrence; but Mr. Yusuf Hossain Humayun disputes the place and manner of the occurrence, though he does not dispute the time of the occurrence. Anyway, we have already found the place of the occurrence, that is to say, drain-slab on the northern side of Road No. 120 which is on the southern side of House No. 19/B, Road No. 117, Gulshan Police Station, DMP, Dhaka as testified to by the prosecution witnesses concerned. Over and above, the place of occurrence has been pinpointed by the letter ‘A’ in the sketch-map as indicated in the index thereto. Although Mr. Yusuf Hossain Humayun challenges the place and manner of the occurrence, yet he fails to cast any reasonable doubt thereon, regard being had to the evidence and materials on record.  Under the circumstances, the challenge as to the place and manner of the occurrence by Mr. Yusuf Hossain Humayun falls through.<br/><br/>We have already discussed the involvement of the accused Saiful, Al Amin, Lalu and Khokon in the commission of the offence. As to the absconding accused Selim, it seems that there are mainly two circumstances appearing against him-(1) his continuous unexplained abscondence since the commission of the offence and (2) his implication in the commission of the offence in the judicial confessions of the two co-accused, namely, Al Amin and Lalu.  In this connection, a million-dollar question arises: Are those two circumstances sufficient for the conviction of the accused Selim?<br/><br/>However, both the Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khursedul Alam and the Attorney-General Mr. Mahbubey Alam have submitted that in view of the evidence of the P. W. 23 Md. Atiqur Rahman Munshi and P. W. 24 Md. Faisal Ahmed Munshi, it is crystal clear that the accused Selim lived with the accused Saiful in his rented flat and the accused Selim happened to be a maternal cousin of the wife of the accused Saiful and it is on record that Saiful and others were accused in a number of cases which were initiated prior to the present case and since Selim and Saiful lived together in the rented flat and since earlier Selim and others were accused in a case, it may be presumed that Selim’s living together with Saiful in the self-same rented flat is an incriminating circumstance indicating Selim’s  involvement in the commission of the instant offence which ought to be taken into account along with his implication in the commission of the offence in the confessions of the co-accused  Al Amin and  Lalu and Selim’s continuous unexplained abscondence. In view of this submission of Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam and Mr. Mahbubey Alam, a pertinent question crops up: Does Selim’s living together with Saiful in the self-same rented flat give rise to any presumption that Selim was involved in the commission of the instant offence? The answer is obviously in the negative, though Selim was an accused along with others in an earlier case, namely, Pallabi Police Station Case No. 22(1)11 under Sections 395/397/412 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>It is true that immediately after the occurrence, the accused Selim absconded and has been on the run as of now. This long unexplained abscondence of the accused Selim is, no doubt, a relevant fact under Section 8 of the Evidence Act and favours the prosecution pointing a finger at his alleged guilt, though abscondence by itself is not conclusive of one’s guilt. This unexplained abscondence of the accused Selim, in our view, is a supporting circumstance which must be considered along with the substantive evidence on record, if any, forthcoming against the accused Selim. The implication of the accused Selim in the commission of the offence in the confessions of the two co-accused, namely, Al Amin and Lalu, it is well-settled, is not a piece of substantive evidence within the meaning of Section 3 of the Evidence Act. This implication of the accused Selim in the commission of the offence in the confessions of the two co-accused may lend support to the independent evidence on record, if any, connecting him with the commission of the offence. To sum up, apart from the abscondence of the accused Selim and his implication in the commission of the offence in the confessions of the co-accused Al Amin and Lalu, we do not find any independent substantive evidence on record linking the accused Selim with the commission of the offence. This being the panorama, we can not find the accused Selim guilty along with the co-accused Saiful, Al Amin, Lalu and Khokon.  In this context, the reference made by the learned Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam to the decisions in the cases of The State Vs. Md. Gaush Meah alias Rana and others, 10 BLC (HCD) 74 and The State Vs. Moslem, 55 DLR (HCD) 116 has misfired. Having regard to the totality of the evidence and materials on record and in the facts and circumstances of the case, we are inclined to award the benefit of doubt to the accused Selim.<br/><br/>The defence version of the case that the victim Khalaf was a man of immoral character and his maid-servant was a call-girl and she along with others caused the death of Khalaf at the relevant time and the confessions of the accused Md. Al Amin and Akbar Ali Lalu are the products of police torture, oppression and maltreatment do not receive any support or indication from the evidence and materials on record. So we are of the opinion that the defence version is a blatant falsehood. It is like “A drowning man catches at a straw.”<br/><br/>It seems that the learned Advocate Mr. Khandker Mahbub Hossain has rightly pointed out that there are three options in Section 396 of the Penal Code in respect of awarding of sentence to the accused. However, we deem it worthwhile to quote Section 396 of the Penal Code which runs as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“396. If any one of five or more persons, who are conjointly committing dacoity, commits murder in so committing dacoity, every one of those persons shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, or rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>As there are three options in respect of awarding of sentence in Section 396 of the Penal Code, it lies at the discretion of the Court to award an appropriate sentence to each of the accused, regard being had to his individual culpability and role in the commission of the offence, though dacoity is a conjoint offence. The measure of punishment in a given case must depend upon the atrocity of the crime; the conduct of the criminal and the defenceless and unprotected state of the victim. Imposition of appropriate punishment is the manner in which the Court responds to the society’s cry for justice against the criminals. Justice demands that the Court should impose punishment befitting the crime so that the Court reflects public abhorrence of the crime. The Court must not only keep in view the rights of the criminal, but also the rights of the victim of the crime and the society at large while considering imposition of appropriate punishment.<br/><br/>It is axiomatic that in the criminal justice delivery system, sentencing is the cutting-edge of the judicial process. In sentencing any accused, aggravating factors can not be ignored and similarly mitigating circumstances have also to be taken into consideration.<br/><br/>In the case of the State Vs. Rokeya Begum alias Rokaya Begum and another (condemned-prisoners) reported in 13 BLT (HCD) 377, it has been stated in paragraph 51:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“51. Sentencing discretion on the part of a Judge is the most difficult task to perform. It is, also, not possible to lay down any cut and dry formula for imposition of sentence, but the object of sentence should be to see that crime does not go unpunished and the victim of crime as, also, the society has the satisfaction that justice has been done. It will be a mockery of justice to permit the accused to escape the extreme penalty of law when faced with such evidence and cruel act perpetrated by the offenders. To give lesser punishment to the condemned prisoners who stand convicted in a shocking and revolting crime would render the Justicing System of the country suspect. Sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to Justice System to undermine public confidence in the efficacy of law.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the decision in the case of Madan Gopal Kakkad Vs. Naval Dubey and another reported in 3 SCC (1992) 204, it has been observed in paragraph 58:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“58. We feel that Judges who bear the Sword of Justice should not hesitate to use that Sword with the utmost severity, to the full and to the end, if the gravity of the offence so demands.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the decision in the case of Geedo and others Vs. The State reported in 1986 P. Cr. L. J Karachi 2192 adverted to by Mr. Khandker Mahbub Hossain, it has been spelt out:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“…………………………………………….…………………............................................But the case of dacoity accompanied with murder should be viewed separately. Here no member of the band had a premeditated design to kill any particular person. The paramount intention of each member of the gang was to acquire property. The lust for booty and not the lust for blood was the motivating force behind the mind of each member which brought them to the scene of the crime. Individually and collectively they were keen to avoid any clash and would resort to force most reluctantly much against their will. This inhibition to cause any injury, simple or grave, would be shared by each of them whether his fingers are on the trigger of his gun or on the lock of the safe. The bodily injuries caused during such an encounter usually occur much to their distress and out of sheer necessity for accomplishing the object. The intruder causing death has no previous enmity with his target. More often than not such a misfortune occurs in an effort to break the cordon and ensure their escape. Can any discrimination be made between any one of them and can it be said that the quantum of retribution to each would depend on the part played by each? In my humble opinion, the legislative intent specified in Section 396, P.P.C., provides the answer. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>………………………………………………………………………………………………</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>There is no doubt that in the case on hand all the five convicts who were armed to the teeth reached the scene of offence with intention to commit dacoity. They all shared the common intention to commit dacoity. None of them even Geedo who fired the fatal shot had any design or premeditated intention to cause death of Bhambho. But once it is shown that murder was committed by Geedo while all the five were “conjointly committing dacoity”, then all of them would be equally liable for the murder. Had it been a case of murder punishable under Section 302, P.P.C. then each one of them could not be made liable until his individual role was not determined in terms of Section 34. But Section 396 has a combined effect of Sections 302 and 34, P.P.C. The concept of immunity for those to whom no overt act is attributed is misconceived in the present situation. This is a case where the intention from the start to the end for committing dacoity is common. Their very presence during the commission of the offence would be deemed to be an overt act and enough to saddle them with the consequences prescribed in the Section.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>While referring to the other decision reported in 40 Cr. L. J Allahabad 132 (Lal Singh Vs. Emperor), Mr. Khandker Mahbub Hossain has laid much emphasis on its last paragraph which is in the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“There remains the question of sentence. It is true that a man was wounded in the dacoity and eventually died. It is also true that the accused carried a gun in this dacoity. But it is stated that there were several guns carried in this dacoity and none of the witnesses say that the accused was the man who fired the shot which had fatal effects. We do not consider that as a general rule a sentence of death should necessarily follow a conviction under Section 396, Indian Penal Code, and this Section differs from Section 302, Indian Penal Code in that respect. The rule is under Section 302 that a sentence of death should follow unless reasons are shown for giving a lesser sentence, no such rule applies to Section 396, Indian Penal Code. Accordingly we find no reason in this case why the sentence of death should be imposed. We, therefore, maintain the conviction of Lal Singh under Section 396, Indian Penal Code, and we reduce the sentence from a sentence of death to a sentence of transportation for life.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Reverting to the case in hand, we find that out of all the accused, only the accused Saiful was armed with a revolver. At the time of commission of the offence, the victim Khalaf was defenceless and in jogging apparels. There is nothing on record to show that the accused were encircled by the local people at the material time and with a view to effecting their escape, the accused Saiful fired the fatal revolver shot on the victim Khalaf resulting in his eventual death at the United Hospital, Dhaka. In any case, the firing of the fatal revolver shot on Khalaf by the accused Saiful was not necessitated by the exigency of the situation and it was senseless indeed.<br/>As to the case of Emperor Vs. Nga Tha Hmwe and others reported in AIR 1935 Rangoon 504 adverted to by the learned Attorney –General Mr. Mahbubey Alam, we find that  the facts and circumstances of that case are quite distinguishable from those of the instant case. So the aforesaid referred case is an exercise in futility.<br/><br/>According to the observation of the Indian Supreme Court in the case of Madan Gopal Kakkad Vs. Naval Dubey and another, 3 SCC (1992) 204 (supra), we feel that we should not hesitate to use the Sword of Justice with the utmost severity, to the full and to the end in so far as the accused Saiful is concerned. There goes an age-old adage- “Give the Devil his due”. So we are of the opinion that the ends of justice demand that the accused Saiful be awarded the extreme penalty of death. We see eye-to-eye with the learned Tribunal Judge on this question.<br/><br/>As regards the remaining three condemned-appellants, namely, Md. Al Amin, Akbar Ali Lalu alias Roni and Md. Rafiqul Islam alias Khokon, we have already found that they were involved in the commission of dacoity, though they did not inflict any injuries on the victim Khalaf. But in any event, they should be awarded deterrent punishment commensurate with their culpability and roles in the commission of the offence. We think, the ends of justice will be sufficiently met if those three accused, that is to say, Md. Al Amin, Akbar Ali Lalu and Khokon are sentenced to imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>In order to commit ‘dacoity’, there must be at least five persons as contemplated by Section 391 of the Penal Code. So naturally a question arises as to whether the four accused, namely, Saiful Islam, Md. Al Amin, Akbar Ali Lalu and Khokon can be convicted and sentenced under Section 396 of the Penal Code. On this question, there is an illuminating decision in the case of Wahed alias Abdul Wahed alias Sk. Abdul Wahed and others Vs. The State reported in 8 DLR (Dhaka) 50. In that decision, it has been held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Mr. Abdullah, lastly, argued that only four persons out of fifteen on trial have been convicted on a charge of dacoity and as such the conviction is not maintainable in law, as to constitute an offence of dacoity there must be at least five persons involved therein .……………..………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………... …………………..</em><br/><em>In the case before us as many as 15 persons were tried on a charge under Section 396 of the Pakistan Penal Code, that is, dacoity with murder. Out of these, 11 were acquitted of the charge for want of sufficient evidence. There is no finding in the judgment of the learned Additional Sessions Judge that only these four appellants took part in the dacoity. The evidence on record shows that the number of the persons was not 5 but much more than 5. Moreover, the ‘dacoity’ occurring in the charge, according to the provisions contained in Section 294 Cr. P.C. is to be taken to bear the same sense in which it has been defined in Section 391 of the Pakistan Penal Code. Further, the charge as it stood contains 15 names and accordingly no fault can be found therewith. The appellants knew very well that they had to meet a charge of dacoity with murder and the defence, as a matter of fact, was conducted on that line. We, accordingly, hold that no surprise was sprung on the appellants at any stage of the trial and no failure of justice has been occasioned on account of their conviction under Section 396 of the Pakistan Penal Code. In any view of the matter, this conviction can not be said to be wrong in law inasmuch as it does not infringe any mandatory provision of law.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the present case before us, as many as five accused including the absconding accused Md. Selim Chowdhury were charge-sheeted under Section 396 of the Penal Code. They also faced trial under that Section of the said Code. Defence was necessarily conducted on that line. It may be recalled that we have awarded the benefit of doubt to the accused Md. Selim Chowdhury in the absence of any independent substantive evidence on record connecting him with the commission of the offence. Following the ‘ratio decidendi’ of the decision reported in 8 DLR (Dhaka) 50, the conviction  recorded against the four accused, namely, Saiful Islam, Md. Al Amin, Akbar Ali Lalu  and Khokon under Section 396 of the Penal Code can not be found fault with.<br/><br/>From the aforementioned discussions and in the facts and circumstances of the case, we do not find any merit in Criminal Appeal Nos. 251 of 2013 and 273 of 2013 and Jail Appeal Nos. 07 of 2013, 08 of 2013, 09 of 2013 and 10 of 2013. As such, all those appeals are dismissed with the commutation of the death sentence of the appellants Md. Al Amin, Akbar Ali Lalu alias Roni and Md. Rafiqul Islam alias Khokon to imprisonment for life.  The death sentence awarded to the appellant Saiful Islam alias Mamun does not call for any interference from this Court. In the result, the Death Reference is accepted in part and the sentence of death imposed upon him (Saiful Islam alias Mamun) is maintained. The absconding accused Md. Selim Chowdhury alias Selim Ahmed is acquitted of the charge on the ground of benefit of doubt. Accordingly the impugned judgment and order stands modified.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>Let the records of the Tribunal below along with a copy of this judgment be sent down immediately for information and necessary action.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>By this appeal, convict appellant has challenged the legality and propriety of the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 30-01-2000 passed by learned Judge of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Bishe413sh Adalat, Narsingdi (briefly as Adalat), in Nari-O-Shishu Case no. 27 of 1998 convicting the appellant under Section 5(L) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidan)Ain, 1995 (briefly as Ain 1995) and sentencing him under Clause (D) of the Ain 1995 to suffer imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Tk. Five thousand in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year more and also convicted under section 5(P)  of the Ain 1995 and sentencing him under Clause (A) of the Ain, 1995 to suffer rigorous imprisonment for fourteen years and also to pay a fine of Tk. three thousand in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months more with a direction to run both the sentences concurrently.<br/><br/>The prosecution case as projected in the first information report (briefly as FIR) and unfurled at trial are that Sufia Begum (since victim) (PW.2) was married with Arju Mia (PW.3) before 14/15 years of the occurrence. During their wedlock three child born and she used reside in her conjugal home. During subsistence of their marriage her husband married one Fatema  sister of accused Ibrahim for the second time who failed to stay at her conjugal home as she (victim) do not allow her to stay at her conjugal home jointly, for which accused Ibrahim threatened her. On 06-04-1996 at 9:00 p.m. she came out from her dwelling hut for natural call and sat under a date-tree situated at the north –east corner of her dwelling hut. At then, accused hurled acid upon her from back causing burn injuries to her head, face, shoulder, chest and back. On her alarm in-law’s including locals rushed to the scene to whom she disclosed the facts. Then she was taken to Palash hospital but due to her critical condition she was shifted  to Dhaka Medical College hospital for better treatment. Even then she sustained permanent disfiguration at her head and face. With these allegations prosecution was launched by lodging an FIR by her cousin sister’s husband Md. Sirajul Islam as informant (PW.1) which was recorded as Palash P.S. Case no. 06(4) of 1996.<br/><br/>The Police after investigation submitted charge-sheet under Section 326 A of the Penal Code accusing FIR named accused Ibrahim.<br/><br/>Eventually, the accused was called upon to answer the charge under Section 5(L)(P) of the Ain, 1995 to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. In course of trial the prosecution in all examined eleven witnesses and one witness was tendered out of twelve cited witnesses. The defence examined none. After closure of the prosecution case, accused was again examined under Section 342 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure(briefly as the Code), again he pleaded not guilty but led no evidence in defence.<br/><br/>The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses are that of innocence and false implication; it was divulged in defence that due to internal feud between them he was falsely implicated. It was further revealed that PW. 3 conspired to hurl acid upon victim but out of enmity accused appellant was implicated.<br/><br/>After trial the learned Judge convicted the appellant as aforesaid as holding :</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">The prosecution successfully proved the charge  beyond all reasonable doubt;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">There are consistent and corrobor-ative evidence against the accused in respect of commission of such crime.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> The learned Advocate appearing for the convict-appellant seeks to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on five fold arguments:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><u>Firstly:</u></strong>  The learned Judge tried the case without jurisdiction inasmuchas he is not empowered under section 17 of the Ain, 1995 to try such case as the Police submitted its report not under Ain 1995 but under Penal Code.<br/><strong><u>Secondly</u></strong><u>:</u> Findings in respect of sentence of the learned Judge is not supported by legal evidence;<br/><strong><u>Thirdly:</u> </strong>The recognition of the appellant from back in moon-light was not probable. In support of his contentions he refers the case of Moslemuddin and others vs. State 1 BCR (1981)-70 held:<br/><em>"Recognition of accused persons being improbable, speculative and of an uncertain character, no reliance can be placed on such recognition for convicting accused persons- Omission to state recognition to the Investigating Officer amounts to material contradiction-Evidence unworthy of credibility. "</em><br/><strong><u>Fourthly:</u></strong>   Delay in examination of the prosecution witness who rush to the scene soon-after the occurrence were examined after long lapse of time which render their evidence shaky. In support of his contentions he refers the case of Zafar and others vs. The State 14 BLD 280 held:<br/><em>"Inordinate delay in recording the statement of witnesses by the I.O. under section 161 Cr.P.C. renders their evidence shaky.</em><br/><strong><u>Fifthly:</u></strong> The judgment and order of conviction and sentence based on misreading and non-consideration of the evidence on record which cannot be sustained in the eye of law.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State-respondent opposes the appeal and submits that the victim Sufia Begum categorically narrated the entire episode and she rightly recognised the accused in moon-light. She adds that such recognition is probable and acceptable. In support of her contentions she refers the case of Nausher Ali Sarder and others vs. The State BCR 1987(AD) 376 held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"(a) Recognition of the accused by moon-light.</em><br/><em>The bamboo clump by the side of which the village path lay was found to be 100 cubit from the dwelling hut of Golam Ali from where he claimed to have heard the alarm of Elias who sought his help stating that he was being killed by these three persons. Golam Ali is found to be sickly but he is not suffering from any illness; as such his physical condition could hardly stand in the way of his recognising known persons in the moon-light, and as the incident took place not in the bamboo clump but on the path recognition by moon-light was quite possible."</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">She further submits that the victim was under treatment for about two months and to that effect respective doctors issued the certificate. She submits that although PW. 2 is a sole witness in this case but she recognized the assailant so her evidence can be believed for convicting the accused. In support of her contentions she refers the case of Abdul Hai Sikder and another vs. The State 43 DLR (AD) 95 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>" Number of witnesses-Conviction of the appellants can safely be based on the solitary evidence of the eye witness PW 1. His evidence is full, complete and self-contained. It may not have received corroboration from other witnesses, but it stands fully corroborated by the circumstances of the case and the medical evidence on record. It fullness and complete-ness are enough to justify the conviction. "</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On identical point she refers the case of Ataur Rahman and others vs. The State 43 DLR(HC) 87 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>      <br/>        " The evidence of an injured person carries much weight since the injured person does not usually allow the real culprit to escape and falsely implicate an innocent person.</em><br/><em>         -In the matter of observation, perception and memorisation, different witnesses differ from each other. So is weight to be given to those which are of consensus as to the substance of their evidence. The standard of rural witness should not be comparable to that of urban witness in the matter of exactitude and consistency. Consideration in narration can not militate against the veracity the cure of testimony provided that there is an impression of truth and conformity in substantial fabric of the testimony so delivered</em><br/><em>         -It is settled principle that when injured witness marked assailants it cannot be said that he would give up real assailant and falsely implicate person with whom there was no enmity.</em><br/><em>         -Quality and not quantity of evidence is acceptable. There is no impediment in law in conviction being based on the testimony of single witness if it is honest and trustworthy, veracity of eye-witness cannot be doubted unless reason for false implication is given. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>She also refers the case of Abdul Quddus vs. The State 43 DLR (AD)234 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>         "The testimony of the solitary eye witness could not be shaken in any manner by the defence in cross-examination for which it is difficult to disbelief her testimony as she narrated the prosecution case in details. Even a child witness can be relied if he/she is capable of understanding and replying the question intelligently.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><em>Medical evidence is only corroborative in nature- Ocular evidence of the eye witness which substantially corroborates the major injuries on the person of the deceased must be accepted. "</em><br/> <br/>She lastly submits that the learned Judge after considering the entire consistent evidence of the witnesses rightly convicted the accused which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/> <br/>In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to their submissions.<br/> <br/>Let us now weigh and sift the evidence on record as adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/> <br/>P.W.1, Md. Sirajul Islam is the informant of this case. He is cousin sister’s husband of victim. He virtually heard the occurrence from PW. 2. He deposed that on 06-04-1996 at 9:00 p.m. the occurrence took place; his sister-in-law victim Sufia Begum was married with Arju Mia before 15/16 years of the occurrence. Before 3/4 years Arju married one Fatema for the second time who urged to come to her conjugal home but resisted by first wife Sufia and due to such enmity brother of Fatema hurled acid upon Sufia. On the date and time of occurrence victim Sufia came out for natural call. At then, the accused Ibrahim hurled acid upon her back causing burn injuries at head, back, chest, shoulder, and face. On her alarm locals rushed to the scene to whom Sufia disclosed such recognition to the effect that she recognised Ibrahim by moon-light. Then she was taken to Palash hospital. Later at the advise of doctor she was shifted to Dhaka Medical College hospital wherein she was under treatment for about one month. On 14-04-1996 he lodged the FIR which he proved it as Exhbt. 1 and his signature on it Exbt. 1/1. The investigating Officer (briefly as I.O.) on 15-04-1996 seized different wearing apparels of victim.<br/> <br/>In cross-examination he stated that at the date and time of occurrence he was in Dhaka.  On 08-04-1996 he had a talk with Sufia for the first time then she disclosed the name of Ibrahim. He could not remember whether he stated in the FIR that Sufia recognised the accused at moon-light. Soon-after the occurrence Sufia disclosed about such recognition to Mozammel Haq, Benu Mia, Sultanuddin, Alauddin, Haider Hossain, Abdul Karim and others to whom he had a talk on 12-04-1996. He denied the suggestion that Arju Mia being dissatisfied with his first wife Sufia, hurled acid and since then he was absconding and instituted false case against the accused Ibrahim.<br/>PW. 2  Sufia Begum is the victim. She deposed that informant is her sister’s husband and Arju Mia is her husband.  On 06-04-1996 at 9:00 p.m. she came out for natural call and sat under a date-tree. At then, accused Ibrahim hurled acid upon her from back causing burning injuries at her head, face, shoulder, chest and back. She recognised the accused by moon-light and voice. On her alarm her mother-in-law, uncle-in-law and other locals rushed there to whom she disclosed that Ibrahim hurled acid. At then, she was taken to Palash hospital as her condition was so critical, then she was shifted to Dhaka Medical College hospital wherein she was under treatment for about one month. Before 14/15 years of the occurrence she was married with Arju Mia. Before 2/3 years her husband married Fatema sister of accused Ibrahim  for the second time. Ibrahim Mia tried to send her to her conjugal home which was resisted by her(PW 2) and her husband for which Ibrahim threatened them. By acid different parts were permanently disfigured.<br/><br/>In cross-examination she stated that Arju Mia married for the second time without her consent. After receiving injuries by acid she was not senseless. On her alarm other locals rushed to the scene but her husband do not turn up. After two days of the occurrence she disclosed the facts to the informant. She denied the suggestion that at the time of occurrence there was dark and she did not see Ibrahim. She also denied that Arju Mia hurled acid upon her.<br/><br/>PW. 3 Arju Mia husband of the victim and cousin of the informant.He deposed that on 06-04-1996 at 9:00 p.m. he was in the market. Having had heard the incident he rushed to the house and heard the occurrence from his wife that Ibrahim hurled acid upon her causing  burning injuries at her face, chest etc. She was taken to Palash hospital. Thereafter she was shifted to the Dhaka Medical College hospital for treatment. Ibrahim is the brother of his second wife. For the cause of enmity Ibrahim hurled acid upon her.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that at the night of occurrence there was dark. He does not ask how Sufia identified the accused and he was not examined by I.O. and he never meet with I.O.  He did not come with Sufia to Dhaka for her treatment. He denied the suggestion that after the incident he was absconding.<br/><br/>PW. 4 Benu Mia, PW. 6 Mozammel Haq are the locals seizure list witnesses. They deposed that they heard the occurrence and found victim Sufia sustaining injuries by acid. In their presence the I.O. seized different wearing apparels, PW- 4 proved the same as material Exhbts. (I-IV) and seizure list as Ehbt. 2 and his signature on it as Exhbt. 2/1. At the time of seized Arju Mia husband of the victim was not present. <br/>PW. 5 Sultanuddin, PW. 8 Aftabuddin are the locals witnesses they heard the occurrence.<br/><br/><br/>In cross-examination they stated that they came to know that Ibrahim hurled acid upon the victim Sufia.<br/><br/>PW. 7 Momena Khatun is the mother –in-law of the victim. She deposed that on hearing the alarm she came out and found Sufia was injured by acid. He heard that Ibrahim hurled acid.<br/><br/>In cross-examination she stated that on the night of occurrence there was dark.<br/><br/>PW.9 Abdul Karim Sarder was tendered by the prosecution. However in cross-examination he stated that he went to Sufia in the hospital.<br/><br/>PW.10 Dr. Abdul Matin. He examined the victim Sufia Begum. He deposed that Sufia was under treatment since 06-04-1996 to 02-06-1996 sustaining injuries at her head, neck, chest and back. He issued the injury certificate on 08-04-1999, he proved the discharge certificate as Exhbt. 6.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he denied the suggestion that being influenced he issued certificate.<br/><br/>PW.11 S.I. Md. Solaiman Ahmed, he deposed that on 14-04-1996 he was attached with Polash Police Station. He was entrusted with the case for investigation.  He also filled up the form of FIR which he proved it at Exhbt. 3 and his signature on it 3/1. He visited the place of occurrence. He prepared the sketch map and index which he proved it as Exbts. 4 and 5 respectively and his signatures on it Exhbts.4/1 and 5/1 respectively. He recorded the statements of the witnesses under Section 161 of the Code. He prepared seizure list of the wearing apparels of the victim on 15-06-1996 which he proved it as Exhbt.2 and his signature on it 2/3.  <br/><br/>After investigation he submitted charge-sheet under Section 326A of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that on 15-04-1996 he visited the P.O.. On 08-05-1996 he examined Arju Mia. On 23-04-1996, 30-04-1996, 08-05-1996, 16-05-1996, 24-05-1996, 01-06-1996, 08-06-1996, 11-06-1996, 28-06-1996, and 10-08-1996 he visited the P.O. but find no witness of the occurrence. On 21-07-1996 he recorded the statements of the victim and Benu Mia. He recorded the statement of Sultan Ahmed and Aftabuddin on 02-08-1996 and 08-05-1996 examined Arju Mia. He denied the suggestion that he submitted the perfunctory charge-sheet without proper investigation.<br/><br/>PW.12 Dr. A.J.M. Saleque. He deposed that the victim  was admitted to his ward no. 35A and he also held a surgical operation upon the victim.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he denied the suggestion that the discharge certificate was not correct one.<br/><br/>These are all of the evidence on record adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/><br/>On going to the materials on record it transpires that the prosecution in all produced twelve witnesses. Of them examined eleven witnesses and one witness namely PW.9 was tendered by the prosecution.<br/><br/>PW. 1 is the informant and cousin sister’s husband of victim (PW. 2). PWs. 4-8 were the local witnesses they heard the occurrence from PW. 2. PW.10, 11,12 are the official witnesses. Of them PWs.10 and 12 are the doctors and examined the victim and PW. 11 investigated the case and submitted charge-sheet accusing accused.<br/> <br/><em>W</em><em>e should bear in mind, credibility of testimony oral and circumstantial, depends considerably on a judicial evaluation of the totality, not isolated scrutiny. When dealing with the serious question of guilt or innocence of persons charged with crime, the following principles should be taken into consideration. </em></div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The onus of proving everything essential to the establishment of the charge against the accused lies on the prosecutor.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The evidence must be such asto exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>In matters of doubt it is safer to acquit than to condemn, for it is better that several guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person suffer.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>There must be clear and unequivocal proof of the corpus delicit.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The hypothesis of delinquency should be consistent with all the facts proved.</em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>Inspite of the presumption of truth attached to oral evidence under oath if the Court is not satisfied, the evidence inspite of oath is of no avail. </em><br/><br/>It appears that the prosecution case absolutely rest upon the evidence of PW. 2 Sufia Begum. She stated that on 06-04-1996 at about 9:00 p.m. she came out from her dwelling hut for natural call and sat under a date-tree north east of their hut. Then accused Ibrahim hurled acid upon her from back causing burning injuries her chest, face, back and shoulder. She recognised the accused by the moon-light and voice. On her alarm her mother-in-law and uncle-in-law aswellas the other locals rushed there to whom she disclosed about the facts. She further stated that her husband Arju Mia married one Fatema as second wife, who could not reside at her conjugal home due to resistance made by her.<br/><br/>In cross-examination she stated that at the first instance her husband did not come rather he came after some-time. Other witnesses namely PW.1, PWs. 3-8 were examined to corroborate the  evidence of PW. 2. We find that PW.2 asserted that she recognised the accused by moon-light but PW. 3 Arju Mia, PW.7 Momena Khatun categorically stated in the cross-examination that at the night of occurrence there was dark. Therefore recognition of accused Ibrahim by the moon-light was not corroborated by the vital witnesses.<br/><br/>Moreover, the victim Sufia Begum sat under a date-tree at 9:p.m. and it was alleged that the accused Ibrahim hurled acid from back. So in our view the recognition of accused Ibrahim was improbable, speculative and of an uncertain character. Therefore, we failed to discover that the evidence of solitary witness PW. 2 furnish any corroboration by any other independent or impartial evidence.<br/><br/>The word "corroboration " is derived from the Latin word " robust" meaning "strength". It means strengthening or confirming something. There is no Rule of practice that there must in every case be corroboration before a conviction. The Rule of corroboration is a Rule of Prudence which looks for some corroboration, either direct or circumstantial or both connecting the person indicated for commission of crime imposing penalty upon him. Corroboration of the testimony of a solitary witness as a Rule of Prudence is normally demanded for the satisfaction of the Court that the testimony has a ring of truth around it and the person arraigned of the offence has not been falsely implicated.<br/><br/>Where the evidence of the victim PW.2, Sufia Begum forms the only witness on which the Court has to act upon. It is absolutely necessary for the interest of justice that at least the victim’s statement must be inconformity with the probability and in a case like this the evidence of solitary witness calls for corroboration as a Rule of prudence. It is pertinent to point out that such corroboration is absent in this case.<br/>It is pertinent to point out that the occurrence of the instance case took place on 06-04-1996 but the first information report was lodged on 14-06-1996. PW. 1 the Investigating Officer visited the P.O. for the first time on 15-04-1996. He categorically stated that on 23-04-1996, 30-04-1996, 16-05-1996, 24-05-1996, 01-06-1996 he visited the P.O. but no witness happened there for his examination under Section 161 of the Code. Therefore, he examined PW. 2, PW. 3, PW. 4, PW. 5, PW. 8 on 21-07-1996, 08-06-1996, 27-07-1996, 02-08-1996, 02-08-1996 respectively. So in our view inordinate delay in recording the statements of the witnesses by the investigating Officer under Section 161 of the  Code renders their evidence shaky.<br/><br/>In the case of Bangladesh (State) Vs. Paran Chandra Baroi 1986 BCR(AD)225  held:<br/>“<em>The long delay in examining the material witnesses cast a doubt on the whole prosecution case.”</em><br/> <br/>In the case of Vijaybhai Bhanabhai Patel Vs. Navnitbhai Nathubhai Patel and ors. 2004 Criminal 413 Supreme Court of India held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>The delay in questioning the witnesses by investigating officer is a serious mistake on the part of the prosecution. So the witnesses are not reliable.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of State Vs. Al Hasib Bin Jamal alias Hasib and five others 59 DLR 653 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>   “<em>Inordinate delay in examining the important prosecution witnesses casts a serious doubt as to the truth of the prosecution case and in the circumstances their evidence cannot be relied on and are to be left out of consideration.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Even then there are serious contra-dictions of the statements of witnesses to the Investigating Officer and testimony before the Court which makes their evidence unreliable. In the case of Abul Kalam Azad alias Ripon (Md) Vs. State 58 DLR(AD) 26 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>When witness is contradicted by a statement recorded by the Police in the course of investigation the only effect that it can have is to reduce the evidentiary value of his testimony in Court and make the witness unreliable on the point on which he is so contradicted.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><em>In the case of Sanwar Hossain Vs. State 45 DLR-489 it was held inordinate delay in examining the important prosecution witnesses casts a serious doubt as to the truth of the prosecution case and in the circumstances their evidence cannot be relied on and are to be left out of consideration. In the case of Bangladesh Vs. Paran Chandra Baroi, 1986 BCR(AD) 225 it was held that the long delay in examining the material witnesses casts a doubt on the whole prosecution case. In the case of Muslimuddin and others Vs. State, 38 DLR (AD)311 evidence of P.W. 3 who claimed to have recognised the assailants was not relied upon as her statement, which could have been recorded on the day following the incident, was recorded after 34 days. Same view was taken in the cases of Haji Md. Jamal uddin  Hossain and others Vs. State, 1994 BLD-33, State Vs. Mokbul Hossain, 1986 BLD 34=37 DLR 156, Nurul Haque Vs. State,1982 BCR 332, Moinullah and another Vs. State,1988 BLD 100=40 DLR 443 and State Vs. Babul Hossain, 52 DLR-400. In view of the above settled principle of law the evidence of P.W. 2, should not be relied upon and the same is to be left out of consideration.</em><br/> <br/>Moreover, it is the definite case of the prosecution that there was an internal feud between the parties and when there is a background of enmity and the witnesses are chance witnesses and not natural witnesses and further natural and independent witness were not produced, it is unsafe to rely on the evidence of chance witnesses to make a nexus between the accused and the crime. So we hold that there is no cogent, convincing and unimpeachable evidence on record to prove the complicity of the accused with the crime of throwing acid. Prosecution utterly failed to bring home guilt to the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<br/> <br/>It is true that crime like acid throwing is shocking in nature and also, revolting. The Crime is against Society and humanity, but the prosecution convicted the accused merely on suspicion that the accused committed such crime. There cannot be conviction for such crime on mere suspicion or presumption. The commission of murder must be proved. The presumption cannot take the place of positive evidence, (1970 P. Crl. L.J.-166).<br/> <br/>It further appears to us that the Court below without any legal evidence convicted the accused in moral view. Legal evidence in a criminal trial is the evidence of the incrimin-ating facts and circumstances of involvement of the accused in the commission of offence inevitable pointing to their guilty as the perpetrators incompatible with the plea of their innocence. In view of the proved facts and circumstances of the present case which do not constitute any legal evidence moral conviction should not be substituted in place of the legal evidence.<br/> <br/>The accused was convicted merely on suspicion without any legal evidence. To that end in view, law is now well settled that suspicion or doubt however strong it might be cannot take place of evidence or there be slightest doubt asto the involvement of the accused in the crime, he cannot be convicted. With this regard reliance are being placed in the cases of Abdul Haq and others  Vs. The State 14 BLT 485, Fazu alias Fazlur Rahman Vs. The State 1 BLC 558, Rekatfullah Vs. The State 13 DLR-750. It is further held in the case reported in AIR 1921(PC)69, that the decision of the Court must rest upon legal ground established by legal testimony from the prosecution.<br/> <br/>Moreso in all respect, the convict is also entitled to benefit of doubt. In the case of Safder Ali Vs. Crown 5 DLR(FC) 107 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>In a criminal case, it is the duty of the Court to review the entire evidence that has been produced by the prosecution and the defence. If, after an examination of the whole evidence, the Court is of the opinion that there is a reasonable possibility that the defence put forward by the accused might be true, it is clear that such a view reacts on the whole prosecution case. In these circumstances, the accused is entitled to benefit of doubt, not as a matter of grace, but as of right, because the prosecution has not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>So, there is no cogent, convincing and unimpeachable evidence on record to prove the complicity of the accused with the crime. Prosecution utterly failed to bring home guilt to the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<br/> <br/>Moreover, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence in its entirety is not well founded in the facts and circumst-ances of the case. Therefore, the submissions advanced by the learned Counsel for the defence prevails and appears to have a good deal of force. On the contrary we have gone through the decisions as referred by the  learned Deputy Attorney General. The facts leading to those cases are distinguishable to that of the instant case. So the same have no manner of application in the instant case. In such circumstances we are also unable to accept her submissions.<br/><br/>In the light of discussions made above and the preponderant judicial views emerging out of the authorities refer to above, we are of the view that the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 30-01-2000 suffers from legal infirmities which calls for interference by this Court. Thus the appeal having merit succeeds.<br/><br/>In view of foregoing narrative the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 30-01-2000 passed by learned Judge of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishes Adalat, Narshingdi, in Nari-O-Shishu Case no. 27 of 1998 is hereby set aside.<br/><br/>The convict appellant is acquitted from the charge. Let the appellant Ibrahim be set at liberty if not detained in any other case.<br/><br/>The Office is directed to send down the records at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><hr/><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"> </div></div></div></div>

Ashfaqul Islam, J:</span></u></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt"> At the instance of the petitioner Mrs. Mohsina Rahman, Chairman, Meghna Insurance Co. Ltd. this Rule was issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the impugned C.I.B. (Credit Information Bureau) report maintained by the Office of the respondent Nos. 2-6 illegally treating the petitioner as a loan defaulter under Borroweer Code No. 161447 should not be declared to have been made without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt"> The back ground leading to the issuance of the Rule, in short, is that the petitioner is the chairman, Meghna Insurance Co. Ltd. and operating her business for a long time with wide reputation. On 21.05.2003, the respondent No. 7, Industrial Promotion and Development company Limited (IPDC), vide its letter No. IPDC/BHL/2003/393 offered a lease finance facility of Tk. 5.00 crore to the respondent No. 9, Brighton Hospital &amp; Diagnostic Center (Pvt.) Ltd. for procurement of MRI machine for its diagnostic centre. According to the aforesaid offer of  the respondent No.7, the respondent No. 9 need to have personal guarantee from the petitioner to obtain the aforesaid loan facility, and the Managing Director of the respondent No.9  Company being a close relative of the petitioner took the signature of the petitioner on the form of a personal guarantee dated 23.07.2003 by misrepresenting facts and accordingly the respondent No. 9 availed of the loan facility for Tk. 5.00 crore from the respondent No.7.  </span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Subsequently when the petitioner came to know the real picture, she raised objection to the Managing Director of the respondent No.9 and the respondent No. 7. Mr. Sabir Ahmed chowdhury, father of the petitioner came forward to settle the matter with the respondent No.7 and the respondent No.9 and following negotiation between them, he offered a fresh personal guarantee to secure the loan of the respondent No.9 on condition that the respondent No.7 shall cancel, return and release the personal guarantee obtained from the petitioner. Accordingly, the respondent No.7 received the fresh personal guarantee given by Mr. Sabir Ahmed Chowdhury but unfortunately, the respondent No. 7 did not as yet release the personal guarantee obtained from the petitioner inspite of repeated request.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Thereafter on 01.04.2004 the respondent No.7 offered another lease finance facility to the respondent No.9 for an additional amount of Tk. 4.00 crore vide its letter under memo No. IPDC/BHL/2004/319 dated 01.04.2004. By completing all formalities the respondent No.9 availed of the aforesaid loan facility from the respondent No.7. Thereafter vide a letter dated 24.06.2004, the respondent No.7 confirmed an arrangement of funding of Tk. 11.00 crore in addition to previous loan amount of Tk. 9.00 crore to the respondent No. 9, the respondent No.7 also confirmed that the collateral securities mentioned in the said letter will cover the total financial facilities of Tk. 20.00 crore including Tk. 9.00 crore which has already been disbursed in favour of the respondent No.9 who agreed to mortgage some properties in favour of Shahjalal Islami Bank Limited and on 17.08.2005 vide a letter respondent No.7, confirm the respondent No.9, to consider releasing the personal guarantee of the petitioner. On 05.04.2006 the petitioner served a legal notice upon the respondent No.7 to cancel the personal guarantee of the petitioner which the respondent No.7 regretted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt"> The petitioner thereafter prayed for loan to a financial institution namely Prime Finance &amp; Investment Ltd. and Bangladesh Commerce Bank Limited but they regretted the prayer of the petitioner on the ground that, the name of the petitioner has been enlisted as </span><strong><span style="font-family:sutonnybanglamj; font-size:11.0pt">Ò‡Ljvcx FY MÖnxZvÓ</span></strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt"> </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">in the list of the Credit Information Bureau (CIB). The information is surprising for the petitioner. To the best of the petitioner’s knowledge she is not a defaulter borrower of any bank or financial institution. Having known about the aforesaid information the petitioner on 15.02.2011 served a Legal Notice to the respondent Nos. 2-6 with a demand to supply an authenticated copy of CIB list of defaulters showing the petitioner as a</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"> </span><strong><span style="font-family:sutonnybanglamj; font-size:11.0pt">Ò‡Ljvcx FY MÖnxZvÓ</span></strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt"> </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">along with the name of the reporter and all particulars of the report by 10.00 a.m. Sunday, 20.02.2011either to the petitioner or to her learned advocate, but the respondents did not yet responded against the said Legal Notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">The petitioner thereafter obtained authentic information regarding the inclusion of her name in the CIB report, where she found that under Borrower Code No. 161447 her name has been listed as defaulter against loan taken by the respondent No. 9. Then on 22.02.2011 the petitioner served a Notice demanding Justice upon the respondent Nos. 2-6 to delete her name from the said report as she was not a loan defaulter. After receiving the aforesaid notice the respondent No. 2-6 not yet informed the petitioner or her lawyer that they have deleted the name of the petitioner from the said report (Annexure-J).</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">By annexure-K a letter dated 22.02.2011 the Bangladesh Commerce Bank Limited also informed the petitioner that her name has been enlisted as loan defaulter</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"> </span><strong><span style="font-family:sutonnybanglamj; font-size:11.0pt">Ò‡Ljvcx FY MÖnxZvÓ</span></strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt"> </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">as against the personal guarantee of the respondent No.9 BHDCL. At this stage the petitioner moved this Division and obtained the present Rule. </span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt"> Mr. Qumrul Haque Siddique the learned advocate appearing on</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"> </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">behalf of the petitioner after placing the petition and the relevant laws on the issue mainly submits that the impugned CIB list maintained by the office of the respondent Nos. 2-6 showing the petitioner as a loan defaulter is absolutely wrong since the same has been done upon misinterpretation and misconception of section 5(GaGa) of the Bank Companies Act, 1991. He submits that the definition of </span><strong><span style="font-family:sutonnybanglamj; font-size:11.0pt">Ò‡Ljvcx FY MÖnxZvÓ</span></strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt"> </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">as envisaged in section 5 (GAGA) if read with section 27 (KA KA) of the Act contemplates that a guarantor is not included in that definition.

Bangladesh Bank and other 1 law guardian 343 and a decision of full a Court Quazi Naibul Hasan Vs. Bangladesh Bank 61 DLR 96 and all these decisions unequivocally held that the definition of defaulter in section 5 (GAGA) of the Act, does not include a guarantor.  He has also brought to our notice a contra decision on the point held in the case of IFIC Bank Vs.

Nawab Ali, Advocate-on-Record.<br/><strong>For the Respondent:</strong> Not represented.</div><br/><strong>Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 479 of 2011</strong><br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></span></div><u><strong>Nazmun Ara Sultana, J.</strong></u><br/> <div style="text-align: justify;">This Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal, at the instance of the convicted accused persons, is directed against the judgment and order dated 18.08.2011 passed by the High Court Division in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.21816 of 2009 making the rule absolute in part.<br/><br/>The above mentioned Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.21816 of 2009 was started on an application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure filed by the present accused leave-petitioners praying for quashment of the judgment and order dated 01.07.2009 passed by the Druto Bichar Tribunal, Sylhet in Druto Bchar (Sessions) Case No.03 of 2008 arising out of G.R. Case No.23 of 2006 corresponding to Chhatak Police Station Case No.04 dated 10.02.2006 convicting the accused-petitioners Rajibullah and Tazuddin under sections 148/449/326/ 385/302/34 of the Penal Code and sentencing them to 3 years rigorous imprisonment with fine of Tk.2,000/-, in default, to suffer 2 months rigorous imprisonment more under section 148 of the Penal Code, sentencing them to 7 years rigorous imprisonment with fine of Tk.3,000/-, in default, to suffer 4 months rigorous imprisonment more under section 449 of the Penal Code, 5 years rigorous imprisonment under section 385 of the Penal Code, 7 years rigorous imprisonment with fine of Tk.3,000/-, in default, to suffer 5 months rigorous imprisonment under section 326 of the Penal Code and also sentencing them to imprisonment for life with fine of Tk.10,000/-, in default, to suffer 6 months rigorous imprisonment under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>The prosecution case, in short, was that the informant Manik Mia was a grocer at Moinpur Bazar. The accused Rajibullah, Tazuddin, Jwel, Saiful, Salam, Nazir, Nizam and others used to put pressure on Manik Mia on demand of “Chanda” and also threatened him to kill his wife if their demand was not met. That all the accused persons forming unlawful assembly demanded Tk.10,000/- from Manik Mia just before one week of the occurrence. That in the night flowing 07.02.2006 at about 2.00 A.M. the accused persons started to untie the tin of the roof of the hut of Manik Mia and getting that sound, Manik Mia came out of his hut and his wife deceased Rokeya Begum also came out and started hue and cry. Manik Mia saw the accused persons by his torch light. In that situation the accused persons attacked Manik Mia and his wife. Accused Rajibullah inflicted a dao blow on the shoulder of Manik Mia, accused Tazuddin inflicted a dagger blow on the left elbow of Manik Mia causing injuries. Rokeya Begum, the wife of Manik Mia came forward to save her husband and then accused Rajibullah, Tazuddin and other accused persons started to assault her wife and dragged her under a jackfruit tree in their yard and assaulted her indiscriminately and twisted her neck. At their hue and cry the neighbouring people came and saw the occurrence. Both the informant Manik Mia and his wife Rokeya Begum were treated by doctor and ultimately Rokeya Begum succumbed to her injuries on 21.03.2006. The informant lodged an ejher with Chatak Police Station against the accused persons. The police, after completion of investigation, submitted charge sheet against the accused persons under sections 449/323/ 325/326/307/385/302/34 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>The trial court framed charges under sections 148/449/326/385/302/34 of the Penal Code against the present accused-leave-petitioner and others. Ultimately after completion of trial the trial court convicted and sentenced these 2 accused-petitioners only as aforesaid with a direction that all sentences would run concurrently. The trial court found the other 8 accused persons not guilty and acquitted then of all the charges by the judgment and order dated 01.07.2009. <br/><br/>These 2 convicted accused-petitioners though were in jail custody, but they failed to prefer any appeal against the impugned judgment and order within the prescribe time and as such they filed the above mentioned application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure praying for quashment of their conviction and sentence and obtained a rule. Ultimately a Division Bench of the High Court Division, after hearing the learned Counsel of both the sides and on examination of the evidence on record made that rule absolute in part quashing the conviction and sentences of the accused-petitioners under sections 148/449/385 and 326 of the Penal Code only. The High Court Division upheld the conviction and sentences of these accused-leave-petitioners under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code making observations thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“From a bare reading of the evidence of the eye-witnesses, namely, the P.W.1 Manik Mia, the P.W.7 Tofail Ahmed Tuhin and the P.W.8 Md. Tarke Ahmed together with the evidence of the P.W.12 Dr. Abul Mansur and the P.W.13 Dr. Himangshu Lal Roy, it cannot be said by any stretch of imagination that it is a case of no legal evidence. Assuming for the sake of argument that the evidence of those prosecution witnesses is unreliable or shaky or slender that cannot be a ground for quashing the conviction of the petitioners in this proceeding under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”<br/>“......... this court not being the court of appeal cannot sift or re-asses or re-evaluate the prosecution evidence on record and arrived at its own findings.”</em></div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Mr. A. K. M. Foyez, the learned Advocate for the accused-leave-petitioners though has made some submissions, but he could not assail the above quoted observation and findings of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>We find no wrong or infirmity in the above observations and findings of the High Court Division. In a proceeding under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure praying for quashment of a judgment and order of conviction and sentence there is no scope for re-assessment of the evidence on record. The inherent power conferred by section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure may be exercised to quash a proceeding or even a conviction and sentence on conclusion of trial if the court concerned had no jurisdiction to hold the said trial or the facts alleged against the accused do not constitute any criminal offence or the conviction has been based on no evidence or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.<br/><br/>We have examined the impugned judgment of the High Court Division and also that of the trial court. We also find no ground for quashing the conviction and sentence of the leave-petitioners under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><br/>We find no merit in this Criminal Petition for  Leave to appeal and hence it is dismissed.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Abdul Wahhab Miah, J:</u></strong><br/><br/>This appeal, by leave, at the instance of the writ-respondents, is from the judgment and order dated the 12<sup>th</sup> day of December, 2000 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.3497 of 1998 making the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>Facts giving rise to the appeal are that the sole respondent as petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the writ-petitioner) filed the writ petition before the High Court Division praying for the principal relief being as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“A) Issue Rule Nisi upon the Respondents to show cause as to why the impugned orders dated 1-7-90 (Annexure-C) and order dated 13-1-98 (Annexure-D) passed by the Bank Authority dismissing the petitioner should not be declared to have been passed without any lawful authority and of no legal effect and accordingly Rule was issued.” (The other prayers made in the writ petition being ancillary in nature are not quoted).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The case of the writ-petitioner as made out in the writ petition was that he was appointed as Junior Officer in Janata Bank (hereinafter referred to as the Bank) on 16.02.1978 and in course of time, was promoted to the post of Branch Manager and lastly was posted at Kagmari Branch, District-Tangail. While the writ-petitioner was serving at Kagmari, he was placed under suspension with effect from 18.12.1987 on the charge of defalcation of taka 22 lac and a criminal case was started against him. The writ-petitioner was arrested by the police on 24.12.1997. The Bank also instituted Money Suit Nos.22 of 1988 and 23 of 1988 against the writ-petitioner for realization of the said money alleged to have been defalcated by him. Criminal case being Tangail Police Station Case No.5 dated 24.12.1987 was investigated by the District Anti-Corruption Officer, Tangail who submitted final report on 31.03.1991 as no charge of misappropriation of the Bank money was established against the writ-petitioner. Money Suit No.22 of 1988 was dismissed on contest on 12.03.1997 against which the Bank filed First Appeal No.244 of 1997 which is pending, Money Suit No.23 of 1988 is still pending in the Court of the Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) and Artha Rin Adalat, Tangail. In the meantime, the Bank dismissed the writ-petitioner from his service vide the letter dated 01.07.1990. The writ-petitioner on 26.08.1997 submitted written representation to the Chairman of the Bank (writ-respondent No.1), appellant No.1 herein to review the decision of his dismissal, but that was turned down and was informed to him by the letter dated 13.01.1998. In the circumstances, the writ-petitioner filed the writ petition for the relief as quoted hereinbefore.<br/> <br/>Janata Bank contested the Rule by filing affidavit-in-opposition contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the writ jurisdiction was not available to the writ-petitioner, he should have rather gone before the Administrative Tribunal to vindicate his grievances, if any.<br/> <br/>On hearing the  Rule, a Division Bench of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order made the Rule absolute declaring the impugned orders to have been passed without lawful authority and were of no legal effect and also directed the writ-respondents, appellants herein to restore the writ-petitioner <em>“to his service position as was on the date of his dismissal from that service with all the benefits which he is entitled to get under the service with all the benefits which he is entitled to get under the service rules.”</em> <br/> <br/>Against the judgment and order of the High Court Division, the appellants filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.484 of 2001 before this Division. Leave was granted on 16.04.2002 to consider ground Nos.I and VII of the leave petition which are as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“I. Because the . . . High Court Division failed to take into consideration that rule 49 of Janata Bank Employees Service Regulations, 1995 did not apply to the petitioner-respondent who was dismissed long before the said Regulations came into operation and that Janata Bank Employees Service Regulation, 1981 which applied to the petitioner-respondent did not contain provisions equivalent to rule 49 of Janata Bank Employees Services Regulations, 1995.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">VII. Because the ... High Court Division failed to consider that the matter in issue was exclusively within the jurisdiction of Administrative Tribunal.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Mr. Khaled Ahmed, learned Advocate, appearing for the appellants, has canvassed the two grounds quoted above on which leave was granted.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Aftab Hossain, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing for the writ-petitioner-respondent tried to justify the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>From the affidavit-in-opposition filed on behalf of Janata Bank as well as the impugned judgment and order, it is <em>prima-facie</em> clear that specific objection was taken by the writ-respondents to the effect that the writ petition was <em>“incompetent and the writ-petitioner ought to have sought relief before the Administrative Tribunal”</em> and in support of that objection the case of Mujibur Rahman(Md.)-Vs-Government of Bangladesh and others 44 DLR (AD) (1992) 111 was relied upon, but the High Court Division discarded the said objection on the view that the writ petition was <em>“not against an order of dismissal from service simpliciter. Herein the petitioner challenges the impugned order on the ground that the order itself is per se without any lawful authority being violative of the Service Rules. We, therefore, find that the writ jurisdiction is not ousted in the instant case. The point raised by the petitioner as to the illegality of the impugned order has not been challenged seriously by the learned Advocate for the respondent-bank.”</em><br/> <br/>Let us see whether the High Court Division was correct in overthrowing the objection of the respondent-Bank on the view as quoted hereinbefore.<br/> <br/>From the prayer made in the writ petition (prayer has been quoted hereinbefore), it is crystal clear that the writ-petitioner challenged two orders as contained in annexures-‘C’ and ‘D’ passed by the respondent-Bank. By annexure-‘C’, the writ-petitioner was dismissed from the service of the Bank and by annexure-‘D’, his prayer to reconsider the order of dismissal passed against him was rejected. This will be further clear if we have a look at annexures-‘C’ and ‘D’ which read as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>জনতা ব্যাংক</strong><br/><strong>১১০, মতিঝিল বাণিজ্যিক এলাকা, ঢাকা ১০০০, বাংলাদেশ</strong><br/><strong>পি|ও|বক্ম নংঃ ৪৬৮, কেবলঃ জনতা ব্যাংক, টেলেক্ম ৬৫৮৪০ জেবিডি বিজে</strong><br/><strong>ফোনঃ ২৪০০০০, ২৪০০২৭-৩০, ২৪০০৪২-৪৫</strong></div><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:justify;

From annexure-‘D’ it is also clear that after dismissal from service, the writ-petitioner filed two appeals–first one on 05.09.1990 and 14.11.1991 and the second one on 27.07.1993–which were rejected on 18.06.1992 and 03.10.1993 respectively and then after a gap of 5(five) years from the first rejection and four years from the second rejection, third application for review was filed on 27.08.1997 and after rejection of the same on 13.01.1998, the writ petition was filed. Thus it is clear that the writ-petitioner, in fact, challenged or called in question the order of dismissal from his service and as such, the only forum that was available to him ventilating his grievances against such dismissal was the Administrative Tribunal under section 4 read with section 2(aa) of the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980(the Act, 1980) in view of the provisions of article 117(2) of the Constitution. In the context, it may be stated that Janata Bank was included in the schedule to the Act, 1980 with effect from 18.04.1988.<br/> <br/>The High Court Division observed that “<em>the order itself is per see without any lawful authority being violative of the Service Rules.”</em> But it failed to consider that the Administrative Tribunal had all the jurisdiction to see the propriety of the order of dismissal even if the same was passed violating any of the provisions of the Service Rules of the Bank or any fundamental rights as guaranteed in Part-III of the Constitution. Admittedly, vires of any provisions of the Service Rules of the Bank under which the writ-petitioner was dismissed, was not challenged in the writ petition. We have also perused the grounds taken in the writ petition. From the grounds, it does not appear that any ground was taken touching the vires of any of the provisions of the Service Rules of the Bank. Therefore, the argument put forward by the High Court Division in rejecting the objection taken by the learned Advocate, who appeared for the Bank as to the maintainability of the writ petition, <em>prima facie</em> appears to us fallacious and the result of non application of the judicial mind. When a decision of this Division was referred to by the learned Advocate for the Bank in support of his contention that the writ petition was not maintainable and that the writ-petitioner ought to have gone to the Administrative Tribunal how the High Court Division could make the observation that the point raised by the writ-petitioner as to the illegality of the impugned order was not challenged seriously by him. It appears to us that the High Court Division totally misconceived the orders impugned in the writ petition and also the principle of law laid down in the case of Mujibur Rahman (MD) (Supra). In that case, this Division in unequivocal language held that the Administrative Tribunal can strike down an order for violation of the principles of natural justice as well as for infringement of fundamental rights, guaranteed by the Constitution, or of any other law, in respect of matters relating to or arising of sub-clause (a), but such Tribunals cannot, like the Indian Administrative Tribunals, in exercise of a more comprehensive jurisdiction under article 323A, strike down any law or rule on the ground of its constitutionality. A person in the service of the Republic, who intends to invoke fundamental right for challenging the vires of a law, will seek his remedy under article 102(1), but in all other cases, he will be required to seek remedy under article 117(2) of the Constitution. The law laid down in that case is being followed consistently and there has been no deviation. So, the writ petition filed by the writ-petitioner was not maintainable in law and the Rule issued in the writ petition ought to have been discharged on that ground alone.  <br/> <br/>It also appears that the High Court Division totally failed to consider a broad fact that although the writ-petitioner was dismissed from service as back as on 01.07.1990 and his appeal and application for review were rejected twice on 18.06.1992 and 13.10.1993 respectively, again he filed a 3<sup>rd</sup> review application, which being rejected on 13.01.1998‒he filed the writ petition in 1998 (affidavits in support of the writ petition was sworn on 25.02.1998), i.e. after long 5(five) years and 6(six) months from the date of rejection of his appeal on 18.06.1992. This was nothing but a contrivance to invoke the power of judicial review of the High Court Division having not availed the statutory forum under section 4 of the Act, 1980.<br/> <br/>The High Court Division also made another fundamental mistake in taking cognizance of the objection taken by the writ-petitioner in his writ petition that the order of dismissal from service was illegal as the same was passed during the pendency of the criminal case filed against him by the Bank in violation of rule 49 of Janata Bank Service Rules, 1995, which has provided that an employee of the Bank cannot be dismissed from service pending disposal of a criminal case, inasmuch as the Service Rules, 1995 had no existence when the writ-petitioner was dismissed from his service on 10.07.1990. The writ-petitioner having been dismissed from service on 01.07.1990, ceased to be an employee of Janata Bank on and from that date. Not only his appeal against such dismissal and but also the applications for review were rejected on 18.06.1992 and 03.10.1993 respectively. Therefore, shelter under rule 49 of the Service Rules, 1995 could, in no way, be taken to strike down the dismissal order passed against the writ-petitioner. It needs to be kept on record that at the relevant time, there was no bar in dismissing an employee of the Bank pending disposal of a criminal case. <br/> <br/>For the discussions made above, we find merit in the appeal and accordingly, the same is allowed. There will be no order as to costs. The impugned judgment and order is set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
