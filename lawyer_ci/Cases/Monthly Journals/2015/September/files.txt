Any dispute between buyer and seller is to be settled between them in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract of sale. If the buyer suffers in any way, he can file suit for damages. But at the same time in all these  decisions it has also been manifested that only exception to such  general statement of principle  i.e. recognized by a court of law is obvious and clear case of fraud brought to the knowledge of the L/C issuing bank. However, mere allegation of fraud is not sufficient to entitle the issuing bank to withhold payments. It must be found that the draft/ documents submitted for payment must be tainted by real fraud. When that can be established only in that case payment can be refused by the issuing bank. . . .

We hold that it is absolutely an “advance” taken by the customer within the meaning of section 2 of the Artha Rin Ain, 2003 that defines advance as a loan and therefore, attracts section 5 (GAGA) of the Bank Company Act and for that reason inclusion of the names of the petitioners in the list of CIB is justified.  . . .

Ashfaqul Islam, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>All these Writ petitions are taken up together and disposed of by a single judgment as there involved common question of fact and law.<br/><br/>In Writ Petition Nos. 1529 of 2013, 11229 of 2013, 866 of 2013, 867 of 2013 and 16322 of 2012 Rule was issued calling upon the respondents  to show cause as to why a direction should not be given upon the respondents to pay the outstanding bill along with over due interest of the petitioners.<br/><br/>In Writ Petition Nos. 609 of 2013, 610 of 2013 and 4045 of 2013 Rule was issued challenging the enlistment of the names of the petitioners in the CIB list of its Credit Information Bureau as loan defaulter to be illegal and a direction was sought for the enlistment should be declared to have been done without lawful authority having no legal effect.<br/><br/>In rest of the Writ Petitions i.e. Nos. 16323 of 2012, 16380 of 2012, 16381 of 2012, 16383 of 2012, 16384 of 2012, 2665 of 2013, 235 of 2013, 237 of 2013, 16385 of 2012,16386 of 2012, 16382 of 2012, 2664 of 2013, 2670 of 2013 and 16387 of 2012 Rule was issued in both the terms as aforesaid.<br/><br/>Broadly the facts are almost similar in all the petition bereft of the particulars of the parties (petitioners and respondents) and their position in the cause title.<br/><br/>For the sake of convenience and brevity we would first take up Writ Petition No. 1529 of 2013. The background leading to the Petition is that the petitioner Company Alvi Spinning Mills Ltd. has been running on its business with reputation in respect of trading and import and export, and attracted several companies who became interested to purchase textile and garments products from the petitioner through their several Letter of Credits and accordingly the petitioner accepted the Letter of Credit issued by the Sonali Bank Limited, Hotel Sherton (now Rupashi Bangla) Corporate Branch and supplied the product    through Agrani Bank Limited, BWAPDA Branch, Motijheel, Dhaka  and also Al-Arafa Bank Jatrabari Branch who are the Negotiating Bank. Respondent No.8 Sonali Bank Hotel Sheraton Branch (Now Rupashi Bangla)  is the L/C. issuing Bank. It has been stated that after accepting the export Bills from Respondent No.11 Agrani Bank Limited, the negotiating Bank, 42 Export Bills were accepted by the Sonali Bank. Upon accepting those over due bills amounting to U.S.$ 52,11,000 the respondent No.8 Sonali Bank is under an obligation to make payment through Respondent No.11 Agrani Bank and also Respondent No.12 Al Arafa Islami Bank to the petitioner. But instead of releasing the same in favour of the petitioner it has been held up by the Sonali Bnak. It is at this stage the petitioner moved this Division asking for a direction upon the respondents to pay the over due bills along with over due interest of the petitioner through respondent Agrani Bank and Al Arafa Islami Bank and obtained the present Rule.<br/><br/>In Writ Petition No. 609 of 2013 the Rule was issued in the following terms:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Let a Rule Nisi be issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the action of the respondent No. 1 and 2 enlisting the name of the petitioner in the CIB list of its Credit Information Bureau as a loan defaulter should not be declared to have been done without any lawful authority and is of no legal effect.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Mr. A.F.  Hasan Arif, the learned Senior Advocate has appeared in Writ Petition No. 1529 of 2013 and in all other Writ Petitions Mr. Mainul Hossein the learned Senior Advocate appeared for the petitioners. Both of them argued unequivocally that the petitioner, who supplied fabrics and yarns through the negotiating Bank, approached the above branches of Sonali Bank Ltd. for issuing necessary certificate and acceptance that whether the shipping documents in all these transactions namely, L/Cs, Delivery Challan, Bills of Exchange etc. were genuine and valid. The above branch of respondent-Sonali Bank Ltd., in turn issued certificate and acceptance in favour of the negotiating banks of the petitioners saying that the shipping documents were all genuine and valid and the sale proceeds would be paid by the date of maturity.<br/><br/>Their further submission is that the payment has to be made on  the documents supplied to L/C opening Bank  (namely respondents Sonali Bank by the negotiating Bank  Agrani Bank (Agargoan Branch) as per   international customs   having the force of law, i,e, UCPDC-600 (2007 Revision). L/C is an independent contract and not qualified by the original contract of sale though it is based on it and in the cases in hand since the L/C issuing bank, (Sonali Bank) found no discrepancy in the documents supplied by the sellers bank and moreover, Sonali Bank confirmed payment by advising the  date of maturity, there is no scope further to stop the payment as such. It has been also contented that Sonali Bank is a statutory  public  authority  as per Article  152 of the Constitution as well as local authority defined under section 2(27) of the General Clauses Act, 1897. Besides, UCPDC-600 has the force of law as defined by Article  152 of the Constitution. Consequently they have also argued that whatever the allegation may be made against   the  buyer or the seller outside the contract of L/C has no relevance for  the obligations under the L/C. The remedies are available elsewhere, but L/C must be honoured only on the basis of L/C related documents.<br/><br/>They further contended that there is no allegation of fraud or forgery in respect of documents supplied by the banks of the sellers. Internal irregularities of the bank also will not affect payment under the L/C. <u>Only vague allegations of fraud</u> against L/C issuing forgery about document supplied by buyers for securing L/Cs are not relevant for the payment under the L/Cs to the negotiating bank. They went on submitting that in respect of payment by the Sonali Bank principle of estoppel shall also operate and the bank is stopped from denying payment in as much as the negotiating bank of the seller acted in buying document on the confirmation made by the respondent Sonali Bank.<br/><br/>In support of the Rule in Writ Petition No. 1529 of 2013  i.e. withholding of payment by the Sonali Bank Mr. Mainul Hosein cited some authorities :-   Uttara Bank Vs. Macneill and Kilbon Ltd. and others  33 DLR (AD) 298, Zyta Garments Ltd. Vs. Union Bank 55 DLR (AD) 56. , Gujrat  State Financial Company Vs. M/s Lotus Hotel  Pvt. Ltd. AIR 1983 (SC) 848 and also Standard Bank Ltd. Vs.  Tripost  Engineering and Training Company  (GD) and others 56 DLR 55. All these decisions have been focused on the settled proposition of law that when an irrecoverable   Letter of Credit is open and confirmed by a bank such bank is left with no option but to honour its obligation under the Letter of Credit and pay.<br/><br/>As it has been submitted that UCPDC-600 through several article has also fortified the said proposition of law as discussed above.<br/><br/>In respect of Writ Petition No. 609 of 2013 which concerns with the illegal enlistment of the petitioners’ name in the CIB list,  Mr. Mainul Hosein submits that the petitioners are neither loanee nor borrowers  as the claim being for “sale proceed” on receipt of document of title. As no credit limit was sanctioned by the negotiating bank, only by purchase of document of title the petitioners automatically do not become borrowers under Article  42 of the Bangladesh Bank Order  1972.<br/><br/>The respondent  Sonali Bank Ltd. in some cases paid 70% and in some  cases even 90% of the ‘sale proceeds’  in advance and purchased the relevant shipping documents namely, L/Cs, Delivery Challan, Bills of Exchange etc. from the petitioners. The said negotiating Banks thereafter obtained sale proceeds from Sonali Bank Ltd. in some cases and failed to receive the sale proceeds in other cases. Hence, the negotiating Bank of the petitioners requested for payment and issued reminders to Sonali Bank Ltd. for payment of the unpaid sale proceeds. But the  negotiating Banks failed to receive payment of the sale proceeds from Sonli Bank Ltd. Thereafter in league with Sonali Bank Bangladesh Bank illegally but on a misconception of law has shown the said sale proceeds as loan and included the petitioners’ name in the CIB list of Bangladesh Bank.<br/><br/>CIB is creation to Bangladesh Bank Order 1972 and it being protected by first schedule of the Constitution which  shall prevail over the Bank Companies Act. It was also positive argument from the bar that the petitioners are not borrower under Article 42 where Credit Information has been defined in Bangladesh Bank Order 1972.<br/><br/>The petitioners  received the advance payment against sale proceeds  by selling their shipping documents to  the negotiating bank thus  transfer  their title over the sale proceeds  to the negotiating bank on the basis of the documents and the purchasing bank  should   get money from  Sonali bank. Therefore, it cannot be claimed that the petitioners became loanee under the Bank Companies Act or borrower under the Bangladesh Bank Order. In any view of the matter the petitioners names should not have been included in CIB list as they are not borrower or loanee.<br/><br/>Notably, in respect of second point for consideration i.e. illegal enlistment of the name of the petitioner in CIB list no authority has been cited by the learned counsel appearing for both the sides.<br/><br/>Mr. Azizul Hoque, the learned Advocate appearing for the respondent No.8 in Writ Petition No.1529 of 2012 by filing affidavit in opposition on the other hand opposes the Rule and made his submissions. He has submitted two affidavits in oppositions in support of his contention. Be it mentioned that at one point of time we in our anxiety directed personal appearance of the Managing Director of Sonali Bank to clarify the entire aspect and he personally appeared before us and in his own way tried to give clarification explaining the entire scenario.  We then asked Mr. Azizul Hoque, the learned Advocate for the Sonali Bank to give further affidavit in opposition containing the statement of the Managing Director,  Sonali Bank that have been stated  before us and accordingly he submitted affidavit in opposition where in paragraph 3 it has been stated : In view of the facts and circumstances  of the cases as narrated by the petitioner as lately  discovered by the  writ respondent No.8 Sonali Bank Limited that under a Memo  dated  23 September, 2012  a  complaint  to the Chairman,  Anti Corruption Commission, Head Office,  Segun Bagicha,  Dhaka  has been lodged against the writ petitioners  and others and the Anti Corruption Commission vide its letter  dated 10.3.2013 acknowledged the same stating,  inter alia, that Anti-Corruption Commission  filed several cases  against the petitioners and others in Miscellaneous Case No.4842  of 2013 before this Division and filed Ramna  Model Police Station (DNP) Case No.9 dated 04.10.2012. The Respondent bank categorically lodged the complaint stating that:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>‘পূর্বপরিকল্পিতভাবে প্রতারণার  উদ্দেশ্যে জাল দলিল ও অস্তিত্ববিহীন ভূয়া প্রতিষ্ঠান সৃজন করিয়া উক্ত জাল দলিলাদি  ও  অস্তিত্ববিহীন ভূয়া প্রতিষ্ঠান সমূহকে সঠিক বলিয়া  উপস্থাপন করিয়া নিমণ লিখিত  উপায়ে বর্ণিত পরিমান অর্থ আত্মসাত করিয়াছে।‘‘</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The copies of the complaint and their acknowledgement letter of the Anti Corruption Commission have been annexed as Annexure- ‘X’ and ‘X-1’ to the affidavit in opposition. Therefore, he submits that while the cases of the petitioners are under investigation by the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC)  and also in other forum, in such situation the respondents bank cannot make any payment to the petitioners till their decisions.<br/><br/>In elaborating his submissions the learned counsel by filing another affidavit in opposition dated 8.7.2013 further submits that due to non-compliance/violation of existing rules and regulations in connection with  disbursement and drawing of Funded Loan of the respondent No. 8 (Sonali Bank Limited, Hotel Sheraton Corp. Branch, Dhaka), Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has filed several cases against the officials of Sonali bank Limited and the applicant (Hall Mark Fashion Ltd., Farhan Fashion Ltd., Dol Apperals Ltd., Islam Fashion Ltd., T &amp; Brothers Knit Composite Ltd. and Dress Me Fashion Ltd.) involving L/Cs. As a result some of the accused persons are now in jail and the cases are still pending before the court. Anti Corruption commission (ACC) also informed Sonali Bank Limited that the non-funded loan (Accepted Liabilities) of respondent No. 8 (Sonali Bank Limited, Hotel Sheraton Corporate Branch, Dhaka) is under their investigation.

So at this stage the question of payment the bills dues not arise.   <br/><br/>Therefore, he submits that in all fairness this Rule should be discharged outright.<br/><br/>That being the situation the questions need to be addressed by this Division in all these Petitions are whether under the facts and circumstances of the different cases in hand the L/C issuing bank was at all justified in withholding the payment to be paid by honourig respective L/Cs and whether the enlistment of the names of the petitioners in the list of CIB by the respondent Bangladesh Bank is in keeping with the relevant provisions of law.<br/>Let us now discuss the first point.<br/><br/>The decisions referred to above consistently spelt out that when an irrecoverable Letter of Credit  issued / opened and confirmed  by the bank  such a bank is left with no option  but to respect  its  obligation under the  letter of credit  and pay if the draft and documents are  found to be in order and terms and conditions of such L/C  satisfied.<br/><br/>In 55 DLR (AD) (56) referred to above our Appellate Division clearly observed in paragraph-9</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“As soon as the letters of credit are established between the issuing bank and the negotiating bank, it becomes an independent agreement between the two banks, neither the seller nor the buyer has any (privacy) to that agreement. It is by nature a separate transaction from the sale agreement between the seller and the buyer. Consequently, the undertakings and obligation of a bank to pay, accept and pay drafts or negotiate under a letter credit are not subject to claims or defences by either the seller or the buyer. The only exception to this strict rule is the knowledge of the bank that the documents presented are forged and fraudulent.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Customer cannot instruct the bank not to pay and bank cannot act upon such instruction, if any, for withholding the payment. Any dispute between buyer and seller is to be settled between them in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract of sale. If the buyer suffers in any way, he can file suit for damages. But at the same time in all these  decisions it has also been manifested that only exception to such  general statement of principle  i.e. recognized by a court of law is obvious and clear case of fraud brought to the knowledge of the L/C issuing bank. However, mere allegation of fraud is not sufficient to entitle the  issuing bank to withhold payments. It must be found that the draft/ documents submitted for payment must be tainted by real fraud. When that can be established only in that case payment can be refused  by  the  issuing bank.<br/><br/>Article-5 of UCPDC-600 envisages that bank deal with documents and not with goods, services or performance to which the documents may relate.<br/> <br/>Article-7 depicts issuing Bank under taking as under:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">Provided that the stipulated documents are presented to the nominated bank or to the issuing bank and that they constitute a complying presentation, the issuing bank must honour if the credit is available.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">An issuing bank is irrevocable bound to honour as of the time it issues the credit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">An issuing bank undertakes to reimburse a nominated bank that has honoured or negotiated a complying presentation and forwarded the documents to the issuing bank. Reimbursement for the amount of a complying presentation under a credit available by acceptance or deferred payment is due at maturity, whether or not the nominated bank prepaid or purchased before maturity. An issuing bank’s undertaking to reimburse a nominated bank is independent of the issuing bank’s undertaking to the beneficiary.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> On the other hand UCPDC-600 through its several Articles also focused exception to the proposition of law as discussed above. Article 34, 36 &amp; 37 of UCPDC-600 envisage a bank assumes no liability or responsibility for the Form, sufficiency, accuracy genuineness, falsification or legal effect  of any document or for general  or particular condition stipulated in  a document. Needless to mention that it concerns  about L/Cs.<br/> <br/>UCPDC-600 Article-36 clarifies further:-<br/>         “A bank assumes no liability or responsibility for the consequences arising out of the interruption of its business by Acts of God, riots, civil commotions, insurrections, wars, acts of terrorism, or by any strikes or lockouts or any other causes beyond its control.”<br/> <br/>The submissions of Mr. Hasan Arif and Mr. Mainul Hosein on different points have been considered by us in meticulous adherence to the settled proposition of law in a given situation.<br/> <br/>Lord Dening once observed in [R. -Vs- Metropolitan Police Commissioner (1968) 2 All. E.R.-139] that silence is not an option when things are ill done.  May be His Lordship in a particular case observed this but we have found that in many grave exigencies this immutable observation still applies. We have come across from the affidavit in opposition of the Respondent bank as quoted above that the parties involved in all these petitions are alleged to have been involved in a large scale of scam and mall practices which touched the conscience of the people of the country of late. However, that is not relevant for the purpose of deciding the petition at all. Significantly in all the decisions referred to above we have found that all the cases were first filed in the court of origin i.e. the trial court and then went up to the High Court Division and Appellate Division. Not a single decision on this issue could be found in a Writ jurisdiction.<br/> <br/>Truth or otherwise of the allegation whatsoever branded against the parties shall have to be decided of course on evidence and in the court of origin i.e. in the trial court. This Court in summary jurisdiction under Article 102 while exercising its discretion will be loath to interfere with and give a decision in such a situation. In the case of Chairman, Bangladesh Water Development Board and another -Vs- Shamsul Hoque and Company Ltd.  and others  51 DLR (AD) 169  Chief Justice Mustafa Kamal (As his Lordship then was) held the direction of the High Court Division to pay a sum of Taka 24,90,724.25 by the respondent No. 1 Bangladesh Water Development  Bank to the Writ Petitioner to be untenable in Writ jurisdiction His Lordship observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The High Court Division in its writ jurisdiction is not a court for the recovery of money and has no jurisdiction to give a direction for payment of a particular amount of money, to the writ petitioner unless the amount claimed is both an admitted amount as well as statutory payment.”</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Moreover, the cases are absolutely based on contract between the parties as such this Division would be reluctant to dwell upon the same. The parties, if so advised, can redress their grievances, if any, before the appropriate forum. Therefore, the first point which relates to the first part of the Rule has no legs to stand and fails.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Next comes the second part i.e. the illegal inclusion of the names of the petitioner in the list of CIB by the Bangladesh Bank.  Substituted Section 5 Ga Ga of Bank Company Act (ব্যাংক-কোম্পানী (সংশোধন) আইন, ২০১৩ (২০১৩ সনের ২৭ নং আইন) এর ৪(খ) ধারাবলে দফা (গগ) প্রতিস্থাপিত) defines defaulter borrower. It says:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“খেলাপী ঋণ গ্রহীতাচ  অর্থ- <u>কোন দেনাদার</u> ব্যক্তি বা প্রতিষ্ঠান বা কোম্পানী যাহার নিজের বা স্বার্থ সংশ্লিষ্ট প্রতিষ্ঠানের অনুকূলে প্রদত্ত <u>অগ্রীম</u>, ঋণ বা অন্য কোন আর্থিক সুবিধা বা উহার অংশ বা উহার উপর অর্জিত সুদ বা উহার মুনাফা বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক কর্তৃক জারীকৃত সংজ্ঞা অনুযায়ী মেয়াদোত্তীর্ণ হওয়ার ৬ (ছয়) মাস অতিবাহিত হইয়াছে।”<br/>ব্যাখ্যা।-এই দফার উদ্দেশ্য পূরণকল্পে কোন ব্যক্তি বা, ক্ষেত্রমত, প্রতিষ্ঠান বা কোম্পানী অন্য কোন প্রতিষ্ঠানের পরিচালক না হইলে অথবা উক্ত প্রতিষ্ঠানে তাহার বা উহার শেয়ারের অংশ ২০% এর অধিক না হইলে অথবা উক্ত প্রতিষ্ঠানের ঋণের জামিনদাতা না হইলে, উক্ত প্রতিষ্ঠান তাহার বা উহার স্বার্থ সংশ্লিষ্ট প্রতিষ্ঠান বলিয়া গণ্য হইবে না;] </div><div style="text-align: justify;">        <br/>Section 27 KaKa depicts that whenever names of the loan defaulter by any bank company have been sent to the Bangladesh Bank who in its turn at once enlist the name in the CIB list.  It has no choice   other than that. In every three months it rotates which is a continuing process. Mr. Hosein tried to impress upon us that as per Article 42 of Bangladesh Bank Order 1972 where borrower have been categorized, no definition of loan has been given and the definition of loan বা ‘ঋণ which could be found in Artha Rin Ain.2003 in section  2 Ga is also for the purpose of realizing  money under the Ain itself.<br/> <br/>In the case of M/S Ripon Traders Vs. Bangladesh Bank, VII ADC (2010) 152 the enlistment of the name of the incumbent in list of CIB by the High Court Division was held to be justified. The Appellate Division upheld the said decision of the High Court.<br/> <br/>In Md. Abul Kashem Vs. Mahmudul Hasan, IX ADC (2012) 489, our Appellate Division held that section 27 KaKa of Bank Companies Act, 1991 provides for identification and preparation of a list of defaulter loanees by the bank itself and then to send it to Bangladesh Bank. The purpose of sending such list to the Bangladesh Bank having regulatory authority, is clearly stated in sub-sections (2) and (3) to the effect that Bangladesh Bank shall distribute such list to other banks and financial institutions which are prohibited from giving loan to the defaulter.  <br/> <br/>Mr. Shamim Khaled Ahmed, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the Bangladesh Bank, however, by filing affidavit in opposition detailed out and clear the scheme of loan and its implication in terms of  Section 5 GaGa of Bank Companies  Act read with section 27 KaKa and Article 42 of Bangladesh Bank Ordinance  1972  with  special  reference to section 2 of Artha Rin Adalat Ain that defines loan. Mr. Khaled categorically submits that in paragraph 5 of the Writ Petition No. 235 of 2013 in particular and also in other petitions statements to the effect that amount received by the Respondent beneficiary is not a loan rather a “sale proceed” is totally misconceived and not at all correct. He clarified:–<br/><br/>         “It is stated that in amount admittedly received by the writ petitioner from the respondent No.4 United Commercial Bank Ltd. admittedly by way of ‘bill purchase’ is a term of art known and understood throughout the business world. The term bill purchase is very much in the definition of loan in Artho Rin Adalat Ain 1990 and its substitute Artho Rin Adalat Ain 2003. ‘Loan’ as defined in section 2 of the Ain is as follows:-  <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">‘‘ ঋণ’  অর্থ<br/>১। অগ্রিম, ধার, নগদ ঋণ, ওভার ড্রাফট, ব্যাংকিং ক্রেডিট , বাটাকৃত বা ক্রয়কত  বিল, ইসলামী শরীয়া  মোতাবেক পরিচালিত আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান কর্তৃক বিনিয়োগকৃত অর্থ বা অন্য যে কোন আর্থিক আনুকৃল্য বা সুযোগ- সুবিধা , যে নামেই অভিতহত হউক না কেন;<br/>২। গ্যারান্টি, ইনডেমনিটি, ঋণপত্র বা অন্য কোন আর্থিক বন্দোবস্ত  যাহা কোন আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান ঋণ গৃহীতার  পক্ষে প্রদান বা জারী কওে বা দায় হিসাবে গ্রহন করে ।<br/>৩। কোন আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান কর্তৃক উহার কোন কর্মকর্তা বা কর্মচারীকে প্রদত্ত কোন ঋণ; এবং<br/>৪। পূর্ববর্তী ক্রমিক  (১) হইতে (৩) এ উল্লিখিত ঋণ, বা ক্ষেত্রমত ইসলামী শরীয়াঅনুযায়ী পরিচালিত  আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান কর্তৃক বিনিয়োগকৃত অর্থ এর উপর বৈধভাবে আরোপিত সদু, দন্ড সুদ বা  মুনাফা বা  ভাড়া : ‘‘</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>We have found considerable force in the submissions of learned counsel for Bangladesh Bank. It is clear that the assertions and averments made by the petitioners in different petitions that the amount received from the negotiating bank is a “sale proceed” does not at all merit substance. We hold that it is absolutely an “advance” taken by the customer within the meaning of section 2 of the Artha Rin Ain, 2003 that defines advance as a loan and therefore, attracts section 5 (GAGA) of the Bank Company Act and for that reason inclusion of the names of the petitioners in the list of CIB is justified. Submission of Mr. Moinul Hosein for the petitioner on that score is misconceived and fallacious one. Our Appellate Division and this Division in several decisions had already decided this aspect which is no longer a resintegra.(All the underlings are mine to add emphasis)<br/> <br/>Fortified with all the decisions referred to above conjunct with the discussions and observations made thereto we are of the view that both the Writ petition Nos. 1529 of 2013 and 609 of 2013 miserably fail and for that matter all other Writ Petitions having been standing on the same footing also equally fail. They are absolutely devoid of any substance and should be discharged outright.<br/> <br/>In the result, all the Rules are discharged without any order as to cost. The orders of stay granted earlier by this court are hereby recalled and vacated. <br/> <br/><strong><u>Md. Ashraful Kamal, J</u></strong><br/> <br/>I agree with His Lordship Md. Ashfaqul Islam, J. that the Rules should be discharged. I would however, add some observations of my own since the questions raised in the Rules are of considerable public importance.<br/> <br/>The Hall Mark episode has been the ‘talk of the country’. The Hall Mark loan scandal has put the entire banking sector in an embar-rassing situation and the confidence of the depositors has gone shattered in consequence.<br/> <br/>The petitioners’ cases are based on a claim arising out of a commercial letter of credit. The facts may be briefly stated at the outset:<br/>         According to the petitioners, their customers intended to purchase garments products from them to export garments to their (purchasers) buyers. For the purpose of facilitating trade, their customers opened back-to-back letter of credit in their respective banks in favour of the petitioners to purchase the garments products. After that their customers sent those LCs to the petitioners.<br/>         The petitioners then submitted those LCs to their respective banks and took 90% of the LC amount as sale proceeds. Thereafter, petitioners have supplied the goods and their customers received those goods duly.<br/>         After that petitioners respective banks (Negotiating Bank) submitted all the documents of the goods delivered by the petitioners as per LC before the LC issuing bank i.e Sonali Bank to have their payment against the letter of credit. But the respondent Sonali Bank refused to pay LC amount of the petitioners’ to their respective banks.<br/> <br/>In view of the above situation the petitioners invoked this extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution and the above Rules were issued in the following three different terms:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">a)   Why a direction should not be given upon the respondents to pay the outstanding bill along with overdue interest of the petitioners.<br/>b)   Challenging the enlistment of the names of the petitioners in the CIB list of its Credit Information Bureau as loan defaulter to be illegal and a direction was sought for the enlistment should be declared to have been done without lawful authority having no legal effect.<br/><em>c)   both the terms as aforesaid</em>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Since the entire matter relates to Letter of Credit, therefore, it is necessary to understand what Letter of Credit is.<br/> <br/>Letters of credit (LCs) are one of the most versatile and secure instruments available to international traders. An LC is a commitment by a bank on behalf of the importer (foreign buyer) that payment will be made to the beneficiary (exporter) provided that the terms and conditions stated in the LC have been met, as evidenced by the presentation of specified documents. Since LCs are credit instruments, the importer’s credit with his bank is used to obtain an LC. The importer pays his bank a fee to render this service.<br/><br/>Letters of credit (LCs) are also referred to as a documentary credit, is a contractual agreement whereby the issuing bank (importer’s bank), acting on behalf of its customer (the importer or buyer), promises to make payment to the beneficiary or exporter against the receipt of “complying” stipulated documents. The issuing bank will typically use intermediary banks to facilitate the transaction and make payment to the exporter.<br/><br/>Letters of credit (LCs) are a separate contract from the sales contract on which it is based; therefore, the banks are not concerned with the quality of the underlying goods or whether each party fulfils the terms of the sales contract. [Article 4 of UCP 600 (2007 Revision)]<br/><br/>The bank’s obligation to pay is solely conditioned upon the seller’s compliance with the terms and conditions of the LC. In LC transactions, banks deal in documents only, not goods. [Article 5 of UCP 600 (2007 Revision)]<br/>The Letters of credit (LCs) are always irrevocable, which means the document may not be changed or cancelled unless the importer, banks, and exporter agree. [Article 2 of UCP 600 (2007 Revision)]<br/><br/>There are two types of letters of credit: <em>commercial and standby</em>. Commercial letters of credit are used primarily to facilitate foreign trade. The commercial letter of credit is the primary payment mechanism for a transaction, whereas the standby letter of credit is a secondary payment mechanism.<br/><br/>A commercial letter of credit is a contractual agreement between a bank, known as the issuing bank, on behalf of one of its customers, authorizing another bank, known as the advising or confirming bank, to make payment to the beneficiary. The issuing bank, on the request of its customer, opens the letter of credit. The issuing bank makes a commitment to honor drawings made under the credit. The beneficiary is normally the provider of goods and/or services.<br/><br/>Commercial letters of credit have been used for centuries to facilitate payment in international trade. Their use will continue to increase as the global economy evolves.<br/><br/>Letters of credit used in international transactions are governed by the International Chamber of Commerce Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits. The general provisions and definitions of the International Chamber of Commerce are binding on all parties.<br/><br/>The International Chamber of Commerce’s (ICC), which was established in 1919, had as its primary objective facilitating the flow of international trade.<br/><br/>The Uniform Customs and Practice (UCP) for Documentary Credits is promulgated by the Commission on Banking Technique and Practice of the International Chamber of Commerce headquartered in Paris, France. It articulates standard international commercial letter of credit practice.<br/><br/>The current revision, ICC Publication No. 600 (UCP600), became effective July 2007. Prior versions were issued in 1933 (UCP82), 1951 (UCP151), 1962 (UCP222), 1974 (UCP290), 1983 (UCP400) and 1994 (UCP 500).<br/><br/>On the other hand, domestic letters of credit or Inland Letter of Credit (ILC) are used as payment instruments for business transactions in which the principal and the beneficiary live in the same country. They are defined as the conditioned payment order a loan institution (issuing bank) issues to guarantee that a business corporation (buyer/ principal) will pay another (seller/beneficiary) and honor its payment obligations upon receiving certain documents regarding the sale of goods or services, which must comply with all of the terms and conditions established in such Letter of Credit.<br/><br/>In the cases in hand, admittedly the applicants of the Letters of Credit and the beneficiaries (petitioners) of the letters of credit are living in the same country i.e Bangladesh; therefore, the back-to-back letters of credit herein are Domestic Letters of Credit or Inland Letters of Credit (ILC). In these letters of credit it is stipulated that those are governed by the International Chamber of Commerce Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits UCP 600 (2007 Revision).<br/><br/>Since in the case in hand, the Inland Letters of Credit presented by the petitioners are alleged to have been obtained by fraud, so these Letters of Credit have to be examined thoroughly.<br/><br/>As per Article 28 of the ICC Uniform Customs and Practice says that;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/><em>“ a..............................</em><br/><em>b..............................</em><br/><em>c...............................</em><br/><em>d...............................</em><br/><em>e................................</em><br/><em>F.         (i) The insurance document must indicate the amount of insurance coverage and be in the same currency as the credit.</em><br/><em>(ii) A requirement in the credit for insurance coverage to be a for a percentage of the value of the good’s of the invoice value or similar is deemed to be the minimum amount of coverage required.</em><br/><em>If there is no indication in the credit of the insurance coverage required, the amount of insurance coverage must be at least 110% of the CIF or CIP value of the goods.</em><br/><em>When the CIF or CIP value cannot be determined from the documents, the amount of insurance coverage must be calculated on the basis of the amount for which honour or negotiation is requested or the gross value of the goods as shown on the invoice, whichever is greater.</em><br/><em>iii. The insurance document must indicate that risks are covered at least between the place of taking in charge or shipment and the place of discharge or final destination as stated in the credit.</em><br/><em>G. A credit should state the type of insurance required and, if any, the additional risks to be covered. An insurance document will be accepted without regard to any risks that are not covered if the credit uses imprecise terms such as “ usual risks” or “customary risks”. </em><br/><em>h.................................</em><br/><em>i..................................</em><br/><em>j................................... ”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>On a plain reading of the aforesaid Article 28 it appears that a credit should state the type of insurance required but in the case in hand none of the letters of credit mentioned the name of the insurance company and its type. Rather the column of the insurance of the Letters of Credit was found blank.<br/><br/>Moreover, according to the guidelines issued by Bangladesh Bank for foreign exchange transactions (FFET) Volume I, Chapter-7, page-33, which provide that “LC covering value more than USD 5000 or equivalent should be sent through SWIFT Code or other similar arrangements to the advising Bank”. But, mysteriously, in the instant letters of credit, SWIFT Code were not used and issued either by the negotiating Bank or by the L/C issuing Bank.<br/>Apart from that, according to inspection report dated 8<sup>th</sup> July, 2012, the letters of credit in question were not issued by the Sonali Bank Limited, and acceptance also were not issued by the said bank and the respective Inland Letters of Credit (ILC) were not found in Bank’s record.<br/><br/>Further, according to Inspection report dated 14<sup>th</sup> October, 2012, the letters of credit in question issued by the 26 Branches of several Banks for which no register acceptance of margin and realization of commission and acceptance of the bills were not available in the records of the Sonali Bank. This may be the result of running unauthorized/parallel banking operation by some officials in connivance with the concerned client.<br/><br/>During the course of Sonali Bank’s audit, the audit team have obtained and reviewed the documents provided by the private banks in support of their lodged claims against accepted bills, but they have however been informed by the Branch Management that no Inland Letters of Credit were opened or issued from the concerned Branch and acceptance on inland bills were not given by the said Branch. Transaction occurred between Sonali Bank Ltd. and other commercial Banks which purchased inland bills, has been obtained illegally out of Bank’s network, without recording of the related transactions in the books of the Branch.<br/><br/>So, in issuing these Inland Letters of Credit, Credit discipline has been grossly violated and disregarded in defiance of the existing rules, regulations, principles and guideline of bank.<br/><br/>The documents submitted by the private commercial banks do not contain all the required supporting papers to establish their right against the claims. They could not provide any documents to confirm that the acceptances have been taken by them from concerned branch through the Branch Management or proper official channel. Moreover the documents submitted by other banks against accepted bills were not signed /endorsed by the Branch In-charge or the Manager.<br/><br/>Bills purchasing banks (negotiating banks of the petitioners) should be held responsible for taking such acceptances without observing generally accepted banking norms i.e. through official channel. Therefore, we can assume that the concerned private commercial banks have purchased inland bills from the suppliers without discharging their responsibility diligently in purchasing such bills. They have also taken the acceptances without any proper channel of Agargaon Branch of Sonali Bank Ltd. We have also found that in most of the cases acceptances were obtained from concerned Branch by these bill purchasing banks through interested party which has created the opportunity of parallel banking.<br/><br/>So it appears from the record that Hall mark group has managed to obtain a fake letter of credit (LC) from abroad and submitted it to Sonali Bank, Rupashi Bangla Branch to have opening local back-to-back letter of credit in the name of its sister concern, which maintain their account with other banks. The other banks thereafter submitted a fake fabricated local bill to Rupashi Bangla Branch of Sonali Bank for acceptance. After having obtained the acceptance of Sonali Bank, the respective banks paid the bill amount to the beneficiary by debit to their IBP account. On maturity date of the bill, the collecting bank availed the bill proceeds from the Sonali Bank and adjusted the IBP outstanding accordingly. Without movement of any goods, Hall mark group have snatched away the public money in the name of fake spinning companies.<br/><br/>The Sonali Bank is not only the largest nationalised bank in Bangladesh, but also the biggest commercial bank in this sector having the responsibility to perform the treasury function of the Sonali Bank places, where Bangladesh bank does not have its runs. Sonali Bank has been functioning with full confidence of the people and the nation as a whole. The Hall mark scam has not only thrown the Sonali Bank in a ‘black hole’ but also ruined the trust and confidence of the people in the entire banking sector.<br/><br/>About Tk. 3700 crore that has been distributed alone in the name of Hall Mark by Sonali Bank, Rupashi Bangla Branch, which includes the amount taken by their sister concern in the name of various Spinning Mills from other banks.<br/> <br/>As per Bangladesh Bank guide lines, the single/party exposure is maximum 30% (funded 15% and non-funded 15%) of the respective banks paid up capital. The present paid up capital of Sonali Bank Ltd. is Tk. 1125.00 crore. Therefore, Sonali Bank Ltd. can extend credit facility to a single party to the tune of Tk. 168.75 crore as funded and Tk. 164.75 as non-funded, Tk. 337.50 crore in total. Therefore, it is crystal clear that Sonali Bank allowed Tk. 3700 crore to a single party (Hall Mark) as opposed to the 337.50 crore breaking the single party exposure limit as fixed by Bangladesh bank, the central bank of the country.<br/> <br/>Lord Denning Mr. in the case of Edward Owen Engineering Ltd. Vs. Barclays Bank International Ltd. and Umama Bank reported in 1978 Lloyd’s Law Reports Vol-1 page 166, wherein it has been observed.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><em>“It is not concerned in the least with the relations between the supplier and the customer nor with the question whether the supplier has performed his contracted obligation or not nor with the question whether the supplier is in default or not. The bank must pay according to its guarantee on demand, if so stipulated, without proof of conditions. <u>The only exception is when there is clear fraud of which the bank has notice.</u></em><u> ”</u><em>(emphasis is supplied)</em><br/> <br/>As per Article 34 of the ICC Uniform Customs and Practice the UCP 600 (2007 Revision) it speaks about the disclaimer on effectiveness of Documents which reads as thus;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“<u>A bank assumes no liability or responsibility for the form, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness, falsification or legal effect of any document,</u> or for the general or particular conditions stipulated in a document or superimposed thereon;  nor does it assume any liability or responsibility of the description, quantity, weight, quality, condition, packing, delivery, value or existence of the goods, services or other performance represented by any document, or for the good faith or acts or omissions, solvency, performance or standing of the consignor, the carrier, the forwarder, the consignce or the insurer of the goods or any other person. ”</em><em>(emphasis is supplied)</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Therefore, on a reading of the aforesaid article 34 it is crystal clear that a bank assumes no liability or responsibility for the form, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness, falsification.<br/><br/>Since in the present cases in hand the respondents Bangladesh Bank and Sonali Bank disputed the Inland back-to-back letters of credit presented by the petitioners (beneficiaries) being forged documents, therefore, the issuing bank of the letters of credit has no liability or responsibility to honour them. <br/><br/>So, a letter of credit bank undertakes to honor a document that represents the underlying transaction. But, it does not undertake to honor a document that is fraudulent regardless of the innocence of the person presenting it. <br/> <br/>In the present case it was alleged that Inland back-to-back letters of credit submitted by the petitioners are false documents by colluding with the applicant or a third party and there isn't any true basic transaction.<br/> <br/>Fraud vitiates everything and in most cases it originates when a commercial party contracts with a rouge.<br/> <br/>Thus it appears that only in two exceptional circumstances an issuing bank can absolve it’s responsibility of not honoring the obligation created by it under a letter of credit. Firstly, if it is  proved that there is a clear fraud of  which it has knowledge the bank may refuse to pay and secondly, if the cases are of such a nature that there is very special circumstance which warrants an interference by the court.<br/> <br/>Since the genuineness of these letters of credit have been questioned by the issuing bank, therefore,  under Article 102 we cannot entertain complicated disputed question of the fact as to whether the letters of credit annexed herein in the writ petitions  are genuine or not.<br/> <br/>The well-known principle that complicated questions of fact should not be entertained in a writ petition and the writ jurisdiction cannot be invoked when any alternative remedy is available to the aggrieved party cannot be disregarded at all. In the summary proceedings under Article 102 of the constitution, it is neither desirable nor advisable to enter into their merit and record a finding as to a disputed question of fact.<br/> <br/>In the case of New India Tea Company Ltd. Vs. Bangladesh and others reported in 31 DLR(AD) (1979)-303 it was held that;<br/>“There is a long line of decisions in favour of the view that the High Court should not enter into disputed questions of fact nor decide any question as to title which require investigation into facts and taking of elaborate evidence.”<br/> <br/>It is necessary to quote Section 45 of the Banking Companies Act, 1991, which runs thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>৪৫ বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংকের নির্দেশ দানের ক্ষমতাz - (১) বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক যদি এই মর্মে স¿ºষ্ট হয় যে, -<br/>(ক) জনস্বার্থে, বা<br/>(খ) মুâানীতি এবং ব্যাংক -নীতির উন্নতি বিধানের জন্য,    বা<br/>(গ) কোন ব্যাংক -কোম্পানীর আমানতকারীদের স্বার্থের পরিপ¿Ûী বা ব্যাংক -কোম্পানীর স্বার্থের পক্ষে ক্ষতিকর কার্যকলাপ প্রতিরোধ করার জন্য; বা<br/>(ঘ) কোন ব্যাংক -কোম্পানীর যথাযথ ব্যবসÛাপনা নিশ্চিত করার জন্য, সাধারণভাবে সকল ব্যাংক-কোম্পানীকে, অথবা বিশেষ কোন ব্যাংক -কোম্পানীকে নির্দেশ প্রদান করা প্রয়োজন, তাহা হইলে বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক যথাযথ নির্দেশ জারী করিতে পারিবে; এবং সংশ্লিষ্ট ব্যাংক -কোম্পানী উক্ত নির্দেশ পালন করতে বাধ্য থাকিবেz<br/>(২) বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক স্বেচ্ছায় অথবা উহার নিকট পেশকৃত কোন আবেদনের পরিপ্রেক্ষিতে উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন প্রদত্ত নির্দেশ বাতিল বা পরিবর্তন করিতে পারিবে; এবং এইরুপ বাতিলকরণ বা পরিবর্তন শর্তসাপেক্ষে হইতে পারিবে<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">So the supervisory powers of the Bangladesh Bank within the meaning of Section 45 of the Bank Companies Act, 1991which is to the effect:</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>In the public interest; or </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>In furtherance of monetary and banking policy; or </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>To prevent the affairs of any banking company being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interest of the depositors of any banking company or in a manner prejudicial to the interest of the banking company; or </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>To secure the proper management of any banking company.</em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">It is a well-settled principal of law that in order to get a Rule of mandamus the petitioner must show that his claim is rooted in the statute or statutory Rule.<br/>So, it is always required that the applicant for a mandamus should have a specific legal right to enforce the performance of those duties.<br/>In the case of Queen v. Guardians of the Lewisham Union, reported in (1897) 1 QB 498 it was observed;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“This court would be far exceeding its proper functions if it were to assume jurisdiction to enforce the performance by public bodies of all their statutory duties without requiring clear evidence that the person who sought its interference had a legal right to insist upon such performance.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Talekhal Progressive Fisherman Co-operative Society Ltd. Vs. Bangladesh and others reported in 1981 BLD(AD)-103 wherein it has been runs thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In order to entitle a person to ask for performance of any public duty by mandamus it is necessary to show that he has a legal right for claiming such performance apart from the fact that he is interested in the performance of the duty.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of National Engineers vs. Ministry of Defence reported in 44 DLR (AD) (1992) 179 our Apex Court held thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In order to enforce the performance by public bodies of any public duty by mandamus, the applicant must have a specific legal right to insist upon such performance”</em>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>So, a writ of mandamus can be granted only in a case where there is a statutory duty imposed upon the public bodies and there is a failure on the part of that public bodies to discharge their statutory obligations. The paramount function of a writ is to compel performance of public duties prescribed by statute and to keep public bodies exercising public functions within the limits of their jurisdiction.  Therefore, mandamus may issue to compel the public bodies to do something, it must be shown that there is a statute which imposes a legal duty and the aggrieved party has a legal right under the statute to enforce its performance. <br/><br/>Section 45 of the Act gives a clear indication, as to which situation Bangladesh Bank shall act and the petitioners failed to show us any legal right under section 45 of the Act which imposed a legal duty upon the Bangladesh Bank. Therefore, the petitioners are not entitled to seek any relief under section 45 of the Banking Companies Act, 1991 and as such these writ petitions are not maintainable in law. <br/><br/>The petitioners’ main allegation is against their respective negotiating banks (those are private banks) and as such writ petition does not lie under the provision of Article 102 of the Constitution.<br/><br/>Since the petitioners are borrowers (as they took 90% of the sale proceeds of the letters of credit as loan from their respective negotiating banks), they are obliged to repay their outstanding liability to their respective banks as their letters of credit were refused by the LC issuing banks being forged and the petitioners are also subject to the provisions of Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003.<br/><br/>The petitioners being defaulter-borrowers completely failed to show us any such specific legal right which imposes a legal duty upon the Bangladesh Bank.<br/><br/>According to M/S. Ripon Traders and others Vs. Bangladesh Bank reported in VII ADC(2010)152, it was held that “once the borrower is found by the bank as loan defaulter under section 27 ka ka of Bank Companies Act, 1991. Every bank is required to send its report to Bangladesh bank and then Bangladesh Bank in turn is required in the interest of the lending market and the national economy at large in general and for compliance of the relevant laws in particular to send such list of loan defaulter to each and every banking company and or financial institution.”<br/><br/>In the instant cases as the petitioners as borrowers cannot curtail the power of the respondent No.2 by filing the instant writ petitions with a prayer for direction upon the respondents not to show their names in the CIB list.<br/><br/>Relying on the principle of law, in the instant case, we find that alternative forum is open to the petitioners to place their grievances seeking remedy before the civil court and hence we are inclined to keep our hands off in the matter of deciding the case on merit.<br/><br/>Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we hereby discharge the Rules with observation that the petitioners may seek remedy in the proper forum, if any, for vindication of their right, if they are so advised.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Anyway, initially BFCC was established as a project approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) in its meeting held on 16.08.1988. In course of time, BFCC became an integral part of Bangladesh Biman which was established under the Bangladesh Biman Corporation Ordinance of 1977. With the establishment of BFCC in 1989 at Zia International Airport, now renamed as Hazrat Shah Jalal International Airport, Biman Management abolished the Cabin Facilities Department of Bangladesh Biman which consisted of two sections, namely, Field Service and Catering Section by Organization Order No.13 of 1989 dated 11.11.1989 issued under the signature of the respondent no.3 and thereby transferred all the existing employees of the Cabin Facilities Department to BFCC. Clause (b) of the said Organization Order No. 13 of 1989 provides that the employees transferred to BFCC would be functionally and administratively accountable to BFCC Management and on transfer, their service would be governed by the Bangladesh Biman Corporation Employees (Service) Regulations, 1979 (in short, the Regulations of 1979) and they would continue to receive salaries, allowances and other facilities of Biman as per their terms of engagement. Although the employees transferred to BFCC are entitled to all Biman facilities and benefits as per clause (b) of the Organization Order No. 13 of 1989, but clause (d) of the said Organization Order discriminates the newly-recruited employees of BFCC in the sense that they will be governed by BFCC rules and service regulations and that Biman service facilities and benefits will not be admissible to them.<br/> <br/>Under the administrative and financial policy formulated by BFCC Board, BFCC Management has been recruiting employees since 1990 against different posts on contractual basis within the permanent organizational set-up of BFCC approved by the Biman Authority. The petitioners being employees of BFCC were primarily appointed on contractual basis for a period of 3(three) or 5(five) years in different capacities. Subsequently, their contractual periods were extended or renewed for further periods. In this way, some of the petitioners have already completed about 15 (fifteen) years of service in BFCC. However, initially the petitioners were paid consolidated salaries by the authority and afterwards pursuant to the declaration of the new National Pay Scale by the Government in 1991, BFCC Management determined their Pay Scale in line with the Pay Scale applicable to the permanent Biman officers/employees. The petitioners received their salaries accordingly. By the Administrative Order No. 02 of 1998 dated 21.06.1998, BFCC Management approved the implementation of the new National Pay Scale of 1997 to all BFCC contractual employees in line with the Biman Administrative Order No. 07 of 1998 dated 05.04.1998. The Administrative Order No. 02 of 1998 came into force with effect from 01.07.1997 and since then, the petitioners had been receiving their salaries in the new Pay Scale of 1997. But unlike the permanent Biman officers/employees, they are not entitled to other allowances and retirement benefits like pension, provident fund, medical facility etc. On perusal of the appointment letter of a contractual employee and that of a permanent Biman employee, it appears that though both the employees have been appointed in the same Pay Group and primarily on contractual basis under almost identical terms and conditions and are being paid in the same Pay Scale, the terms and conditions of the permanent employee’s service will be governed by the Rules of 1979  and his service will be regularized with effect from the date of his contractual appointment subject to his satisfactory performance during the period of contract. On the other hand, the terms and conditions of the contractual employee’s service will be governed as per the service agreement and the Orders, Instructions etc. issued from time to time by BFCC. The BFCC Board was reconstituted by the Office Order No. 07 of 1995 dated 29.03.1995 wherein it was stated that the Board would, inter alia, frame Service Rules or Regulations for the newly-recruited contractual employees; but unfortunately no Service Rules or Regulations have yet been framed by the BFCC Board. In the mean time, by issuing various Administrative Orders, the BFCC Management approved/introduced different policies and service benefits for the contractual employees like enhancement of salaries and allowances, gratuity benefit etc. From Memos dated 01.06.2000 and 12.09.2001 issued under the signature of the Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism, it is clear that for regularization of BFCC contractual employees, the Ministry asked the respondent no. 2 to provide it with necessary papers/documents, but unfortunately the Biman authority did not respond thereto. Because of reluctance of the Biman authority, they could not be regularized in spite of the issuance of the said two Memos dated 01.06.2000 and 12.09.2001 by the Government. It was stated in the agenda of a Biman ED meeting signed on 30.12.2001 that by reason of the dual management system in BFCC and the discriminatory terms and conditions governing the service of the contractual employees, the smooth functioning of BFCC was being hampered and as such, it was recommended that the contractual employees be regularized and governed under the Regulations of 1979. But the said recommendation went unheeded. However, in an inquiry report dated 28.01.2002 submitted by a three-member committee of the Government, it has been stated that the appointment of contractual employees against the permanent set-up of Biman and extension of their service for indefinite duration are not consistent with the policies of the Government. The said committee recommended that both the regular Biman employees and contractual employees of BFCC be administered under a uniform regime and that the contractual employees be absorbed in the service of Biman. Alternatively, the committee recommended to convert BFCC into a company and administer all its employees according to the Company Law. But strangely enough, no positive step has been taken by the Biman authority for implementation of the recommendations as yet. In another inquiry report dated 27.10.2004 submitted by a one-member committee of the Government, it has been stated that since the regular and contractual employees of BFCC are not receiving equal treatment with regard to salaries and other service benefits, there exists a disappointing atmosphere in BFCC causing a feeling of deprivation among the contractual employees to the detriment of the smooth functionality of BFCC. So this committee also recommended that the contractual employees of BFCC be regularized in the service of Biman. Lastly, on 09.01.2005, a five-member committee headed by the General Manager (Administration), Biman submitted a report wherein it was recommended that in order to remove complications as regards promotion of the regular Biman employees and contractual employees of BFCC, Biman might be converted into a company under the control of the Biman Corporation.<br/> <br/>As per Office Order No. 07 of 1995 dated 29.03.1995, the BFCC Board is obligated to frame Service Regulations/Rules for the newly-recruited contractual employees of BFCC; but no such Regulations/Rules have been framed as yet, albeit they are getting various service benefits/facilities under different Administrative Orders issued from time to time. While Regulation 4(1) of the Regulations of 1979 provides that the contractual employees shall be bound thereby, clause (d) of the Organization Order No. 13 of 1989 discriminates between the regular employees and the contractual employees by indicating that the Biman service facilities and benefits will not be applicable to the contractual employees. This being the scenario, clause (d) of the Organization Order No. 13 of 1989 dated 11.11.1989 is arbitrary and violative of the fundamental rights of the petitioners. It is worthy of notice that both the regular and contractual employees of BFCC were appointed under the same terms and conditions and as per the Regulations of 1979, but the service of the contractual employees is governed by various Administrative Orders of BFCC and not by the Regulations of 1979 and such contractual appointments of the petitioners are against the provisions of the Bangladesh Biman Corporation Ordinance of 1977. The impugned Organization Order No. 13 of 1989 is ultra vires the power of the Director (Administration) of Biman Corporation. BFCC being a permanent set-up within the organizational structure of Biman, the service of its contractual employees should be governed by the Regulations of 1979. So the issuance of Administrative Orders by BFCC Management to govern the service of the contractual employees without the approval of the Government is violative of the provisions of Section 30 of the Ordinance of 1977. The contractual employees of BFCC are enjoying almost all the service benefits like the regular Biman employees and as such they should be regularized as per the recommendations of various inquiry committees for efficient performance of their functions. Against this backdrop, the Biman authority is legally mandated to regularize the petitioners in the service of Biman.<br/> <br/>In the Supplementary Affidavit dated 16.11.2005 filed on behalf of the petitioners, it has been mentioned that as per the relevant Government  policy, all revenue posts transferred from development projects shall be made permanent after three years.<br/> <br/>In the Supplementary Affidavit dated 12.05.2010 filed on behalf of the petitioners, it has been stated that over the years, BFCC has become an integral part of Biman and this is why, it is managed and controlled by Biman. The contractual employees of BFCC will continue to work till attainment of 57 years and they are retiring from service just like the permanent/regular employees of BFCC. Only the permanent employees of Biman are entitled to service benefits like gratuity and various types of leave as per the Regulations of 1979; but nevertheless the contractual employees of BFCC are also getting these benefits which show that they are being treated as permanent employees of Biman for all practical purposes. Further, the Administrative Order concerning payment of gratuity to the contractual employees of BFCC also contemplates that they would go on working for an indefinite duration and be entitled to gratuity only on satisfactory completion of 7 years of service.<br/> <br/>The respondent no. 2 has contested the Rule by filing an Affidavit-in-Opposition. His case, as set out in the Affidavit-in-Opposition, in short, runs as follows:<br/>         Clause (d) of the Bangladesh Biman Organization Order No. 13 of 1989 does not discriminate between the regular employees of Bangladesh Biman and the newly-recruited employees of BFCC. It is specifically stated that the newly-recruited employees of BFCC have been appointed on contractual basis and that these employees have agreed under their contracts with BFCC that their terms and conditions of service will be governed as per their agreements with BFCC and as per the Service Regulations, Orders and Instructions issued from time to time by BFCC. As the petitioners are contractual appointees, they are bound by the terms and conditions of their contracts and as such, they are not entitled to enjoy all the benefits admissible to the permanent/regular employees of Biman. BFCC not only has its own Administrative and Financial Rules, but also has a separate Organogram (Organizational Chart). The terms and conditions of the service of the petitioners are prescribed by BFCC and not by Biman. Over and above, the salaries of the petitioners are paid not by Biman, but by BFCC. The allegation of discrimination by the petitioners in view of non-application of the Regulations of 1979 is clearly misconceived. The petitioners have been receiving gratuity, medical allowance and other facilities under their contracts with BFCC. Besides, they are currently receiving certain benefits/allowances that are not available to the permanent employees of Biman. So the contractual employees form a distinct class by themselves. The petitioners’ employment is currently regulated by various Administrative Orders and Instructions issued by BFCC and therefore they have not been in any way prejudiced by the fact that no Service Regulations are in place. The inquiry committee which submitted its report on 28.01.2002 was set up to inquire into certain audit objections. It was not set up for the purpose of reporting on the alleged differences between the terms and conditions of service of the contractual employees of BFCC and those of the permanent employees of Biman. The inquiry report  dated 27.10.2004 was in relation  to the presence  of a nail  in the food supplied  by BFCC to Qatar Airways and the observations made therein vis-à-vis the service conditions of the two sets of employees are uncalled-for, unjustified and unwarranted.<br/> <br/>In the Supplementary Affidavit-in-Opposition dated 16.03.2006 filed on behalf of the respondent no.2, it has been averred that the petitioners have all been directly recruited by BFCC on contractual basis and the permanent employees of Biman working in BFCC have been appointed on deputation. Originally BFCC was a project of Biman. Biman is currently running a Poultry Complex which is manned by direct recruits on contractual basis as well as the permanent employees of Biman working on deputation there. The Deputy General Manager of BFCC is a permanent functionary of Biman working on deputation in BFCC. The contractual periods of the petitioners have been extended/renewed from time to time by BFCC. The orders of extension or renewal of their contractual periods clearly indicate that they are too entitled to terminate the contracts under the terms and conditions embodied therein. <br/> <br/>In the Supplementary Affidavit-in-Opposition dated 13.05.2010 filed on behalf of the respondent no.2, it has been mentioned  that  in 2001, BFCC had 558 employees of whom 312 were contractual employees directly recruited by BFCC and the remaining 246 were permanent employees of Biman working on deputation in BFCC. In 2007, Biman retired 182 permanent employees working on deputation in BFCC under a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS). Furthermore, several permanent employees were terminated and/or removed from service by Biman. As a result, the number of permanent employees of Biman working on deputation in BFCC was considerably reduced. At present, BFCC has only 55 permanent employees of Biman working on deputation and 292 directly-recruited contractual employees. However, BFCC provides exclusive catering services to Air Africa, Saudia Airlines, Dragon Air, China Eastern Airlines, Etihad, Cathay Pacific and Biman Bangladesh Airlines Ltd. BFCC also provides catering services ‘on request’ to Air India Express, Emirates, Malaysian Airlines, Qatar Airways, Thai Airways, Kuwait Airways, Oman Airways and PIA. BFCC provides catering services to UN mission flights as well. Consequently, it is imperative that the services provided by BFCC must be commensurate with the international standard. As such, the terms and conditions of service of the directly-recruited contractual employees are determined by the authority with a view to ensuring and/or maintaining the quality and efficiency of the catering services of BFCC.<br/><br/>At the outset, Dr. M. Zahir, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners, submits that the impugned Clause (d) of the Organization Order No. 13 of 1989 amounts to discriminatory treatment against the petitioners and the said Order should be struck down as being arbitrary and violative of Articles 27, 29, 31 and 40 of the Constitution.<br/><br/>Dr. M. Zahir also submits that the impugned Organization Order No. 13 of 1989 being a mere Administrative Order has overridden the Regulations of 1979 which can not be acceptable in any perspective.<br/><br/>Dr. M. Zahir also submits that while Regulation 4(1) of the Regulations of 1979 provides that the contractual employees shall be bound thereby, Clause (d) of the Organization Order No. 13 of 1989 discriminates between the regular employees and the contractual employees by indicating that the Biman service facilities and benefits will not be applicable to the contractual employees.<br/><br/>Dr. M. Zahir further submits that it is true that the petitioners were initially appointed on contractual basis for a period of three or five years, as the case may be, but the fact remains that their contracts were renewed from time to time and they are still working in BFCC and in this view of the matter, those contracts can be regarded as “rolling contracts” and in this regard, the “doctrine of continuous officiation” should be called in aid for their absorption/regularization in the service of Biman.<br/><br/>Dr. M. Zahir also submits that the principle of legitimate expectation requires that the petitioners should be made permanent employees of Biman, regard being had to the attributes of permanency of their jobs.<br/><br/>Dr. M. Zahir next submits that it is an admitted fact that the petitioners along with the deputationists have been rendering self-same service in BFCC and that being so, both the sets of employees stand on the same footing and from this standpoint, the rule of “intelligible differentia” or “permissible criteria” is not applicable and by that reason, the petitioners should be regularized in the service of Biman as recommended by various inquiry committees.<br/><br/>In support of the above submissions, Dr. M. Zahir relies upon the decisions in the cases of Bangladesh Biman Corporation represented by the Managing Director…..Vs…. Rabia Bashri Irene and others, 55 DLR(AD)132; Sheikh Abdus Sabur…Vs… Returning Officer, District Education Officer-in-Charge, Gopalganj &amp; others, 41 DLR(AD) 30; Md.

Jain and others…Vs…… Union of India and others, 1987 (Supp) SCC 497.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdul Matin Khasru, another learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners, submits that it is simply inconceivable that after rendition of continuous, uninterrupted and satisfactory service by the petitioners in BFCC, they will be thrown out on the street with empty hands on attainment of 57 years of age and the principle of equity demands that they be absorbed in the service of Biman.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdul Matin Khasru also submits that both the permanent and contractual employees manning BFCC are similarly situated and they must be treated alike; but strangely enough, the petitioners have been discriminated against in the matter of regularization of their service by Biman authority and such being the position, the inaction of Biman authority in not regularizing their service is violative of Article 27 of the Constitution.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdul Matin Khasru next submits that there is no gainsaying the fact that the Biman authority has made a material departure from the contracts of the petitioners in view of the fact that though they are  contractual employees, they have been given National Scales of Pay, gratuity  etc. just like permanent employees of Biman and from this angle, it can not be said by any stretch of imagination that the petitioners have not attained  any semblance of permanence  in their jobs; but the Biman authority has failed to take any steps for regularization of their service and as such, they have come  up with the instant Writ Petition for appropriate reliefs under Article 102 of the Constitution.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdul Matin Khasru further submits that it is in the Organization Order No. 13 of 1989 that the petitioners on being appointed on contractual basis will be governed by necessary Service Rules; but for reasons best known to the authority, the contemplated Service Rules have not been framed as yet, instead they are being governed by various Administrative Orders to their prejudice.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Mr. Abdur Razzaq, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 2, submits that  in view of Annexures-‘G’ and ‘G-1’  to the Writ Petition, it is abundantly clear that the modes of appointment of the permanent and contractual employees working in BFCC are different and in that view of the  matter, they can not be placed  or tied together  and the petitioners being contractual employees  are bound by the terms and conditions of their contracts and  they can not go beyond those terms and conditions  in any event.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdur Razzaq further submits that the petitioners have failed to show that not a single BFCC contractual employee was absorbed in the service of Biman at any point of time and as such the question of invocation of the principle of legitimate expectation does not arise at all.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdur Razzaq next submits that admittedly the petitioners have not challenged the legality of the contracts and it is not their case that they executed the contracts with BFCC under duress or intimidation or coercion or undue influence and consequently they can not give a go-by to the stipulations of the same.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdur Razzaq also submits that it is true that the petitioners were   given some benefits like gratuity, house rent, over-time allowance, scales of pay et el beyond the stipulations of the contracts; but those were given to them  ex gratia and on compassionate grounds and all those benefits /facilities are to their benefit and not to their prejudice and their claim  for regularization or absorption in the service of Biman has  only been made capitalizing on the  largesse offered to them by the Biman authority.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdur Razzaq next submits that there is no question of any discrimination between the permanent employees of Biman and the contractual employees like the petitioners working in BFCC inasmuch as they are governed  under separate regimes, though the differences in respect of service benefits between the two classes of employees have been considerably narrowed down; but none the less, it can not be held that the contractual employees have acquired the status of permanent employees necessitating their absorption in the service of Biman.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdur Razzaq also submits that the decisions relied on by Dr. M. Zahir in support of the case of the petitioners will not be of any avail to him in that those decisions deal either with temporary or casual or ad hoc employees and he  fails to  advert to any  decision of any jurisdiction to the effect that the contractual employees have been absorbed  permanently in the service  of the concerned department or organization because of their continuous, uninterrupted and satisfactory rendition  of service  for a good number of years.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdur Razzaq next submits that it is not comprehensible as to how this Court will issue a Writ of Mandamus particularly when the petitioners have signally failed to make out a case of a legal right for enforcement and a legal duty for performance on the part of the authority concerned and as the recommendations of various inquiry committees for absorption of the petitioners in the service of Biman are not justiciable, the Rule as issued in the instant Writ Petition must fail.<br/><br/>In support of the above submissions, Mr. Abdur Razzaq has relied on some cases, namely, Talekhal Progressive Fishermen Co-operative Society Limited….Vs….Bangladesh and others, 1981 BLD (AD) 103; Hazerullah….Vs…..Assistant Commissioner, Board of Management of Abandoned Property and others, 55 DLR (AD) 15; Yunus Mia (Md) and others….Vs…. The Secretary, Ministry of Public Works &amp; Urban Development, Government of Bangladesh and others, 45 DLR (HCD) 498; The Secretary, State of Karnataka and others….Vs… Umadevi (3) and others, (2006) 4 SCC 1 and the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax and others…Vs…. Susheela Prasad (SMT) and others (2007) 12 SCC 402.<br/><br/>We have heard the submissions of the learned Advocate Dr. M. Zahir and Mr. Abdul Matin Khasru and the counter-submissions of the learned Advocate Mr. Abdur Razzaq and perused the Writ Petition, Supplementary Affidavits, Affidavit-in-Opposition, Supplementary Affidavits-in-Opposition and relevant Annexures annexed thereto.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that initially the petitioners were appointed on contractual basis for a period of three or five years, as the case may be and subsequently their contractual periods were extended from time to time. It is admitted that they were first appointed on that basis in BFCC project and after the completion of the project, it became an affiliate body of Bangladesh Biman. It is also admitted that the Biman authority made a material departure from the contracts of the petitioners by awarding them various service benefits/ facilities at subsequent points of time by way of house rent, over-time allowance, gratuity etc. It is further admitted that all the petitioners are still working in BFCC. Given this scenario, a pertinent question arises: Whether the petitioners being contractual employees have acquired the status or right to be treated as permanent employees of Biman? In the facts and circumstances of the case, this moot question must be answered either in the affirmative or in the negative.<br/><br/>In this context, the Annexures-‘D’, ‘G’, ‘G-1’ and ‘E’ to the Writ Petition appear to be very vital documents for the purpose of adjudication of the Rule. Annexure-‘D’ to the Writ Petition is the Organization Order No. 13 of 1989 dated 11.11.1989. This Annexure-‘D’ reveals that with the establishment of BFCC, Biman Management has taken certain decisions and one of those decisions is the abolition of the Cabin Facilities Department.  Another decision is that all the existing employees of Cabin Facilities Department stand transferred to BFCC and they will be functionally and administratively responsible to BFCC Management.  On transfer, their service will be governed by the Regulations of 1979 or those as are amended from time to time and they will continue to receive salaries, allowances and other facilities of Biman as per their terms of engagement. The Annexure-‘D’ further shows that the service of newly-recruited employees of BFCC will be governed by BFCC Rules and Service Regulations and Biman service facilities and benefits will not be applicable to them.  So from Annexure-‘D’,  it is crystal  clear that the erstwhile  employees  of Cabin Facilities  Department working on deputation in BFCC as permanent employees of Biman and the petitioners being contractual employees working there are two distinct and separate classes of employees and are governed separately.<br/><br/>Undeniably, the deputationists working in BFCC as permanent employees  of Biman were initially  appointed  on contractual basis and subsequently in terms of Clause 6 of Annexure-‘G-1’ dated 11.01.2001, they were appointed permanently  in the service  of Biman, regard being had to their satisfactory service records  during contractual periods. But in contradistinction to Annexure-‘G-1’, there is no such clause in Annexure-‘G’ dated 05.09.1999 which governs the appointment of contractual employees. In the absence of any such clause in Annexure-‘G’ to the Writ Petition, there does not appear to be any scope for absorption of the petitioners in the service of Biman as permanent employees. This clause 6 in Annexure’G-1’ is, no doubt, a distinguishing feature which puts the contractual employees like the petitioners on a different footing. What we are driving at boils down to this:  had there been any stipulation as embodied in Clause 6 of Annexure-‘G-1’ in Annexure-‘G’, then the question of regularization of the petitioners, or for that matter, their absorption as permanent employees in the service of Biman would have arisen. By the way, Annexure-‘E’ to the Writ Petition may be taken into account. This Annexure-‘E’ is the agreement for contractual service. A reference  to Annexure-‘E’ positively indicates  that the contractual employees will not be entitled to the benefits of any provident fund, gratuity and group insurance  whatsoever, even though indisputably the benefit of gratuity has been  extended  to them at a later stage. The most striking feature of Annexure-‘E’ is this: the service of the contractual employees in BFCC is terminable at any time without assigning any reason by giving notice of 60 days. Taking Annexures-‘D’,’G’, ‘G-1’ and ‘E’ together, it leads us to the irresistible conclusion that the service of the contractual  employees of BFCC like the petitioners is terminable with prior notice. In other words, the relationship between the Biman authority and the petitioners is virtually that of master and servant.  The rule of master and servant necessarily and essentially applies to them.<br/><br/>Regulation 1(2)(b) of the Regulations of 1979 envisages that the Regulations shall  apply to the employees of the Corporation employed on contract to the extent not otherwise specified  in the instruments of contracts. As a matter of fact, the fate of the petitioners hinges upon the interpretation of Regulation 1(2)(b). From a bare reading thereof, it transpires that the contractual employees (petitioners) shall be governed by the Regulations of 1979 subject to the terms and conditions embodied in the instruments of contracts. At this juncture, Regulation 4(1) of the Regulations of 1979 appears to be of paramount importance. Regulation 4(1) contemplates that  an employee on contract is a person  with whom a specific contract of employment has been entered into. An employee on contract shall be bound by the Regulations except where otherwise expressly stated in the contract.  Precisely speaking, the petitioners shall only be governed by the Regulations of 1979 subject to the stipulations otherwise expressly stated in the contracts.  As observed earlier, the permanent employees working in BFCC were initially appointed on contract and subsequently they were appointed permanently in the service of Biman pursuant to clause 6 of Annexure-‘G-1’. It has already been adverted to above that there is no such clause in Annexure-‘G’. Such being the state of affairs, the express stipulations  in the instruments of the contracts executed by the petitioners shall be binding  upon them and in the absence of any specific stipulation to the contrary therein, they will be governed  by the relevant provisions of the Regulations of 1979.<br/><br/>The respondent no. 2, in this respect, rightly relies upon the legal dictum: “Expressio unius est exclusion alterius”. (Bangladesh …Vs… Abdul Mannan and others, 29 DLR (SC) 17), that is to say,  express mention of one thing implies exclusion  of others. The express mention of Administrative Orders in the contracts governing the terms and conditions of the service of the petitioners implies exclusion of operation of the Regulations of 1979.<br/><br/>It seems that Mr. Abdur Razzaq has rightly contended that the legality of the contracts is not in dispute. No allegation of fraud, coercion, intimidation, undue influence and malpractice has been levelled against the authority. The petitioners entered into the contracts of their own volition and with eyes wide open. The authority can not be blamed for their act of volition. They are employees on contract by choice, not by chance.<br/><br/>It necessarily follows that the impugned Clause (d) of the Organization Order No.13 of 1989 does not mete out any discriminatory treatment to the petitioners who are a class by themselves as distinguished from the regular/permanent employees of Biman working in BFCC on deputation. So the contention of Dr. M. Zahir that the said Order No.13 of 1989 is arbitrary and violative of Articles 27, 29, 31 and 40 of the Constitution falls through.<br/><br/>As the petitioners have chosen to be governed by the terms and conditions of their contracts and as they are bound by the Regulations of 1979 except where otherwise expressly stated in the contracts, we are not impressed by the omnibus contention of Dr. M. Zahir that the Organization Order No. 13 of 1989 has overridden the Regulations of 1979.<br/><br/>The upshot of the foregoing discussions is that there are ‘intelligible differentia’ or ‘permissible criteria’ between the two classes of employees working in BFCC, that is to say, the permanent and contractual employees. From this point of view, we find it difficult to hold that both the contractual and permanent employees working in BFCC are similarly situated. It has already been observed that various service benefits of permanent employees have been extended or awarded to the contractual employees. Does this place the contractual employees on a par with the permanent employees working in BFCC? The obvious answer is an emphatic no.<br/><br/>Although the differences between the permanent and contractual employees in respect of service benefits/facilities have been significantly bridged or narrowed down, even then they are not equals; rather they are unequals. The petitioners might have rendered continuous, uninterrupted and satisfactory service in BFCC, but that does not ipso facto entitle them to lay a claim to regularization of their service in Biman.<br/><br/>There is not an iota of doubt that necessary Service Rules or Regulations have not yet been framed by BFCC for the petitioners. It has been agreed upon that they will continue to be governed by various Administrative Orders and Instructions. As they are a consenting party thereto, they can not cash in on non-framing of any Service Rules or Regulations by BFCC.<br/><br/>As per Regulation 3 of the Regulations of 1979, there are as many as 8 (eight) types of employees, namely, (a) Employees on contract, (b) Permanent employees, (c) Probationers, (d) Temporary employees, (e) Substitute employees,(f) Casual employees, (g) Apprentice employees, and (h) Deputationists. It seems that every class of employees as provided in Regulation 3 is a distinct class and stands on a separate footing. So we opine that the petitioners being employees on contract are a class by themselves on the basis of this categorization as well.<br/><br/>Dr. M. Zahir has emphatically relied on the decision in the case of Bangladesh Biman Corporation represented by the Managing Director…Vs… Rabia Bashri Irene and others reported in 55 DLR (AD) 132 in support of the claim of the petitioners that their service is liable to be regularized or made permanent by the Biman authority. In that decision, it was held, inter alia, in paragraph 10:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“10…………………………………………………………………………………………………………….<br/>It is not disputed that the employees of batch nos. 1-27 of the writ-petitioners’ category although were employed on contract, but on satisfactory completion of initial period of employment, they have been absorbed permanently in the service of the Corporation. But in the case of the writ-petitioners, that has not been followed, rather on completion of the initial period of employment instead of renewal of their   agreement of employment, they were given fresh employment. Since some employees of the Corporation inter se standing in the similar situation have not been treated in the similar manner or, in other words, have been treated differently from others, the contention of the writ-petitioners that they have been discriminated against has rightly been found genuine by the High Court Division.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Reverting to the case in hand, we have already found that not a single contractual employee standing on the same footing with the petitioners has been absorbed in the service of Biman permanently at any point of time. So in that view of the matter, the facts and circumstances of the instant case are quite distinguishable from those of the case reported in 55DLR(AD)132. Consequently, the reference to that case does not appear to be of any avail to Dr. M. Zahir.<br/><br/>Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the decision in the case of Sheikh Abdus Sabur….Vs… Returning Officer, District Education Officer-in-Charge, Gopalganj and others reported in 41DLR (AD)  30 adverted to by Dr. M. Zahir does not seem to be of any help to him.<br/><br/>With regard to the other decisions relied on by Dr. M. Zahir, it transpires that those decisions have dealt with either temporary or casual or ad hoc employees/ appointees. The present writ-petitioners being contractual employees can not be bracketed with them in any case. Besides, the decision of the Indian Supreme Court in the case of the Secretary, State of Karnataka and others….Vs…. Umadevi (3) and others reported in (2006) 4 SSC 1 has already clinched the matter on this point. In that decision, paragraphs 47 and 48 are as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“47. When a person enters a temporary employment or gets engagement as a contractual or casual worker and the engagement is not based on a proper selection as recognized by the relevant rules or procedure, he is aware of the consequences of the appointment being temporary, casual or contractual in nature. Such a person can not invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for being confirmed in the post when an appointment to the post could be made only by following a proper procedure for selection and in cases concerned, in consultation with the Public Service Commission. Therefore, the theory of legitimate expectation can not be successfully advanced by temporary, contractual or casual employees. It cannot also be held that the State has held out any promise while engaging these persons either to continue them where they are or to make them permanent. The State can not constitutionally make such a promise. It is also obvious that the theory can not be invoked to seek a positive relief of being made permanent in the post.<br/>48.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………<br/>There is no fundamental right in those who have been employed on daily wages or temporarily or on contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be absorbed in service. As has been held by this Court, they can not be said to be holders of a post, since, a regular appointment could be made only by making appointments consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The right to be treated equally with the other employees employed on daily wages, can not be extended to a claim for equal treatment with those who were regularly employed. That would be treating unequals as equals. It can not also be relied on to claim a right to be absorbed in service even though they have never been selected in terms of the relevant requirement rules. The arguments based on Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution are therefore overruled.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the said decision, paragraph 52 runs as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“52. Normally, what is sought for by such temporary employees when they approach the Court, is the issue of a Writ of Mandamus directing the employer, the State or its instrumentalities, to absorb them in permanent service or to allow them to continue. In this context, the question arises whether a Mandamus could be issued in favour of such persons. At this juncture, it will be proper to refer to the decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in Rai Shivendra Bahadur (Dr.) V. Governing Body of the Nalanda College (AIR 1962 SC 1210). That case arose out of a refusal to promote the writ petitioner therein as the Principal of a college. This Court held that in order that a Mandamus may issue to compel the authorities to do something, it must be shown that the statute imposes a legal duty on the authority and the aggrieved party had a legal right under the statute or rule to enforce it. This classical position continues and a Mandamus could not be issued in favour of the employees directing the Government to make them permanent since the employees can not show that they have an enforceable legal right to be permanently absorbed or that the State has a legal duty to make them permanent.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the decision in the case of the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax and others….Vs…. Susheela Prasad (Smt) and others reported in (2007) 12SCC 402, the Indian Supreme Court referred to said Umadevi’s case and quoted with approval paragraph 33 of that case which is in the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“33. It is not necessary to notice all the decisions of this Court on this aspect. By and large, what emerges is that regular recruitment should be insisted upon, only in a contingency can an ad hoc appointment be made in a permanent vacancy, but the same should soon be followed by a regular recruitment and that appointments to non-available posts should not be taken note of for regularization. The cases directing regularization have mainly proceeded on the basis that having permitted the employee to work for some period, he should be absorbed, without really laying down any law to that effect, after discussing the constitutional scheme for public employment.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the above observations and findings of the Supreme Court of India and in the light of the facts and circumstances of the present case, we do not find any substance in the argument of Dr. M. Zahir that the “doctrine of continuous officiation” should be invoked for absorption/regularization of the petitioners in the service of Biman.<br/> <br/>Article 27 of our Constitution provides that all citizens are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of law. Sir Ivor Jennings in his “The Law and the Constitution” stated:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Equality before the law means that among equals, the law should be equal and should be equally administered, that like should be treated alike”.           </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>A.V. Dicey in his “Law of the Constitution” mentioned:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Equality before the law does not mean absolute equality of men which is a physical impossibility, but the denial of any special privileges by reason of birth, creed or the like, in favour of any individual and also the equal subjection of all individuals and classes to the ordinary law of the land administered by the ordinary law Courts.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the “Limitations of Government Power” by Rotundy and others, the phrase “equal protection of the law” was described in the following manner:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The equal protection clause guarantees that similar individuals will be dealt with in a similar manner by the Government. It does not reject the Government’s ability to classify persons or draw lines in creation and application of laws, but it does guarantee that those classifications will not be based upon impermissible criteria or be arbitrarily used to burden a group of individuals. Such a classification does not violate the guarantee when it distinguishes persons as ‘dissimilar’ upon some permissible basis in order to advance the legitimate interest of society.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Southern Rly Co. V. Greane, 216 U. S. 400, Day-J observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Equal protection of the law means subjection to equal laws, applying alike to all in the same situation.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Chandrachud-J, in the case of Smt. Indira Gandhi V. Raj Narayan, AIR 1975 SC 2279 described his idea of equality in the following words:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“All who are equal are equal in the eye of law, meaning thereby that it will not accord favoured treatment to persons within the same class.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On consideration of the views expressed by these distinguished Judges and Authors as to the meaning of the phrase “equality before law and equal protection of the law”, we do not think that we will be able to define this term in a better way. “Equality before law” is not to be interpreted in its absolute sense to hold that all persons are equal in all respects disregarding different conditions and circumstances in which they are placed or special qualities and characteristics which some of them may possess but which are lacking in others. The term “equal protection of law” is used to mean that all persons or things are not equal in all cases and that persons similarly situated should be treated alike. Equal protection is the guarantee that similar people will be dealt with in a similar way and that people of different circumstances will not be treated as if they were the same.  It has already been held that the petitioners and the permanent employees of Biman working in BFCC are not similarly situated. As they are not likes, they can not be treated alike in any view of the matter. That is the point.<br/> <br/>A promise made in the shape of a statement of policy or a procedure regularly adopted by the authority may give rise to what is called “legitimate expectation”, that is, expectation of a kind which the Court now enforces. Legitimate expectation gives the applicant sufficient “locus standi” for judicial review and in most cases, the legitimate expectation is confined to the right of a fair hearing before a decision which results in negativing a promise or withdrawing an undertaking is taken. The doctrine operates in the domain of public law and in an appropriate case constitutes substantive as well as procedural rights. The statement or practice giving rise to the legitimate expectation must be sufficiently clear and unambiguous, and expressed or carried out in such a way as to show that it was intended to be binding. <br/><br/>So it is our considered view that the legitimate expectation must stem from a promise in the shape of a statement of policy or a procedure regularly adopted by the authority. We have already discussed that not a single contractual employee standing on a par with the petitioners was ever absorbed in the service of Biman. In that view of the matter, the question of legitimate expectation as advanced on behalf of the petitioners stands negatived.<br/>Of course, it is undisputed that various inquiry committees made repeated recommendations for absorption of the petitioners in the service of Biman as permanent employees. It is also on record that the Ministry of Civil Aviation  and Tourism asked the Biman authority to supply  the relevant information  about their background to that  Ministry for doing the needful; but the Ministry did not receive any response therefrom in that regard. There is no dispute that those recommendations can not be enforced through the Writ Jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution in that they do not create any legal right in favour of the petitioners.<br/><br/>The second part of clause (2)(a)(i) of Article 102  of the Constitution  confers power on the High Court Division  to issue  writs in the nature   of Mandamus to compel a person  performing  functions in connection with the affairs  of the Republic or a local authority  to do  something that he is required by law to do. Such person must hold office of a public nature, that is, an office under the Constitution or a law relating to the affairs of the Republic or of a local authority. The Writ of Mandamus will be issued only when that public functionary has a public duty under a law and he refuses to perform his legal duty; the duty may be judicial, quasi-judicial or purely administrative.  The duty sought to be enforced must be a duty of a public nature, that is, a duty created by the provisions of the Constitution or a statute or some other rule of common law or some rules or orders or notifications having the force of law. The public duty need not, however, be always a statutory duty. No Writ of Mandamus will be issued to compel the Government to implement its policy nor will it be issued merely on consideration of equity.<br/><br/>In the case of Yunus Mia (Md.) and others….Vs…The Secretary, Ministry of Public Works and Urban Development, Government of Bangladesh and others reported in 45 DLR(HCD) 498 relied on by Mr. Abdur  Razzaq, it has been held that the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution can not issue any prerogative writ directing the Government  to implement its policy.<br/><br/>In the case of Talekhal Progressive Fishermen Co-operative Society Limited …Vs… Bangladesh &amp; others reported in 1981 BLD(AD) 103 referred to by Mr. Abdur Razzaq, it has been held that in order to entitle a person to ask for performance of a public duty  by Mandamus, it is necessary to show that he has a  legal right for claiming such performance, apart from the fact that he is interested  in the performance of the duty. <br/><br/>In the case of Hazerullah Vs. Assistant Commissioner, Board of Management of Abandoned Property and others reported in 55 DLR (AD)15 adverted to by Mr. Abdur Razzaq, it has been decided that one could only avail oneself of the forum by way of Mandamus for enforcement of any legal right or to redress the violation thereof.<br/><br/>In the case of the Queen …Vs…. Guardian of the Lewisham Union reported in (1897) 1 QB 498, it was held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“This Court would be far exceeding its proper functions if it were to assume jurisdiction to enforce performance by public bodies of all their statutory duties without requiring clear evidence that a person who sought its interference had a legal right to insist upon its performance.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the above discussions, it leaves no room for doubt that in order to invoke the prerogative Writ of Mandamus, the petitioners must have a legal right to be enforced and the Biman authority must have a legal duty to be performed. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we have no hesitation in holding that the petitioners have no legal right for enforcement and the Biman authority has no legal duty for performance.  Such being the legal position, our definite conclusion is that the petitioners can not enforce their claimed absorption or regularization in the service of Biman through issuance of a Writ of Mandamus.<br/><br/>There is no denying the fact that the petitioners being contractual employees have been provided with most of the service benefits/facilities of the permanent employees of Biman. Even  as per Annexure-‘Z-5’ dated 19.02.2009 to the Supplementary Affidavit filed to-day  on behalf of the petitioners, the service of the contractual employees is terminable on completion of 57 years of age just like the terminal point of the service of the permanent employees of Biman. It is true that the petitioners have rendered many years of service as contractual employees in BFCC. Admittedly the Biman authority has made a material departure from the instruments of contracts giving some additional benefits/ facilities to them in phases. According to Mr. Abdur Razzaq, those benefits/facilities have been awarded to them on compassionate grounds.  Anyway, as we see it, with the passage of time, the petitioners have acquired the status of quasi-permanency in their jobs. But nevertheless as they are bound by the terms and conditions of their contracts, they can not be absorbed permanently in the service of Biman unless and until they are recruited thereto in accordance with law. If we give the reliefs sought for in the present Writ Petition, that will be tantamount to re-writing the terms and conditions of their contracts. But that is not permissible in law.  In our opinion, both the contractual and permanent employees working in BFCC are so near and yet so far.<br/><br/>In the given facts and circumstances of the case, we strongly feel that there is always some scope for doing something more for the petitioners in view of their admitted continuous, uninterrupted and unblemished rendition of service in BFCC. Hopefully the Biman authority will continue its sustained and unremitting efforts   to ameliorate their lot.<br/><br/>However, in view of the discussions made above and in the facts and circumstances of the case, we find no merit in the Rule. The Rule, therefore, fails.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the Rule is discharged without any order as to costs.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Whenever any accused leads the evidence to rebut such presumption the burden again shifts to the complainant who is the holder in due course of the chque to proof by the legal evidence that the cheque was drawn in his favour for consideration. But in this case there appears nothing in the record to show that the complainant Rasel or complainant Nadim had taken any attempt to prove that they got the cheque from accused Badal for any consideration. It appears that the defence by the cogent evidence has been able to prove that the complainant Rasel had worked in the business firm of the accused Badal when he got some pages of the cheque and he using the said pages of the cheque </strong><strong>filed the case one in his own name and another</strong> <strong>by his maternal uncle Nadim. So, the conviction</strong><strong> and sentence of Muksedur Rahman Badal did not justify at all under section 138 of the </strong><strong>Negotiable Instruments Act.

Bashir Ullah, J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>These two criminal appeals under section 410 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (in short, the Code) have been taken up jointly for disposal as the facts of the two appeals are almost similar and common with a few differences in respect of the prosecution case but the defence cases are almost similar and all the points regarding the fact and law raised by the convict-appellant in both the appeals are almost common, as such, the same are being disposed of by this single judgment.<br/><br/>Criminal Appeal no. 6691 of 2011 has been preferred by the convict appellant Md. Muksedur Rahman Badal (in short, Mr. Badal) against the judgment and order dated 04.10.2011 passed by the Metropolitan Additional Sessions Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka in Metro Session Case no. 2154 of 2007 arising out of C.R Case no. 2121 of 2007 convicting the appellant under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (in short, the N.I. Act) sentencing him to suffer simple imprisonment for 6(six) months with a fine of Taka 21,27,000/- (twenty one lacs twenty seven thousand).<br/><br/>The Criminal Appeal no. 6692 of 2011 has been filed by the same appellant against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 04.10.2011 passed by the Metropolitan Additional Sessions Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka in Metro Session Case no. 133 of 2008 arising out of C.R Case no. 2592 of 2007 convicting the appellant under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 sentencing him to suffer to suffer simple imprisonment for 6(six) months with a fine of Taka 8,58,000/- (eight lacs fifty eight thousand).<br/><br/>The facts relevant for the disposal of the appeal no. 6691 of 2011, in short, is that Feroz Mahmood Rasel (in short, Mr. Rasel) as complainant filed a petition of complaint in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against the present appellant Mr. Badal alleging, inter-alia, that the complainant Mr. Rasel is the proprietor of Prantik Enterprise, a business firm and also a bonafide businessman. The accused in order to run his business took a loan of Taka 21,27,000/- (twenty one lacs twenty seven thousand) from the complainant on 20.04.2006. The accused in order to make payment of the said loan money drew a cheque on 26.11.2006 being cheque no. 0000441948 of his account no. 01-684 1678-01of Standard Chartered Bank, Bangladesh Ltd. The complainant in order to encash the said cheque presented the same at Sonali Bank, Amin Bazar on 02.04.2007 and the cheque was lastly dishonoured on 04.04.2007 for insufficient of fund. Thereafter, the complainant issued a legal notice on 29.04.2007 through his engaged Advocate requesting the accused for making payment of the cheque value. But the accused did not make payment pursuant to the said legal notice. Thereafter, the complainant under compelling circumstances filed the petition of complainant in the competent Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka on 21.06.2007. The Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka examining the complainant Mr. Rasel under section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure took cognizance of the said offence by his order dated 21.06.2007 and the case was registered as Complaint Case being no. 2121 of 2007.<br/><br/>The accused appearing in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate sought bail and he was granted bail and when the case became ready for trial the same was transmitted in the Court of  Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Dhaka where the case was registered as Metropolitan Sessions Case no. 2154 of 2007 and eventually the accused was put on trial before the Metropolitan Additional Sessions Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka where charge under section 138 of the N.I. Act against the accused Mr. Badal was framed to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>The prosecution in order to prove the charge examined one witness and submitted some papers which were marked as exhibit nos. 1-4 and on completion of recording of the evidence of the prosecution witness the accused was examined under section 342 of the Code when he repeated his innocence and expressed his desire for examining of the defence witnesses and accordingly the defence examined 5 witnesses in the case. The trial Court on consideration of the evidence and other materials on record found the appellant guilty and convicted and sentenced him as aforesaid. The convict Mr. Badal being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said judgment of the trial Court dated 04.10.2011 preferred Criminal Appeal no. 6691 of 2011 in this Court.<br/><br/>The facts relevant for disposal of the Criminal Appeal no. 6692 of 2011, in short, is that Md. Nadim as complainant filed a petition of complaint under section 138 of the N.I. Act against the accused Badal alleging, inter-alia, that the accused being a relative of the complainant had approached him for a loan of Taka 10,00,000/- (ten lacs) in the 1<sup>st</sup> week of January, 2006 and the complainant in responding of the said request gave Taka 8,58,000/- to him with the stipulation that he will return back the same within the month of March of the same year. Later on, the complainant Mr. Nadim asked the accused for making payment of the said loan money and last of all the accused drew a cheque on 04.12.2006 for Taka 8,58,000/- being cheque no. 0000441950 of his Standard Chartered Bank Bangladesh Ltd. The complainant Mr. Nadim presented the cheque on several occasions at Janata Bank, Elephant Road, Dhaka and lastly the same was dishonoured on 29.04.2007. Thereafter, the complainant issued a legal notice on 24.05.2007 requesting the accused Mr. Badal for making payment of the said amount and though the accused received the legal notice on 28.05.2007 but did not respond to the said legal notice and under the said compelling circumstances the complainant Mr. Nadim filed the petition of complaint on 26.07.2007 before Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka examining the complainant Mr. Nadim under section 200 of the Code took cognizance of the said offence against the accused Mr. Badal under section 138 of the N.I. Act and the case was registered as C.R Case no 2592 of 2007.<br/><br/>The accused Mr. Badal surrendering in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka sought bail and he was granted the same and when the case became ready for trial the same was transmitted into the Court of Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Dhaka where the case was registered as Metropolitan Sessions Case no. 133 of 2008 and eventually the accused was put on trial before the Court of Metropolitan Additional Sessions Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka. The trial Court framed charge against the accused under section 138 of the N.I. Act to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>The prosecution in order to prove the charge examined 1 witness and submitted some papers which were marked as exhibit nos. 1-4/1 and on completion of the recording of the prosecution evidence the accused was examined under section 342 of the Code when he repeated his innocence but expressed his desire to examine defence witnesses and ultimately the defence examined 4 witnesses in the case and submitted some papers also. The trial Court on consideration of the evidence and other materials on record found the accused Mr. Badal guilty under section 138 of the N.I. Act and convicted and sentenced him as aforesaid.<br/><br/>The convict appellant Mr.Badal being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment of the trial Court dated 04.10.2011 preferred the appeal being no 6692 of 2011 in this Court.<br/><br/>It has been told earlier that the defence cases are almost same in both the cases. The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses is the case of innocence, false implication and total denial of the prosecution case.<br/><br/>The further defence taken is that Feroz Mahmood Rasel is the brother’s son of accused Moksedur Rahman Badal who (Feroz Mahmood Rasel) used to work in the business firm of the accused as an employee from 2000 to 2005 and on those years the accused was sick, as such, he was not in a position to look after his business attentively. Most of the work of his business firm was done by the complainant Feroz Mahmood Rasel. Since Feroz Mahmood Rasel is the family member of the accused he (accused) trusted him much. As such, all the transactions of the business firm of the accused like collection of the money from the parties, depositing of the money in the banks and payment to the other business firm for purchasing goods were also done by the complainant Feroz Mahmood Rasel. Feroz Mahmood Rasel taking the advantage of the full trustness of the accused had grabbed some pages of the cheque of the accused and when the accused came to know that Feroz Mahmood Rasel has not been working honestly and sincerely and when it was also detected that some pages of the cheque books are missing and when the total activities of the complainant Feroz Mahmood Rasel became doubtful to the accused he had ousted him from the business firm of the accused but the complainant Feroz Mahmood Rasel using the stolen cheques filed two false cases, one in his own name putting a figure of Taka 21,27,000/- in the cheque and another by his cousin Md. Nadim putting Taka 8,58,000/- in that cheque. The complainants had no financial ability to give any loan to the accused.<br/><br/>It is the further defence Case that there was no consideration for the drawing of such a cheque in favour of Feroz Mahmood Rasel. The accused did not take any loan from Feroz Mahmood Rasel and he had no any financial capacity to give loan of such amount to the accused Muksedur Rahman Badal.<br/><br/>The complainant Feroz Mahmood Rasel was not satisfied using the cheque for Taka 21,27,000/- he also filed another case through Nadim who happens to be the cousin of Feroz Mahmood Rasel and nephew of Moksedur Rahman Badal. Feroz Mahmood Rasel using another cheque of the accused putting an amount at their sweet will for Taka 8,58,000/- filed another case being C.R Case no. 2592 of 2007. The accused had no any business transaction with Md. Nadim. The accused did not take any loan from Nadim and Nadim had no any financial capacity to give loan to the accused and the accused did not drew any cheque in favour of Nadim for the amount shown in the cheque. Both the cheques were written and prepared for the purpose of the cases and there was no any reason for the accused to draw the cheques in favour of the complainants. The accused was innocent and have become the victim of circumstances.<br/><br/>At the time of hearing of these appeals Mrs. Hosneara Begum, the learned Advocate appearing for the appellant Moksedur Rahman Badal assailing the judgments of the trial Court and supporting the petition of appeals submits that the accused is a established and rising businessman who has been running the business of sands and stones at Amin bazar, Dhaka and he is a very promising businessman of that locality but from 2002 he became sick as such he was not in a position to look after his business firm closely and regularly and to cover his such absence he had inducted one of the family member Feroz Mahmood Rasel who is nobody but his brother’s son to look after the business on his behalf and he Mr. Rasel had looked after of the business of the accused from 2002-2005. She further contends that the accused took treatment hither to thither trusting solely upon the complainant Feroz Mahmood Rasel who also had looked after the business properly at the early stage of his induction but at one stage he was misguided for the reasons best known to him. The complainant (Mr. Rasel) in discharging his duties in the business firm of the accused used to collect money from the parties, deposited the money in the banks and withdrew the same from the banks under and the cheque book of the accused was also in the custody of the complainant Mr. Rasel.<br/><br/>She further submits that in 2005 the accused found that some of the pages of his cheque book were missing and the total activities of the complainant Mr. Rasel had appeared to the accused very doubtful. Upon the above facts, the accused made a G.D entry recording the facts of missing of the cheques and the accused did not feel it suitable to continue Mr. Rasel from 2005 in his firm. Thereafter, he took the business in his own hand from Mr. Rasel but when he (Mr.Rasel) has been in the total responsibility of the business firm of the accused had taken away some of pages of the cheque book and using the same filed the case in his own name showing Taka 21,27,000/- being C.R Case no. 2121 of 2007 and another case in the name of his cousin Mr. Nadim putting a figure of Taka 8,58,000/-.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate further submits that the story of loan as canvassed in both the petitions of complaint is nothing but a myth. They had no any financial capacity to give the loan to the accused. Mr. Rasel was an employee in the business firm of the accused. How could he lend an amount of Taka 21,27,000/- to the accused. Md. Nadim also had no any financial capacity to give loan of a figure like Taka 8,58,000/- to the accused. As such, there was no minimum reason on the part of the accused to draw the said two cheques in their favour in order to make payment of the cheque value.<br/><br/>She also submits that the complainant Mr. Rasel using the signed cheques of the accused which he had taken away in between 2002-2005 filed two false cases and the accused in his defence adducing sufficient numbers of witnesses including the family members who are nobody but the brothers and sisters of the accused proved this defence case and those brothers and sisters of the accused are the uncle and fufu of Mr. Rasel. They as the family members must not favour the accused only. They stand in the same distance from Mr. Rasel and the accused Mr. Badal. But the trial Court measurably failed to consider the defence case as well as the unequivocal and nitid evidences of those defence witnesses and thus came to a wrong conclusion finding the accused guilty under section 138 of the N.I. Act.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate also submits that the trial Court did not at all consider whether the complainants had any capacity to give the loans of the projected amount to the accused and also did not consider whether the accused had drawn the cheques in favour of them in order to make payment of his debts. The learned Advocate in her concluding submissions submits that in a case under section 138 of the N.I. Act in order to assert the conviction of the accused, the prosecution is under duty bound to prove that the complainants were holders of the cheques in due course as provided in section 9 of the N.I. Act but the prosecution could not prove the same. The complainants had managed to file the case using the signed cheques of the accused which they had got earlier by fraudulent means. Thus, the judgment and the order of conviction and sentence has been suffering from gross illegality and the same cannot sustain at all. So, the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed upon the convict appellant by the trial Court in both the cases are liable to be set aside acquitting the convict appellant from the charges levelled against him.<br/><br/>On the other hand Mr. Md. Monowar Hossain, the learned Advocate appearing for the complainant-respondents in both the appeals supporting the judgment of the trial Court and opposing the appeals submits that the accused Moksedur Rahman Badol took a loan of Taka 21,27,000/- from Feroz Mahmood Rasel and also Taka 8,58,000/- from Md. Nadim. It is fact that both the complainants and the convict appellant are the relatives and that is why the convict was blessed with the said loans by the complainants but the convict failed to make payment of the said loan amount within the stipulated time, thus he drew two cheques in order to make payment of his such debts but the cheques were dishonoured by the Banks for insufficient of funds, thereafter both the complainants issued legal notice asking the convict for making payment of the cheques values but the convict intentionally did not respond to the claim of the complainants. Thus, the complainants finding no other alternative had filed the cases in the competent Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka and at trial both the complainants Feroz Mahmood Rasel and Md. Nadim deposing in the Court proved that the cheques were drawn by the convict appellant and also proved the prosecution case and the trial Court rightly believing the evidence of the prosecution witnesses convicted and sentenced the convict accordingly. The trial Court did not commit any error of law and fact in believing the prosecution case which has been proved by the very cogent and nitid evidence of the complainants. So, the judgment and the order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court in both the cases are not liable to be set aside. So, the appeals are liable to be dismissed with costs.<br/><br/>I have considered the above submissions and arguments of the learned Advocates of both the parties with profound attention and have gone through the materials on record particularly the petition of complaints, the oral evidence adduced by the parties, the documentary evidences and other materials on record meticulously.<br/><br/>On going to the materials on record, it appears that in Sessions Case no. 2154 of 2007 the prosecution examined one witness and the defence examined 5 witnesses and both the parties had adduced documentary evidences. Now, in order to appreciate the arguments advanced by the learned Advocates of both the parties before me, let the oral evidence adduced by the parties in both the cases be sift and discussed.<br/><br/>In Sessions Case no. 2154 of 2007 Feroz Mahmood Rasel was examined as PW 1 who testified in the Court that accused Moksedur Rahman Badal  in order to make payment of Taka 21,27,000/- had drawn a cheque being cheque no. 0000441948 of the Standard Chartered Bank Bangladesh Ltd on 26.11.2006, the cheque has been marked as exhibit 1. He further testified that the cheque was dishonoured for insufficient of fund on 04.04.2007. The dishonor slip has been marked as exhibit 2.

He further stated that he had filed the petition of complaint on 21.06.2007. The petition of complaint has been marked as exhibit 4.<br/><br/>In cross-examination of the defence, he has stated that the accused is the full brother of his father, he did not file any paper to show the ownership of the Prantik Enterprise, his father had 4 brothers and his father died in the year of 2005. He denied the defence suggestion that the accused is the owner of the Prantik Enterprise and Pentacle Intertrade and he cannot say who is the owner of Pentacle Intertratde. He denied the defence suggestion that he was an employee in the business firm of the accused from 2002-2005 and the cheques of the accused were in his custody and he filed the case using those cheques. He denied the further defence suggestion that he had no taka 21,87,000/- in his possession at any time.<br/><br/>The defence examined 5 witnesses in Sessions Case no. 2154 o 2007. DW 1 Alhaz Md. Moksedur Rahman, the accused himself testified that the complainant is his brother’s son, the father of the complainant Mr. Rasel was a patient of cancer and he had suffered a lot in the said disease, he (accused Badal) has been suffering from lecuderma disease for the last 15 years and he could not perform all type of jobs, particularly the jobs which has contact with the dust. He also stated that since the father of the complainant Mr. Rasel was ailing their financial condition was bad and at the same time since he could not go in the sun light and in the meantime the father Mr. Rasel died on 09.05.2000  as such he was appointed as an employee in his business firm as Manager-Cum-Cashier and all the works of his business firm were looked after by the complainant Mr.Rasel, who used to transact the money with the parties.<br/><br/>He further stated that on 15.12.2005 he had gone at Ramzan Super Market under Pallobi Police Station along with the complainant Mr. Rasel to settle an account with a party and when he came to know that a cheque book of Standard Chartered Bank Ltd is missing and on search he did not get it, on 16.12.2005 the complainant Mr. Rasel was asked to place the accounts when he found disparity in the accounts of his business firm and from then the complainant Mr. Rasel was dropped from his job, thereafter, he has been looking for his own business, he lodged a G.D entry with Pallobi Police Station on 17.12.2005 for the missing of the cheque book being G.D entry no. 1057, marked as exhibit ‘Ka’. He also stated that since the complainant Mr. Rasel was ousted from his business firm he was offering threat to him, on 15.05.2006 the complainant Mr. Rasel and his younger brother Jewel coming in his office assaulted him, he lodged an FIR to that effect with Savar Police Station. In the last part of 2007 he came to know that the complainant Mr. Rasel has filed a case under the provisions of N.I. Act against him and also came to know that the missing page of the cheque book has been used by Mr. Rasel which had been detected on 15.12.2005. He also stated that after some days he also came to know that another case has been filed by his nephew being case no. 139, in fact, that was also filed by Mr. Rasel, their family members took an attempt to settle the matter amicably and accordingly the complainant Mr. Rasel was requested to withdraw the case but he did not comply with such request whereupon all the relatives had set aside the relationship with Mr. Rasel.<br/><br/>DW 1 further stated that his financial condition is better, he did not take any loan from Rasel and he (Mr. Rasel) had no any financial capacity to give any loan to him, both the case were filed using the stolen cheques.

He further testified that for encashment of the cheque, the same was presented to his Bank repeatedly but lastly on 29.04.2007 it was dishonoured for insufficient of fund, the disnonoured slip has been marked as exhibit 2 series, thereafter, he issued legal notice through his engaged Advocate on 24.05.2007, the legal notice and other papers connected to the legal notice has been marked as exhibit 3 series, since the accused did not make payment of the said amount, he filed the petition of complaint on 26.07.2007 in the Court Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka, he proved the case and his signature on it, marked exhibit 4 and 4/1.<br/><br/>In cross-examination of the defence PW 1 stated that so far he knows the accused is a businessman of stones and sands, he had lended the money to the accused in the first week of January, 2006 but there was no any paper in support of the said transaction, he did not receive the cheque on the date of lending money, the accused is his cousin (fufato vi) and there was stipulation between them that the accused will return back the money within March, 2006. He further stated that he had deposed in Sessions Case no. 2154 of 2007 in favour of Feroz Mahmood Rasel who is his nepnew. He denied the defence suggestion that he filed the case relying on a cheque given by Feroz Mahmood Rasel in order to serve his purpose.<br/><br/>The defence examined 4 witnesses in Sessions Case no. 133 of 2008. DW 1 Muksedur Rahman Badal, the accused himself has testified that the complainant is his cousin (mamato bhai), the father of Mr. Rasel died of cancer disease, thereafter in compliance of the request of the near relatives he appointed Feroz Mahmood Rasel in his business firm as Manager-Cum-Cashier, on 15.12.2005 he and Feroz Mahmood Rasel had gone at Ramzan Super Market under Pallabi Police Station to settle an account with one of his business partner and he coming back in his house came to know that a cheque book of Standard Chartered Bank is missing and some of the pages of the said cheque were signed by him and some of the pages were unsigned, on 16.12.2005 he found some anomaly in the accounts of his business whereupon Feroz Mahmood Rasel was dropped from his business firm, on 17.12.2005 he filed a G.D entry being no. 1057 regarding the missing of the cheque and after almost one year and five months by the by he came to know that Mr.Rasel and the present complainant Nadim have filed the cases under the provisions of Negotiable Instruments Act against him. In fact both the cases were filed using the missing cheques which was noticed to him on 15.12.2005, the complainant Nadim in collusion with Mr.Rasel filed the present case.<br/><br/>In cross-examination of the prosecution DW 1 denied the prosecution suggestion that after the death of the father of Mr.Rasel he used to look after the business firm namely Prantik Enterprise belonged to the father of Mr.Rasel. He denied the further suggestion that he did not go to Ramzan Super Market with Rasel. He cannot say exactly how many pages were lost and also cannot say how many pages were signed and unsigned. One cheque book was in the custody of Rasel. He denied the further prosecution suggestion that no cheque has been lost from him and he drew the cheque in order to make payment of his debts in favour of the complainant Nadim.<br/><br/>DW 2 Abdul Haque Badal, the full brother of accused Muksedur Rahman Badal has testified that complainant Nadim is his cousin (mamato bhai). Rasel had stolen the chque of the accused and using the same filed this case and another case. In cross-examination of the prosecution DW 2 stated that they sat two/three years ago for amicable settlement of the dispute but cannot say the exact date. They asked the complainant to withdraw the case. He denied the prosecution suggestion that Rasel did not steal the chqeue.<br/><br/>DW 3 Nurul Haque Rubel, the full brother of accused testified that complainant Nadim is his mamato bhai, the present case is false, Rasel used to serve in the company of the accused Badal and since they were some anomaly in the accounts of the business firm of accused Badal, he ousted Mr.Rasel and Mr.Rasel ultimately using the cheques which he got at the time of serving in the business firm of the accused filed one case in his own name and another through Nadim. In cross-examination of the prosecution DW 3 stated that he cannot say how many cheques were in the custody of Rasel. He denied the prosecution suggestion that since the accused is his full brother he has deposed falsely in his favour.<br/><br/>DW 4 Khorsheda Khatun, the full sister of the accused testified that Nadim is his cousin (mamato bhai), some cheques were lost from the custody of the accused Badal. Thereafter, they heard it that Rasel and Nadim have filed the cases against Badal. They requested the complainants to withdraw the case but they did not pay heed to it. In cross-examination of the prosecution she stated that 3-4 years ago the cheques were lost whereupon Badal lodged G.D entry and they took an attempt to settle the matter. She denied the prosecution suggestion that he has deposed falsely favouring his full brother accused Muksedur Rahman Badal.<br/><br/>These are the evidences that have been given by the prosecution and defence in both the cases.<br/><br/>From the evidence discussed so far it appears that in both the cases the defence case are same that Feroz Mahmood Rasel has been serving in the business firm of the accused from 2000-2005 and when all the papers of the business firm of the accused were in the custody of Rasel, he had taken some of the pages of the cheque behind the knowledge of accused and thereafter using the same, have filed two cases, one in his own name and another through his maternal uncle Nadim.<br/><br/>On the other hand the prosecution case is that both the complainants had lended money in different figure to the accused and the accused in order to make payment of the said loan money drew cheques in favour of the complainants.<br/><br/>Before amendment of section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act by the Act no. XVII of 2000 dated 6<sup>th</sup> July there was an open privilege for the accused to make out a case directly that he did not draw the cheque to discharge in whole or in part of any debt or other liability but in 2000 section 138 of the N.I. Act has been amended in our country omitting the following words from the section:<br/><br/><em>         “for the discharge in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability”.</em><br/><br/>Therefore, from 2000, that is, from the amendment of section 138, there appears serious hurdle on the part of the accused to claim that he did not draw the cheque to discharge any liability or debt. But the term “holder in due course” of the cheque as envisaged in section 138 has been defined in section 9 of the N.I. Act in the following manner:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><em>9. “Holder in due course”-</em></strong><em>“Holder in due course” means any person who for consideration becomes the possessor of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque if payable to bearer, or the payee or indorsee thereof, if payable to order, before it became overdue, without notice that the title of the person from whom he derived his own title was defective.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the plain reading of section 9 of the N.I. Act it appears that when a person becomes the holder in due course of a cheque he must get it for consideration leaving the scope to get it without any consideration.<br/>The defence from the very beginning of the cases had canvassed that there was no any consideration for drawing of the cheques in favour of the complainants. But section 118 of the Act has given some privileges to the holder of a cheque. Section 118(a) of the Negotiable Instruments Act runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em><strong> 118. Presumptions as to negotiable instruments</strong> <strong>of consideration</strong> -Until the contrary is proved, the following presumption shall be made;<br/>(a) That every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for consideration, and that every such instrument, when it has been accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred, was accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred for consideration. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the plain reading of section 118(a) of the N.I. Act it appears that unless the contrary is proved there is a presumption that every negotiable instrument was drawn for consideration, that is, the complainant of a case presumed to have got the cheque for consideration.<br/><br/>Now from the discussion and citations made above what has been found is that in a case under section 138 of the N.I. Act, the payee or the holder of the cheque enjoys some legal privileges which has been enunciated in section 9 and 118 of the N.I. Act. In defining the ‘holder in due course’, section 9 provides that the holder in due course, means any person who for consideration becomes the possessor of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque. This indicates that whenever a person will be holder in due course, he must become holder in due course for consideration and section 118 of the N.I. Act has given more privileges to the holder in due course which provides that until the contrary is proved it is to be presumed that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for consideration, that is, the law itself prescribed a privilege in favour of the holder of a cheque that for consideration the cheque was drawn in his favour but this presumption is a rebutable presumption.<br/><br/>‘Presumption’ means to take anything without verification or prove or in other words an idea that is taken to be true on the basis of probability, as such, I find that whenever a cheque is drawn in favour of a person he enjoys a presumption that the cheque was drawn for some consideration but this presumption is a rebutable presumption . That is, the accused has a right to offer the evidence to prove that the said inference or presumption is not correct and the law has given the said privilege to the accused also, as the very section 118 of the N.I. Act starts with the words ‘until the contrary is proved’ that means the defence has the authority to prove the contrary fact of the presumption that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for consideration in favour of the holder in due course.<br/><br/>The convict appellant in the two cases in order to rebut the presumption has come forward with the strong defence case that Feroz Ahmed Rasel had worked in his firm from 2002 to 2005 and within that period he used to manage all the affairs of his business and he used to deposit the money, withdraw the same and maintained the accounts of the business etcetera and taking the advantage of the same, he kept the cheque in his custody and whenever he was driven away from the business firm of the accused, he used the same in filing of two cases, one in his own name and another one in the name of his maternal uncle Mr.Nadim.<br/><br/>On the other hand complainant Feroz Mahmood Rasel all through of the case even at this stage of the hearing of the appeal categorically asserted that he did not serve in the business firm of the accused and the accused in order to discharge the liability issued the cheque and the same assertion has also been made by another complainant Mr.Nadim who is nobody but his (Rasel) maternal uncle.<br/><br/>Moksedur Rahman Badal as  DW 1 in Sessions Case no. 2154 of 2007 categorically stated that Rasel had worked in his business firm of stones and sands as Manager-Cum-Cashier. DW 2 Azizur Rahman and DW 3 Abdul Haque, who are the full brothers of accused Moksedur Rahman Badal and at the same time father’s brothers of Rasel, Asuda Khatun and Khorsheda Khatun who are the fufus of Rasel and full sisters of accused Badal and DW 3 Nurul Haque Rubel of Sessions Case no. 133 of 2008, the full brother of accused Muksedur Rahman Badal Stated that Rasel had worked in the firm of Moksedur Rahman Badal. They were cross examined extensively by the Prosecution but there such evidence that complainant Mr. Rasel had worked in the business firm of accused has not been shaken away in any way.<br/><br/>Thus it is found that three full brothers and two sisters of the accused who are the uncles and fufus of accused Mr. Rasel in a clear and chorus voice very consistently testified that Rasel had worked in the business firm of the accused. It is difficult for any prudent man to disbelieve the evidence of such witnesses as both the complainant Rasel and accused Badal stand on the same distance of those witnesses. So, from the oral evidence adduced by the defence it has been proved very strongly that Rasel had worked in the business firm of the accused as his helping hand.<br/><br/>Over and above, the defence has submitted many papers to show the activities of Rasel in the business firm of the accused. The defence submitted a paper of grameen phone company by which Feroz Mahmood Rasel took a SIM from the same company, marked exhibit Tha-1 where there appears an initial signature of Feroz Mahmood Rasel. The defence submitted 52 deposit slips of bank, marked exhibits “Uma series” to show that by those deposit slips Rasel had deposited money on the various dates in the Dhaka Bank when he was in the business firm of the accused. Those deposit slips bear the initial signature of Rasel as depositor of money. Both the initial signatures appear in the deposit slips and the papers of the grameen phone are of the same man. Which established that Rasel as manager of the accused deposited money in the bank.<br/><br/>Over and above, the defence submitted one khata, the exhibit ‘chha’ and one ledger book, the exhibit ‘jha’ to prove that those khatas were maintained by the complainant Rasel in the business firm of the accused. There is nothing in the record to show that Rasel took any attempt to discard this evidence in order to establish his non involvement in the business firm of the accused.<br/><br/>The complainant Rasel did not challenge those documentary evidences in any manner. As such, relying on the oral evidence of the defence as well as the documentary evidence discussed so far.  I find that though Rasel was in the business firm of the accused from 2002 to 2005 but for taking some undue advantage in the cases had denied the same.<br/><br/>As I have told it earlier that though from section 138 of the N.I Act the words “for the discharge in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability” has been omitted in 2000 by the amendment but section 118(a) of the N.I Act still allows the defence to rebut the presumption that the cheque was drawn for any consideration. The defence in this case adducing sufficient evidence proved that Rasel had worked in the business firm of the accused and taking the advantage of the same he got the cheques and used the same.<br/><br/>In answering the above defence case, there appears no attempt on the part of the complainants to prove that they got the cheque for any consideration. When the defence can prove that the cheque was drawn without any consideration the onus again shifts to the complainant to show and to prove that the cheque was drawn  for consideration. In the case of Bharat Barrel &amp; Drum Manufacturing Company-Vs-Amin Chand Payrelal (1999) 3 SCC 35 it was held by the Supreme Court of India in the following manner:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>   “Upon consideration of various judgments as noted hereinabove, the position of law which emerges is that once execution of the promissory note is admitted, the presumption under section 118(a) would arise that it is supported by a consideration. Such a presumption is rebuttable. The defendant can prove the non-existence of a consideration by raising a probable defence. If the defendant is proved to have discharged the initial onus of proof showing that the existence of consideration was improbable or doubtful or the same was illegal, the onus shift to the plaintiff who will be obliged to prove it as a matter of fact and upon its failure to prove would disentitle him to the grant of relief on the basis of the negotiable instrument. The burden upon the defendant of proving the non-existence of the consideration can be either direct or by bringing on record the preponderance of probabilities by reference to the circumstances upon which he relies. In such an event, the plaintiff is entitled under law to rely upon all the evidence led in the case including that of the plaintiff as well. In case, where the defendant fails to discharge the initial onus of proof by showing the non-existence of the consideration, the plaintiff would invariably be held entitled to the benefit or presumption arising under section 118(a) in his favour. The Court may not insist upon the defendant to disprove the existence of consideration by leading direct evidence as the existence of negative evidence is neither possible for contemplated and even if led, is to be seen with a doubt.”<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">From the above findings of the Supreme Court of India it appears that if the accused can discharge the initial onus to have no consideration for drawing of cheque in favour of the complainant, the latter will be under legal obligation to prove that the accused drew the cheque to clear any bebt or other liability failing which he is not entitled to get any relief and in view of the above legal position, the complainant Rasel in order to discharge his such liability that he got the cheque for any consideration did not lead any evidence in this case. He and another complainant simply has stated in their evidence that accused Muksedur Rahman Badal in order to satisfy their debts drew the cheques in their favour. But the definite case of the defence is that Rasel and Nadim had no any financial capacity to give any loan to the accused. As it has been found that Rasel was the employee in the business firm of the accused from 2002 to 2005. So, the lending of money by Rasel to his uncle accused Muksedur Rahman Badal appears to be very farce which have no legs to stand at all. And though Nadim was not a staff of the accused but Nadim also could not lead any evidence in the case to show his financial ability that he can lend Taka 8,58,000/- to the accused.<br/> <br/>Moreover, can a court of law rely on the evidence of PW 1 Feroz Mahmood Rasel who as PW 1 in Metro Sessions Case no. 2154 of 2007 stated in his cross-examination in the following ways:</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><br/>“আমি প্রান্তিক এন্টারপ্রাইজের মালিক আমি, পেন্টাকল ইন্টারঢ্রে~ড এর মালিক কে বলতে পারব না”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Exhibit ‘Ta’ will go to show that Feroz Mahmood Rasel filed C.R Case no. 29 of 2007 before the Magistrate Court, Dhaka against Muksedur Rahman Badal inserting his (Badal) address as proprietor of Pentacle Intertrade. Thus, it reveals that Rasel is a man did not know how a man tell the truth. So, there is no scope to rely on the oral evidence of PW 1 Md. Rasel that he had lended money more than taka 21,00,000/- to his uncle Muksedur Rahman Badal.<br/><br/>The defence proved the copy of a diary dated 17.12.2005 being Pallabi Thana G.D in 1051 which has been marked as exhibit ‘Ka’ and through the said diary Muksedur Rahman Badal informed the Police Station that a cheque book of Standard Chartered Bank with some pages have been lost. Though in the said G.D entry there appears no cheque numbers but as I have found from the reported case of Indian Supreme Court that whenever the accused adducing sufficient evidence rebuts the presumption that cheque was drawn for consideration the burden of proof heavily shifts and lies upon the complainant to show that cheque was drawn for consideration. From the whole record I find nothing to hold that for any consideration the cheques were drawn in favour of the complainant Rasel and Nadim. The trial Court without taking consideration of the defence case as well as the evidences led by the defence and without going into the root of the facts involved with the case found the accused guilty very arbitrarily in both the cases.<br/><br/>From the discussions made above, I am of the opinion that the trial Court totally failed to consider the facts of the case as well as the law involved with a case under section 138 of the N.I Act.<br/><br/>In this case the other issues particularly issuing of the legal notice, presentation of the cheque within time is not at all disputed. So, there is no necessity to give any attention to those points.<br/><br/>In a case under section 138 of the N.I Act, the legal presumption exists in favour of the “holder in due course of the cheque” that he got the cheque for consideration and that has been ensured by the provisions of sections 9 and 118 of the N.I Act but at the same time this presumption is a rebuttable presumption. Whenever any accused leads the evidence to rebut such presumption the burden again shifts to the complainant who is the holder in due course of the chque to proof by the legal evidence that the cheque was drawn in his favour for consideration. But in this case there appears nothing in the record to show that Rasel or Nadim had taken any attempt to prove that they got the cheque from Badal for any consideration. So, in my consideration the defence by the cogent evidence has been able to prove that Rasel had worked in the business firm of the accused Badal when he got some pages of the cheque and he using the said pages of the cheque filed the case one his own name and another by his maternal uncle Nadim. So, the conviction and sentence of Muksedur Rahman Badal did not justify at all under section 138 of the N.I. Act.<br/><br/>In the result, both the appeals are allowed. The order of conviction and sentence of accused Muksedur Rahman Badal dated 04.10.2011 passed by the Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka in Metro Sessions Case no. 2154 of 2007 and 133 of 2008 are herby set aside.  The convict-appellant is acquitted from the charge of both the cases. The accused is entitled to withdraw the money as deposited in the Court at the eve of filing of the appeals.<br/><br/>Let a copy of this judgment and order along with the lower Court’s record be sent to the concerned Court for information and necessary action.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Iqbal Kabir, J: </u></strong><br/> <br/>This Jail Appeal has been preferred by the convict appellant under section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure having arisen out of the order of conviction and sentence dated 25<sup>th</sup> March, 2010 passed by the Joint Sessions Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Bagerhat  in Sessions  Case No. 313 of 2009, arising out of Mongla P.S Case No.- 04 dated 07-10-2008 corresponding to GR No. 164 of 2008 convicting the present appellant under  section  395 of the Penal Code and sentencing him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and also to pay a fine of Taka 10,000/- in default to suffer imprisonment for a further period of 2 years.<br/><br/>The facts relevant for disposal of the appeal, in brief is that on 07-10-08, the Informant Md. Nurul Islam of village- West Shehalabunia, Zia Sarok, Police Station- Mongla, Bagerhat lodged an  ezaher, alleging, inter alia that on 6<sup>th</sup> September, 2008 after finishing dinner and completing all other works, informant went for sleep in his own room, all other family members also slept in their respective rooms; at about 2.30 am, 7/8 unscrupulous people somehow opened the door and entered  into the informant’s rooms; there after they wake and found 4/5 people with deadly weapon stood beside his bed. They introduced themselves as dacoits, there after they went to others and wake up them and create pressure upon them and showing threat, ask for key of the almeria. Thereafter, they opened the almeria and took ornaments, cash, Nokia Mobile phone, Video Camera and necessary belongings; the value of those  would be Tk. 2,99375/.  The age of the dacoits would between18-25 years; all of them used local languages, and their faces were covered with cloth. They left the place at about 3.45 am and before leaving they also threatened them and locked the door from the outside.<br/><br/>After investigation, police submitted charge sheet being No. 44 dated 30-04-09 under section 395 and 397 of the Penal Code against the present appellant along with 5 others. At the time of trial, charge was framed against said accused under section 395 and 397 of the said Code. The charge as framed was read over to the accused persons present in the dock to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Only the appellant as  trial prisoner, Roni, pleaded guilty of the offence charged under section 395/397 of the Penal Code, upon consideration of plea of  guilt, the learned Judge of the concerned court clearly explained him the charge, and mentioned the consequence of admission of guilt and shall be fraught with punishment like imprisonment for life. But the accused, Roni is found stick to his decision. Then he was brought to the witness box and his statement in brief was recorded in the deposition sheet comprising of two pieces of paper. After recording such plea of guilt it was read over and then the accused put his signatures in both pages terming it true and correct.<br/><br/>On perusal of the prosecution case, it appears that the occurrence took place at 2.30 AM on 7.10.2008 and accused, Roni was arrested just on the following day that is, on 8.10.2008 and on the same day made exculpatory confessional statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the Magistrate. Accused Roni in his confessional statement said that he is a Motor-van driver and was compelled to commits robbery. The other accused pointing deadly weapon forced him to attend in the robbery. He went on saying that his accomplices took away 3 mobile sets, gold ornaments and cash while he claimed as his share but the accomplices didn’t  give him share, rather they put him in fear of death and assaulted him.<br/><br/>Under the facts and circumstances, trail court made a comparison between two above quoted statements with due cautions. One confessional statement under section 164 of the Code made just on the following day of the date of occurrence and without resorting police remand. The 2nd one is admission of guilt, when the charge under section 395/397 is framed, read over and explained repeatedly to accused Roni by the court when the very consequences were brought to his notice clearly and separately. It needs to quote here that the accused Roni has been in jail custody since 08-10-2008, and during this period of 1½ years he gets company of numerous convicts, accused, under the facts and circumstances the confessional statement under section 164 of the Code and the admission of guilt after understanding the charge carry special importance. Both the statement seems to be true, voluntary and credible.<br/><br/>On the basis of the confessional statement and admission of guilty the Joint Sessions Judge convicted and sentenced the appellant as aforesaid.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the Judgment and order of conviction and sentence Md. Roni preferred the instant Jail Appeal. Subsequent to the admission of the Appeal it is taken up for disposal by this Judgment.<br/><br/>The case of the accused appellant as made out in his application for Jail Appeal is that the accused appellant is innocent and he has been falsely implicated in the aforesaid occurrence; he is poor and has no person to conduct the case, the Judge of the trial court without proper analysis of record decided the case and illegally convicted the appellant, as such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>Perused the application for Jail Appeal, examined the material evidence available on the record, scrutinized the preposition and confessional statement, and admission of guilty of the accused and gone through the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence.<br/><br/>On perusal of the Trial Court’s record, it appears that the charge against the convict appellant was under section 395/397 of the Penal Code. For proper disposal of the appeal let us examine those material evidences, admission of guilty and confessional statements made by appellant and order passed by the Trial Court. <br/> <br/>We have strictly examined the above testimony and perused the FIR, Charge Sheet and other materials on record. It is seen that accused Roni is a poor man and he has no one who can assist to contest the case. The record suggest that the accused soon after arrest made a confessional statement on 8-10-08 under section 164 of the Code, which is exculpatory as he in his confessional statement stated as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">‘‘আমার ১ টি টমটম গাড়ি [ভ্যানের সাথে ২ দিনযুক্ত] আছে। সেটি আমি চালায় এবং যাত্রী বহন করি। ০৬.১০.২০০৮ ইং তারিখে আনুমানিক ৮.০০ টার দিকে পূজায় যাওয়ার জন্য লোকজনকে নিয়ে জয়মুনিতে যাই। জয়মুনিতে আমি রাত্র ৯.০০ সময় পৌছাই। ৯.২৫ মিনিটের সময় চলে আসি এবং পৌর এলাকার গেটের নাকো কাইনমারী ব্রিজের উপরে গাড়ি রাখি। গেট দারোয়ান না থাকায় আমি গাড়ির উপরে ঘুমিয়া যাই। হঠাৎ করে ব্রিজের নিচে ১টি নৌকা এসে দাড়ায়। নৌকা থেকে রাজু,ঘামা ইদ্রিস, সেলিম আরও ১ জন অজ্ঞাত আমার গাড়ির সামনে আসে। তাদের হাতে ধারালো অস্ত্র ছিল। আমি বলি আপনারা কোথাও যাবেন নাকি? তাহারা বলে পৌর  এলাকার ভিতরে যাবে। আমি বলি গেট বন্ধ যাওয়া যাবে না । বলে তুই চল আমাদের সাথে। আমি বলি আমার গাড়ি  চুরি হয়ে যাবে। এই জন্য আমি যাব না। আমি যাব না বলে তারা আমাকে হত্যার হুমকি দেয় এবং সিগন্যাল টাওয়ারে দেরি করে। আমাকে তাহাদের সাথে নিয়ে যাইয়া এলাকার ডাকাত খোকন, কালু , মানিক, বাবুও অন্যান্য ব্যক্তিদের সাথে তাহারা একত্র হয়। পরবর্তী গ্রাম পুলিশ মেহালুবু মিয়া, নুরুল ইসলাম এর বাড়িতে ডাকাতের উদ্দেশ্য ঢোকে রাত্র ৩.০০ টার সময়। আমি বুঝতে পারি যে হয়ত কোনো মানুষকে খুন করার জন্য এসেছে। পরে দেখি তিনজন মানিক,আলী হোসেন ও শহীদ কে আমার কাছে রেখে তাহারা [রাজু, ঘামা, কালু খোকন, ইদ্রিস, সেলিম, বাবু] ঘরের ভিতর চলে যায়। ঘরের ভিতর থেকে ৩টি মোবাইল , অলাংকার ও কিছু টাকা বের করে নিয়ে আসে। ঘরের ভিতর লোকজন ৩ জন মেয়ের কান্না শুনি। আমাকে বলে মালগুলি এখন ভাগ হবে না, বিকাল বেলায় জয়মুনি এলাকায় যাইয়া ভাগ হবে। আমি বলি কিছু মাল দিতে তাহারা আমাকে মাল না দিয়ে দুই/ তিনটা লাথি মেরে অস্ত্রে ভয় দেখাইয়া বলে যায়। তারপরে আমি  আমার গাড়ীর কাছে যাই ব্রিজের নিকট। পরের দিন সকালে ঘটনার বিষয় শরীফ, করিম ও ১ মহিলা জান্নাত কে বলি। পরে মোংলা বন্দরের  সামনে হইতে পুলিশ আমাকে গ্রেফতার করে। আমাকে জোর করে তাদের সাথে নিয়ে গিয়েছিল।’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>We find some basic loopholes in the judgment, as which the Judgment does not conform the minimum requirements of law,it is difficult for us to hold the same was made in full compliance to the provision of legal requirement as it appears that the  statement and admission of guilty are not voluntary and true,  which will be apparent on the following discussions.<br/> <br/>In this matter the prosecution has examined no witness to narrate the prosecution case. The Joint Sessions Judge has narrated the prosecution case and reproducing the FIR version, charge sheet and other documents. The narration of the prosecution case should be those statements, which are needed to be made on oath by a witness in court with reference to the criminal offence.<br/> <br/>The allegations made in the FIR and charge sheet cannot, in any way, be taken as the prosecution case to prove the case.<br/> <br/>The Joint Sessions Judge framed charge against the appellant under section 395 and 397 of the Penal Code, without specifying the contents of these sections. However, the record suggests that no formal or proper charge was framed against the appellant at the time of trial on 25-03-2010. The record further suggested that statement has been recorded in a plain paper, wherein no signature of the Magistrate found and nothing has been stated which supposed to make by the Magistrate.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“In the case of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman vs State it was observed that it is fundamental principle of criminal law that the accused should be informed with certainty and accuracy the exact value of the charge brought against him, so that he may not be prejudice in taking his defence. It is, therefore imperative that before a person is convicted of an offence he should be, subject to certain exceptions, formally charged with having committed the offence specific and be given an opportunity to defend himself against charge (Reported  in 55 DLR-pg-393)”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Though charge is a precise formulation of the specific accusation made against person who is entitled to know its nature at the very earliest stage. Since no formal charge was framed against the accused, naturally he could not get any opportunity to take defence against any allegation made therein. It is clear from the record that statement has been recorded in a plain paper, wherein no signature of the Magistrate found and nothing has been stated which supposed to make by the Magistrate.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“A statement under section 164 of the Cr.PC cannot be used as substantive evidence; apart from that confessional statement in a plain paper without the narration of the questions and answers would not by itself, make it inadmissible in evidence. Certificate given by the Magistrate, who had recorded the confessional statement, as to what had happen, how he warned and gave time for reflection to the person confessing, how yet he insisted on making confession and his admitting the same to be correct and the Magistrate‘s believing the same to be voluntary ought to be treated as conclusive evidence facts stated therein unless shown to be otherwise (43 DLR 389)”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is also found in the record that the day when the accused was arrested, on that day the accused was produced before the Magistrate, he made a confessional statement and which is exculpatory. This kind of confessional statement would be used in cross-examination.<br/><br/>In the case of Azed Sheikh reported in 41 DLR page-62, it is held that the recording Magistrate did not make any genuine effort to find out the real character of the confession. Omissions in the filling up of many paragraphs cast serious doubt upon the voluntary character of confessional statement”.<br/> <br/>The alleged statement made under section 164 of the Code is not a statement as because it has made in a plain paper having no authenticity marks therein. Nothing has followed as specified in the law; as such in the eye of law there is no scope to accept it as a statement made under section 164 of the Code.<br/> <br/>Though the accused pleaded guilty and on the basis of the admission of guilty the accused was convicted under section 395 of the Penal Code, we have strictly examined the above testimony of the accused and perused the same, where the accused stated as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ আমি দোষি। আমি দোষ স্বীকার করি। আমার কিছু বক্তব্য আছে। আমি একজন নিন্ম বিত্ত পরিবারের ছেলে। আমার মামলা পরিচালনার মত কেহ নাই। বিগত ২ বৎসরের মধ্যে একটি জামিনের প্রার্থনা দিতে পারি নাই। আমি, রাজু, সহিদুল ও বাবুল এই চার জনে ঐ বাড়ী ডাকাতি করা উদ্দেশ্যে যাই। আমার ডাকাতি করি। পুলিশ আমাকে পরের দিন বিকাল ৫.০০ ঘটিকার সময় গ্রেফতার করে । আমাকে থানায় খুব  torture  করে। পুলিশ আমাকে করে বাকী আসামীদের নাম বলায়। বাকী আসামীদের আমি চিনি না বা তারা এই ঘটনায় জড়িত ছিল না। আমার সঙ্গীয় বাবুল এর বাড়ী সোনাইলতলা, থানা-রামপাল, জেলা: বাগের হাট। আমার মোবাইল সেট ও স্বর্নালঙ্কার ডাকাতি করিয়া নেই। ঘরের লোকজনকে ভয় দেখানোর জন্য আমাদের কাছে ছুরি ছিল।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Now the most pertinent question is whether in the instant case the alleged admission of the guilt by the accused was legally and properly recorded as required under section 243  Code of Criminal Procedure.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>‘‘আমি দোষি। আমি দোষ স্বীকার করি। আমার কিছু বক্তব্য আছে।’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the above, it is clear that the alleged admission of guilt was not at all recorded as nearly as possible in the words used by the accused. The reply does not at all appear to be recorded in the words of the accused but in the words of the trying Judge in the following term,<strong> </strong>আমি দোষি। আমি দোষ স্বীকার করি। আমার কিছু বক্তব্য আছে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>This is not the proper compliance of the provisions of section 243 Cr PC. Further, if the provisions of section 243 Cr PC are carefully examined, it will be found that after recording an admission of guilt of the accused as nearly as possible in his own words, he  should be asked why he should not be convicted on his such admission of guilt.  This part of the provision of section 243 of the Code of Criminal Procedure appears to have been totally over- looked by the learned Judge and only on the basis of the so-called recording of appellant’s admission of his guilt and without putting any other question in pursuance of section 243 Cr PC as to why he should not be convicted there under he formed his opinion and convicted the accused.<br/> <br/>In the case reported in 11 DLR 514, it has been laid down:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“A conviction without taking of any evidence and purporting to be based on a plea of guilt cannot be sustained when the accused denies having pleaded guilty and the said plea is not found recorded in accordance with the provisions of section 243 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The provision in section 243 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the recording of the admission of the accused as nearly as possible in the words of the accused is a statutory provision designed to enable not only the trying Court but also the superior courts to know that the accused understood that he was really pleading guilty to the offence   charged.<br/> <br/>In 22 DLR 217, it has been observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Although an accused can be convicted on his pleading guilty yet for the interest of Justice there should be some legal materials on record to support it. In the instant case nobody has come forward to prove the prosecution case. No witness has been examined in the case. The admission of the accused has not also been recorded as nearly as possible in the words used by the accused. The order of conviction is not thus proper on that score too.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In 20 DLR 461, it has been held;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Section 243 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides, ‘inter alia’ that if the accused admits that he has committed the offence of which he is an accused, his admission shall be recorded as nearly as possible in the words used by him.” In the case reported in 40 DLR 461, it has been observed by a single Judge of this court.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“It cannot be said that there was no material or evidence before the court besides the plea of guilt because the informant pw-1 had made elaborate statement regarding the entire prosecution case as was observed in the judgment of the trial court. But the fact remains that the mandatory requirements of section 243 of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been violated as the learned Judge did not at all record the individual statements of the two accused either in their language or in words as nearly as were expressed by them. This violation of the mandatory provision must be held to have prejudiced the accused appellants and for that reason the violation cannot be overlooked by aid of section 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. For the reasons stated above the conviction and sentence cannot be sustained.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>If we believe that the statement made was voluntary and true, then it should be considered. However, the statement shows there were four people who committed dacoity. But section 395 of the Penal Code-punishment for dacoity reviles that as per section 391 of the Penal Code, when five or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to commit a robbery is said to commit “dacoity”. In this circumstances if we believe plea of guilt admission of guilty true, then nothing happened to dacoity.<br/> <br/>In this case we find that no formal charge was framed against the convict appellant which is essential and legal requirement of law, Naturally accused appellant had no opportunity to take defence against any allegation made therein and usually convict failed to felt the consequence of plea of guilty. This manifestly suggests that the appellant pleaded guilty without knowing what exactly he was pleading to. His plea of guilty is no more than an admission that he had committed that act which is alleged to be an offence. The judge without affording the appellant proper safeguards and consequences of his plea accepted the plea of guilt.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Accepting the plea of guilty of the appellant is error of law. A plea of guilty in a criminal court can only be made in response to a charge made by the court. In this case no formal charge was framed but, his plea was accepted. “An informal admission as to guilt does certainly not amount to formal plea of guilt and such an admission has of course no binding effect as to a plea of guilt’- Observed by Cunliffe, J in the case of Superintendent and Remembrance of Legal Affairs, Bengal vs Jiban Kumar De and others AIR 1936 Cal 292.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Section 265 E of the Code of Criminal Procedure, provides that if the accused pleads guilty, the court shall record the plea and may in its discretion convict him thereon. Therefore, the Court should not act upon the plea, in other words, the conviction need not necessarily follow the plea of guilty. The Court has discretion of accepting the plea or proceeds to take evidence notwithstanding the plea. While the conviction on a plea may considerably abridge the trial that should not be a reason for the courts to refrain from taking evidence, if it feels any doubt that the accused did not understand the full implication of the offence mentioned in the charge”.<br/><br/>The facts, question relating to charge, confessional statement and guilty pleadings we have to rely above mentioned cases wherein their lordships consistently took same views.<br/><br/>In view of the above, we hold that the appellant’s plea of guilty was not genuine and it was an admission that he has committed the act, which is alleged to be an offence. The confessional statement made under section 164 of the Code is not at all confessional statement, since it has made in a plain paper without fulfilling the legal requirement and the record suggested no formal charge has been made against the convict, since no formal charge was framed against the accused, the convict got no opportunity to take defence against those allegation.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“An accused person who pleads guilty and convicted thereon, he has no right of appeal except as to extend or legality of the sentence as provided in section 412 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Where, however, the facts alleged by the prosecution do not amount to an offence, the plea of guilty of an accused cannot stand in the way of his acquittal and section 412 of the Code cannot bar an appeal from his conviction. References in this connection are the cases of Mustaq vs Crown, AIR 1965, MP 137. Marari vs Crown AIR 1919 Bon 160”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>This accused has been in Jail custody since 08-10-08 and by this time 6 years have been elapsed. In that view of matter the ends of justice would be met if the appellant is acquitted of the alleged charge leveled against him. Accordingly, we find merit in this appeal.<br/><br/>In this result, this appeal is allowed. The judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 25-03-08 in Sessions Case No.313 of 2009 is hereby set aside.  The accused Roni is found not guilty of the alleged charges and thus acquitted and he be set at liberty at once if not wanted in connection with any other cases.<br/><br/>Let the lower Court record along with the copy of this Judgment be transmitted down and the order also be communicated to the authority concern at once.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

(pre-emption)  Case No.43 of 1989  disallowing the Misc. Case under section 4 of the Partition Act.<br/><br/>The appellants’   case, in-short, is that the land measuring 0.58 acre in plot No. 724 appertaining to C.S. Khatian No.509 under holding No.8 of  Kushtia Pourashava was originally belonged to Nil Moni Roy Chowdhury and others, who exchanged the same with the two brothers named Yamin Nobi alias Yeasin Nobi and Rexaun Nobi). The said two brothers after getting the disputed land under exchange deed in equal share started living thereon and later on conflict was started between them resulting various civil and Criminal cases were started amongst them. In this background the predecessor of the respondents, Md. Rejan Nabi  as plaintiff filed Title Suit No.174 of 1976 in the Court of the then Sub-ordinate Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Kushtia for partition against his brother Yeamin Nobi ( predecessor of the present appellants)  and got Preliminary decree on  contest vide judgment and decree dated 12.04.1980. The defendant No.1, thereafter, as appellant preferred First Appeal No.7 of 1981 before this Court and during pendency of the said appeal the plaintiff  opposite party No.1 sold his 50% undivided share of land on 14.2.82, 16.2.82, 15.7.82 and 17.7.82 by 6 Kabalas  (Ext. Nos.’Cha’ and ‘Chha’ series) without serving any notice upon the predecessor of the present appellants  and hence,  Md. Yeamin Nobi,  the predecessor of the present appellants filed Misc. (pre-emption) Case No.43 of 1989 under section 4 of the Partition Act for pre-empting the case land.<br/><br/>Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 as opposite party Nos. 2-4 entered appearance in the Misc. Case and filed written objection contending inter alia that the disputed land is not undivided land because petitioner Yamin Nobi was living separately in   the divided land under holding No.8 of Kushtia Pourashava paying separate Tax and opposite party No.1, Rezaun Nobi was also living in divided land under separate holding No.8/1 of Kushtia Pourashava paying separate Tax to the Government. The petitioner,  Yeamin Nobi also sold some land from his share of the disputed plot to others. The pre-emption case is hopelessly barred by limitation because the petitioner filed the pre-emption case under section 4 of the Partition Act beyond the stipulated period of 3(three) years and hence, the pre-emption case is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>At the trial both the parties led evidence both oral and documentary to prove their respective cases.<br/><br/>The trial Court on consideration of the evidence on record factually found that the land under pre-emption was  divided land   and the  petitioner did not mention the schedule of the land  under pre-emption   in the original pre-emption petition and the pre-emption case  was barred by limitation  according to the provision under Article 180 of Limitation Act as the case was filed long lapse  of 6/7 years, that is, beyond the stipulated period  of 3 years and thus, the learned Subordinate Judge dismisses the pre-emption case by  the impugned judgment and order dated 17.5.1998.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied by with the aforesaid  impugned judgment and order dated 17.5.1998 the appellant, Yeamin Nobi, the predecessor of the present appellants preferred this appeal.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Nurul Amin, the learned Advocate appearing for the appellant in the course of his argument has taken  me through the impugned judgment, deposition of PWs and OPWs and other materials on record and then submits that the  learned trial judge erred in law in disallowing the pre-emption case on the main ground that  the case was hopelessly barred by limitation as the case was filed beyond the stipulated time of 3 years although there is no limitation to file the pre-emption case and as such the impugned judgment is liable to be set-aside. The learned Advocate to fortify his 1<sup>st</sup>  branch of argument has referred to the decisions reported in 36 DLR 351, 1 BLT(AD) 34 and AIR 1973 (Patna) 142.  Mr. Nurul Amin further submits that the findings of the trial Court below on the point of partition of the suit land is perverse being contrary to the evidence on record inasmuch  as admittedly, Md. Rejan Nobi as plaintiff filed Title Suit No.174 of 1976 for partition of their ejmali property  including the case land and finally the said suit was decreed and as such in no way it can  be said that the ejmali property  of the parties   was partitioned or divided by metes and bounds.  Mr. Nurul Amin further submits that the engaged Advocate  in the court below due to his unintentional mistake did not mention  the schedule of the land under pre-emption in the pre-emption petition  and the same can not be a valid ground to reject the case if otherwise the case  is maintainable in law.  Finally, Mr.  Nurul Amin submits that the impugned judgment is a product of non application of judicial mind and suffers from patent illegality and as such the same is liable to be set-said. <br/><br/>Mr. A. K. M. Golam Mohiuddin, the learned Advocate appearing for the defendant-respondents, on the other hand, supports the impugned order and contends that the learned Sub-ordinate Judge was perfectly justified in disallowing the pre-emption case  on the clear findings that land under pre-emption was  not undivided  land   and the  petitioner did not mention the schedule of the case land  in the original pre-emption petition and the pre-emption case was barred by limitation  according to the provision under Article 180 of the Limitation Act inasmuch as the case was filed long lapse  of 6/7 years, that is, beyond the stipulated period  of 3 years. He further upon referring to the evidence of PW-1 and OPW-1 and the certified copy of the sale deeds as well  submits  that admittedly   the pre-emptor himself transferred a portion of land from his share and as such it does not lie in the mouth of the pre-emptor that he needs more land or land in question was belonged to joint or   undivided family.  Mr. Mohiuddin further submits that in spite of getting opportunity to implead the necessary parties such as Taimur Banda, Mozaffar Hossain and others the petitioner deliberately did not implead them in the case  and as such the case was  bad for defect of parties. Finally, the learned Advocate submits that the petitioner  never approached before the Court with clean hands, who made self contradictory statements as witness in 2  cases namely Title Suit No.174 of 1976 and Misc. (pre-emption)  Case No.43 of 1989 as to the property in question was divided or not  and as such the  appellants as heirs of the pre-emptor petitioner  are not entitled to get any relief whatsoever. The learned Advocate to fortify his argument has relied on the decisions reported in 59 DLR (AD) 69, 14 BLC 734, 4 BLC (AD) 98 and 54 DLR 181.<br/><br/>I have heard the learned Advocates for both the sides at length and perused the memo of appeal, deposition of witnesses of both the cases, that is, Misc. (pre-emption) Case No.43 of 1989 and Title Suit No.174 of 1976 and other relevant materials on record.  Now, to deal with the contentions raised by the parties before this Court it would be convenient for me to decide first of all the question whether the land in question belonged to joint/ undivided family or not. <br/><br/>On scrutiny of the impugned judgment it appears that the trial Court after a detailed discussion of the evidence and materials on record came to a conclusion that the land under pre-emption is not a part of the property of undivided family. In coming to this conclusion, the said Court noticed that: “সুতরাং ইহা প্রমানিত যে, ১নং প্রতিপক্ষ ও দরখাস¹কারী অবিভও্র পরিবারের সদস্য ছিল না এবং ১নং প্রতিপক্ষ অবিভও্র পরিবারের সদস্য হিসাবে নালিশী কবলা সমুহের জমিতে তদুপরিসিহত বিল্ডিং ২-৪ নং প্রতিপক্ষের নিকট বিএ্রি করেন নাইz উপরের আলোচনা হতে আরো প্রমানিত হয় যে, ১ নং প্রতিপক্ষ প্রদত্ত ২-৪ নং প্রতিপক্ষের অনুকুলীয় কবলা সমুহের জমাজমি ও বিল্ডিং অবিভও্র পরিবারের মালিকানাধীন বসতবাড়ী (বষলনড়ঢ়নতধ ) অর্ভুও্র জমি ও বিল্ডিং ছিল না“<br/><br/>In this case the pre-emptor, Yeamin Nobi himself was examined as PW-1, who in his deposition stated that the case land has not yet  been partitioned, the opposite party Nos.2-4 are stranger to the case land. This witness in his cross-examination denied the suggestion of the opposite parties stating that: “১৬/৪/৮৮ ইং তারিখে আকতার বাবু ও আবদুল মুরাদের কাছে জমি বিএ্রি করেছি এ কথা সত্য নয়z আকতার বাবু ও আবদুল মুরাদের কাছে বিএ্রয় বিষয় ঠিক একথা সত্য নয়” This witness was also examined as DW-1 in Title Suit No.174 of 1976, who in his deposition stated that the plaintiff and myself are in possession over the suit land by specific boundary. I have got separate holding No.8 for my portion. The plaintiff’s holding number is 8/1. We also pay separate municipal tax. This witness as defendant No.1 filed  written statement in Title Suit  174 of 76 stating inter alia  that: “বাদী বিবাদীর মধ্যে নালিশী সম্পত্তি অাপোষ বিভাগ বন্টন হইয়া গিয়াছে এবং পূîর্ কথিত অংশ মোতাবেক বাদী নালিশী সম্পত্তির পশ্চিমাংশের দখল প্রাপ্ত হয়z---------------- বাদীর দখলীয় অংশ কুষ্টিয়া মিউনিসিপ্যালিটির আর, এ, খান রোড এর ৮/১ নং হোল্ডিং এবং বিবাদীর দখলীয় অংশ ঐ রাসর ৮ নং হোল্ডিং হইতেছে”<br/><br/>From a plain reading of the above quoted evidence,   it appears that disputed land of opposite party No. 1 are divided land under separate holding No. 8/1 in which the pre-emptor petitioner’s holding No. 8 of Kushtia Pourashava. My view is, therefore, that the trial court below was perfectly justified in holding that the land under pre-emption is not a part of the undivided family’s land.<br/><br/>Now, coming to consider the question whether the trial Court committed any illegality in holding that: “নথি পর্যা­লাচনা­ দেখা যায় মূল­দং  ১৭৪/৭৬ নং বন্ট­নর মামলাটি­ত গত ১২/৪/৮০ইং তারি­খর বন্ট­নর ডিত্র্রি হ­য়­ছz নথী পর্যা­লাচনা আ­রা দেখা যায় যে, ডিত্র্রী­দর বাদী কতৃক প্রদত্ত অত্র মিস কে­সর নালিশী ৬টি যথাত্র্র­ম ১৬/২/৮২,  ২৪/২/৮২,  ৫/৭/৮২ এবং ১৭/৭/৮২ তারি­খ রেজিস্ট্রিকৃত হ­য়­ছz অত্র মামলাটি গত ২৮/৩/৮১ তারি­খ আনয়ন ক­র­ছz উক্ত বন্ট­নর ডিত্র্রীর তারিখ হ­ত কিংবা ঐ নালিশী কবলা সমু­হর রেজিস্ট্রীর তারিখ হ­ত নির্ধারিত ৩(তিন) বৎসর সময় সীমার ম­ধ্য অত্র মোকদ্দমা আনয়ন না করায় অত্র মোকদ্দমাটি তামাদী বারিত”<br/><br/>On a query by me, Mr. Nurul Amin, the learned Advocate submits that since the instant Misc. Case No.43 of 1989 under section 4 of the partition act is related with the original Title Suit No.174 of 1976, the engaged Advocate in the Court below did not mention the schedule of the case land in the original petition of misc. case for pre-emption. The pre-emption case under section 4 of the Partition Act is an independent proceeding in which   schedule of case land and particulars of the disputed deeds are very much required to be described/ made in details otherwise the pre-emption case must fail.  Therefore, the trial court below was perfectly justified in holding that since the pre-emptor-petitioner did not mention the schedule of the case land and particulars of the deeds in question   in the original pre-emption petition/ application, the pre-emption case is incompetent, misconceived and  not maintainable.<br/><br/>Mr. Nurul Amin, however, at the end of the day submitted that the engaged Advocate due to inadvertence did not mention the schedule of the land and particulars of the deeds under pre-emption in the pre-emption application and for that fault of the engaged Advocate the innocent appellants  should not suffer. To meet this argument I have carefully examined the record and it appears that  this  First Misc. Appeal No.183 of 98 was   filed on 14.06.98 and since then till to filing  an application for amendment of the plaint on 30.9.2013, that is,  more than 16 years   no one raised any question for incorporating the schedule of the land and particulars of the deeds under pre-emption by way of the amendment of the pre-emption petition. It also appears that no such ground was taken in memo of appeal as canvassed by Mr. Nurul Amin.<br/><br/>It is seen from the record that  in this case the pre-emptor-petitioner neither mentioned  the schedule of the case land and particulars of the deeds in question in the pre-emption case  nor taken any step  for incorporating the schedule of the case land and particulars of the disputed deeds  in the pre-emption application  by way of the amendment of the pre-emption petition at the time of filing the memo of appeal, who slept over the  matter idle over a period of 16 years. Therefore, I  am unable to see eye to eye to such submission made by learned Advocate on behalf of the appellants.  These indolent appellants in my view cannot get the relief as sought for. Law does not help the indolent rather it helps the vigilant.<br/><br/>As already noticed, the trial Court factually found the pre-emption case was hopelessly barred by limitation inasmuch as the pre-emption case was filed long  6/7 years after registration of   the impugned deeds, that is,  beyond the statutory period of 3 years.   Mr. Nurul Amin, the learned Advocate relying on the decisions reported in 36 DLR 351, 1 BLT(AD) 34 and AIR 1973 (Patna) 142 submits that the finding of the trial Court on the point of limitation is perverse being contrary to law bearing on the subject  inasmuch as there is no time limit for filing an application under section 4 of the Partition Act.<br/><br/> <br/>In order to consider this question, I feel it necessary to  quote hereunder the relevant passages from the cited decisions.  In the case of Syesta Bibi and others Vs. Juma Sha and others reported in 1 BLT(AD) 34,  our Apex Court observed as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The appellate Court’s finding that ”the suit land is no doubt a homestead, but is not a dwelling house of an undivided family” is utterly misconceived. In the suit land an undivided dwelling house is situated. The defendant himself claimed to be residing in a portion there. The suit property never lost its character of an undivided homestead because there had admittedly been no partition by metes and bounds by any previous arrangement. The impartible character of the suit property remained undisturbed when the suit was filed in 1962. There is no time limit for filing an application under section 4 of the Partition Act. In the instant case, the plaintiff’s claim cannot be called stale.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Azizur Rahman and others Vs. Jugal Kishori Sarkar and others, reported in 36 DLR 351, this Court observed as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>”…………..It is undisputed position of law that there is no time limit for laying a claim under section 4 of the Partition Act unlike the claim for pre-emption under other law. So, the plaintiff having the benefit provided by the law itself there is no scope for this Court to refuse the claim of the plaintiff on the ground that the claim has been laid after much delay……………..”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of H. N. Mukharjee Vs. Shyam Sunder Kuer reported in AIR 1973 (Patna) 142,  it was observed as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“………An application under section 4 can be made at any stage of the suit. Simply because an application has been filed under section 4 after the passing of the final decree, it cannot be said that it is not maintainable on the ground that the executing Court cannot go behind the decree.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>On a reading of the above quoted consistent view of the superior courts of this subcontinent, I find a clear view of law as it stands today that there is no time limit for filing an application under section 4 of the Partition Act. Keeping in mind this undisputed position of law, I have no hesitation to hold that trial Court below erred in law in  arriving at a finding that the pre-emption case  is barred by limitation  according to the provision under Article 180 of Limitation Act as the case was filed long lapse  of 6/7 years from the date of registration of the impugned deeds, that is, beyond the stipulated  time of 3 years.<br/><br/>On the face of this undisputed position of law, the learned Advocate for the respondent finds it  difficult to contend that the trial court committed no wrong in holding that the pre-emption case under section 4 of the Partition Act was barred by limitation.  He, however,  sought to argue that perhaps the exact legal position on this point was not brought to the notice of the trial judge. It is by now fairly well settled that the impugned judgment cannot be knocked down on account of a particular wrong finding among the other well reasoned findings. In that view of the matter, I am not inclined to disturb with the impugned judgment.<br/><br/>Now, it remains for me to consider the contentions raised by Mr. A. K. M. Golam Mohiuddin, the learned Advocate for the respondents that the pre-emptor-petitioner  never approached before the Court with clean hands, who miserably  failed to prove that he needs the land under pre-emption badly.  <br/><br/>It appears that  the pre-emptor, Yeamin Nobi himself was examined as PW-1, who  denied the suggestion stating that  he never transferred a portion of his share  from  their undivided property  to  any 3<sup>rd</sup> party although,   OPW-1 clearly stated in his deposition that the pre-emptor himself transferred a portion of land from  his share to 3<sup>rd</sup> party stranger.  Drawing my attention to the certified copy of the deed No.2276 dated 16.4.88 and deed No.2287 dated 16.4.88,   Mr. A. K. M. Golam Mohiuddin candidly  submits that the pre-emptor, Yeamin Nobi transferred more than 10 decimals of land from his share by executing 2 registered deeds in favour of Kazi Akhter Banu and Kazi Abdul Murad, who are  stranger to the case land. <br/><br/>From a combined reading  of those deeds, I find that the pre-emptor, Yeamin Nobi transferred a part of land from  his share  to 3<sup>rd</sup> party  long before filing of the instant pre-emption case under section 4 of the Partition Act  and as such,  it does not lie in the mouth of the pre-emptor petitioner that the land in question is a part of dwelling house of an undivided family or he needs more land badly. In view of this, I find considerable merit in the submission of the learned Advocate Mr. A. K. M. Golam Mohiuddin.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Nurul Amin, the learned Advocate, however, at the end of the day having realized the difficulty submits that the case may be sent back on remand to the trial Court for deciding it on all points after fresh trial. In view of the evidence and materials on record,  I am of the view that if long lapse  of 16/17 years the case is remanded to the trial Court below for deciding afresh in giving opportunity to the parties to add further evidence that will not improve the ultimate result of the case. Therefore, I am unable to accept this last submission of Mr. Nurul Amin.<br/><br/>Here it may be mentioned that the decisions  reported in 15 BLT 18, 13 BLT 418, 15 DLR(SC) 120, 63 DLR(AD) 138, 11 DLR 355,  40 DLR(AD) 150, 53 DLR 256, AIR 1960 (Cal) 467, AIR 1985(Orissa) 137,  31 DLR(AD) 320, Volum-7 ADC 593, 6 MLR(AD) 46 and 65 DLR(AD) 82 as cited by Mr. Nurul Amin in support of his lengthy argument have no manner of application in the facts and circumstance of the case as the facts of the instant case are quite distinguishable from the facts of those cases.<br/><br/>On an overall consideration of the facts, circumstances and the materials on record  I find that the respondents’ basic objection to the maintainability of the pre-emption case mainly on two counts that (i) the land in question is not a part of an undivided family’s property and (ii)  the original  pre-emptor-petitioner neither mentioned  the schedule of the land nor given any  particulars of the disputed deeds in the original pre-emption application   are sound and,  I accordingly  hold that the pre-emption case itself was not maintainable.<br/><br/>In view of my discussions made in the foregoing paragraphs it is by now clear that the instant first miscellaneous appeal must fail.<br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to cost. <br/><br/>         Let a copy of this judgment along with the lower Court’s record be sent down at once.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Considering the facts and circumstances of a particular case the court is to decide whether the delay in lodging the F.I.R. is fatal and whether this delay in lodging the F.I.R. makes the prosecution case doubtfull. Considering all these facts and circumstances both the trial court and the High Court Division found that the delay of 5 days in lodging the F.I.R. was not  fatal to create any doubt about the truth of the prosecution case. Considering the facts and circumstances we also find that in this case the delay in lodging the F.I.R. cannot be a ground for disbelieving the truth of the prosecution case. . . . (80 and 81)<br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)<br/>Section 154</strong><br/>There is no bar in filing a second F.I.R. if the first information about any occurrence given to the police station is vague and indefinite and does not disclose the actual offence committed in that occurrence. In the present case the GDE which was made in the concerned police station at the time when the occurrence was still going on does not disclose the offences committed in that occurrence and hence the subsequent F.I.R. stating the offences committed in that occurrence in details is the actual F.I.R. and there is no legal bar in accepting this F.I.R. in the stated facts and circumstances. . . .(82)<br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)<br/>Section 161</strong><br/>The delay in examining the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the investigating officer can be any reason for discarding their evidence before court. …(82)<br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)<br/>Section 154<br/>Evidence Act (I of 1872)<br/>Section 134</strong><br/>There is no law requiring examination of all the F.I.R. named and charge sheeted witnesses before court. Rather it is well established by judicial pronouncements that conviction of accused can safely be based on the evidence of one witness only if his evidence is full, complete and selfcontained and believable. The prosecution is not bound at all to examine all the witnesses mentioned in the F.I.R. or in the charge sheet. . . .(84)<br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)<br/>Section 154<br/>Evidence Act (I of 1872)<br/>Section 157</strong><br/>In this case the informant, who lodged the F.I.R. was not the eye-witness to the occurrence. Hearing from others she lodged the F.I.R. So it was very natural that in the F.I.R. all the details of the occurrence could not be stated properly and correctly. The evidence of P.Ws.2 to 8-the eye-witnesses to the occurrence are consistent. In the circumstances the discripancy between the F.I.R. story and the evidence of these eye witnesses cannot be any reason for disbelieving the evidence of these eye-witnesses in this particular case. . . .

By the side of that road the house, of accused Aiyub Ali, sitting chairman of Bagra Union was situated. While Monawar Ali along with his brothers and nephew were going through that road, all on a sudden, the accused persons, namely, Aiyub Ali chairman, Nazir, Mizan and Badshah, sons of late Swarup Ali, Sabuj Ali, Kuti Chan, Mahfuz, Mintoo, Abdul Mannan Shah, Faruq Gazi, Salam, Mithu, Alek member, son of late Hossain, Selim, Billal, Ripon, Piyar Ali, Jasim, Muluk, Alek, son of unknown, Shafiul Azam, Syed Chowdhury, Ayesha Khatun, wife of Abu Jaher, Rubel, Maram Ali, Abdur Rob Bepari @ Roba, Keru Fakir member, Adalat Sikder, Jainal Talukder, Aynal, Haroon, Salam Sikder, Shamsuddin, Aminur Rahman, Jewel, Abdul Mannan @ Mobile Mannan, Kuddus Bepari, Akram Ali Bepari, Rouf, Faran Sheikh, Titan Khan, Hossain member, Malek Bepari, Shah Alam Bepari, Muktar Hossain, Sekander, Ummat Ali, Mahfuz, son of Salam Sikder, Amin, Israfil Bepari, Abbas, Hashem, son of Hasen Gazi, Faraj Ali, Motaleb Fakir, Ketu Salam @ Kota Salam, Abdul Gazi and many unknown persons being armed with weapons like gun, ‘ramdao’, ‘chapati’, iron rod, chinese axe etc. attacked them. Though the deceased Monwar Ali and his associates were carrying two licensed guns and one pistol they along with Hashem, being chased, ran towards the house of Srijon Bepari and entered into that house and started shouting “save, save”. Hearing their alarm, the neighbouring people gathered there. In the meantime, the accused Aiyub Ali and the aforesaid accused persons started shouting saying that Monwar Ali chairman whould be killed. The accused Aiyub Ali chairman started firing targeting the house of Srijan Bepari. He and the aforesaid accused persons fired targeting the public also so that they could not come forward. Being frightened the public went away far. Deceased Manwar Ali and his associates requested Srijan Bepari to give them shelter in his house. Haji Srijan Bepari, being kind enough, gave them shelter in his two storied wooden house and for that the accused persons started looting that house. Finding no other way the deceased Monwar Ali started blank firing from his brother’s licensed gun and pistol and instructed his relatives over mobile phone to inform the police station. In the meantime, accused Kuti Chand, Nizam, Nazim, Sabuj Ali, Hashem and Alauddin broke open the door of that house of Srijan Bepari and entered into that house and tried to drag away Badsha. Hashem, who also took shelter in that house along with Monwar Ali and his assocaites, was trying to drag Badsha into the house. The accused Faruq Gazi then shot Hashem with a gun and as a result Hashem died. The other accused persons from out side the house fired many shots one of which hit Badsha causing bleeding injury. At that time Alauddin from the accused’s group, who entered into that house to drag out the victims, also received a bullet injury and died.<br/><br/>That the reason for carrying guns and pistol by the deceased Monwar Ali and his brothers is that the accused Aiyub Ali chairman and his family members are their enemy. 26/27 years back the accused Aiyub Ali and his brothers took away the father of the deceased Monwar Ali from a tea-stall of Bagrabazar and cut his body into pieces and threw the pieces into the river Padma. The pieces of the body could not be found. Since thereafter, they were threatening the deceased Monwar Ali and his family members also and for this reason they used to carry their licensed guns and pistol while they had to go to Bagrabazar. That the accused A. Rob @ Roba, son of late Rashid Bepari informed the accused Aiyub Ali about the deceased Monwar Ali’s going to Bagrabazar on 07.07.2001. Roba is the terrorist of the accused Aiyub Ali’s group who was in the jail several times for his terrorist activities. Being informed by Roba the accused Aiyub Ali took preparation about which the deceased Monwar Ali was ignorant. <br/><br/>While the above stated occurrence was going on Sreenagar Thana police went to the place of occurrence at about 1.00 P.M. and sent message to different police stations. The Deputy Commissioner and the police super of Munshiganj and the T.N.O. from Sreenagar went to the place of occurrence from 2.00 P.M. to 5.00 P.M. The District Magistrate, the police super and the O.C., Sreenagar P.S. could not bring the accused persons under control. The deceased Monwar Ali and his companions were in confinement at the 1st floor of Srijon Bepari’s wooden house from 9.00 A.M. At about 6.00 P.M. the District Magistrate and the Police Administration announced through a hand mike addressing Monwar Ali to come throwing down their weapons and to surrender. They also announced assuring them that if they surrendered to them they would save them. Hearing this, the deceased Monwar Ali along with others came down from the 1st floor of the said house. The police then arrested them out of suspicion and handcuffed them. Forthwith, the accused Aiyub Ali and the other accused persons snatched the deceased Monwar Ali and his companions away from the police custody. The accused Aiyub Ali then dealt a sharp weapon blow on the back of the head of deceased Monwar Ali in presence of police. At the same time, the other accused persons, namely, Nazir, Mizan, Nizam, Badsha, Sabuj, Kuti Chan, Mahfuz, Mintoo gave indiscriminate blows with sharp cutting weapons on the different parts of the body of the deceased Monwar Ali. The accused Abdul Mannan Shah, son of Malek Shah, Faruq Gazi, Salam, Mintoo, Alek member, son of Hossain, Selim, Billal, Ripon, Piyar Ali, Jasim, Muluk, Alek, son of unknown, Safiul Azam, Syed Chowdhury, Ayesha Khatun, wife of Abu Taher started dealing blows on the body of the deceased Monwar Ali with sharp cutting weapons. The accused Jainal son of late Beshai Talukder, Aynal son of Joynal Talukder, Haroon, Salam Sikder, Samsuddin, Sekander, Ummet Ali, Mahfuz son of Salam Sikder, Rubel, Keru Fakir member dealt stick and iron rod blows to the brothers of the deceased Monwar Ali. The accused Aminur Rahman, Jewel, Abdul Mannan started dealing blows on the body of Salauddin, the nephew of the deceased Monwar Ali with sharp cutting weapons. The accused Kamal, Abbas, Hashim, Kuddus Bepari, Akram Ali Bepari, Rouf, Fazal, Sheikh, Titan Khan, Hasen member, Malek Bepari, Sahah Alam Bepari started firing all around so that no body come forward to rescue them.

At that time, due to indiscriminate firing of accused persons, one passerby, namely, Ismail Gazi an old man, received a bullet injury on his dead and died.

Thereafter, police took the dead bodies of Monwar Ali, Badsha, Hashem, Alauddin and Ismail Gazi to the police station by police van.

After completion of autopsy their bodies were brought to the residence of the informant and at that time also the informant lost her sense once again. Injured Md. Anwar Ali and Salauddin were in hospital and other relatives were living abroad. The cause of delay in lodging the First Information Report was that the informant lost balance of her mind because of the death of her husband.<br/>On 12.07.2001 Meherun Nessa-the wife of deceased Manwar Ali lodged the First Information Report with Sreenagar Police Station on the basis of which Sreenagar P.S.

Mr. Mansural Haque Chowdhury, the learned Advocate has appeared for the condemned-prisoner-appellant Faruq Gazi of Criminal Appeal No.27 of 2012 and accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam of Criminal Appeal No.35 of 2012. Mr. Md. Sarwar Ahmed, the learned Advocate has appeared for the condemned-prisoner-appellant Md. Aiyub Ali chairman and the accused-appellant Md. Mahfuzur Rahman @ Mahfuz S/O Aiyub Ali of Criminal Appeal No.26 of 2012. Mr. Mohammad Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record has appeared for the accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader of Criminal Appeal No.25 of 2012.  <br/> <br/>Mr. Khandaker Diliruzzaman, the learned Deputy Attorney General has appeared for the State-respondent in all the criminal appeals.<br/>We have heard the learned Advocates for the accused-appellants and also the learned Deputy Attorney General for the State-respondents at length.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Sarwar Ahmed, the learned Advocate appearing for the accused-appellant Md. Aiyub Ali and Mahfooz s/o Aiyub Ali has made argument to the effect that the accused Aiyub Ali and his son accused Mahfooz have been entangled in this case falsely out of enmity and grudge, that in this case it has been sufficiently proved from the evidence adduced by the prosecution that there was long standing enmity in between this accused-appellant Aiyub Ali and his family members and the deceased Monwar Ali and his family members on different issues including political issue. The learned Advocate has argued that all the alleged eye witnesses to the alleged occurrence, who have deposed before the court as P.Ws.2 to 8 and also the informant, being close relatives and partymen of deceased Monwar Ali, have deposed before court implicating these accused-appellants falsely out of grudge. The learned Advocate has argued that the trial court and also the High Court Division did not consider this aspect at all and consequently they have committed wrong and injustice in finding these accused-appellants guilty relying on the evidence of these interested and partisan witnesses only. The learned Advocate has argued also that the evidence which these witnesses have given before the court are also contradictory on material points and that on this count also the evidence of these prosecution witnesses are not reliable at all. The learned Advocate for the accused-appellants has made argument to the effect also that in the FIR as many as 28 persons have been named as eye witnesses but out of these 28 eye witnesses only 4 witnesses, namely, P.Ws.2, 3, 4 and 7 have been examined by the prosecution before court but no explanation whatsoever, has been given from the side of the prosecution for withholding the other FIR named eye witnesses. The learned Advocate has argued that the withholding of so many FIR named eye witnesses by the prosecution also reasonably creates doubt about the prosecution case. The learned Advocate has pointed out also that there are material discrepancies in between the FIR and the evidence of the witnesses before court and has argued that these discrepancies between the FIR story and the evidence adduced before court very reasonably makes the prosecution case false. The learned Advocate has submitted that the evidence adduced before the court deviating from the FIR story should be taken into consideration with much caution as there remains scope for making subsequent embellishment of the prosecution case and has argued that in this present case the subsequent embellishment and departure from the FIR story has been overlooked by both the trial court and the appellate court causing failure of justice. The learned Advocate has made argument to the effect also that some of the own witnesses of the prosecution though have deposed before court to the effect that the men of Aiyub Ali attacked the deceased/victims but these witnesses did not say at all that the accused Aiyub Ali himself was present in the place of occurrence or took any part in that occurrence. The learned Advocate has contended that these evidence of the own witnesses of the prosecution rather proves that accused Aiyub Ali himself was not at all involved in the alleged occurrence, but he has been entangled in this case by the informant side out of enmity and grudge only. The learned Advocate has contended also that the evidence of these prosecution witnesses, namely, P.Ws.9, 10, 11 and 15 rather proves that the accused-appellant Aiyub Ali had no involvement in this alleged occurrence. Mr. Md. Sarwar Ahmed, the learned advocate for the accused-appellants has made argument to the effect also that though some of the prosecution witnesses have deposed to the effect that this accused Aiyub Ali dealt a chapati blow on the back side of the head of the deceased Monwar Ali, but this evidence is doubtful inasmuch as some other prosecution witnesses have deposed to the effect that accused Aiyub Ali had a gun in his hand. The learned Advocate has contended that these contradictory evidence of the own witnesses of the prosecution has made the charge against this accused-appellant doubtful and in the circumstances this accused-appellant is entitled to be acquitted from this charge. The learned Advocate for the accused-appellant Aiyub Ali and Mahfooz son of Aiyub Ali has argued also that the other charges brought against these accused-appellants for killing deceased Badsh and Hashem Kazi have not been proved at all. The learned Advocate has pointed out that though the prosecution case is that at the time of occurrence the accused persons killed Hashem Kazi also by firing shot, but this prosecution case has been proved false by the postmortem examination repot of dead body of Hashem which shows that there was no gun shot injury at all on the dead body of Hashem. The learned Advocate has argued that though these accused appellants have been convicted for killing deceased Badsha also but there is no evidence at all to prove that these accused-appellants took any part in killing Badsha.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Sarwar Ahmed, the learned Advocate has made argument to the effect also that in this case the own evidence of the prosecution itself has rather proved that the deceaseds and victims of this case were miscreants and they came to the place of occurrence with fire arms like guns and pistol with an intention to commit crime and they also committed murder of Alauddin son of accused Ayesha and at this the local people, being agitated, assaulted them and consequently some of them died, but long 5 days after this occurrence the informant, being influenced by some enemies of the accused persons, lodged the FIR making a false story. The learned Advocate has argued that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses to the effect that the high officials of Administration and police asked the deceased and other victims by hand mike to surrender and to deposit their arms supports this case that the deceased and the victims actually came there to commit some crmies and they were assaulted and killed by the agitated mob. The learned Advocate has pointed out that in the inquest reports also of the dead bodies, the deceaseds were mentioned as miscreants. Mr. Md. Sarwar Ahmed has argued also that in this case the alleged eye witness P.W.2 Alhaj Sirajuddin Bepari was not examined by the investigating officer and the rest alleged eye witnesses were examined by the investigating officer after a long laps of time and in the circumstances the evidence of these alleged eye witnesses should be left out of consideration as per settled principle of law.<br/>Mr. Md. Sarwar Ahmed, the learned Advocate has made argument to the effect also that according to the own case of the prosecution, Alauddin, son of accused Ayesha Begum, was killed inside the house of Srijon Bepari where deceased Monwar Ali and his companions were staying with arms, that this deceased Alauddin is the full brother of accused Nazir, Mizan, Nizam and Badsha and these accused-persons having seen the dead body of their brother, being highly shocked and gravely provocated, participated in the free fight arose between the parties and that these facts prove that the occurrence took place without any premeditation and it occured as a result of sudden grave provocation. The learned Advocate has contended that in the circums-tances the conviction under section 302 of the Penal Code may be altered to one under section 304, part-II of the Penal Code. The learned Advocate has made submissions to the effect also that the accused-appellant Aiyub Ali has been detaining in the condemned cell and has been suffering from mental agony of death for about 10 years and considering these fact as extenuating circumstances this court may now commute his sentence of death to imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdul Motin Khashru, the learned Advocate appearing for the appellants Mannan Shah, Shawkat Ali and Hashem has made arguments to the effect that the charges framed against these 3 appellants have not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt, that the evidence which the prosecution has adduced before court to prove the charges against these accused-appellants could not prove at all these accused-appellants guilty of the said charges. The learned Advocate has argued that though the prosecution has examined some alleged eye witnesses before court but the evidence of these alleged witnesses, namely, P.Ws.2 to 8 are contradictory to each other and as such these evidence could not prove the charges against these accused-appellants at all. The learned Advocate has pointed out that according to the case of the prosecution as many as 15 persons dealt blows on victim Monwar Ali with sharp cutting weapons like ‘chan’, ‘dao’, axe and ‘chapati’ at a time but in the postmortem examination report of the dead body of victim Monwar Ali there is no incised wound on the body of the victim and that this fact also tells in favour of falsehood of the prosecution case. Mr. Abdul Motin Khashru has made submissiont to the effect also that admittedly dead body of Alauddin son of accused Ayesha and full brother of accused Nazir, Nizam, Mizan and Badsha was brought out of the house where victim Monwar Ali and his associates were staying with fire arms and that seeing the dead body of Alauddin his near and dear ones, being highly shocked and provocated, might have attacked the victims and in the circumstances this case comes within the ambit of section 304, part-II of the Penal Code and not under section 302 of the Penal Code. The learned Advocate has made argument to the effect also that the High Court Division found that the charges framed against some other convicted persons were not proved beyond reasonable doubt and, therefore, acquitted those accused persons, that the accused-appellants Mannan Shah, Shawkat Ali and Hashem also stand on the same footing with those accused-persons who have been acquitted by the appellate court and as such these accused persons also are entitled to get benefit of doubt and entitled to be acquitted.<br/><br/>Mr. Mansurul Haque Chowdhury, the learned Advocate appearing for the accused-appellant Faruq Gazi and A. Salam @ Ketu Salam @ Kota Salam has made argument to the effect that the charge framed against these 2 accused-appellants have not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt. The learned Advocate has pointed out that the allegations against these 2 accused- appellants is that they murdered Hashem and Badsha by gun shot, but the postmortem examination report of the dead bodies of Hashem and Badsha proved that there was at all no gun shot injury on those bodies. The learned Advocate has contended that this very fact make the allegations against these 2 accused-appellants false. Mr. Mansurul Haque Chowdhury has submitted also to the effect that the evidence of the alleged eye witnesses to the occrrence are contradictory and these evidence could not prove the charges framed against these 2 accused-appellants beyond all reasonable doubt. The learned Advocate has argued to the effect also that the own evidence of the prosecution has rather proved that the deceased and the victims went to the palce of occurrence with fire arms for commiting some crime and at that time the local people, being agitated, attacked them and ultimaely the agitated mob assaulted them causing death of some of them, but 5 days after that occurrence the informant, being ill advised by some inmical persons of the accused side, lodged the FIR making false allegations against the accused persons; that in this case it has not been proved by any cogent evidence that these appellants Faruq Gazi and A. Salam @ Ketu Salam took any part in the alleged occurrence and in the circumstances these 2 appellants are entilted to get benefit of doubt. The learned Advocate has argued also that though these 2 accused appellants have been convicted under sections 302/109 of the Penal Code, but there is no iota of evidence in this case to prove that these 2 accused-appellants in any way abetted the offence of murder.<br/><br/>Mr. Mohammad Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the accused-appelant Shafiul Azam Dafader has made submissions similar to those made by the learned Advocates for other accused-appellants as stated above. The learned Advocate-on-Record also has made argument to the effect that the evidence adduced by the prosecution could not prove the charge against the accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader inasmuch as the alleged eye-witnesses-whom the prosecution has examined in this case-are all interested and partisan witnesses and their evidence also are contradictory to each other.<br/><br/>Mr. Khondaker Diliruzzaman, the learned Deptuy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the State respondents in all the criminal appeals has advanced argument to the effect that it is a brutal murder case, that in this occurrence as many as 5 persons were murdered and 2 others were critically injured in broad day light in presence of thousands of people including high officials of Administration and police; that in this sensasional case the proseuction adduced sufficient evidence to prove the charges framed against the accused persons and the trial court and also the High Court Division examined, sifted  and considered these evidence minutely and propertly and found these accused-appellants guilty rightly. The learned Deput Attorney General has argued that in this case so many eye witnesses to the occurrence have been examined by the prosecution all of whom have deposed supporting the prosecution case and that there is no cogent ground for discarding the evidence of these eye witnesses to the occurence; that both the trial court and the High Court Divison, considering all aspects, have accepted the evidence of these witnesses as reliable and that from the side of the accused-appellants nothing materal could be shown/detected to make these findings and decision of the trial court and the High Court Division not sustainable. Referring to the relevant portion of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses the learned Deputy Attorney General has argued that these evidence of the prosecution witnesses have sufficiently proved the charges brought against these accused-appellants and as scuh they cannot get acquittal as prayed for in these appeals. Refuting the argument advanced by the learned Advocates for the accused-appellants the learned Deputy Attorney General has made submissions to the effect also that in this case the delay of 5 days in lodging FIR is not fatal at all inasmuch as there were cogent reasons for not being able to lodge the FIR earlier and that the High Court Division has dealt with this point raised from the side of the accused persons and concluded correctly that the delay in lodging the FIR in the instant case, did not make the prosecution case doubtful at all. The learned Deputy Attorney General has argued also that in this case as many as 8 eye witnesses have been examined by the prosecution all of whom have deposed supporting the prosecution case and besides, some other witnesses also have deposed in this case lending support to the prosecution case and that in the circumstances the non-examination of some other FIR named or charge sheeted witnesses does not make the prosecution case weak or doubtful at all. The learned Deputy Attorney General has made argument to the effect also that the relationship of the prosecution witnesses wtih the informant side does not make their evidence unbelievable if their evidence is otherwise trustworthy and that in this case the evidence of these prosecution witnesses are trustworthy and a such cannot be disbelieved and discarded only for the reason that they are related to the informant side. The learned Deputy Attorny General has argued to the effect also that in this case it has been proved sufficiently that there was long standing enmity in between the accused Aiyub Ali-the present chairman of the Bagra Union and the deceased Monwar Ali-the former chairman of the same Union and in the circumstances the evidence of the prosecution witnesses to the effect that out of that enmity and grudge the accused persons, at the behest of accused Aiyub Ali-chairman, committed this occurrence-cannot be disbelieved.  <br/><br/>For considering the arguments advanced by the learned Advocates for the accused-appellants and the learned Deputy Attorney General for the State-respondents we require to narrate the relevant portion of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses here. It has already been mentioned above that in this case the prosecution has examined 23 witnesses before court in order to prove its case.<br/><br/>The P.W.1 is the informant Meherunnessa. Admittedly, this witness is not an eye witness to the occurrence. Hearing about the occurrence from others she lodged the F.I.R.

Iqbal Bahar Chowdhury told that two persons had died inside the house and the dead bodies were lying there. That S.I. Iqbal Bahar Chowdhury informed the S.P. of the occurrence through wireless. Then S.P., D.C., T.N.O. and O.C. went to the place of occurrence. The police officer asked the people staying in the first floor of the house to surrender and then those people dropped their arms. At that time the associates of the accused Aiyub Ali set the house on fire. The people staying in the first floor of that house came down and the S.I. and constable handcuffed them.

Subsequently, the high officials of police came to the place of occurrence. The police officer, with a hand mike, asked the people taking shelter at ‘Nikari Bari‘ to come down and to hand over their arms. Those people then dropped their arms down.

As per identification of this witness the G.D. Entry No.194 dated 07.07.2001 has been marked as exhibit-15.<br/><br/>The P.W.23 S.I. of police Md. Nasir Uddin Paik is the investigating officer of this case. This witness has deposed to the effect that on 30.10.2001 he was attached to C.I.D. Bangladesh, Dhaka as an Inspector. On that date as per instruction of the police head quarter and CID head quarter he took up the charge of investigation of this case from the previous Investigating Officer S.I. D.M. Belayet Hossain. The material part of the evidence of this investigating officer is that during investigation he perused the diary of the previous investigating officer and   visited the place of occurrence, examined the witnesses including the informant and recorded their statements as per section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, seized alamats as per seizure list and after completion of investigation, as prima facie case was made out against 108 accused persons including accused Aiyub Ali and some officials, namely, S.I. Iqbal Bahar Khan, S.I. D.M. Belayet Hossain, S.I. Rafiqul Alam, A.S.P. Md. Nazam Uddin Chowdhury, Additional S.P. A.K.M. Shahjahan, S.P. Omul Bhuson Barua, the then T.N.O. K.M.

Kamrun Nessa Khanam he submitted the memorandum of evidence on 04.06.2003 for submission of charge sheet. He submitted required papers to get sanction to proceed against the public servants. He arrested the accused persons. In the meantime, as he was transferred, he handedover the docket and alamats of the case as per the instruction of his higher authority to the subsequent investigation officer inspector Amirul Islam on 15.10.2003. This witness has been cross-examined at length on behalf of the accused persons.<br/>These are the evidence which the prosecution has adduced in this case to prove the charges framed against the accused persons. In this judgment we are to consider only whether the evidence adduced in this case justify the conviction and sentences imposed on the accused-appellants before us.<br/><br/>Before scanning the evidence of the prosecution witnesses we require to address some legal points raised on behalf of the accused-appellants.<br/><br/>It has been argued from the side of the accused-appellants that in this case the F.I.R. was lodged long 5 days after the alleged occurence and this long delay in lodging the F.I.R. has reasonabley made the prosecution case doubtfull. The learned Advocates for the accused-appellants have made submissions to the effect that there are series of decisions where it was held that a belated F.I.R. always carrys the chance of fabrication and that the delay in lodging the FIR without explaining suffcient cause renders the prosecution case doubtfull.<br/><br/>It is true that the delay in lodging the FIR  raises suspicion about the truth of the prosecution case, but there may be various reasons for causing delay in lodging the F.I.R. Without considering the reasons of delay in lodging the F.I.R. the courts should not doubt the truth of the prosecution case only for the fact that there was delay in lodging the F.I.R. Mere delay in lodging the FIR should not be a ground for disbelieving the prosecution case if that delay occurred for any reasonable cause. Considering the facts and circumstances of a particular case the court is to decide whether the delay in lodging the F.I.R. is fatal and whether this delay in lodging the F.I.R. makes the prosecution case doubtfull.<br/><br/>In the present case the delay in lodging the F.I.R. has been explained in the very F.I.R. The facts and circumstances which have come out from the evidence of the prosecution witnesses also have explained the delay in lodging the FIR. It has been proved in this case that the husband and another near relative of the informant were murdered and 2 others of her near relatives were critically injured in the occurrence of this case and both those injureds were in hospital under treatment for a long time. The informant has stated also both in the F.I.R. and in evidence before court that after this occurrence she, being highly shocked, got senseless and was not in a position to lodge the F.I.R. It was also stated that her other near relatives also were abroad at that time. Considering all these facts and circumstances both the trial court and the High Court Division found that the delay of 5 days in lodging the F.I.R. was not  fatal to create any doubt about the truth of the prosecution case. Considering the facts and circumstances we also find that in this case the delay in lodging the F.I.R. cannot be a ground for disbelieving the truth of the prosecution case.<br/><br/>It has also been argued from the side of the accused-appellants that the F.I.R. which was lodged 5 days after the occurrence cannot be treated as FIR inasmuch as before lodging of the F.I.R. there was a G.D. entry about this occurrence in the concerned police station and in the circumstances that G.D. entry, being the first information about the occurrence, should be treated as FIR and the subsequent F.I.R. lodged by the informant should be treated as a statement under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It appears that the High Court Division has addressed this legal point also adequately and given the right decision. The High Court Division rightly pointed out that the G.D. entry which was lodged in the concerned thana about this occurrence was vague and indefinite and no offence was disclosed in the said G.D. entry and in the circumstances the said G.D. entry could not be treated as an F.I.R. There is no bar in filing a second F.I.R. if the first information about any occurrence given to the police station is vague and indefinite and does not disclose the actual offence committed in that occurence. In the present case the GDE which was made in the concerned police station at the time when the occurrence was still going on does not disclose the offences committed in that occurrence and hence the subsequent F.I.R. stating the offences committed in that occurrence in details is the actual F.I.R. and there is no legal bar in accepting this F.I.R. in the stated facts and circumstances.<br/><br/>The learned Advocates for the accused-appellants have argued also to the effect that in this case the prosecution witnesses were examined by the investigating police officer long several months after the occurrence and this long delay in examining the prosecution witnesses also makes the evidence of these  witnesses before court suspicious. But this argument also of the learned Advocates for the accused-appellants is not acceptable in the present facts and circumstances of the case. In this case the P.Ws.2 to 8 are all eye witnesses to the occurrence and two of them were critically injured in the said occurrence. All these P.Ws. have deposed before court narrating the occurrence in details. Some other police constables also have deposed corrobrating these public witnesses and all these prosecution witnesses have been cross-examined at length on behalf of the accused persons, but by cross-examining these witnesses at length their evidence could not be shaken or made unbelievable. In the circusmtances the delayed examination of these prosecution witnesses by the investigating police officer cannot be a reason for disbelieving these witnesses. In the present case it has also come before court that the investigating officer of this case was changed and several other cases also were started over the same occurrence and the police investigated those cases also. In the circumstances the delay committed by the investigating police officer in examining the witnesses of this case cannot be a reason for disbelieving the prosecution witnesses who have deposed before the court on oath in details and have faced the lengthy cross-examination by the learned Counsel of the accused persons. In the stated facts and circumstances we do not find that the delay in examining the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the investigating officer can be any reason for discarding their evidence before court.<br/><br/>It has also been argued from the side of the accused-appellants that many F.I.R. named and charge sheeted witnesses have not been examined in this case and this fact also makes the prosecution case weak. But we do not accpet this argument also of the learned Counsel for the accused-appellants. There is no law requiring examination of all the F.I.R. named and charge sheeted witnesses before court. Rather it is well established by judicial pronouncements that conviction of accused can safely be based on the evidence of one witness only if his evidence is full, complete and selfcontained and believable. The prosecution is not bound at all to examine all the witnesses mentioned in the F.I.R. or in the charge sheet. In the present case 7 eye witnesses namely, the P.Ws.2 to 8 have deposed before court supporting the prosecution case and if the evidence of these witnesses can be believed as true the non-examination of other FIR named or charge sheeted witnesses is not fatal at all.<br/><br/>The learned Advocates for the accused-appellants have made submissions to the effect also that in this case there are discripancies in between the F.I.R. and the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses before court and that these discrepancies between the FIR and the evidence of the prosecution witnesses makes the prosecution case unbelievable. But we are unable to accept this contention also of the learned Advocates for the accused-appellants. In this case the inforamnt, who lodged the F.I.R. was not the eye- witness to the occurence. Hearing from others she lodged the F.I.R. So it was very natural that in the F.I.R. all the details of the occurrence could not be stated properly and correctly. The evidence of P.Ws.2 to 8-the eye-witnesses to the occurrence are consistent. In the circumstances the discripancy between the F.I.R. story and the evidence of these eye witnesses cannot be any reason for disbelieving the eivdence of these eye-witnesses in this particular case.<br/><br/>The learned Advocates for the accused-appellants have made argument to the effect also that all the alleged eye-witnesses to the occurrence being interested, related and partisan, their evidence cannot be relied upon. It is true that the evidence of the interested and partisan witnesses must be scrutinized and considered cautiously before it is accepted. But the evidence of the interested and partisan witnesses should not be discarded for the reason only that they are partisan and interested witnesses if their credibility is not shaken by the defence. In the present case the P.Ws.2 to 8 though have been blamed to be interested and partisan witnesses by the defence but by cross-examining these witnesses at length the defence could not shake their varacity or make their evidence false or unbelievable. It is now settled by the decisions of the apex courts that the evidence of partisan witnesses need not always be discarded only for the reason of their relationship, when their evidence are found to be reliable that can be basis for convicting the accused. So the argument that the P.Ws.2 to 8 being interested witnesses their evidence cannot be relied on-is not acceptable.<br/><br/>The learned Advocates for the accused-appellants have made arguments to the effect also that there are contradictions and discrepancies among the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and these contradictory and discrepent evidence of the prosecution witnesses make these witnesses untrustworthy and make the prosectuion case also false.<br/><br/>But considering the facts and circums-tances of the present case we do not accept this argument also of the learned Advocates. In the present case the number of accused is more than hundred. Hundreds of people were present in the place of occurrence and wintessed this occurance. In the circumstances it was difficult to pinpoint specifically the role played by each and every accused. So it is most natural that there may occur some discrepencies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses as to the role played by the accused persons in this occurrence. While sifting the evidence of the prosecution witnesses the courts are to take into consideration the discrepencies also in their evidence, but for making some discrepent statements only their whole evidence should not be discarded and they also should not be treated as untrustworthy.<br/><br/>Now we shall sift the evidence of the prosecution witnesses narrated above.<br/><br/>From the evidence of the prosecution witnesses it appears that in this case there are sufficinet evidence to prove the active involvemnet of the accused-appellant Aiyub Ali in the murder of Monwar Ali, Badsha and Hashem. All the prosecution witnesse 2 to 8-the eye witnesses to the occurrence-have deposed before court to the effect that this accused Aiyub Ali ordered the other accused persons firstly to catch Monwar Ali and his other associates while they were going to Bagra Bazar along the road by the side of the house of accused Aiyub Ali and as per this order the other accused persons and also accused Aiyub Ali himself chased Monwar Ali and his associates and made them confined in the house of Seraj Bepari and kept them confined there for a long period and during that period some of the accused persons entered into that house by breaking open the door and murdered Hashem and subsequently, in the evening, after arrival of police, when Monwar Ali, Badsha, Anwar Ali and Salauddin came out of that house on the asking of police and were handcuffed by police and brought near the bamboo clump the accused Aiyub Ali gave order to other accused persons to kill them and he himself also dealt a ‘chapati’ blow on the back of head of Monwar Ali and then other accused persons started dealing blows on Monwar Ali and Badsha with different weapons. These evidence of the prosecution witnesses could not be shaken by cross-examining the witnesses at length. Some of the police witnesses also, who came to the place of occurrence, namely, P.Ws.9 and 10 have supported the prosecution case by deposing to the effect that Monwar Ali and his other associates were kept confined in the house of Siraj Bepari and subsequently when, on the asking of the police, Monwar Ali and his associates came out of that house the associates of accused Aiyub Ali snatched away them from police and killed them. These evidence of the police constables has strongly supported the prosecution case that accused Aiyub Ali was the gang leader and he ordered his other accomplices to kill Monwar Ali, Badsha and Hashem. From the side of the accused persons though question has been raised as to the credibility of P.Ws.2 to 8 but considering the facts and circumstances of the case we do not find the evidence of these witnesses unbelievable or false. Admittedly the occurrence of murder of Monwar Ali, Badsha and Hashem took place in broad daylight in presence of hundreds of people. However these eye-witnesses to the occurence, the P.Ws.2-8, have been cross-examined at length by the learned Advocates for the accused persons, but their veracity could not be shaken by the lengthy cross-examination. So, we do not accept the contention of the learned Advocates for the accused-appellants that these P.Ws.2-8 are not trustworthy for the reason only that they are interested and partisan witnesses. It has been contended from the side of the accused persons that deceased Monwar Ali and his associates, being armed with fire arms, went to the place of occurrence to commit any crime and at that time the agitated public confined them in the house of Seraj Bepari and ultimately those mob murdered them. But considering the evidence adduced before court we do not find this defence contention acceptable at all. It should be mentioned here that before us arguments have been made from the side of the accused persons to the effect that deceased Monwar Ali and others murdered Alauddin, the son of accused Ayesha and brother of accused Mizan, Nizam, Nazir and Badsha and at this the accused persons, being highly shocked and provocated, might have committed this occurence and in the circumstances this case does not come within the ambit of section 302 of the Penal Code, rather it comes within the ambit of section 304, part-II of the Penal code. This very defence argument, rather, supports the prosecution case that the accused Aiyub Ali and his other associates killed Monwar Ali, Badsha and Hashem. Even, if it is believed that deceased Monwar Ali and his associates went to the place of occurrence to commit some crime and they were miscreants, but that does not absolve the accused Aiyub Ali and his other associates from the charge of murder of Monwar Ali and his associates. The evidence adduced by the prosecution has proved sufficiently that accused Aiyub Ali along with his associates snathched away the deceased Monwar Ali and Badsha and victims Anwar Ali and Salauddin from the hands of police when they were handcuffed and accused Aiyub Ali then gave order to other accused persons to kill them and he (accused Aiyub Ali) himself dealt a ‘chapati’ blow on the vital part of body of deceased Monwar Ali. The execuse that deceased Monwar Ali and his associates were miscreants cannot be accepted as a ground for absolving the accused Aiyub Ali and other accused persons from the charge of murder. The brutal murder of 3 persons and also assaulting of two other persons mercilessly with the intention to kill them in braod daylight in presence of high officials of Administration and police cannot be taken leniently under any circumstances.<br/><br/>It was argued that some of the prosecution witnesses have deposed to the effect that accused Aiyub Ali had a gun in his hand and in the circumstances the evidence that accused Aiyub Ali dealt a ‘chapati’ blow on the back of head of Monwar Ali is not believable at all. But we do not accept this argument also. It cannot be accepted that a person who has a gun in one of his hands cannot hit any person with any other kind of arms. It might be that accused Aiyub Ali, at that very moment, took that ‘chapati’ from any other accused person and hit Monwar Ali with that ‘chapati’. Where there are sufficient evidence to prove that accused Aiyub Ali dealt a ‘chapati‘ blow on the back of head of Monwar Ali and where the postmortem examination report of the dead body of deceased Monwar Ali supports these evidence we cannot disbelieve these evidence only for the reason that some of the witnesses deposed that the accused Aiyub Ali was carrying a gun at the time of occurrence.<br/><br/>Though there is no specific evidence to prove that accused Aiyub Ali himself dealt any blow on deceased Badsha and Hashem, there are ample evidence to prove that accused Aiyub Ali along with other accused persons chased Monwar Ali and others and made them confined in a house and then murdered Hashem in that house and subsequently as per order of accused Aiyub Ali, the other accused persons murdered Badsha. So in the circumstances accused Aiyub Ali was rightly convicted and sentenced under sections 302/109 of the Penal code for killing Badsha and under sections 302/149 of the Penal Code for killing Hashem.<br/><br/>From the side of the accused-appellant Aiyub Ali arguments have been made to the effect also that in this case the evidence of the prosecution itself have proved that the accused persons, being highly shocked and provocated by the murder of Alauddin, committed this occurrence and in the circumstances this case will not come within the abmit of section 302 of the Penal code, rather it will come within the ambit of section 304 part-II of the Penal Code. But considering the evidence on record we are unable to accept this argument also. The evidence adduced in this case has proved sufficiently that accused Aiyub Ali along with his associates chased Monwar Ali and his associates while they were going along the road by the side of the house of accused Aiyub Ali and made them confined in the hosue of P.W.2 Srijon Bepari and during that period, at one stage, they entered into that house by breaking open the door and tried to drag out them and at that time Alauddin was murdered. So, in these facts, circumstances, the plea of accused-appellants that being highly shocked and provocated they killed Monwar Ali and others and as such these killings do not fall within the purview of sction 302 of the Penal code, rather these fall within the purview of section 304 part-II of the Penal Code-is not acceptable at all even if it is believed that Alauddin was killed by Monwar Ali and his associates.<br/><br/>Mr. Sarwar Ahmed-the learned Advocate for the condemned prisoner Aiyub Ali has made submissions to the effect also that this accused-appellant Aiyub Ali has been detaining in the condemned cell for long 10 years with mental agony of death and now this Division, for the ends of justice, may show some mercy to him and may commute his sentence of death to a sentence of life imprisonment. But considering the very offence of cruel murders of as many as 3 persons committed by this accused-appellant Aiyub Ali we do not think that he can be shown any mercy at all.<br/><br/>However, considering the facts, circumstances and evidence on record we find that both the trial court and the High Court Division rightly convicted this accused appelalnt Aiyub Ali under sections 302/1`09 of the Penal code for killing Monwar Ali and Badsha and under sections 302/149 of the Penal Code for killing Hashem. The High Court Division has upheld the sentence of death of accused Aiyub Ali awarded by the trial court for killing Monwar Ali only and awarded him 2 separate sentences of life imprisonment for killing Badsha and Hashem. We find no reason to interfere with the judgment and order of the High Court Division so far as it relates to the accused-appellant Aiyub Ali.<br/><br/>Accused Md. Mahfuzur Rahman @ Mahfuz son of Aiyub Ali has been convicted for killing Monwar Ali and Badsha and has been awarded 2 separate sentences of life imprisonmnet with fine for each of the killings with a direction that both the sentences will run concurrently. From the above narrated evidence of the proseuction witnesses it appears that all the P.Ws.2 to 8-the eye witnesses to the occurrence-have deposed stating the active involvement of this accused-appelalnt Md. Mahfuzur Rahman @ Mahfuz son of Aiyub Ali in the murder of Monwar Ali and Badsha. These evience prove that this accused-appelant Mahfuz son of Aiyub Ali was carrying a chinese axe during the whole occurrence and while Monwar Ali, Badsha and others  were brought out of the house of Srijon Bepari by police and were handcuffed this accused Mahfuz son of Aiyub Ali also along with other accused persons started assulting them.<br/><br/>The P.W.3 Salauddin, an injured witness, has deposed specifically that this accused-appelalnt Mahfuz dealt chinese axe blows to Monwar Ali. The P.W.4 Md. Anwar Ali-another injured witness also has specifically deposed that this accused-appelalnt Mahfuz dealt chinese axe blows to deceased Monwar Ali. This witness deposed to the effect also that the accused persons who assulted Monwar Ali dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on Badsha also. The P.W.5 Saifur Rahman Pintoo-another eye-witness to the occurrence also has specifically deposed to the effect that accused-appellant Mahfuz had chinese axe in his hand and he dealt chinese axe blows to both Monwar Ali and Badsha. The P.W.6 Md. Shahabuddin Khan, the Headmaster of Bagra Swarup Chandra Pilot High School, also has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mahfuz kept dealing chinese axe blows to Monwar Ali. The P.W.7 Abul Kalam Azad-another eye witness to the occurrence also has deposed to the effect tha this accused Mahfuz dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on deceased Monwar Ali and also on Badsha, Anwar Ali and Salauddin. The P.W.8 Md. Shahin, another eye-witness also has deposed to the effect that this accused appelalnt Mahfuz kept dealing chinese axe blows on Monwar Ali. Considering these evidence of the prosecition witnesses we find that the trial court and the High Court Division rightly found this accused appellant Mahfuz son of Aiyub Ali guilty of killing of Monwar Ali and Badsha and therefore rightly convicted him under section 302 of the Penal Code. The High Court Division, however, has commuted the sentence of death awarded by the trial court to this accused-appelalnt Mahfuz to imprisonment for life as already mentioned above. We find no reason to intefere with the findings and decision of the High Court Division as regrds this accused-appellant Mahfuz son of Aiyub Ali also.<br/><br/>In the cicumstances the Criminal Appeal No.26 of 20012 filed by the condemned prisoner Md. Aiyub Ali chairman and his son accused-appellant Md. Mahfuzur Rahman @ Mahfuz is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>Accused Faruq Gazi was awarded death sentence by the trial court for killing Monwar Ali, Hashem and Badsha. The High Court Division has commuted the death sentence of this accused-appellant Faruq Gazi to imprisonment for life for killing Monwar Ali and Badsha but upheld his death sentence awarded for killing Hashem. It has been pointed out before us that though according to the prosecution witnesses this accused-appellant Faruq Gazi killed Hashem by firing a gun shot but the postmortem examination report of Hashem does not show at all that there was any bullet injury on the dead body of Hashem. The learned Advocate for the accused-appellant Faruq Gazi has contended that the postmortem examination report of deceased Hashem makes the allegation of killing Hashem against this accused-appelant Faruq Gazi false. The learned Depty Attorney General has made submissions to the effect that, in fact, the postmortem examination report, which bears the name of deceased Hashem, actually was not of the dead body of Hashem but the other postmortem examination report of an “unknown person” was actually of Hashem and this postmortem examination report shows that there were bullet injuries on that dead body. But this argument of the learned Deputy Attorney General cannot be accepted at this stage. There is no cogent evidence or materials before us to prove that the postmortem examination report which bears the name of Hashem actually was not of Hashem, rather the postmortem examination report  of an “unknown person” actually was of Hashem. There is no evidence before us to the effect that an unknown person also was killed in that occurrence by assaulting with weapons other than fire arms. One Ismail Gazi was killed in that occurrence, but admittedly he was killed by gun shot. So, we cannot accept the contention of the prosecution that the postmortem examination report of Hashem was not actually of Hashem, but that was of an unknown person. In the circumstances we accept the defence contention that the postmortem examination report of the dead body of Hashem does not suppoprt the prosecution case that this accused appellant Faruq Gazi murdered Hashem by gun shot. However, this accused-appellant Faruq Gazi has been found guilty for killing of Monwar Ali and Badsha also and it appers that there are sufficient evidence on record to prove that this accused-appelalnt Faruq Gazi took active part in killing Monwar Ali and Badsha. The P.W.3 and P.W.4-the two injured witnesses have deposed to the effect that on the order of accused Aiyub Ali this accused- appellant Faruq Gazi along with others dealt sharp cutting weapon blows to both Monwar Ali and Badsha. The other eye witnesses also have deposed to the effect that the other accused persons assulted Monwar Ali and Badsha with sharp cutting weapons. Considering the postmortem examination report of deceased Hashem we though do not find this accused- appellant Faruq Gazi guilty of the offence of commtting murder of Hashem but considering the other evidence stated above we find that both the trial court and the High Court Division rightly found this accused-appellant Faruq Gazi guilty of the offence of committing murder of Monwar Ali and Badsha. We, therefore, affirm the conviction and sentences of life imprisonment of this accused-appellant Faruq Gazi for committing murder of Monwar Ali and Badsha.<br/><br/>Criminal Appeal No.27 of 2012 filed by the accused-appellant Faqur Gaiz, therefore, deserves to be allowed in part.<br/>Accused-appellant Hashem has been convicted under sections 302/109 of the Penal Code and sentenced to imprisonment for life for killing Monwar Ali. This accused-appellant has been further convicted under sections 307/109 of the Penal Code and sentenced to rigorous imprisonmnet for 7 years for making attempt to commit murder of Anwar Ali and Salauddin. There is a direction that both the sentences will run concurrently.<br/><br/>From the above narrated evidence of the prosecution witnesses it appears that there are sufficient evidence to prove both the charges against this accused-appellant Hashem. The P.W.2-Alhaj Sirajuddin Bepari @ Srijan Bepari has deposed to the efect that this accused-appellant Hashem along with other accused persons entered into his house by breaking door and tried to drage out Badsha. This witness has deposed further that this accused-appellant Hashem had a big ‘chhan’ in his hand and he dealt blows on the chest of Monwar Ali. The P.W.3-Md. Salauddin, one of the injured witnesses, has deposed to the effect that this accused Hashem along with other accused persons chased them and when they took shelter in the hosue of Srijan Bepari this accused Hashem along with others entered into that hosue by breaking door and tried to drage out Badsha. This P.W.3 futher deposed that this accused Hashem delat ‘chhan’ blows on deceased Monwar Ali. This P.W.3 has deposed also to the effect that that the accused persons who assaulted Monwar Ali assaulted him also with sharp cutting weapons and stick. The P.W.4 Anwar Ali, another injured witness, also has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Hashem along with others chased them and while they took shelter in the house of Srijan Bepari this accused-appellant Hashem along with some others entered into that house by breaking door and tried to drage out Badsha. The P.W.4 has stated also that this accused-appellant Hashem dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali. This witness stated further that the accused persons who assaulted Monwar Ali dealt blows on Salauddin and on him also. The P.W.5, another eye witness of the occurrence, also has deposed that this accused-appellant Hashem dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali.<br/><br/>Considering the above stated evidence adduced by the prosecution we find that both the trial court and the High Court Division rightly found this accused-appellant Hashem guilty under section 302 of the Penal Code and rightly convicted and sentenced him to imprisonment for life for killing Monwar Ali and also rightly convicted him furhter under section 307 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to 7 years rigorous imprisonemnt for making attempt to commit murder of Anwar Ali and Salauddin. We find no reason to intefere with these findins and decision of the courts below.<br/><br/>The Criminal Appeal No.31 of 2012 filed by this accused-appellant Hashem is, therefore, liable to be dismissed.<br/>Accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader has been convicted under sections 302/109 of the Penal Code  for killing Monwar Ali and Badsha and has been awarded two separate sentences of life imprisonmnet for both the killings and has been further convicted under sections 307/109 of the Penal Code and sentenced to rigorous imprisonmnet for 7 years for making attempt to commit murder of Anwar Ali and Salauddin. There is a direction that all the 3 sentences will run concurrently.<br/><br/>On scrutiny of the above narrated evidence it appears that all the 7 eye witnesses to the occurrence, namely, the P.W.2 to P.W.8 have deposed stating the active involvement of the accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader in the alleged occurrence. The P.W.2 has deposed that at the time of occurrence this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader had a big ‘dao’ in his hand. The P.W.3 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader along with other accused persons chased them. The P.W.4 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali. The P.W.5 also has deposed that this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali and Badsha. The P.W.6 has deposed that this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader dealt indiscriminate blows on Monwar Ali, Badsha and Salauddin. The P.W.7 also has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on Monwar Ali, Badsha and also Anwar Ali and Salauddin. The P.W.8 has deposed that this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali.<br/><br/>Considering the above stated evidence adduced by the prosecution witnesses we find that the trial court and the High Court Division rightly convicted and sentenced this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader for killing Monwar Ali and Badsha and also for making attempt to commit murder of Anwar Ali and Salauddin.<br/><br/>The Criminal Appeal No.25 of 2012 filed by this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader is, therefore, liable to be dismissed.   <br/>Accused-appellant Showkat Ali has been convicted under sections 302/109 of the Penal Code for killing Monwar Ali.<br/>This accused-appellant Showkat Ali has not been named in the FIR.<br/>The P.W.2-Alhaj Sirajuddin Bepari @ Srijan Bepari-an eye witness to the occurrence also did not name this accused-appellant Showkat Ali.<br/>The P.W.3 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Showkat Ali dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on Monwar Ali.<br/>The P.W.4 has deposed only that this accused-appellant Showkat Ali along with other accused persons chased them while they were going by the side of the house of accused Aiyub Ali.<br/>The P.Ws.5, 6 and 8 have deposed only to the effect that this this accused-appellant Showkat Ali along with other accused persons set the house of Srijan Bepari on fire.<br/>The P.W.7 did not say anything implicating this accused-appellant Showkat Ali in the alleged occurence.<br/>So it appears that save and except P.W.3 only none of the other prosecution witnesses has stated anything in support of the charge of murder of Monwar Ali brought against this accused-appellant Showkat Ali. It has already been pointed out above that in the FIR also this accused-appellant Showkat Ali has not been named.<br/>Considering the evidence on record we find that the High Court Division was not justified at all in maintaining the conviction and sentence of this accused-appellant Showkat Ali. In view of the evidence on record our considered opinion is that this accused-appellant Showkat Ali is entilted to get benefit of boubt and, therefore, to be acquitted of the charge under sections 302/109 of the Penal Code.<br/>The Criminal Appeal No.30 of 2012 filed by this accused-appellant Showkat Ali Mollah, therefore, deserves to be allowed.   <br/>Accused-appellant Mannan Shah has been awarded 3 separate sentences of life imprisonment for killing Monwar Ali, Hashem and Badsha with a direction that all the 3 sentences will run concurrently.<br/><br/>We have scrutinized the evidence adduced by the prosecution as regards this accused-appellant Mannan Shah. It appears that the P.W.2 has deposed only to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah fired with a cut rifle from out side of his house while the deceased and others took shelter in that house. The P.W.3 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah along with other accused persons chased them and while they took shelter in the house of Srijan Bepari this accused-appellant Mannan Shah fired with a gun through the window of that hosue. This P.W.3 has deposed fruther that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah jumped on Monwar Ali and Badsha. The P.W.4 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah chased them and fired with a cut rifle. This witness has deposed also that this accused-appellant Mannan Shaha dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali and jumped upon Badsha and dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on him. The P.W.5 has deposed to the effect only that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah opened fire through the window of the hosue of Srijan Bepari while the deceaseds took shelter in that house. The P.Ws.6 and 7 also have deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah fired through the window of the house of Srijan Bepari while the deceased and others took shelter there. The P.W.8 did not name this accused-appellant Mannan Shah.<br/><br/>So it appears that out of 7 eye witnesses the P.Ws.3 and 4 only have deposed in support of the charges brought against this accused-appellant Mannan Shah. The P.W.3 has deposed that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah jumped on Anwar Ali and Badsha and P.W.4 has deposed that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali and jumped upon Badsha and dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on him. The P.W.3 did not say that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali. Other P.Ws. though have deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah fired through the window of the house of Srijan Bepari, but none of the witnesses has stated anything to the effect that the shot fired by the accused-appellant Mannan Shah hit anybody. It has been pointed out above that the postmortem examination report of the dead body of deceased Hashem does not show that there was any bullet injury on that dead body. So it appears that there is practically no evidence to prove that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah had any involvement in the murder of Hashem. As regards the charge of killing Mownar Ali brought against this accused-appellant Mannan Shah the only evidence is of P.W.4-who deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali. But none of the other prosecution witnesses, even the P.W.3 also  deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah took part in the murder of Monwar Ali by dealing ‘chhan’ blows on him. In the circumstances our considered opinion is that the charge of killing Monwar Ali brought against this accused-appellant Mannan Shah also has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubet and in the circumstances this accused-appellant Mannan Shah is entilted to get benefit of boubt and be acquitted from this charge also.<br/><br/>As regards the charge of killing Badsha brought against this accused-appellant Mannan Shah it appears that out of 7 eye witnesses the P.W.3 has deposed only to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah jumped on Anwar Ali and Badsha. This witness did not say that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah dealt any blow with any weapon on deceased Badsha. The P.W.4 only has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on Badsha. Out of 7 eye witnesses of the occurrence the P.W.4 only has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on Badsha. The other eye witnesses of the occurrence did not corroborate the evidnece of the P.W.4 that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on Badsha. Considering the evidence of P.Ws.2 to 8 we find that the proseuction could not prove the charge of killing Badsha also against this accused-appellant Mannan Shah beyond all reasonable doubt.<br/><br/>In the circumstances we find that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah is entilted to be acquitted from all the 3 charges of killing of Monwar Ali, Hashem and Badsha.<br/>The Criminal Appeal No.32 of 2012 filed by this accused-appellant Mannan Shah, therefore, deserves to be allowed.   <br/>Accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam has been convicted for killing Hashem and Badsha and has been awarded 2 separate sentences of life imprisonment for both the killings with a direction that both the sentences will run concurrently.<br/><br/>From the baove narrated evidence of the prosecution witnesses it appears that as regards this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam-the P.W.2 has deposed only to the effect that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam fired with a gun from out side targating his house while the deceaseds and others took shelter in that house. The P.W.3 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam chased them and opened fire with rifle through the witndow of the house where they took shelter. The P.W.4 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam along with others chased them and also fired with a gun through the window of the house where they took shelter and that gun shot hit Badsha. The P.W.5 has deposed to the effect only that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam opened fire through the window of the hosue where the deceaseds took shetler. The P.W.6 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam along with other accused persons chased the victims and surrounded the house of Srijan Bepari where the victims took shelter and opened fire with a gun from out side of that house. This P.W.6 deposed also that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam assaulted Badsha and Salauddin also. The P.W.7 deposed to the effect only that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam opened fire through the window of the house where the victims took shelter. The P.W.8 did not utter the name of this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam.<br/><br/>So, it apperars that the P.W.4 only has deposed to the effect that the gun shot fired by this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam hit Badsha. But the postmortem examination report of the dead body of deceased Badsha does not show that there was any bullet injury on that dead body. The P.W.6 only though has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam assaulted Badsha but no other prosecution witnesses have corrobo-rrated this statement of P.W.6. In view of the above stated evidence adduced by the prosecution our considered opinion is that none of the charges of killing Hashem and Badsha brought against this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt and as such this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam is entilted to get benefit of doubt and, therefore, to be acquitted of both charges.<br/>The Criminal Appeal No.35 of 2012 filed by this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam, therefore, deserves to be allowed.<br/><br/>Accordingly it is ordered that the Criminal Appeal No.25 of 2012 be dismissed. The conviction and sentences imposed on this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader by the impugned judgment and order be hereby affirmed.<br/>The Criminal Appeal No.26 of 2012 is dismissed. The conviction and sentences including the death sentence awarded against the accused-appellant Aiyub Ali be upheld and affirmed. The conviction and sentence of the other accused-appellant Mahfuz son of Aiyub Ali also be upheld.<br/><br/>The Criminal Appeal No.27 of 2012 is allowed in part. The conviction and sentences of life imprisonemnet with fine of the accused-appellant Faruq Gazi under sections 302/109 of the Penal Code for killing of Monwar Ali and Badsha be upheld. However, his conviction and sentence of death for killing of Hashem be set aside. He be acquitted of the charge under section 302/149 of the Penal Code for killing of Hashem.<br/><br/>This convicted accused-appellant Faruq Gazi is to be shifted from condemned cell to normal cell.<br/><br/>The Criminal Appeal No.30 of 2012 be allowed. The impunged judgment and order so far as it relates to the accused-appellant Showkat Ali Mollah be set aside and he be acquitted of the charge under sections 302/109 of the Penal Code for killing of Monwar Ali. The accused-appellant Showkat Ali Mollah be set at liberty at once if not wanted in connection with any other case.<br/><br/>The Criminal Appeal No.31 of 2012 be dismissed. The conviction and sentences imposed on this accused-appellant Hashem by the impugned judgment and order be upheld.<br/><br/>The Criminal Appeal No.32 of 2012 be allowed. The impunged judgment and order so far as it relates to the accused-appellant Mannan Shah be hereby set aside and he be acquitted of all the charges under sections 302/109 and 302/149 of the Penal Code. The accused-appellant Mannan Shah be set at liberty at once if not wanted in connection with any other case.<br/><br/>The criminal Appeal No.33 of 2012 has abated as already mentioned above.<br/><br/>The Criminal Appeal No.35 of 2012 be allowed. The impunged judgment and order so far as it relates to the accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam be set aside and he be acquitted of the charges under sections 302/109 and 302/149 of the Penal Code. The accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam be set at liberty at once if not wanted in connection with any other case.<br/><br/>Jail Petition No.20 of 2012 filed by the condemned prisoner Aiyub Ali be dismissed.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Respondent</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)<br/>Section 32(1)</strong><br/>When any statement is made by a person as to cause of his death or as to any of the circumstances which resulted in his death, the same is admissible in evidence in a case in which the cause of death of that person comes into question. The expression “any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death” in the above quoted clause (1) of section 32 is wider than the expression “the cause of his death”. The words “resulted in his death” do not mean “caused his death”. Death may be homicidal or suicidal and, therefore, the word ‘death’ includes suicidal death. So, the statement of a person, who commits suicide, also is admissible under section 32 of the Evidence Act in any proceeding in which the cause of his death comes into question provided the statement relates to the cause of his committing suicide or exhibits circumstances leading to his suicidal death. . . . (23)<br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)<br/>Section 32(1)</strong><br/>In a rape case, the victim of which, being highly shocked and humiliated by the commission of rape on her, committed suicide her statement as to rape and rapists is admissible in evidence according to section 32(1) of the Evidence Act. . . . (24)<br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)<br/>Section 32(1)</strong><br/>Victim Mahima, being highly humiliated and shocked by the commission of gang-rape on her, committed suicide. The reason of her committing suicide is the commission of forceful gang-rape on her. In other words, the commission of gang-rape on her resulted in her committing suicide. Rape itself might not have caused her death, but rape certainly was the cause of her committing suicide. So, there cannot be any argument against the conclusion that commission of rape on victim Mahima resulted in her death. . . . (25)<br/><br/>Evidence Act (I of 1872)<br/>Section 32(1)<br/>The definite case of the prosecution is that being highly humiliated and shocked by the commission of gang-rape on her victim Mahima committed suicide. So, in this case of rape the cause of death also of victim Mahima comes into question. It needs to be mentioned here that section 32(1) of the Evidence Act has made statement of a dead person relating to cause of his death admissible in all kind of proceedings in which the cause of his death comes into question. . . . (26)<br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)<br/>Section 32(1)</strong><br/>In our country the incident of rape is rampant. Very often the victims of rape commits suicide being highly humiliated and shocked by such rape on her. Generally there is no eye-witness of such rape, the only witness of such rape is the victim herself. The victims of rape sometimes narrate the commission of rape on them and disclose the names of the rapists to their near and dear ones before they commit suicide. In such cases the only evidence that may be made available is the hearsay evidence of such near and dear ones of the victims of rape. To hold that such hearsay evidence in a case of rape is inadmissible would be negation of justice and clear misinterpretation of the provision of section 32(1) of the Evidence Act. . . . (28)<br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)<br/>Section 32(1)</strong><br/>Failure to punish the rapists even after discloser of their names by the victim of rape before her committing suicide is not only a great injustice to the victim of rape but injustice to the society also. . . .

Farid, Md. Kamrul Hasan @ Faroque and Md. Selim Hossain, being armed with ‘hashua’, ‘chhora’, knife etc. forcibly kidnapped victim Mahima, aged about 14 years from her father’s house and took her to the nearby Bakkar’s sugar cane field and raped her there one after another. They also took naked photographs of the victim girl. Thereafter Mahima came home crying and informed the occurrence to her younger sister and to her mother and also to her brother and father when they returned home that night. The father of the victim Mahima then went to the parents and guardians of the accused persons and asked for justice and return of the said photographs and negatives, but they rebuked him and commented also that his daughter was of bad character. Thereafter on 19.02.2002 at about 11.30 A.M. the victim Mahima due to sufferings from humiliation and to preserve her self-respect and honour, took poison. She was immediately taken to Putia Hospital where she died that day at 1.00 P.M. The father of the victim Mahima then lodged First Information Report on that very day at 11.15 P.M. on the basis of which Putia Police Station Case No.21 dated 19.02.2002 was started. After completion of investigation the police submitted charge sheet against the accused persons under sections 7/9(3)/10(2) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000. The case was ultimately sent to the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat, Rajshahi for trial where it was registered as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Case No.284 of 2000. This Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat (hereinafter referred to as adalat) held trial of the case after framing charge under sections 7/9(3) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 against all the 4 accused persons. The charge so framed was read over to accused Uzzal @ Elias Hossain (the present appellant) who alone faced trial. The other 3 accused persons being absconding were tried in absentia. Accused Uzzal @ Elias Hossain pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried in accordance with law.<br/><br/>The prosecution examined 20 witnesses and tendered one. The defence did not examine any witness. The accused Uzzal @ Elias Hossain was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The defence case of this accused-appellant was of innocence and also that out of enmity and political rivalry he was falsely implicated in this case. However, upon consideration of the evidence adduced by the prosecution and the facts and circumstances the learned judge of the adalat found all the 4 accused persons guilty under sections 7 and 9(2) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000, but sentenced them under section 9(2) only to death and also to pay a fine of Tk.1,00,000/- each to be paid to the victim’s father as compensation by the judgment and order dated 09.10.2002. The learned Judge of the adalat made a reference under section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the High Court Division for confirmation of death sentences imposed upon the convicted accused persons on the basis of which the above mentioned Death Reference No.47 of 2002 was started.<br/><br/>The convicted accused Uzzal @ Elias Hossain also preferred the above mentioned Jail Appeal No.593 of 2002 and Criminal Appeal No.3448 of 2002 against that judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the adalat. A Division Bench of the High Court Division heard the death reference and the above mentioned criminal appeal and jail appeal together and by the impugned judgment and order rejected the death reference and dismissed both the criminal appeal and the jail appeal but modified the conviction and sentence imposed by the adalat as already mentioned above.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by this judgment and order of the High Court Division the convicted accused-appellant Uzzal @ Elias Hossain filed Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.215 of 2007 before this Division. This Division granted leave to consider the submissions of the learned Counsel for the leave-petitioner to the effect that there is no legal evidence at all about the alleged commission of rape by the petitioner or by other accused on victim Mahima and that the evidence of P.W.1-the father of the victim, P.W.3-the nephew of P.W.1, P.W.5-the son of P.W.1, P.W.6-the daughter of P.W.1, P.W.7-the brother of P.W.1 and P.W.8-the wife of P.W.1, being  the evidence of close relations and interested witnesses their evidence that the occurrence was narrated to them by the victim girl cannot be taken to have corroborated the occurrence allegedly narrated to them by the victim girl, more so when victim girl herself was not examined before the adalat as a witness as she died soon after the occurrence.<br/><br/>Mr. S. M. Shahjahan, the learned Advocate appearing for the convicted accused-appellate Uzzal @ Elias Hossain has advanced arguments before us to the effect that in this case there is practically no legal evidence at all to prove the prosecution case that this accused-appellant along with others committed rape on the victim girl Mahima. The learned Advocate has submitted that admittedly there is no eye witness of the alleged occurrence of rape committed on Mahima and the victim Mahima herself also could not give evidence before the adalat as she committed suicide soon thereafter; that some close relations of the victim Mahima though deposed in this case stating that victim Mahima told them that she was gang-raped by the four accused persons, but the evidence of these witnesses being hearsay evidence is inadmissible and as such cannot be relied on for convicting the accused persons. The learned Advocate has argued that though there are some exceptions to the rule against admissibility of hearsay evidence as provided in section 32 of the Evidence Act, but the facts and circumstances of this case do not attract the provisions of this section 32 of the Evidence Act; that since admittedly the victim girl Mahima committed suicide four days after the alleged incident of rape the cause of her death being not the rape her alleged narration of the incident of rape committed on her by the accused persons is not admissible in evidence under section 32 of the Evidence Act. The learned Advocate for the accused-appellant has made submissions to the effect also that the P.Ws.1, 3, 5, 6 and 8 being very close relations of the victim girl Mahima, their evidence also, in the absence of corroboration by independent witnesses, cannot be relied on safely, that these witnesses being highly interested witnesses their evidence to the effect that the incident of rape was narrated to them by the victim girl herself cannot be relied on as true. The learned Advocate for the accused-appellant has made further submissions to the effect that in this case the very alleged fact that victim Mahima was raped has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The learned Advocate has argued that though in the post mortem examination report of the dead body of victim Mahima it was stated that victim Mahima was raped forcefully, but this post mortem examination report also cannot be relied on safely inasmuch as in the inquest report there is no mention of any such injury on the dead body of victim Mahima suggesting commission of forceful rape on her.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate has contended that since there is no legal evidence to prove the charge against this accused-appellant the accused-appellant is entitled to be acquitted, that both the High Court Division and the adalat has committed wrong and illegality in convicting this accused-appellant.<br/><br/>Mr. Momtazuddin Fakir, the learned Additional Attorney General for the State-respondent has made submissions to the effect that in this case the post mortem examination report and the evidence of as many as 3 doctor witnesses-who held post mortem examination on the dead body of victim Mahima-have sufficiently proved that the victim Mahima was gang-raped before she committed suicide. The learned Additional Attorney General has argued that the inquest report cannot falsify the postmortem examination report which was prepared by a medical board consisting of 3 doctors-who had no reason to prepare an incorrect postmortem examination report. The learned Additional Attorney General has argued also that in this case though there is no eye witness of the alleged occurrence of rape, but so many natural and probable witnesses have deposed before court on oath to the effect that victim Mahima herself narrated the occurrence of rape committed on her by the 4 accused persons immediate after that occurrence and that since victim Mahima committed suicide soon thereafter the evidence of these witnesses are admissible in evidence according to the provisions of Evidence Act. The learned Additional Attorney General has argued that section 32 of the Evidence Act has provided some exceptions to hearsay rule and that the facts and circumstances of the present case justify the acceptance of the evidence of these witnesses under section 32(1) of the Evidence Act. The learned Additional Attorney General has argued that the learned Judge of the adalat and also the learned Judges of the High Court Division did not commit any wrong or illegality in relying upon the evidence of P.Ws.1, 3, 5 , 6 and 8-who all have deposed before court on oath that immediate after the occurrence of rape the victim girl Mahima herself narrated the occurrence of rape committed on her by the four accused persons. The learned Additional Attorney General has made submissions to the effect also that these P.Ws.1, 3, 5, 6 and 8 though are close relations of victim Mahima, but for this reason only their evidence cannot be discarded, rather in the facts and circumstances of this case these witnesses are most natural witnesses and there is no reason at all to disbelieve the evidence of these witnesses. The learned Additional Attorney General has contended that this accused-appellant and the other 3 accused  persons have been rightly found guilty of the offence under section 9(1) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and rightly convicted and sentenced thereunder.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates of both the sides and gone through the impugned judgment, that of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat and also the evidence on record.<br/><br/>In this case it is not disputed that victim Mahima, a minor girl of 14 years of age committed suicide by taking poison. Nevertheless the prosecution has proved by adducing necessary evidence that on 19.02.2002 victim Mahima committed suicide by taking poison. The evidence of P.W.18-Md. Abdul Baki Miah, Professor and Head of Forensic Department, Rajshahi Medical College Hospital, coupled with the postmortem examination report of the dead body of victim Mahima and the evidence of near relations of victim Mahima have proved sufficiently that the victim Mahima committed suicide by taking poison on 19.02.2002.<br/><br/>One of the questions raised in this appeal is whether victim Mahima was raped forcefully before she committed suicide. Both the adalat and the High Court Division, on careful examination and consideration of the evidence adduced by the prosecution, have arrived at a concurrent finding that the victim Mahima was gang-raped before she committed suicide. This concurrent finding of the adalat and the High Court Division does not require to be examined in this appeal inasmuch as leave to appeal was granted to consider only whether there is legal evidence to prove the commission of rape on victim Mahima by this accused appellant and other 3 absconding accused persons. However, since the learned Counsel for the appellant, at the time of making argument before us and also in the concise statement has pointed out some  discrepancies in between postmortem examination report and the inquest report of the dead body of Mahima and has argued that in view of the inquest report it cannot be said that the victim Mahima was raped before she committed suicide, we shall discuss and consider the evidence adduced by the prosecution to prove the fact that the victim Mahima was raped before she committed suicide.<br/><br/>The prosecution has adduced the postmortem examination report of the dead body of victim which has been marked as exhibit-6 and has also examined 3 doctors, the P.W.12-Dr. Md. Amdadur Rahman, P.W.13 Dr. Md. Anamul Haque and P.W.19 Dr. Md. Ashraful Alam-who were members of the Board of doctors which conducted the post mortem examination on the dead body of the victim Mahima and issued the exhibit-6. The P.W.12 gave evidence stating details of the injuries found on the dead body of Mahima which included 2 semi healed up echymosis on her inner and medial aspect of right upper thigh each measuring 1 inch in diameter, 3 semi healed up echymosis detected over inner and medial aspect of left upper thigh each measuring 1¼  inch in diameter, 2 semi healed up tooth bite marks detected over right breast each measuring 1/6” X 1/10”, 2 semi healed up scratch abrasion over  left breast measuring ½ X inch. The P.W.12 deposed also that the vulva and vagina of the victim were found congested, bruised and oedematous, vaginal canal was dilated, congested and bruised, hymen was ruptured. The P.W.12 has proved the postmortem examination report-the exhibit-6 prepared by them before court. The P.W.13 and P.W.19 also deposed before court in support of the postmortem examination report. In this postmortem examination report these doctor witnesses gave opinion to the effect that there were positive findings of forceful sexual act and assault on the person of Mahima. This postmortem examination report of the dead body of victim Mahima coupled with the evidence of these doctor witnesses have proved sufficiently that the victim Mahima was raped forcefully. The very nature of injuries found on the private parts of the body of the victim Mahima tells clearly that victim Mahima was raped forcefully before she committed suicide. In the opinion of doctors-the experts in this regard-Mahima was raped forcefully before her death. We find no reason not to rely on this opinion of the doctors. There is no suggestion even from the side of the accused persons as to why these 3 doctors would prepare an incorrect or false postmortem examination report and would depose lie before court on oath. The contention of the learned Advocate for the accused-appellant that since in the inquest report prepared by the police there is no mention of any such injuries found on the dead body of victim Mahima this postmortem examination report cannot be relied on-is not acceptable at all. It appears that the High Court Division, in its judgment, has rightly clarified the alleged discrepancy between the postmortem examination report and the inquest report. The High Court Division has clarified the discrepancy between the inquest report and the postmortem examination report on the dead body of the victim Mahima thus:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“........... we note from the inquest report that the victim was fully clothed at the time of the inquest and, therefore, it is expected that injuries on the lower and upper parts of the thigh of the victim as well as those on her breasts would not be visible and hence that would explain why the injuries were not seen at the time of inquest.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>However, we find no reason at all not to rely on the postmortem examination report which was prepared by a medical board consisting of 3 doctors, as well as the evidence of these 3 doctors before court. In our opinion, in this case, it has been well proved that the victim Mahima was subjected to forceful rape before she committed suicide.<br/><br/>Now about the main question which is to be answered in this appeal. The question is whether there is any legal evidence to prove that this accused-appellant Uzzal @ Elias Hossain along with 3 other absconding accused persons committed rape on victim Mahima. In this case there is no eye witness of this incident of rape. Mahima, the victim of this rape also is no more in this world as she committed suicide shortly after commission of that rape on her. However, the prosecution case is that immediate after commission of rape on her the victim girl Mahima herself narrated the commission of rape on her by the 4 accused persons to some of her close relations, namely, her father-the P.W.1, her mother-the P.W.8, her sister-the P.W.6, her brother-the P.W.5 and also her cousin-the P.W.3. All these above named prosecution witnesses have deposed before court supporting this prosecution case.<br/>The P.W.1, Abdul Hannan-the father of the victim Mahima and also the informant-has deposed to the effect that her daughter Mahima narrated the occurrence to her mother, sister, brother and to him in details. She (Mahima) told them that the accused Farid, Faroque, Selim and Uzzal being armed with ‘hashua‘,‘chhora‘, knife etc. abducted her from his house and took her to the nearby sugarcane filed where they undressed her and raped her one after another; accused Farid took photographs of Mahima when Selim was committing rape on her. That Mahima came home crying and narrated the occurrence to her younger sister Fahima first and then to her mother when she returned home. That when he (the witness himself) returned home from Taherpur Hat at 9.00 P.M. he was told about the occurrence by his wife and also by Mahima herself and her younger sister. That he then went to the father/guardians of the accused persons and informed them about the occurrence demanding justice and return of those photographs and negatives, but was refused and rebuked; that since his requests and begging did not bear any fruit, his daughter Mahima, in order to save her honour and self respect, took poison at about 11.30 A.M. on 19.02.2002. She was immediately admitted to Putia Hospital where she died at about 1.00 P.M. Thereafter he lodged the ejher which was marked exhibit-1 as per his identification. This witness was cross-examined at length on behalf of the accused persons, but nothing could be brought out from him to raise any suspicion about the truth of what he has deposed before court.<br/><br/>The P.W.3, Md. Anwar Hussain has deposed to the effect that on the next morning of the occurrence at 8.00 A.M. he went to the house of the informant and at that time the wife of the informant and the victim girl Mahima herself told him that the accused Uzzal, Farid, Selim and Faroque abducted her at the point of knife, ‘chhora‘ and took her to a sugarcane fled of Abu Bakkar and raped her there one after another. This witness stated further that on sunday at about 8/9.00 A.M. hearing hue and cry he went to the house of the informant and saw there accused Uzzal, Farid, Faroque and Selim and their father/guardians who were abusing the informant telling him that his daughter was of immoral character and that if he persisted with regard to this occurrence then his daughter’s obscene photographs would be pasted at all the street corners. This witness has identified the accused Uzzal in dock and stated also that the other 3 accused persons are absconding since after the occurrence.<br/><br/>The P.W.5, Md. Jahangir Alam-the elder brother of the victim also deposed to the effect that on the date of occurrence he left the house in morning and returned at about 8.30/9.00 P.M. when his mother told him that accused Farid, Faroque, Selim and Uzzal abducted Mahima from their house in her absence in the afternoon on that day and took her to the sugarcane filed of Abu Bakkar and raped her there one after another and also took pictures of Mahima when she was being raped. That on his asking Mahima also narrated that occurrence to him.<br/><br/>The P.W.6, Fahima Khatun-younger sister of the victim also has fully corroborated the prosecution case by stating to the effect that on the date of occurrence her brother left the house in the morning at 6.00 A.M. and her father went to the market at 1.00 P.M. and that at 3.00 P.M. she and her sister Mahima went to watch TV at the house of their uncle Abdul Wahed and Mahima returned home at 4.00 P.M. while she remained there until 10/15 minutes before dusk; when she returned home she found Mahima crying and upon her query she told her that at about 5.30 P.M. when there was no one else at home, accused Uzzal, Farid, Faroque and Selim suddenly threatened her with ‘chhora‘ and knife and tide a ‘gamcha’ to her mouth and took her to the sugarcane filed of Abu Bakkar and undressed her and raped her one after another; Mahima had told her also that while Selim was raping her accused Farid took pictures of her in the nude and accused Uzzal said that he could now make blue films. This P.W.6 stated also that when her mother reached home just after magrib prayer she and Mahima narrated the whole occurrence to her and at 8.00 P.M. when her brother reached home her mother and Mahima narrated the occurrence to him and when her father returned home at 9.00 P.M. her mother and Mahima narrated the occurrence to him also.<br/><br/>The P.W.8 Mst. Sanowara is the mother of the victim. This witness also has fully corroborated the prosecution case. She has stated to the effect that immediate after the occurrence when she returned home his daughter victim Mahima told her crying that the accused Farid, Faroque, Selim and Uzzal abducted her and took her to the sugarcane field of Abu Bakkar and raped her there one after another and also took obscene pictures of her.<br/><br/>All these above named prosecution witnesses have been cross-examined at length on behalf of the accused persons, but nothing material could be brought out to make the evidence of these witnesses false or unreliable. We find no reason to disbelieve the evidence of these witnesses. Rather, we find that the above stated evidence of P.Ws.1, 3, 5, 6 and 8 have proved well the very fact of narration of the incident of rape by the victim Mahima herself to her near relatives immediate after commission of that rape on her. From the side of the accused-appellant it has been argued that the P.Ws.1, 3, 5, 6 and 8 being close relations of the victim Mahima are all interested witnesses and as such their evidence cannot be relied on unless corroborated by independent witnesses. But we are unable to accept this argument of the learned Advocate for the accused-appellant. Rather, we find that in the facts and circumstances of the present case these prosecution witnesses, namely, the P.Ws.1, 3, 5, 6 and 8 are most natural and probable witnesses. It is most natural and probale that victim Mahima-a minor girl of 14 years only, being gang-raped by 4 accused persons, would disclose about that rape on her to her close relations only. It cannot be expected that victim Mahima would disclose about the commission of rape on her to many other non-related persons also. In our society where rape on a girl is considered as most shameful and disgraceful for the girl, the non-discloser of the fact of commission of rape on her by the victim Mahima  to many other non-related persons is most natural. The defence though suggested that there were enmity and ill feelings between the informant side and the accused persons for political and other reasons and out of that enmity the informant and his other relations deposed falsely against the accused persons, but those defence suggestions were not substantiated at all by any evidence or by cross-examining the prosecution witnesses. Both the trial court and the High Court Division have concurred that the suggested enmity in between the informant side and the accused persons have not been proved at all. In the circumstances we find no reason to disbelieve the evidence of the P.Ws.1, 3, 5, 6 and 8 as to the fact that immediate after commission of rape on her victim Mahima narrated the said occurrence of rape to these witnesses. The evidence of these P.Ws. as to the fact that immediate after the commission of rape on her victim Mahima told them about that rape-is direct and as such there cannot be any controversy about admissibility of this part of evidence of these P.Ws.<br/><br/>Now the question is whether the evidence of these P.Ws.1, 3, 5, 6 and 8 stating what they were told by the victim Mahima are admissible in evidence or not. The evidence of these witnesses disclosing what they heard from victim Mahima about commission of rape on her by the accused persons are, no doubt, hearsay evidence.<br/><br/>As a general rule hearsay evidence is excluded and direct evidence must always be given. But there are important exceptions to this rule. Section 32 of our Evidence Act has provided some exceptions to this rule of exclusion of hearsay evidence. The relevant portion of section 32 of the Evidence Act is quoted below:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>            “Cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who is dead or cannot be found, etc., is relevant-Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead, or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following cases:<br/>            (1). When it relates to cause of death-When the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that person’s death comes into question.<br/>            Such statements are relevant whether the person who made them was or was not, at the time when they were made, under expectation of death, and whatever may be the nature of the proceeding in which the cause of his death comes into question.”</em></div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the above quoted provision of section 32 of the Evidence Act it is evident that when any statement is made by a person as to cause of his death or as to any of the circumstances which resulted in his death, the same is admissible in evidence in a case in which the cause of death of that person comes into question. The expression “any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death” in the above quoted clause (1) of section 32 is wider than the expression “the cause of his death”. The words “resulted in his death” do not mean “caused his death”. Death may be homicidal or suicidal and, therefore, the word ‘death’ includes suicidal death. So, the statement of a person, who commits suicide, also is admissible under section 32 of the Evidence Act in any proceeding in which the cause of his death comes into question provided the statement relates to the cause of his committing suicide or exhibits circumstances leading to his suicidal death.<br/><br/>So, in a rape case, the victim of which, being highly shocked and humiliated by the commission of rape on her, committed suicide her statement as to rape and rapists is admissible in evidence according to section 32(1) of the Evidence Act.<br/><br/>In the present case victim Mahima, being highly humiliated and shocked by the commission of gang-rape on her, committed suicide. The reason of her committing suicide is the commission of forceful gang-rape on her. In other words, the commission of gang-rape on her resulted in her committing suicide. Rape itself might not have caused her death, but rape certainly was the cause of her committing suicide. So, there cannot be any argument against the conclusion that commission of rape on victim Mahima resulted in her death.<br/><br/>The definite case of the prosecution is that being highly humiliated and shocked by the commission of gang-rape on her victim Mahima committed suicide. So, in this case of rape the cause of death also of victim Mahima comes into question. It needs to be mentioned here that section 32(1) of the Evidence Act has made statement of a dead person relating to cause of his death admissible in all kind of proceedings in which the cause of his death comes into question.<br/><br/>Victim Mahima narrated the commission of rape on her by 4 accused persons to P.Ws.1, 3, 5, 6 and 8 and these P.Ws. have deposed before court on oath to that effect. The evidence of these P.Ws. to the effect that victim Mahima stated to them that the accused persons committed rape on her, therefore, though hearsay, is admissible in evidence according to section 32(1) of the Evidence Act.<br/><br/>In our country the incident of rape is rampant. Very often the victims of rape commits suicide being highly humiliated and shocked by such rape on her. Generally there is no eye-witness of such rape, the only witness of such rape is the victim herself. The victims of rape sometimes narrate the commission of rape on them and disclose the names of the rapists to their near and dear ones before they commit suicide. In such cases the only evidence that may be made available is the hearsay evidence of such near and dear ones of the victims of rape. To hold that such hearsay evidence in a case of rape is inadmissible would be negation of justice and clear misinterpretation of the provision of section 32(1) of the Evidence Act.<br/><br/>Failure to punish the rapists even after discloser of their names by the victim of rape before her committing suicide is not only a great injustice to the victim of rape but injustice to the society also.<br/><br/>Now the question comes whether the victim Mahima told the truth to her near relatives. It has been well proved in this case that the victim Mahima was raped forcibly before she committed suicide. We find no reason why the victim Mahima would falsely implicate these four accused persons letting the real rapists escape. She was gang-raped and immediate after that occurrence of gang-rape she disclosed the names of these accused persons as rapists to her near relations. We find no reason not to believe these statements of the victim Mahima as true.<br/><br/>So, from the above discussion it is evident that in this case though there is no direct evidence of commission of rape on the victim Mahima by the accused persons, but there are some other indirect evidence, which are quite admissible in evidence as per section 32(1) of the Evidence Act and these evidence have proved beyond all reasonable doubt that this accused-appellant Uzzal @ Elias Hossain along with 3 other convicted accused persons committed rape on victim Mahima. In our opinion the Adalat as well as the High Court Division did not commit any wrong at all in finding these four accused persons guilty of having committed the offence of rape on victim Mahima.<br/><br/>            We find no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>            In the circumstances this criminal appeal be dismissed.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/> </div></div></div>
