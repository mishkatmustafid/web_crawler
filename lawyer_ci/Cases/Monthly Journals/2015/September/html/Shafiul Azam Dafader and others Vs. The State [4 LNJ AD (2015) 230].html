Considering the facts and circumstances of a particular case the court is to decide whether the delay in lodging the F.I.R. is fatal and whether this delay in lodging the F.I.R. makes the prosecution case doubtfull. Considering all these facts and circumstances both the trial court and the High Court Division found that the delay of 5 days in lodging the F.I.R. was not  fatal to create any doubt about the truth of the prosecution case. Considering the facts and circumstances we also find that in this case the delay in lodging the F.I.R. cannot be a ground for disbelieving the truth of the prosecution case. . . . (80 and 81)<br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)<br/>Section 154</strong><br/>There is no bar in filing a second F.I.R. if the first information about any occurrence given to the police station is vague and indefinite and does not disclose the actual offence committed in that occurrence. In the present case the GDE which was made in the concerned police station at the time when the occurrence was still going on does not disclose the offences committed in that occurrence and hence the subsequent F.I.R. stating the offences committed in that occurrence in details is the actual F.I.R. and there is no legal bar in accepting this F.I.R. in the stated facts and circumstances. . . .(82)<br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)<br/>Section 161</strong><br/>The delay in examining the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the investigating officer can be any reason for discarding their evidence before court. …(82)<br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)<br/>Section 154<br/>Evidence Act (I of 1872)<br/>Section 134</strong><br/>There is no law requiring examination of all the F.I.R. named and charge sheeted witnesses before court. Rather it is well established by judicial pronouncements that conviction of accused can safely be based on the evidence of one witness only if his evidence is full, complete and selfcontained and believable. The prosecution is not bound at all to examine all the witnesses mentioned in the F.I.R. or in the charge sheet. . . .(84)<br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)<br/>Section 154<br/>Evidence Act (I of 1872)<br/>Section 157</strong><br/>In this case the informant, who lodged the F.I.R. was not the eye-witness to the occurrence. Hearing from others she lodged the F.I.R. So it was very natural that in the F.I.R. all the details of the occurrence could not be stated properly and correctly. The evidence of P.Ws.2 to 8-the eye-witnesses to the occurrence are consistent. In the circumstances the discripancy between the F.I.R. story and the evidence of these eye witnesses cannot be any reason for disbelieving the evidence of these eye-witnesses in this particular case. . . . (85).<br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)<br/>Sections 3, 5 and 8</strong><br/>It is true that the evidence of the interested and partisan witnesses must be scrutinized and considered cautiously before it is accepted. But the evidence of the interested and partisan witnesses should not be discarded for the reason only that they are partisan and interested witnesses if their credibility is not shaken by the defence. ...(86)<br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)<br/>Section 3</strong><br/>The evidence of partisan witnesses need not always be discarded only for the reason of their relationship, when their evidence are found to be reliable that can be basis for convicting the accused. . . . (86)<br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)<br/>Section 376</strong><br/>The learned Advocate for the condemned prisoner has made submissions to the effect also that this accused-appellant Aiyub Ali has been detaining in the condemned cell for long 10 years with mental agony of death and now this Division, for the ends of justice, may show some mercy to him and may commute his sentence of death to a sentence of life imprisonment. But considering the very offence of cruel murders of as many as 3 persons committed by this accused-appellant Aiyub Ali we do not think that he can be shown any mercy at all.          . . .

By the side of that road the house, of accused Aiyub Ali, sitting chairman of Bagra Union was situated. While Monawar Ali along with his brothers and nephew were going through that road, all on a sudden, the accused persons, namely, Aiyub Ali chairman, Nazir, Mizan and Badshah, sons of late Swarup Ali, Sabuj Ali, Kuti Chan, Mahfuz, Mintoo, Abdul Mannan Shah, Faruq Gazi, Salam, Mithu, Alek member, son of late Hossain, Selim, Billal, Ripon, Piyar Ali, Jasim, Muluk, Alek, son of unknown, Shafiul Azam, Syed Chowdhury, Ayesha Khatun, wife of Abu Jaher, Rubel, Maram Ali, Abdur Rob Bepari @ Roba, Keru Fakir member, Adalat Sikder, Jainal Talukder, Aynal, Haroon, Salam Sikder, Shamsuddin, Aminur Rahman, Jewel, Abdul Mannan @ Mobile Mannan, Kuddus Bepari, Akram Ali Bepari, Rouf, Faran Sheikh, Titan Khan, Hossain member, Malek Bepari, Shah Alam Bepari, Muktar Hossain, Sekander, Ummat Ali, Mahfuz, son of Salam Sikder, Amin, Israfil Bepari, Abbas, Hashem, son of Hasen Gazi, Faraj Ali, Motaleb Fakir, Ketu Salam @ Kota Salam, Abdul Gazi and many unknown persons being armed with weapons like gun, ‘ramdao’, ‘chapati’, iron rod, chinese axe etc. attacked them. Though the deceased Monwar Ali and his associates were carrying two licensed guns and one pistol they along with Hashem, being chased, ran towards the house of Srijon Bepari and entered into that house and started shouting “save, save”. Hearing their alarm, the neighbouring people gathered there. In the meantime, the accused Aiyub Ali and the aforesaid accused persons started shouting saying that Monwar Ali chairman whould be killed. The accused Aiyub Ali chairman started firing targeting the house of Srijan Bepari. He and the aforesaid accused persons fired targeting the public also so that they could not come forward. Being frightened the public went away far. Deceased Manwar Ali and his associates requested Srijan Bepari to give them shelter in his house. Haji Srijan Bepari, being kind enough, gave them shelter in his two storied wooden house and for that the accused persons started looting that house. Finding no other way the deceased Monwar Ali started blank firing from his brother’s licensed gun and pistol and instructed his relatives over mobile phone to inform the police station. In the meantime, accused Kuti Chand, Nizam, Nazim, Sabuj Ali, Hashem and Alauddin broke open the door of that house of Srijan Bepari and entered into that house and tried to drag away Badsha. Hashem, who also took shelter in that house along with Monwar Ali and his assocaites, was trying to drag Badsha into the house. The accused Faruq Gazi then shot Hashem with a gun and as a result Hashem died. The other accused persons from out side the house fired many shots one of which hit Badsha causing bleeding injury. At that time Alauddin from the accused’s group, who entered into that house to drag out the victims, also received a bullet injury and died.<br/><br/>That the reason for carrying guns and pistol by the deceased Monwar Ali and his brothers is that the accused Aiyub Ali chairman and his family members are their enemy. 26/27 years back the accused Aiyub Ali and his brothers took away the father of the deceased Monwar Ali from a tea-stall of Bagrabazar and cut his body into pieces and threw the pieces into the river Padma. The pieces of the body could not be found. Since thereafter, they were threatening the deceased Monwar Ali and his family members also and for this reason they used to carry their licensed guns and pistol while they had to go to Bagrabazar. That the accused A. Rob @ Roba, son of late Rashid Bepari informed the accused Aiyub Ali about the deceased Monwar Ali’s going to Bagrabazar on 07.07.2001. Roba is the terrorist of the accused Aiyub Ali’s group who was in the jail several times for his terrorist activities. Being informed by Roba the accused Aiyub Ali took preparation about which the deceased Monwar Ali was ignorant. <br/><br/>While the above stated occurrence was going on Sreenagar Thana police went to the place of occurrence at about 1.00 P.M. and sent message to different police stations. The Deputy Commissioner and the police super of Munshiganj and the T.N.O. from Sreenagar went to the place of occurrence from 2.00 P.M. to 5.00 P.M. The District Magistrate, the police super and the O.C., Sreenagar P.S. could not bring the accused persons under control. The deceased Monwar Ali and his companions were in confinement at the 1st floor of Srijon Bepari’s wooden house from 9.00 A.M. At about 6.00 P.M. the District Magistrate and the Police Administration announced through a hand mike addressing Monwar Ali to come throwing down their weapons and to surrender. They also announced assuring them that if they surrendered to them they would save them. Hearing this, the deceased Monwar Ali along with others came down from the 1st floor of the said house. The police then arrested them out of suspicion and handcuffed them. Forthwith, the accused Aiyub Ali and the other accused persons snatched the deceased Monwar Ali and his companions away from the police custody. The accused Aiyub Ali then dealt a sharp weapon blow on the back of the head of deceased Monwar Ali in presence of police. At the same time, the other accused persons, namely, Nazir, Mizan, Nizam, Badsha, Sabuj, Kuti Chan, Mahfuz, Mintoo gave indiscriminate blows with sharp cutting weapons on the different parts of the body of the deceased Monwar Ali. The accused Abdul Mannan Shah, son of Malek Shah, Faruq Gazi, Salam, Mintoo, Alek member, son of Hossain, Selim, Billal, Ripon, Piyar Ali, Jasim, Muluk, Alek, son of unknown, Safiul Azam, Syed Chowdhury, Ayesha Khatun, wife of Abu Taher started dealing blows on the body of the deceased Monwar Ali with sharp cutting weapons. The accused Jainal son of late Beshai Talukder, Aynal son of Joynal Talukder, Haroon, Salam Sikder, Samsuddin, Sekander, Ummet Ali, Mahfuz son of Salam Sikder, Rubel, Keru Fakir member dealt stick and iron rod blows to the brothers of the deceased Monwar Ali. The accused Aminur Rahman, Jewel, Abdul Mannan started dealing blows on the body of Salauddin, the nephew of the deceased Monwar Ali with sharp cutting weapons. The accused Kamal, Abbas, Hashim, Kuddus Bepari, Akram Ali Bepari, Rouf, Fazal, Sheikh, Titan Khan, Hasen member, Malek Bepari, Sahah Alam Bepari started firing all around so that no body come forward to rescue them. The accused Mukter Hossain Bepari, Motaleb Gazi, Idris, Faraj Ali, Motaleb Fakir, Hari Das, Ketu Salam @ Kota Salam, Abdul Awal Gazi, Gaffar assisted the other accused persons. At that time, due to indiscriminate firing of accused persons, one passerby, namely, Ismail Gazi an old man, received a bullet injury on his dead and died. The deceased Monwar Ali and Badsha, due to the aforesaid blows, died at the place of occurrence. Thereafter, police took the dead bodies of Monwar Ali, Badsha, Hashem, Alauddin and Ismail Gazi to the police station by police van. As Anwar Ali and Salauddin-the elder brother and the nephew of the deceased Monwar Ali were alive they were sent to the hospital.<br/><br/>At about 7.00 P.M. on the date of occurrence the informant-the wife of deceased Monwar Ali heard about the death of her husband from the witnesses and lost sense. At about 2.00/2.30 P.M. the dead bodies of the deceased Monwar Ali and Badsha were sent to the hospital for autopsy. After completion of autopsy their bodies were brought to the residence of the informant and at that time also the informant lost her sense once again. Injured Md. Anwar Ali and Salauddin were in hospital and other relatives were living abroad. The cause of delay in lodging the First Information Report was that the informant lost balance of her mind because of the death of her husband.<br/>On 12.07.2001 Meherun Nessa-the wife of deceased Manwar Ali lodged the First Information Report with Sreenagar Police Station on the basis of which Sreenagar P.S.

Mr. Mansural Haque Chowdhury, the learned Advocate has appeared for the condemned-prisoner-appellant Faruq Gazi of Criminal Appeal No.27 of 2012 and accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam of Criminal Appeal No.35 of 2012. Mr. Md. Sarwar Ahmed, the learned Advocate has appeared for the condemned-prisoner-appellant Md. Aiyub Ali chairman and the accused-appellant Md. Mahfuzur Rahman @ Mahfuz S/O Aiyub Ali of Criminal Appeal No.26 of 2012. Mr. Mohammad Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record has appeared for the accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader of Criminal Appeal No.25 of 2012.  <br/> <br/>Mr. Khandaker Diliruzzaman, the learned Deputy Attorney General has appeared for the State-respondent in all the criminal appeals.<br/>We have heard the learned Advocates for the accused-appellants and also the learned Deputy Attorney General for the State-respondents at length.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Sarwar Ahmed, the learned Advocate appearing for the accused-appellant Md. Aiyub Ali and Mahfooz s/o Aiyub Ali has made argument to the effect that the accused Aiyub Ali and his son accused Mahfooz have been entangled in this case falsely out of enmity and grudge, that in this case it has been sufficiently proved from the evidence adduced by the prosecution that there was long standing enmity in between this accused-appellant Aiyub Ali and his family members and the deceased Monwar Ali and his family members on different issues including political issue. The learned Advocate has argued that all the alleged eye witnesses to the alleged occurrence, who have deposed before the court as P.Ws.2 to 8 and also the informant, being close relatives and partymen of deceased Monwar Ali, have deposed before court implicating these accused-appellants falsely out of grudge. The learned Advocate has argued that the trial court and also the High Court Division did not consider this aspect at all and consequently they have committed wrong and injustice in finding these accused-appellants guilty relying on the evidence of these interested and partisan witnesses only. The learned Advocate has argued also that the evidence which these witnesses have given before the court are also contradictory on material points and that on this count also the evidence of these prosecution witnesses are not reliable at all. The learned Advocate for the accused-appellants has made argument to the effect also that in the FIR as many as 28 persons have been named as eye witnesses but out of these 28 eye witnesses only 4 witnesses, namely, P.Ws.2, 3, 4 and 7 have been examined by the prosecution before court but no explanation whatsoever, has been given from the side of the prosecution for withholding the other FIR named eye witnesses. The learned Advocate has argued that the withholding of so many FIR named eye witnesses by the prosecution also reasonably creates doubt about the prosecution case. The learned Advocate has pointed out also that there are material discrepancies in between the FIR and the evidence of the witnesses before court and has argued that these discrepancies between the FIR story and the evidence adduced before court very reasonably makes the prosecution case false. The learned Advocate has submitted that the evidence adduced before the court deviating from the FIR story should be taken into consideration with much caution as there remains scope for making subsequent embellishment of the prosecution case and has argued that in this present case the subsequent embellishment and departure from the FIR story has been overlooked by both the trial court and the appellate court causing failure of justice. The learned Advocate has made argument to the effect also that some of the own witnesses of the prosecution though have deposed before court to the effect that the men of Aiyub Ali attacked the deceased/victims but these witnesses did not say at all that the accused Aiyub Ali himself was present in the place of occurrence or took any part in that occurrence. The learned Advocate has contended that these evidence of the own witnesses of the prosecution rather proves that accused Aiyub Ali himself was not at all involved in the alleged occurrence, but he has been entangled in this case by the informant side out of enmity and grudge only. The learned Advocate has contended also that the evidence of these prosecution witnesses, namely, P.Ws.9, 10, 11 and 15 rather proves that the accused-appellant Aiyub Ali had no involvement in this alleged occurrence. Mr. Md. Sarwar Ahmed, the learned advocate for the accused-appellants has made argument to the effect also that though some of the prosecution witnesses have deposed to the effect that this accused Aiyub Ali dealt a chapati blow on the back side of the head of the deceased Monwar Ali, but this evidence is doubtful inasmuch as some other prosecution witnesses have deposed to the effect that accused Aiyub Ali had a gun in his hand. The learned Advocate has contended that these contradictory evidence of the own witnesses of the prosecution has made the charge against this accused-appellant doubtful and in the circumstances this accused-appellant is entitled to be acquitted from this charge. The learned Advocate for the accused-appellant Aiyub Ali and Mahfooz son of Aiyub Ali has argued also that the other charges brought against these accused-appellants for killing deceased Badsh and Hashem Kazi have not been proved at all. The learned Advocate has pointed out that though the prosecution case is that at the time of occurrence the accused persons killed Hashem Kazi also by firing shot, but this prosecution case has been proved false by the postmortem examination repot of dead body of Hashem which shows that there was no gun shot injury at all on the dead body of Hashem. The learned Advocate has argued that though these accused appellants have been convicted for killing deceased Badsha also but there is no evidence at all to prove that these accused-appellants took any part in killing Badsha.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Sarwar Ahmed, the learned Advocate has made argument to the effect also that in this case the own evidence of the prosecution itself has rather proved that the deceaseds and victims of this case were miscreants and they came to the place of occurrence with fire arms like guns and pistol with an intention to commit crime and they also committed murder of Alauddin son of accused Ayesha and at this the local people, being agitated, assaulted them and consequently some of them died, but long 5 days after this occurrence the informant, being influenced by some enemies of the accused persons, lodged the FIR making a false story. The learned Advocate has argued that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses to the effect that the high officials of Administration and police asked the deceased and other victims by hand mike to surrender and to deposit their arms supports this case that the deceased and the victims actually came there to commit some crmies and they were assaulted and killed by the agitated mob. The learned Advocate has pointed out that in the inquest reports also of the dead bodies, the deceaseds were mentioned as miscreants. Mr. Md. Sarwar Ahmed has argued also that in this case the alleged eye witness P.W.2 Alhaj Sirajuddin Bepari was not examined by the investigating officer and the rest alleged eye witnesses were examined by the investigating officer after a long laps of time and in the circumstances the evidence of these alleged eye witnesses should be left out of consideration as per settled principle of law.<br/>Mr. Md. Sarwar Ahmed, the learned Advocate has made argument to the effect also that according to the own case of the prosecution, Alauddin, son of accused Ayesha Begum, was killed inside the house of Srijon Bepari where deceased Monwar Ali and his companions were staying with arms, that this deceased Alauddin is the full brother of accused Nazir, Mizan, Nizam and Badsha and these accused-persons having seen the dead body of their brother, being highly shocked and gravely provocated, participated in the free fight arose between the parties and that these facts prove that the occurrence took place without any premeditation and it occured as a result of sudden grave provocation. The learned Advocate has contended that in the circums-tances the conviction under section 302 of the Penal Code may be altered to one under section 304, part-II of the Penal Code. The learned Advocate has made submissions to the effect also that the accused-appellant Aiyub Ali has been detaining in the condemned cell and has been suffering from mental agony of death for about 10 years and considering these fact as extenuating circumstances this court may now commute his sentence of death to imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdul Motin Khashru, the learned Advocate appearing for the appellants Mannan Shah, Shawkat Ali and Hashem has made arguments to the effect that the charges framed against these 3 appellants have not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt, that the evidence which the prosecution has adduced before court to prove the charges against these accused-appellants could not prove at all these accused-appellants guilty of the said charges. The learned Advocate has argued that though the prosecution has examined some alleged eye witnesses before court but the evidence of these alleged witnesses, namely, P.Ws.2 to 8 are contradictory to each other and as such these evidence could not prove the charges against these accused-appellants at all. The learned Advocate has pointed out that according to the case of the prosecution as many as 15 persons dealt blows on victim Monwar Ali with sharp cutting weapons like ‘chan’, ‘dao’, axe and ‘chapati’ at a time but in the postmortem examination report of the dead body of victim Monwar Ali there is no incised wound on the body of the victim and that this fact also tells in favour of falsehood of the prosecution case. Mr. Abdul Motin Khashru has made submissiont to the effect also that admittedly dead body of Alauddin son of accused Ayesha and full brother of accused Nazir, Nizam, Mizan and Badsha was brought out of the house where victim Monwar Ali and his associates were staying with fire arms and that seeing the dead body of Alauddin his near and dear ones, being highly shocked and provocated, might have attacked the victims and in the circumstances this case comes within the ambit of section 304, part-II of the Penal Code and not under section 302 of the Penal Code. The learned Advocate has made argument to the effect also that the High Court Division found that the charges framed against some other convicted persons were not proved beyond reasonable doubt and, therefore, acquitted those accused persons, that the accused-appellants Mannan Shah, Shawkat Ali and Hashem also stand on the same footing with those accused-persons who have been acquitted by the appellate court and as such these accused persons also are entitled to get benefit of doubt and entitled to be acquitted.<br/><br/>Mr. Mansurul Haque Chowdhury, the learned Advocate appearing for the accused-appellant Faruq Gazi and A. Salam @ Ketu Salam @ Kota Salam has made argument to the effect that the charge framed against these 2 accused-appellants have not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt. The learned Advocate has pointed out that the allegations against these 2 accused- appellants is that they murdered Hashem and Badsha by gun shot, but the postmortem examination report of the dead bodies of Hashem and Badsha proved that there was at all no gun shot injury on those bodies. The learned Advocate has contended that this very fact make the allegations against these 2 accused-appellants false. Mr. Mansurul Haque Chowdhury has submitted also to the effect that the evidence of the alleged eye witnesses to the occrrence are contradictory and these evidence could not prove the charges framed against these 2 accused-appellants beyond all reasonable doubt. The learned Advocate has argued to the effect also that the own evidence of the prosecution has rather proved that the deceased and the victims went to the palce of occurrence with fire arms for commiting some crime and at that time the local people, being agitated, attacked them and ultimaely the agitated mob assaulted them causing death of some of them, but 5 days after that occurrence the informant, being ill advised by some inmical persons of the accused side, lodged the FIR making false allegations against the accused persons; that in this case it has not been proved by any cogent evidence that these appellants Faruq Gazi and A. Salam @ Ketu Salam took any part in the alleged occurrence and in the circumstances these 2 appellants are entilted to get benefit of doubt. The learned Advocate has argued also that though these 2 accused appellants have been convicted under sections 302/109 of the Penal Code, but there is no iota of evidence in this case to prove that these 2 accused-appellants in any way abetted the offence of murder.<br/><br/>Mr. Mohammad Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the accused-appelant Shafiul Azam Dafader has made submissions similar to those made by the learned Advocates for other accused-appellants as stated above. The learned Advocate-on-Record also has made argument to the effect that the evidence adduced by the prosecution could not prove the charge against the accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader inasmuch as the alleged eye-witnesses-whom the prosecution has examined in this case-are all interested and partisan witnesses and their evidence also are contradictory to each other.<br/><br/>Mr. Khondaker Diliruzzaman, the learned Deptuy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the State respondents in all the criminal appeals has advanced argument to the effect that it is a brutal murder case, that in this occurrence as many as 5 persons were murdered and 2 others were critically injured in broad day light in presence of thousands of people including high officials of Administration and police; that in this sensasional case the proseuction adduced sufficient evidence to prove the charges framed against the accused persons and the trial court and also the High Court Division examined, sifted  and considered these evidence minutely and propertly and found these accused-appellants guilty rightly. The learned Deput Attorney General has argued that in this case so many eye witnesses to the occurrence have been examined by the prosecution all of whom have deposed supporting the prosecution case and that there is no cogent ground for discarding the evidence of these eye witnesses to the occurence; that both the trial court and the High Court Divison, considering all aspects, have accepted the evidence of these witnesses as reliable and that from the side of the accused-appellants nothing materal could be shown/detected to make these findings and decision of the trial court and the High Court Division not sustainable. Referring to the relevant portion of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses the learned Deputy Attorney General has argued that these evidence of the prosecution witnesses have sufficiently proved the charges brought against these accused-appellants and as scuh they cannot get acquittal as prayed for in these appeals. Refuting the argument advanced by the learned Advocates for the accused-appellants the learned Deputy Attorney General has made submissions to the effect also that in this case the delay of 5 days in lodging FIR is not fatal at all inasmuch as there were cogent reasons for not being able to lodge the FIR earlier and that the High Court Division has dealt with this point raised from the side of the accused persons and concluded correctly that the delay in lodging the FIR in the instant case, did not make the prosecution case doubtful at all. The learned Deputy Attorney General has argued also that in this case as many as 8 eye witnesses have been examined by the prosecution all of whom have deposed supporting the prosecution case and besides, some other witnesses also have deposed in this case lending support to the prosecution case and that in the circumstances the non-examination of some other FIR named or charge sheeted witnesses does not make the prosecution case weak or doubtful at all. The learned Deputy Attorney General has made argument to the effect also that the relationship of the prosecution witnesses wtih the informant side does not make their evidence unbelievable if their evidence is otherwise trustworthy and that in this case the evidence of these prosecution witnesses are trustworthy and a such cannot be disbelieved and discarded only for the reason that they are related to the informant side. The learned Deputy Attorny General has argued to the effect also that in this case it has been proved sufficiently that there was long standing enmity in between the accused Aiyub Ali-the present chairman of the Bagra Union and the deceased Monwar Ali-the former chairman of the same Union and in the circumstances the evidence of the prosecution witnesses to the effect that out of that enmity and grudge the accused persons, at the behest of accused Aiyub Ali-chairman, committed this occurrence-cannot be disbelieved.  <br/><br/>For considering the arguments advanced by the learned Advocates for the accused-appellants and the learned Deputy Attorney General for the State-respondents we require to narrate the relevant portion of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses here. It has already been mentioned above that in this case the prosecution has examined 23 witnesses before court in order to prove its case.<br/><br/>The P.W.1 is the informant Meherunnessa. Admittedly, this witness is not an eye witness to the occurrence. Hearing about the occurrence from others she lodged the F.I.R. So we do not find the evidence of this P.W.1 important to be discussed in this judgment.<br/><br/>The P.W.2-Alhaj Sirajuddin Bepari @ Srijan Bepri is an eye witness to the occurrence. This witness has deposed to the effect that on the date of occurrence,  on 07.07.2001 at 8.00 A.M. to 9.00 A.M. he was sitting in his house. At that time Monwar Ali, Anwar Ali, Badsha, Hashem and Salauddin came to him and requested him to save them. On query, he learnt that the accused Aiyub Ali was chasing them to kill. Salauddin forthwith closed the door. He (the witness) looked through the window and saw that the accused Aiyub Ali himself and his associates encircled the north and western side of his house and they were pelting stones targeting his house. Subsequently, the accused Kuti Chand, Nizam, Nazim, Sabuj Ali, Hashem and Alauddin broke open the door and entered into his house and made attempt to drag away Badsha. Hashem, who also took shelter in his house was trying to drag Badsha into the house. The accused Faruq Gazi then shot Hashem with a gun and as a result, Hashem fell down on the bags containing paddy. That the other accused persons from out side the house fired many shots. The accused Mannan Shah was firing with a cut rifle. The accused Ketu Salam was firing with a gun targeting his house. He saw that the deceased Badsha was bleeding. Monwar Ali told that Badsha was injured. They took Badsha to the 1st floor. Subsequently, he saw Alauddin to fall down. After taking Badsha to the 1st floor the deceased Monwar Ali closed the door of the stair case at 11.30 A.M. to 12 O’clock noon. Subsequently, he (P.W.2) went out of his house and went to the house of his cousin and saw that firing was going on. That Monwar Ali and others also were firing. He heard that the accused Aiyub Ali also opened fire. Thereafter, he heard that the deceased Monwar Ali was being asked to surrender. In the evening police brought down Monwar Ali, Badsha, Anwar Ali and Salauddin under handcuff. When they were brought in front of a bamboo clump the accused Aiyub Ali dealt sharp cutting weapon blow under his head and asked his associates why they still kept alive those persons. He asked his associates to deal sharp cutting weapon blows to Monwar Ali and others. Subsequently, the other accused persons, namely, Kuti Chand, Mizan, Nizam dealt sharp cutting blows to Monwar Ali and also beat him up. The accused Kuti Chan had a wooden ‘rowa‘, ‘(dasa)’ in his hand, the accused Nazir had an iron pipe of tube well. The accused Badsha had a ‘dao’ in his hand. The accused Mizan had a ‘dao’ in his right hand and a rod in his left hand. The accused Sabuj Ali had a rod and a ‘dao’ in his hand, accused Salam Sikder had a ‘Ram dao’, the accused Hashem had big ‘chhan’, accused Ripon had a ’chinese axe’, accused Awal Gazi had a ‘dao’ in his hand, accused Mobile Mannan had a sharp cutting ’dao’ in his hand, accused Mahfuz had a big chinese axe, accused Babul had a big ‘dao’, accused Shafiul Azam Dafader had a big ‘dao’ in his hand, accused Seraj had a big ‘chhan’, and accused Javed had a ‘chapati’ in his hand. Accused Mannan Shah opened fire with a rifle. Accused Hashem dealt blow on the chest of Monwar Ali with a big wooden ‘dasa’. The other accused persons dealt ‘dao’ blows to Monwar Ali, Anwar Ali and Badsha and also dealt kick blows. Accused Ayesha Begum dealt blows on the head of the deceased Monwar Ali with a brick. Monwar Ali fell down to the ground. The accused persons plundered away materials from his house and set his house on fire. On the following day he filed a case against the accused persons. This witness has identified the accused persons Aiyub Ali, Ketu Salam, Babul, Shafiul Azam Dafader, Mannan Shah, Ayesha Begum, Mahfuz and Titon Khan on dock. This P.W.2 was cross-examined at length on behalf of the accused persons, but nothing material came out from his cross-examination to make his evidence false. This witness has denied the defence suggestion that accused Aiyub Ali could not walk without help of stick.<br/><br/>The P.W.3 Md. Salauddin-one of the injured witnesses has deposed to the effect that the occurrence took place on 07.07.2001. On that day, at about 8.00 A.M. after breakfast, he along with deceased Monwar Ali Chairman, Anwar Ali and Badsha came out of their house and started for Bagra Bazar. When they reached near the house of Tota Sikder they heard the sound of the utterance ‘catch them’. They looked back and saw the accused Aiyub Ali, Nizam, Mizan, Kuti Chand, Sabuj Ali, Nazim, Badsha, Mannan Shah, Alauddin, Ketu Salam, Mobile Mannan, Mintoo, Shawkat Ali, Mahfuz, Hashem, Shafiullah, Salam Skider and others comming running towards them. Finding no other way they entered into the house of Srijan Bepari and he locked the latch of the door. Breaking the latch, the accused Alauddin, Hashem, Nizam, Kuti Chand, Nazir entered into the house and made attempt to drag away Badsha from the house. Deceased Hashem obstructed the accused persons and tried to save Badsha. Accused Faruq Gazi shot the deceased hashem and as a result, the deceased Hashem fell down on the bags of paddy. Thereafter the accused persons made attempt to drag out Badsha. At that moment the accused Mannan Shah and Ketu Salam opened fire with gun and rifle through the window at which Badsha raised alarm and he then saw that Badsha was bleeding. They then took Badsha to the 1st floor and closed the door. Thereafter, the accused persons fired indiscriminately. Monwar Ali and Anwar Ali opened blank fire. This situation continued till 12 O’clock noon. Deceased Monwar Ali informed his relatives through mobile phone to send massage to the police station for rescuing them. Thereafter some police came to the place of occurrence but could not control the accused persons. The police asked them to surrender assuring them that they would help them and escort them safely to their houses. That the accused persons at that time also fired indiscriminately and also hurled bricks and stones. Thereafter police along with officers from different police station came to the place of occurrence and at the assurance of police they handed over their licensed arms to police at 4.30. P.M. Subsequently they came down from the 1st floor and the police then handcuffed them. That police handcuffed him and deceased Monwar Ali together and Badsha and Anwar Ali together. In the meantime Hashem died. The police took them near the bamboo clump under handcuff. At that time accused Aiyub Ali saying ‘finish them’ dealt chapati blow at the back side of the head of deceased Monwar Ali. Accused Kuti chand dealt ‘wooden dasa’ blow on the head of Monwar Ali and as a result Monwar Ali fell down to the ground. Accused Nazir kept dealing tube well iron pipe blows to the deceased Monwar Ali.

Accused Ayesha Khatun dealt brick blow on the head of Monwar Ali Chairman. Said accused persons also dealt him sharp cutting weapons and stick blows. Accused Mannan Shah, Faruq Gazi and others jumped on Anwar Ali and Badsha.That he was lying pretending to be dead. At about dusk police took him to Sreenagar Police Station in a van where he regained sense completely. At 12 O’clock at night he along with Anwar Ali was taken to Dhaka Medical Collage Hospital. Subsequently he heard that chairman Monwar Ali, Badsha and Hashem had died. This P.W.3 has deposed to the effect also that there was enmity in betweent the accused persons and his maternal uncle Monwar Ali from before. This witness has identified the accused persons present on dock. This P.W.3 was cross-examined at length on behalf of the accused persons, but nothing material came out from his cross-examination to make his evidence false or unbelievable.    <br/><br/>The P.W.4 Md. Anwar Ali-the other injured witness has depsoed to the effect that on 07.07.2001 at about 8.00 A.M. he along with the deceased Monwar Ali, his cousin Badsha and nephwe Salauddin started for Bagra Bazar with their licensed gun. On the way they took Hashem with them. When they reached near the house of Tota Sikder they heard the sound ”catch and shoot”.

Accused Ketu Salam fired with a gun in his hand which hit Badsha and blood came out from his body. He along with Salauddin and Monwar Ali then took Badsha to the 1st floor of the house of Srijan Bepari and closed the door of the room. At that time Hashem died. That Monwar Ali then fired two blank gun shots to frighten the terrorist, but the accused persons kept firing. Monwar Ali then informed his relatives and police station by mobile phone and long after, police stared coming. The police asked Monwar Ali to deposit their guns and rifles saying that they would escort them to their residence safely. Ultimately Monwar Ali deposited two guns, one pistol and cartridges to the police. They dropped the arms and ammunitions down from the 1st floor. Thereafter, the accused persons set the house on fire. The police told them to come down and soon after they came down, 5/6 police personnel then handcuffed them.

This witness has been cross-examined at length on behalf of the accused persons.<br/>These are the evidence which the prosecution has adduced in this case to prove the charges framed against the accused persons. In this judgment we are to consider only whether the evidence adduced in this case justify the conviction and sentences imposed on the accused-appellants before us.<br/><br/>Before scanning the evidence of the prosecution witnesses we require to address some legal points raised on behalf of the accused-appellants.<br/><br/>It has been argued from the side of the accused-appellants that in this case the F.I.R. was lodged long 5 days after the alleged occurence and this long delay in lodging the F.I.R. has reasonabley made the prosecution case doubtfull. The learned Advocates for the accused-appellants have made submissions to the effect that there are series of decisions where it was held that a belated F.I.R. always carrys the chance of fabrication and that the delay in lodging the FIR without explaining suffcient cause renders the prosecution case doubtfull.<br/><br/>It is true that the delay in lodging the FIR  raises suspicion about the truth of the prosecution case, but there may be various reasons for causing delay in lodging the F.I.R. Without considering the reasons of delay in lodging the F.I.R. the courts should not doubt the truth of the prosecution case only for the fact that there was delay in lodging the F.I.R. Mere delay in lodging the FIR should not be a ground for disbelieving the prosecution case if that delay occurred for any reasonable cause. Considering the facts and circumstances of a particular case the court is to decide whether the delay in lodging the F.I.R. is fatal and whether this delay in lodging the F.I.R. makes the prosecution case doubtfull.<br/><br/>In the present case the delay in lodging the F.I.R. has been explained in the very F.I.R. The facts and circumstances which have come out from the evidence of the prosecution witnesses also have explained the delay in lodging the FIR. It has been proved in this case that the husband and another near relative of the informant were murdered and 2 others of her near relatives were critically injured in the occurrence of this case and both those injureds were in hospital under treatment for a long time. The informant has stated also both in the F.I.R. and in evidence before court that after this occurrence she, being highly shocked, got senseless and was not in a position to lodge the F.I.R. It was also stated that her other near relatives also were abroad at that time. Considering all these facts and circumstances both the trial court and the High Court Division found that the delay of 5 days in lodging the F.I.R. was not  fatal to create any doubt about the truth of the prosecution case. Considering the facts and circumstances we also find that in this case the delay in lodging the F.I.R. cannot be a ground for disbelieving the truth of the prosecution case.<br/><br/>It has also been argued from the side of the accused-appellants that the F.I.R. which was lodged 5 days after the occurrence cannot be treated as FIR inasmuch as before lodging of the F.I.R. there was a G.D. entry about this occurrence in the concerned police station and in the circumstances that G.D. entry, being the first information about the occurrence, should be treated as FIR and the subsequent F.I.R. lodged by the informant should be treated as a statement under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It appears that the High Court Division has addressed this legal point also adequately and given the right decision. The High Court Division rightly pointed out that the G.D. entry which was lodged in the concerned thana about this occurrence was vague and indefinite and no offence was disclosed in the said G.D. entry and in the circumstances the said G.D. entry could not be treated as an F.I.R. There is no bar in filing a second F.I.R. if the first information about any occurrence given to the police station is vague and indefinite and does not disclose the actual offence committed in that occurence. In the present case the GDE which was made in the concerned police station at the time when the occurrence was still going on does not disclose the offences committed in that occurrence and hence the subsequent F.I.R. stating the offences committed in that occurrence in details is the actual F.I.R. and there is no legal bar in accepting this F.I.R. in the stated facts and circumstances.<br/><br/>The learned Advocates for the accused-appellants have argued also to the effect that in this case the prosecution witnesses were examined by the investigating police officer long several months after the occurrence and this long delay in examining the prosecution witnesses also makes the evidence of these  witnesses before court suspicious. But this argument also of the learned Advocates for the accused-appellants is not acceptable in the present facts and circumstances of the case. In this case the P.Ws.2 to 8 are all eye witnesses to the occurrence and two of them were critically injured in the said occurrence. All these P.Ws. have deposed before court narrating the occurrence in details. Some other police constables also have deposed corrobrating these public witnesses and all these prosecution witnesses have been cross-examined at length on behalf of the accused persons, but by cross-examining these witnesses at length their evidence could not be shaken or made unbelievable. In the circusmtances the delayed examination of these prosecution witnesses by the investigating police officer cannot be a reason for disbelieving these witnesses. In the present case it has also come before court that the investigating officer of this case was changed and several other cases also were started over the same occurrence and the police investigated those cases also. In the circumstances the delay committed by the investigating police officer in examining the witnesses of this case cannot be a reason for disbelieving the prosecution witnesses who have deposed before the court on oath in details and have faced the lengthy cross-examination by the learned Counsel of the accused persons. In the stated facts and circumstances we do not find that the delay in examining the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the investigating officer can be any reason for discarding their evidence before court.<br/><br/>It has also been argued from the side of the accused-appellants that many F.I.R. named and charge sheeted witnesses have not been examined in this case and this fact also makes the prosecution case weak. But we do not accpet this argument also of the learned Counsel for the accused-appellants. There is no law requiring examination of all the F.I.R. named and charge sheeted witnesses before court. Rather it is well established by judicial pronouncements that conviction of accused can safely be based on the evidence of one witness only if his evidence is full, complete and selfcontained and believable. The prosecution is not bound at all to examine all the witnesses mentioned in the F.I.R. or in the charge sheet. In the present case 7 eye witnesses namely, the P.Ws.2 to 8 have deposed before court supporting the prosecution case and if the evidence of these witnesses can be believed as true the non-examination of other FIR named or charge sheeted witnesses is not fatal at all.<br/><br/>The learned Advocates for the accused-appellants have made submissions to the effect also that in this case there are discripancies in between the F.I.R. and the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses before court and that these discrepancies between the FIR and the evidence of the prosecution witnesses makes the prosecution case unbelievable. But we are unable to accept this contention also of the learned Advocates for the accused-appellants. In this case the inforamnt, who lodged the F.I.R. was not the eye- witness to the occurence. Hearing from others she lodged the F.I.R. So it was very natural that in the F.I.R. all the details of the occurrence could not be stated properly and correctly. The evidence of P.Ws.2 to 8-the eye-witnesses to the occurrence are consistent. In the circumstances the discripancy between the F.I.R. story and the evidence of these eye witnesses cannot be any reason for disbelieving the eivdence of these eye-witnesses in this particular case.<br/><br/>The learned Advocates for the accused-appellants have made argument to the effect also that all the alleged eye-witnesses to the occurrence being interested, related and partisan, their evidence cannot be relied upon. It is true that the evidence of the interested and partisan witnesses must be scrutinized and considered cautiously before it is accepted. But the evidence of the interested and partisan witnesses should not be discarded for the reason only that they are partisan and interested witnesses if their credibility is not shaken by the defence. In the present case the P.Ws.2 to 8 though have been blamed to be interested and partisan witnesses by the defence but by cross-examining these witnesses at length the defence could not shake their varacity or make their evidence false or unbelievable. It is now settled by the decisions of the apex courts that the evidence of partisan witnesses need not always be discarded only for the reason of their relationship, when their evidence are found to be reliable that can be basis for convicting the accused. So the argument that the P.Ws.2 to 8 being interested witnesses their evidence cannot be relied on-is not acceptable.<br/><br/>The learned Advocates for the accused-appellants have made arguments to the effect also that there are contradictions and discrepancies among the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and these contradictory and discrepent evidence of the prosecution witnesses make these witnesses untrustworthy and make the prosectuion case also false.<br/><br/>But considering the facts and circums-tances of the present case we do not accept this argument also of the learned Advocates. In the present case the number of accused is more than hundred. Hundreds of people were present in the place of occurrence and wintessed this occurance. In the circumstances it was difficult to pinpoint specifically the role played by each and every accused. So it is most natural that there may occur some discrepencies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses as to the role played by the accused persons in this occurrence. While sifting the evidence of the prosecution witnesses the courts are to take into consideration the discrepencies also in their evidence, but for making some discrepent statements only their whole evidence should not be discarded and they also should not be treated as untrustworthy.<br/><br/>Now we shall sift the evidence of the prosecution witnesses narrated above.<br/><br/>From the evidence of the prosecution witnesses it appears that in this case there are sufficinet evidence to prove the active involvemnet of the accused-appellant Aiyub Ali in the murder of Monwar Ali, Badsha and Hashem. All the prosecution witnesse 2 to 8-the eye witnesses to the occurrence-have deposed before court to the effect that this accused Aiyub Ali ordered the other accused persons firstly to catch Monwar Ali and his other associates while they were going to Bagra Bazar along the road by the side of the house of accused Aiyub Ali and as per this order the other accused persons and also accused Aiyub Ali himself chased Monwar Ali and his associates and made them confined in the house of Seraj Bepari and kept them confined there for a long period and during that period some of the accused persons entered into that house by breaking open the door and murdered Hashem and subsequently, in the evening, after arrival of police, when Monwar Ali, Badsha, Anwar Ali and Salauddin came out of that house on the asking of police and were handcuffed by police and brought near the bamboo clump the accused Aiyub Ali gave order to other accused persons to kill them and he himself also dealt a ‘chapati’ blow on the back of head of Monwar Ali and then other accused persons started dealing blows on Monwar Ali and Badsha with different weapons. These evidence of the prosecution witnesses could not be shaken by cross-examining the witnesses at length. Some of the police witnesses also, who came to the place of occurrence, namely, P.Ws.9 and 10 have supported the prosecution case by deposing to the effect that Monwar Ali and his other associates were kept confined in the house of Siraj Bepari and subsequently when, on the asking of the police, Monwar Ali and his associates came out of that house the associates of accused Aiyub Ali snatched away them from police and killed them. These evidence of the police constables has strongly supported the prosecution case that accused Aiyub Ali was the gang leader and he ordered his other accomplices to kill Monwar Ali, Badsha and Hashem. From the side of the accused persons though question has been raised as to the credibility of P.Ws.2 to 8 but considering the facts and circumstances of the case we do not find the evidence of these witnesses unbelievable or false. Admittedly the occurrence of murder of Monwar Ali, Badsha and Hashem took place in broad daylight in presence of hundreds of people. However these eye-witnesses to the occurence, the P.Ws.2-8, have been cross-examined at length by the learned Advocates for the accused persons, but their veracity could not be shaken by the lengthy cross-examination. So, we do not accept the contention of the learned Advocates for the accused-appellants that these P.Ws.2-8 are not trustworthy for the reason only that they are interested and partisan witnesses. It has been contended from the side of the accused persons that deceased Monwar Ali and his associates, being armed with fire arms, went to the place of occurrence to commit any crime and at that time the agitated public confined them in the house of Seraj Bepari and ultimately those mob murdered them. But considering the evidence adduced before court we do not find this defence contention acceptable at all. It should be mentioned here that before us arguments have been made from the side of the accused persons to the effect that deceased Monwar Ali and others murdered Alauddin, the son of accused Ayesha and brother of accused Mizan, Nizam, Nazir and Badsha and at this the accused persons, being highly shocked and provocated, might have committed this occurence and in the circumstances this case does not come within the ambit of section 302 of the Penal Code, rather it comes within the ambit of section 304, part-II of the Penal code. This very defence argument, rather, supports the prosecution case that the accused Aiyub Ali and his other associates killed Monwar Ali, Badsha and Hashem. Even, if it is believed that deceased Monwar Ali and his associates went to the place of occurrence to commit some crime and they were miscreants, but that does not absolve the accused Aiyub Ali and his other associates from the charge of murder of Monwar Ali and his associates. The evidence adduced by the prosecution has proved sufficiently that accused Aiyub Ali along with his associates snathched away the deceased Monwar Ali and Badsha and victims Anwar Ali and Salauddin from the hands of police when they were handcuffed and accused Aiyub Ali then gave order to other accused persons to kill them and he (accused Aiyub Ali) himself dealt a ‘chapati’ blow on the vital part of body of deceased Monwar Ali. The execuse that deceased Monwar Ali and his associates were miscreants cannot be accepted as a ground for absolving the accused Aiyub Ali and other accused persons from the charge of murder. The brutal murder of 3 persons and also assaulting of two other persons mercilessly with the intention to kill them in braod daylight in presence of high officials of Administration and police cannot be taken leniently under any circumstances.<br/><br/>It was argued that some of the prosecution witnesses have deposed to the effect that accused Aiyub Ali had a gun in his hand and in the circumstances the evidence that accused Aiyub Ali dealt a ‘chapati’ blow on the back of head of Monwar Ali is not believable at all. But we do not accept this argument also. It cannot be accepted that a person who has a gun in one of his hands cannot hit any person with any other kind of arms. It might be that accused Aiyub Ali, at that very moment, took that ‘chapati’ from any other accused person and hit Monwar Ali with that ‘chapati’. Where there are sufficient evidence to prove that accused Aiyub Ali dealt a ‘chapati‘ blow on the back of head of Monwar Ali and where the postmortem examination report of the dead body of deceased Monwar Ali supports these evidence we cannot disbelieve these evidence only for the reason that some of the witnesses deposed that the accused Aiyub Ali was carrying a gun at the time of occurrence.<br/><br/>Though there is no specific evidence to prove that accused Aiyub Ali himself dealt any blow on deceased Badsha and Hashem, there are ample evidence to prove that accused Aiyub Ali along with other accused persons chased Monwar Ali and others and made them confined in a house and then murdered Hashem in that house and subsequently as per order of accused Aiyub Ali, the other accused persons murdered Badsha. So in the circumstances accused Aiyub Ali was rightly convicted and sentenced under sections 302/109 of the Penal code for killing Badsha and under sections 302/149 of the Penal Code for killing Hashem.<br/><br/>From the side of the accused-appellant Aiyub Ali arguments have been made to the effect also that in this case the evidence of the prosecution itself have proved that the accused persons, being highly shocked and provocated by the murder of Alauddin, committed this occurrence and in the circumstances this case will not come within the abmit of section 302 of the Penal code, rather it will come within the ambit of section 304 part-II of the Penal Code. But considering the evidence on record we are unable to accept this argument also. The evidence adduced in this case has proved sufficiently that accused Aiyub Ali along with his associates chased Monwar Ali and his associates while they were going along the road by the side of the house of accused Aiyub Ali and made them confined in the hosue of P.W.2 Srijon Bepari and during that period, at one stage, they entered into that house by breaking open the door and tried to drag out them and at that time Alauddin was murdered. So, in these facts, circumstances, the plea of accused-appellants that being highly shocked and provocated they killed Monwar Ali and others and as such these killings do not fall within the purview of sction 302 of the Penal code, rather these fall within the purview of section 304 part-II of the Penal Code-is not acceptable at all even if it is believed that Alauddin was killed by Monwar Ali and his associates.<br/><br/>Mr. Sarwar Ahmed-the learned Advocate for the condemned prisoner Aiyub Ali has made submissions to the effect also that this accused-appellant Aiyub Ali has been detaining in the condemned cell for long 10 years with mental agony of death and now this Division, for the ends of justice, may show some mercy to him and may commute his sentence of death to a sentence of life imprisonment. But considering the very offence of cruel murders of as many as 3 persons committed by this accused-appellant Aiyub Ali we do not think that he can be shown any mercy at all.<br/><br/>However, considering the facts, circumstances and evidence on record we find that both the trial court and the High Court Division rightly convicted this accused appelalnt Aiyub Ali under sections 302/1`09 of the Penal code for killing Monwar Ali and Badsha and under sections 302/149 of the Penal Code for killing Hashem. The High Court Division has upheld the sentence of death of accused Aiyub Ali awarded by the trial court for killing Monwar Ali only and awarded him 2 separate sentences of life imprisonment for killing Badsha and Hashem. We find no reason to interfere with the judgment and order of the High Court Division so far as it relates to the accused-appellant Aiyub Ali.<br/><br/>Accused Md. Mahfuzur Rahman @ Mahfuz son of Aiyub Ali has been convicted for killing Monwar Ali and Badsha and has been awarded 2 separate sentences of life imprisonmnet with fine for each of the killings with a direction that both the sentences will run concurrently. From the above narrated evidence of the proseuction witnesses it appears that all the P.Ws.2 to 8-the eye witnesses to the occurrence-have deposed stating the active involvement of this accused-appelalnt Md. Mahfuzur Rahman @ Mahfuz son of Aiyub Ali in the murder of Monwar Ali and Badsha. These evience prove that this accused-appelant Mahfuz son of Aiyub Ali was carrying a chinese axe during the whole occurrence and while Monwar Ali, Badsha and others  were brought out of the house of Srijon Bepari by police and were handcuffed this accused Mahfuz son of Aiyub Ali also along with other accused persons started assulting them.<br/><br/>The P.W.3 Salauddin, an injured witness, has deposed specifically that this accused-appelalnt Mahfuz dealt chinese axe blows to Monwar Ali. The P.W.4 Md. Anwar Ali-another injured witness also has specifically deposed that this accused-appelalnt Mahfuz dealt chinese axe blows to deceased Monwar Ali. This witness deposed to the effect also that the accused persons who assulted Monwar Ali dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on Badsha also. The P.W.5 Saifur Rahman Pintoo-another eye-witness to the occurrence also has specifically deposed to the effect that accused-appellant Mahfuz had chinese axe in his hand and he dealt chinese axe blows to both Monwar Ali and Badsha. The P.W.6 Md. Shahabuddin Khan, the Headmaster of Bagra Swarup Chandra Pilot High School, also has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mahfuz kept dealing chinese axe blows to Monwar Ali. The P.W.7 Abul Kalam Azad-another eye witness to the occurrence also has deposed to the effect tha this accused Mahfuz dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on deceased Monwar Ali and also on Badsha, Anwar Ali and Salauddin. The P.W.8 Md. Shahin, another eye-witness also has deposed to the effect that this accused appelalnt Mahfuz kept dealing chinese axe blows on Monwar Ali. Considering these evidence of the prosecition witnesses we find that the trial court and the High Court Division rightly found this accused appellant Mahfuz son of Aiyub Ali guilty of killing of Monwar Ali and Badsha and therefore rightly convicted him under section 302 of the Penal Code. The High Court Division, however, has commuted the sentence of death awarded by the trial court to this accused-appelalnt Mahfuz to imprisonment for life as already mentioned above. We find no reason to intefere with the findings and decision of the High Court Division as regrds this accused-appellant Mahfuz son of Aiyub Ali also.<br/><br/>In the cicumstances the Criminal Appeal No.26 of 20012 filed by the condemned prisoner Md. Aiyub Ali chairman and his son accused-appellant Md. Mahfuzur Rahman @ Mahfuz is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>Accused Faruq Gazi was awarded death sentence by the trial court for killing Monwar Ali, Hashem and Badsha. The High Court Division has commuted the death sentence of this accused-appellant Faruq Gazi to imprisonment for life for killing Monwar Ali and Badsha but upheld his death sentence awarded for killing Hashem. It has been pointed out before us that though according to the prosecution witnesses this accused-appellant Faruq Gazi killed Hashem by firing a gun shot but the postmortem examination report of Hashem does not show at all that there was any bullet injury on the dead body of Hashem. The learned Advocate for the accused-appellant Faruq Gazi has contended that the postmortem examination report of deceased Hashem makes the allegation of killing Hashem against this accused-appelant Faruq Gazi false. The learned Depty Attorney General has made submissions to the effect that, in fact, the postmortem examination report, which bears the name of deceased Hashem, actually was not of the dead body of Hashem but the other postmortem examination report of an “unknown person” was actually of Hashem and this postmortem examination report shows that there were bullet injuries on that dead body. But this argument of the learned Deputy Attorney General cannot be accepted at this stage. There is no cogent evidence or materials before us to prove that the postmortem examination report which bears the name of Hashem actually was not of Hashem, rather the postmortem examination report  of an “unknown person” actually was of Hashem. There is no evidence before us to the effect that an unknown person also was killed in that occurrence by assaulting with weapons other than fire arms. One Ismail Gazi was killed in that occurrence, but admittedly he was killed by gun shot. So, we cannot accept the contention of the prosecution that the postmortem examination report of Hashem was not actually of Hashem, but that was of an unknown person. In the circumstances we accept the defence contention that the postmortem examination report of the dead body of Hashem does not suppoprt the prosecution case that this accused appellant Faruq Gazi murdered Hashem by gun shot. However, this accused-appellant Faruq Gazi has been found guilty for killing of Monwar Ali and Badsha also and it appers that there are sufficient evidence on record to prove that this accused-appelalnt Faruq Gazi took active part in killing Monwar Ali and Badsha. The P.W.3 and P.W.4-the two injured witnesses have deposed to the effect that on the order of accused Aiyub Ali this accused- appellant Faruq Gazi along with others dealt sharp cutting weapon blows to both Monwar Ali and Badsha. The other eye witnesses also have deposed to the effect that the other accused persons assulted Monwar Ali and Badsha with sharp cutting weapons. Considering the postmortem examination report of deceased Hashem we though do not find this accused- appellant Faruq Gazi guilty of the offence of commtting murder of Hashem but considering the other evidence stated above we find that both the trial court and the High Court Division rightly found this accused-appellant Faruq Gazi guilty of the offence of committing murder of Monwar Ali and Badsha. We, therefore, affirm the conviction and sentences of life imprisonment of this accused-appellant Faruq Gazi for committing murder of Monwar Ali and Badsha.<br/><br/>Criminal Appeal No.27 of 2012 filed by the accused-appellant Faqur Gaiz, therefore, deserves to be allowed in part.<br/>Accused-appellant Hashem has been convicted under sections 302/109 of the Penal Code and sentenced to imprisonment for life for killing Monwar Ali. This accused-appellant has been further convicted under sections 307/109 of the Penal Code and sentenced to rigorous imprisonmnet for 7 years for making attempt to commit murder of Anwar Ali and Salauddin. There is a direction that both the sentences will run concurrently.<br/><br/>From the above narrated evidence of the prosecution witnesses it appears that there are sufficient evidence to prove both the charges against this accused-appellant Hashem. The P.W.2-Alhaj Sirajuddin Bepari @ Srijan Bepari has deposed to the efect that this accused-appellant Hashem along with other accused persons entered into his house by breaking door and tried to drage out Badsha. This witness has deposed further that this accused-appellant Hashem had a big ‘chhan’ in his hand and he dealt blows on the chest of Monwar Ali. The P.W.3-Md. Salauddin, one of the injured witnesses, has deposed to the effect that this accused Hashem along with other accused persons chased them and when they took shelter in the hosue of Srijan Bepari this accused Hashem along with others entered into that hosue by breaking door and tried to drage out Badsha. This P.W.3 futher deposed that this accused Hashem delat ‘chhan’ blows on deceased Monwar Ali. This P.W.3 has deposed also to the effect that that the accused persons who assaulted Monwar Ali assaulted him also with sharp cutting weapons and stick. The P.W.4 Anwar Ali, another injured witness, also has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Hashem along with others chased them and while they took shelter in the house of Srijan Bepari this accused-appellant Hashem along with some others entered into that house by breaking door and tried to drage out Badsha. The P.W.4 has stated also that this accused-appellant Hashem dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali. This witness stated further that the accused persons who assaulted Monwar Ali dealt blows on Salauddin and on him also. The P.W.5, another eye witness of the occurrence, also has deposed that this accused-appellant Hashem dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali.<br/><br/>Considering the above stated evidence adduced by the prosecution we find that both the trial court and the High Court Division rightly found this accused-appellant Hashem guilty under section 302 of the Penal Code and rightly convicted and sentenced him to imprisonment for life for killing Monwar Ali and also rightly convicted him furhter under section 307 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to 7 years rigorous imprisonemnt for making attempt to commit murder of Anwar Ali and Salauddin. We find no reason to intefere with these findins and decision of the courts below.<br/><br/>The Criminal Appeal No.31 of 2012 filed by this accused-appellant Hashem is, therefore, liable to be dismissed.<br/>Accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader has been convicted under sections 302/109 of the Penal Code  for killing Monwar Ali and Badsha and has been awarded two separate sentences of life imprisonmnet for both the killings and has been further convicted under sections 307/109 of the Penal Code and sentenced to rigorous imprisonmnet for 7 years for making attempt to commit murder of Anwar Ali and Salauddin. There is a direction that all the 3 sentences will run concurrently.<br/><br/>On scrutiny of the above narrated evidence it appears that all the 7 eye witnesses to the occurrence, namely, the P.W.2 to P.W.8 have deposed stating the active involvement of the accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader in the alleged occurrence. The P.W.2 has deposed that at the time of occurrence this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader had a big ‘dao’ in his hand. The P.W.3 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader along with other accused persons chased them. The P.W.4 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali. The P.W.5 also has deposed that this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali and Badsha. The P.W.6 has deposed that this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader dealt indiscriminate blows on Monwar Ali, Badsha and Salauddin. The P.W.7 also has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on Monwar Ali, Badsha and also Anwar Ali and Salauddin. The P.W.8 has deposed that this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali.<br/><br/>Considering the above stated evidence adduced by the prosecution witnesses we find that the trial court and the High Court Division rightly convicted and sentenced this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader for killing Monwar Ali and Badsha and also for making attempt to commit murder of Anwar Ali and Salauddin.<br/><br/>The Criminal Appeal No.25 of 2012 filed by this accused-appellant Shafiul Azam Dafader is, therefore, liable to be dismissed.   <br/>Accused-appellant Showkat Ali has been convicted under sections 302/109 of the Penal Code for killing Monwar Ali.<br/>This accused-appellant Showkat Ali has not been named in the FIR.<br/>The P.W.2-Alhaj Sirajuddin Bepari @ Srijan Bepari-an eye witness to the occurrence also did not name this accused-appellant Showkat Ali.<br/>The P.W.3 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Showkat Ali dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on Monwar Ali.<br/>The P.W.4 has deposed only that this accused-appellant Showkat Ali along with other accused persons chased them while they were going by the side of the house of accused Aiyub Ali.<br/>The P.Ws.5, 6 and 8 have deposed only to the effect that this this accused-appellant Showkat Ali along with other accused persons set the house of Srijan Bepari on fire.<br/>The P.W.7 did not say anything implicating this accused-appellant Showkat Ali in the alleged occurence.<br/>So it appears that save and except P.W.3 only none of the other prosecution witnesses has stated anything in support of the charge of murder of Monwar Ali brought against this accused-appellant Showkat Ali. It has already been pointed out above that in the FIR also this accused-appellant Showkat Ali has not been named.<br/>Considering the evidence on record we find that the High Court Division was not justified at all in maintaining the conviction and sentence of this accused-appellant Showkat Ali. In view of the evidence on record our considered opinion is that this accused-appellant Showkat Ali is entilted to get benefit of boubt and, therefore, to be acquitted of the charge under sections 302/109 of the Penal Code.<br/>The Criminal Appeal No.30 of 2012 filed by this accused-appellant Showkat Ali Mollah, therefore, deserves to be allowed.   <br/>Accused-appellant Mannan Shah has been awarded 3 separate sentences of life imprisonment for killing Monwar Ali, Hashem and Badsha with a direction that all the 3 sentences will run concurrently.<br/><br/>We have scrutinized the evidence adduced by the prosecution as regards this accused-appellant Mannan Shah. It appears that the P.W.2 has deposed only to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah fired with a cut rifle from out side of his house while the deceased and others took shelter in that house. The P.W.3 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah along with other accused persons chased them and while they took shelter in the house of Srijan Bepari this accused-appellant Mannan Shah fired with a gun through the window of that hosue. This P.W.3 has deposed fruther that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah jumped on Monwar Ali and Badsha. The P.W.4 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah chased them and fired with a cut rifle. This witness has deposed also that this accused-appellant Mannan Shaha dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali and jumped upon Badsha and dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on him. The P.W.5 has deposed to the effect only that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah opened fire through the window of the hosue of Srijan Bepari while the deceaseds took shelter in that house. The P.Ws.6 and 7 also have deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah fired through the window of the house of Srijan Bepari while the deceased and others took shelter there. The P.W.8 did not name this accused-appellant Mannan Shah.<br/><br/>So it appears that out of 7 eye witnesses the P.Ws.3 and 4 only have deposed in support of the charges brought against this accused-appellant Mannan Shah. The P.W.3 has deposed that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah jumped on Anwar Ali and Badsha and P.W.4 has deposed that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali and jumped upon Badsha and dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on him. The P.W.3 did not say that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali. Other P.Ws. though have deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah fired through the window of the house of Srijan Bepari, but none of the witnesses has stated anything to the effect that the shot fired by the accused-appellant Mannan Shah hit anybody. It has been pointed out above that the postmortem examination report of the dead body of deceased Hashem does not show that there was any bullet injury on that dead body. So it appears that there is practically no evidence to prove that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah had any involvement in the murder of Hashem. As regards the charge of killing Mownar Ali brought against this accused-appellant Mannan Shah the only evidence is of P.W.4-who deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah dealt ‘chhan’ blows on Monwar Ali. But none of the other prosecution witnesses, even the P.W.3 also  deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah took part in the murder of Monwar Ali by dealing ‘chhan’ blows on him. In the circumstances our considered opinion is that the charge of killing Monwar Ali brought against this accused-appellant Mannan Shah also has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubet and in the circumstances this accused-appellant Mannan Shah is entilted to get benefit of boubt and be acquitted from this charge also.<br/><br/>As regards the charge of killing Badsha brought against this accused-appellant Mannan Shah it appears that out of 7 eye witnesses the P.W.3 has deposed only to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah jumped on Anwar Ali and Badsha. This witness did not say that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah dealt any blow with any weapon on deceased Badsha. The P.W.4 only has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on Badsha. Out of 7 eye witnesses of the occurrence the P.W.4 only has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on Badsha. The other eye witnesses of the occurrence did not corroborate the evidnece of the P.W.4 that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah dealt sharp cutting weapon blows on Badsha. Considering the evidence of P.Ws.2 to 8 we find that the proseuction could not prove the charge of killing Badsha also against this accused-appellant Mannan Shah beyond all reasonable doubt.<br/><br/>In the circumstances we find that this accused-appellant Mannan Shah is entilted to be acquitted from all the 3 charges of killing of Monwar Ali, Hashem and Badsha.<br/>The Criminal Appeal No.32 of 2012 filed by this accused-appellant Mannan Shah, therefore, deserves to be allowed.   <br/>Accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam has been convicted for killing Hashem and Badsha and has been awarded 2 separate sentences of life imprisonment for both the killings with a direction that both the sentences will run concurrently.<br/><br/>From the baove narrated evidence of the prosecution witnesses it appears that as regards this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam-the P.W.2 has deposed only to the effect that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam fired with a gun from out side targating his house while the deceaseds and others took shelter in that house. The P.W.3 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam chased them and opened fire with rifle through the witndow of the house where they took shelter. The P.W.4 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam along with others chased them and also fired with a gun through the window of the house where they took shelter and that gun shot hit Badsha. The P.W.5 has deposed to the effect only that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam opened fire through the window of the hosue where the deceaseds took shetler. The P.W.6 has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam along with other accused persons chased the victims and surrounded the house of Srijan Bepari where the victims took shelter and opened fire with a gun from out side of that house. This P.W.6 deposed also that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam assaulted Badsha and Salauddin also. The P.W.7 deposed to the effect only that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam opened fire through the window of the house where the victims took shelter. The P.W.8 did not utter the name of this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam.<br/><br/>So, it apperars that the P.W.4 only has deposed to the effect that the gun shot fired by this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam hit Badsha. But the postmortem examination report of the dead body of deceased Badsha does not show that there was any bullet injury on that dead body. The P.W.6 only though has deposed to the effect that this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam assaulted Badsha but no other prosecution witnesses have corrobo-rrated this statement of P.W.6. In view of the above stated evidence adduced by the prosecution our considered opinion is that none of the charges of killing Hashem and Badsha brought against this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt and as such this accused-appellant A. Salam @ Ketu Salam is entilted to get benefit of doubt and, therefore, to be acquitted of both charges.<br/>The Criminal Appeal No.35 of 2012 filed by this accused-appellant A.
