For the Respondents.<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></div> <div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Syed Md. Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong><br/>This Rule Nisi was issued on an application under Article 102 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the certification of higher CRF value ignoring the invoice value of the imported consignment of the petitioner by the Pre-Shipment Inspection Agency in the CRF certificate No. CN-06009939 dated 07.04.2006 (Annexure-B)  without complying with the provisions of Rule 13(2) and 13(3) of the Pre-Shipment inspection Rules 2002 should not be declared to have been made without lawful authority and is of  no legal effect and why they should not directed to assess and release the petitioner’s goods on the basis of the invoice value or the value as contemplated by Section 25 of Customs Act, 1969 read with  <strong>শুল্ক মূল্যায়ন</strong> (<strong>আমদানীকৃত পণ্যের মূল্য নির্ধারণ</strong>) <strong>বিধিমালা-২০০০</strong> and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court seem fit and proper.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">At the time of issuance of Rule, this Court passed an ad-interim order to the following effect:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>Pending disposal of the Rule, the respondents are directed to release the imported goods of the petitioner covered under Letter of Credit No. 087606010031 dated 25.01.2006 corresponding to Bill of Entry No. C-7534 dated 23.04.2006 on payment of customs duty, tax and other charges, to be assessed on the basis of the invoice value, in cash; and on furnishing Bank Guarantee covering the 50% of the amount of duty, tax and other charges to be assessed on the basis of the difference between CRF certificate value and invoice value and on deposit of the balance 50% of such amount of duty, tax and other charges, in cash within 3 (three) days from the date of receipt of certified copy of order of the Court.</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The material facts leading to this Rule are that the petitioner in course of business opened a Letter of Credit being No. 087606010031 dated 25.01.2006 and imported Exhaustive Fan and Electric Motor with gear Capacitor from China (here in-after “the goods”). Before shipment, the goods were inspected by the Government appointed Pre-shipment Inspection Agent (PSI Agent) namely M/S. Cotecna Inspection (Respondent No. 4) and after inspection the said PSI Agent issued Certificate of Clean Report of Findings (CRF) being No. CN-06009939 dated 07.04.2006 certifying the quality, quantity, price and customs classification of the goods but the PSI Agent which issued the CRF certificate enhanced the value of the imported goods at USD 19335.07 ignoring the transaction value of the imported goods at USD 19199.54 reflected in the Commercial Invoice of the goods. The petitioner also received Commercial Invoice, packing list and bill of lading from the respective persons in due course. After arrival of the imported goods, the petitioner through his Clearing and Forwarding Agent submitted Bill of Entry being No. C-7534 dated 23.04.2006 for release of the imported goods from Customs House, Chittagong but the customs Authority has not taken any action for releasing the goods as per transaction value reflected in the commercial invoice of the goods.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Feeling aggrieved the petitioner preferred the instant writ petition and obtained the present Rule.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner seeks to impeach the impugned action of the respondents on five fold arguments –</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>         <u>Firstly</u>:</strong><br/>         As per Rules 13(2) of the PSI Rules, 2002 in case of en-chancing of value the P.S.I. Agent shall give an opportunity to the exporter to support the invoice value, but in the present case the respondent No. 4 PSI Agent most illegally enhanced the value of the goods by ignoring the invoice value and without affording any opportunity to the exporter to present his case in support of invoice value.<br/><strong><u>Secondly</u></strong><strong>:</strong><br/>As per Rule 13(3) of the PSI Rule 2002, before determination of the value, information is to be taken from the exporter relating to value of the goods in prescribed from and same is to be attached with the CRF Certificate but in the present case no such step have been taken by the PSI Agent and as such the CRF Certificate can not be legally accepted as per law.<br/><strong><u>Thirdly </u></strong><br/>The CRF Certificate issued by the PSI Agent is contrary to the Valuation Rules, 2000 and PSI Agent without making any comment regarding the invoice price have illegally certified the goods at a higher value without any basis and as such its decision is liable to be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/><strong><u>Fourthly </u></strong><br/>The Customs Authority was under legal obligation to assess the imported goods on the basis of transaction Value of the said goods under section 25 of the Customs, 1969 read with <strong>শুল্ক মূল্যায়ন (আমদানীকৃত পণ্যের মূল্য নির্ধারণ) বিধিমালা-২০০০.</strong><br/><strong><u>Fifth and lastly:</u></strong><br/>The assessment of the petitioner’s imported goods on the basis of CRF issued by the PSI Agent in violation of Pre-shipment Rules, 2002 have been made without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the respondents opposes the Rule and submits that the instant writ petition against issuance of CRF certificate itself is not maintainable inasmuchas the petitioner without approaching to the custom authority pursuant to the provision of section 193C of the Customs Act directly preferred the writ petition before this court. He, however submits that the petitioner has the ample opportunity to prefer appeal to the concern authority for determining the value after proper inspection.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the records and given our anxious consideration to their submissions.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On going to the materials on record it transpires that the petitioner challenged the CRF certificate issued by the PSI agent. It is the definite case of the petitioner that the petitioner opened the letter of credit dated 25-01-2006 for import of 5749 pieces of Exhaustive Fan and Electric Motor with gear Capacitor having its value at USD 19199.54, but PSI agent (respondent no. 4) issued a certificate dated 07.04.2006 showing the value of the goods at USD 19335.07.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">At the very outset we are inclined to resolve the question of maintainability of the writ petition.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The CRF certificate issued by the PSI agent who is not an authority performing function with the affairs of the Republic. Moreso, on receipt of CRF certificate the petitioner did not approach to the concern authority of the customs challenging the CRF certificate. Therefore the petitioner is not entitled to file the writ petition before this court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of <em>Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Internal Resources Division and others. Vs. Sherajul Islam, 20 BLC(AD) -64 </em>held:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>Customs Act (IV of 1969)</strong><br/><strong>Section 193</strong><br/><em>Classification of imported goods and assessment thereon by the Customs Authority are disputed questions of fact which could not be resolved in the writ jurisdiction. The High Court Division exercised writ jurisdiction without considering this aspect of the case at all and on this score alone the writ petition was not maintainable.</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">So we are of the view that the writ petition is not maintainable. It is further appears to us that the imported goods has already been released in favour of petitioner. Therefore the ends of justice will best be served if we direct the respondents for final assessment of the imported goods.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In view of forgoing narrative the Rule is discharged with the following terms.</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">The petitioner is at liberty to approach before the Review committee as prescribed in section 193C of the Customs Act, 1969 for determining the appropriate value of his imported goods, within 1(one) month from the date of receipt of this order and shall be dealt with as per its decision.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Bank guarantee as furnished by the petitioner shall remain in force till decision of the Review Committee.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Respondents will not be entitled to encash Bank guarantee till decision of the Review Committee.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         The office is directed to communicate the order at once.<br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

For Opposite Party No.1</em></strong><div style="text-align: center;"><br/><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong><u>Borhanuddin, J:</u></strong><br/>This rule has been issued calling upon the opposite party nos. 1-10 to show cause as to why the judgment and decree dated 14.07.2015 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Meherpur, in Title Appeal No. 68 of 2014 and 71 of 2014 heard analogously, affirming the judgment and decree dated 22.10.2014 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Meherpur, in Title Suit No.375 of 2013 decreeing the suit, should not be set aside and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this court may seem fit and proper.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Facts relevant for disposal of the rule are that opposite party no.1 herein as plaintiff instituted Civil Suit No. 375 of 2013 in the Court of learned Senior Assistant Judge, Meherpur, for declaration that decision of the technical evaluation committee dated 05.09.2013 declaring the defendant no.10 as substantially responsive bidder is illegal, collusive, fraudulent, liable to be set aside and memo dated 09.10.2013 issued by the defendant no.4 Pursuant to the aforesaid decision directing defendant no.1 to take necessary step to implement construction of girder bridge is also illegal, void, arbitrary and further declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to get work order as responsive bidder contending interalia that the plaintiff is a 1st Class contractor having experience in the field of constructing girder bridge and has been continuing his business with reputation since long; Defendant No.1 invited tender for construction of 175.15 meter RCC girder bridge on the river Bhairab through advertisement published in the national dailies; Plaintiff and defendant no.10 purchased tender schedule and both of them dropped tender within prescribed time. In the tender schedule it is specifically mentioned that:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“The eligibility of criteria of the tenderer shall be:  </em><br/><em>General experience at least 3 (three) years.</em><br/><em>II) Similar contract experience as a single contract tk.500.00 lac in last 5(five) years.</em><br/><em>Required average annual construction turnover shall be greater than tk.1200.00 lac over the last 5(five) years.</em><br/><em>Minimum liquid asset 170.00 lac.” </em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Plaintiff submitted requisite papers/ documents as per condition but defendant no.10 though submitted 5 years experience certificate but failed to produce payment certificate alongwith experience certificate as per condition of the tender schedule; Inspite of that technical evaluation committee without proper scrutiny of the documents submitted by the bidders most illegally declared the defendant no.10 as substantially responsive bidder in the meeting of the committee held on 05.09.2013; Being informed of the decision, plaintiff vide letter dated 10.06.2013 requested the defendant no.1 to take appropriate step after proper scrutiny of the submitted documents by the bidders regarding qualification; Copy of the letter also sent to the chairman of tender evaluation committee and project director; Defendants did not respond rather pursuant to the decision of technical evaluation committee, defendant no.4 vide memo dated 09.10.2013 directed the defendant no.1 to take necessary step to implement construction of the bridge in violation of the condition of tender schedule; Plaintiff again sent a letter to the defendant no.3 on 10.09.2013 requesting him to re-examine the documents filed by the bidders and issue work order in favour of the bidder who submitted documents fulfilling conditions of the tender schedule, otherwise plaintiff will take shelter of the Court of law; Copy of the letter sent to the defendant nos. 1 and 2 but the defendants did not pay heed; Being compelled, plaintiff served legal notice upon defendant nos. 1 and 4 narrating the facts and demanding justice but the defendants did not respond; Hence, the suit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Opposite party nos. 2-9 herein as defendant nos. 1-9 contested the suit by filing a joint written statement denying material allegations made in the plaint and contending interalia that the allegation of non submission of payment certificate by the defendant no.10 alongwith work certificate is not correct; Amongst the two bidders, defendant no.10 is the lowest bidder as such technical evaluation committee rightly declared defendant no.10 as substantially responsive bidder; Plaintiff filed the suit in violation of mandatory provision of rule 57 of the Public Procurement Regulations, 2008 i.e. provision for filing complaint before the administrative authority; Technical evaluation committee properly scrutinized documents submitted by the bidders and also considered application of the plaintiff dated 10.06.2013 and lawfully evaluated the bid; Suit is liable to be dismissed.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Petitioner herein impleaded as defendant no.1 did not contest the suit.    </li><li style="text-align: justify;">After hearing the parties and assessing evidence on record, learned Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Meherpur, decreed the suit declaring decision dated 05.09.2013 by the tender evaluation committee and memo dated 09.10.2013 issued by the defendant no.4 to the defendant no.1 as illegal, inoperative and directed the defendants to issue work order in favour of the plaintiff treating him as responsive bidder vide judgment and decree dated 22.10.2014.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Being aggrieved, defendant nos. 1-9 as appellants filed Civil Appeal No.71 of 2014 in the Court of learned District Judge, Meherpur. Defendant no.10 who did not contest the suit also filed Civil Appeal No.68 of 2014 against the judgment and decree passed by the trial court. Both the appeals were heard analogously by the learned Additional District Judge, Meherpur, who after hearing the parties and reassessing evidence on record dismissed both the appeals by a single judgment dated 14.07.2015.  </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Having aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree, defendant no. 10 -appellant as petitioner preferred this revisional application under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the present rule alongwith an order of stay.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Shafique Ahmed with Mr. Mahbub Shafique, learned advocates appearing for the petitioner at the very outset submits that the suit is not maintainable inasmuch as Public Procurement Act, 2006 provides forum for aggrieved bidder under section 29 and 30 of the Act and also under rules 56-60 of the Public Procurement Regulations, 2008 as such there is implied bar in taking cognizance of the civil suit but the court below without considering this legal aspect passed the impugned judgment and decree and thus committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. He also submits that the court below committed an illegality in not holding that technical evaluation committee rightly found the defendant-petitioner as responsive bidder as his bid was lowest and the bid of plaintiff-opposite party was higher at taka 31,07,391.28 as such impugned judgment and decree is liable to be set aside. He next submits that the court below committed an illegality in not considering that the concern authority is authorized to give work order to the lowest responsive bidder but the court below passed the impugned judgment and decree going beyond its jurisdiction as such the judgment and decree is liable to be set aside. In support of his submissions, learned advocate referred to the case of Dhulabhai -Vs- State of Madhya Pradesh and another, reported in AIR1969 Supreme Court 78 and an unreported judgment dated 04.03.2012 passed by this Division in Writ Petition no.10380 of 2011 with Writ Petition no.742 of 2012.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Mr. B. M. Elias learned advocate appearing for the opposite party no.1 by filing a counter affidavit submits that section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure empowers civil courts to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred as such Court below rightly passed the impugned judgment and decree holding that rules 56-60 of the public procurement regulation does not constitute any bar to try the suit in civil court. He also submits that jurisdiction of the civil court to try all disputes of civil nature affecting rights of the contending parties under section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure cannot be taken away lightly but it can be so read only when it is specifically barred under any law as such court below committed no illegality in passing the impugned judgment and decree. He next submits that there is no provision in the Public Procurement Act ousting jurisdiction of the civil court as such court below rightly and legally passed the impugned judgment and decree. By referring Provision of the Public Procurement Act, learned advocate submits that only being the criteria of lowest bidder is not sufficient to get work order and there is no provision in the Public Procurement Act or Regulation for treating someone substantially responsive if he becomes non-responsive as per law. He again submits that the petitioner has not complied with condition III of the tender schedule fully who has only 87% of the required annual turnover and he also violated condition relating to the similar contract experience as such court below after thorough and meticulous discussions of evidence on record passed the impugned judgment and decree which need not require interference by this revisional court.  He further submits that the opposite party no.1 submitted his complaint to the concern authority as per rule 57 of the Public Procurement Rule, firstly, on 10.06.2013 before issuing work order seeking inquiry regarding qualification of the petitioner but the authority has not disposed of the said complaint and thereafter he further submitted complain and objection against treating the petitioner as responsive bidder on 10.09.2013 just day after the issuance of work order which was also not disposed of, thereafter the opposite party send legal notice on 25.09.2013 but the defendant-opposite parties did not respond as such it is clear that the authority concern acted in gross violation of law for which the opposite party could not sought subsequent administrative remedy, considering all the aspect court below legally and rightly passed the impugned judgment and decree. In support of his submissions, learned advocate referred to the case of Ranjeet Singh-Vs- Harji alias Hazari and others, reported in AIR 1991 Madhya Pradesh 169 and the case of M/S. Paresh Engineering Works Pvt. Ltd.-Vs- State of MP and another, reported in AIR 1992 Madhya Pradesh 61.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Heard the learned advocates. Perused the revisional application and annexures appended thereof, judgment and decree passed by the courts below, lower court records alongwith decisions cited by the learned advocates.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On perusal of the record it appears that the opposite party no.1 herein as plaintiff instituted Civil Suit No.375 of 2013 for declaration impleading the petitioner herein as defendant no.10 alongwith other defendants. Defendant nos. 1-9 contested the suit by filing written statement but did not adduce any evidence in favour of their contention though they cross examined the PWs. I have perused written statement filed by the defendant nos.1-9 which contains denial of the averments made in the plaint. Defendant no.10 though did not contest the suit but filed Civil Appeal No.68 of 2014 as appellant contending interalia that no summons/notices were issued upon him but the appellate court below after perusing record of the case arrived at a finding that since the defendant no.10 was not available in his house, summons were served in accordance with the provision of law by affixing copy of the summon at the door of his house. Apart from that summons also issued by post in his address.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">There is no doubt that conduct of the defendants is highly deplorable but question remains jurisdiction of the court below in entertaining the suit. Learned advocate for the petitioner at the very outset raised the question of maintainability of the suit. According to him, jurisdiction of the civil court is impliedly barred in view of the provision of sections 29 and 30 of the Public Procurement Act as well as Rules 56-60 of the Public Procurement Regulation.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Section 29 of the Act provides right to complain by the aggrieved person and section 30 of the Act provides lodging complaint to the administrative authority, appeal etc. Again, rule 56 of the Public Procurement Regulation outline circumstances under which a formal complaint can be lodged against a procuring entity and rule 57 provides procedure for submission complaints to the administrative authority and disposal of appeal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Rule 58 deals with formation of review panels by the central procurement technical unit comprising of specialists mentioned in sub rule (2) for the purpose of review, appeal and giving decisions.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Rule 59 clearly stipulated that authority will suspend issuance of notification of award until resolution of appeal and rule 60 narrates procedure for disposal of appeal by the review committee.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Schedule II of the public procurement regulation specifically mentioned time for disposal of the complaints filed under Section 57 of the regulation. It is apparent from schedule II that completion of whole procedure may take 27-31 days for disposal of the complaint under rule 57 of the Public Procurement Regulation. There is also time limit for disposal of complaints by review panel in writing which is 12 working days from the date of receipt of the complaint.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure lays down that civil courts shall have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. One general rule of law is that when a legal right and an infringement thereof are alleged, a cause of action is disclosed and unless there is a bar to the entertainment of a suit, the ordinary civil courts are bound to entertain the claim. The right of a person to relief in a civil court is a common law right and so long as he can show a cause of action he can bring a suit for redress. But where a statute creates a new right or a new liability which has no existence apart from the statute creating it and the statute creates the right or liability at the same time prescribed a particular method of enforcing it, then the remedy provided by the statute must be followed and it is not competent to the party to pursue any other remedy. In the case of Bhaishankar Nanabhai –Vs- Municipal Corporation of Bombay and others, reported in the Indian law reports, VOL. XXXI, page 604, his lordship sir Lawrence jenkins C.J. observed that:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“It is an essential condition of those rights that they should be determined in the manner prescribed by the Act to which they owe their existence. In such a case there is no ouster of the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts, for they never had any; there is no change of the old order or things; a new order is brought into being.”  </em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Dhulabhai Vs- State of Madhya Pradesh and another, reported in AIR 1969 Supreme Court 78, his lordship Hidayatullah C.J. laid down some principles regarding exclusion of jurisdiction of a civil court, two of them are relevant in this case.	<ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li>Where the statute gives a finality to the orders of the special tribunals the civil courts’ jurisdiction must be held to be excluded if there is adequate remedy to do what the civil court would normally do in a suit. Such provision, however, does not exclude those cases where the provisions of the particular Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure.</li><li>Where there is an express bar of the jurisdiction of the court, an examination of the scheme of the particular Act to find the adequacy or the sufficiency of the remedies provided may be relevant but is not decisive to sustain the jurisdiction of the civil court. Where there is no express exclusion the examination of the remedies and the scheme of the particular Act to find out the intendment becomes necessary and the result of the inquiry may be decisive. In the latter case it is necessary to see if the statute creates a special right or a liability and provides for the determination of the right or liability and further lays down that all questions about the said right and liability shall be determined by the tribunals so constituted, and whether remedies normally associated with actions in civil courts are prescribed by the said statute or not.</li></ol></li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Jogesh Chandra Datta-Vs Govt. of Bangladesh, reported in 30 DLR (1978) 219, this Division respectfully agreed to the dictum laid down by Willes J in the case of Wolver hampton new water Works Co. –Vs- Hawkesford, reported in (1859) 141 E.R. 486, wherein the following principle is laid down:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“There are three classes of cases in which a liability may be established by statute. There is that class where there is a liability existing at common law, and which is only re-enacted by the statute with a special form of remedy; there, unless the statute contains words necessarily excluding the common law remedy, the plaintiff has his election of proceeding either under the statute or at common law. Then there is a second class, which consists of those cases in which a statute has created a liability, but has given no special remedy for it; there the party may adopt an action of debt or other remedy at common law to enforce it. The third class is where the statute creates a liability not existing at common law, and gives also a particular remedy for enforcing it”.</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">From the discussions above, prima facie it appears that where the same statute creates a new rights and specify the remedy, the remedy is exclusive. The natural presumption to begin with is that parliament in creating the novel right, attaches to it the particular mode of enforcement as part of its statutory scheme.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">As it is stated above that sections 29 and 30 of the public procurement act and rules 56-60 of the public procurement regulations creates a right to file complain by an aggrieved person and attaches to it the particular mode of enforcement within a specific period of time. In the premises above, I am of the view that the jurisdiction of civil courts is impliedly barred by the aforesaid provision of Public Procurement Act and Regulations. By now it is settled by our apex court that special remedy provided for in a statute may without any ouster provision bar the general remedy in the civil court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Since I am of the opinion that Civil Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit, it would be obviously improper for me to express any opinion on the merits of the questions discussed before this Court having revisional jurisdiction under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Under the facts and circumstances and for the reasons stated above, I am inclined to make the rule absolute without any order as to cost.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, the rule is made absolute without any order as to cost.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Judgment and decree dated 14.07.2015 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Meherpur, in Title Appeal No.68 of 2014 and 71 of 2014 heard analogously, affirming the judgment and decree dated 22.10.2014 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge in Title Suit no.375 of 2013 is set aside.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Order of stay granted at the time of issuance of the rule is hereby vacated.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Facts and circumstances of the cases referred by the learned advocate for the opposite party no.1 are quite distinguishable from the facts and circumstances of the case in hand.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Send down lower court records alongwith a copy of this judgment to the court concern at once.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed. </strong></div>                       </div></div>

For Opposite Party no.1</em></strong><br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></div> <div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Kashefa Hussain, J:</u></strong><br/>Rule was issued at the instance of the petitioner against order no.155 dated 13.01.2013 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, Additional Court, Dhaka in Miscellaneous Case No. 02 of 2011 arising out of Title Suit No. 07 of 1996 allowing the application of the defendant under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure and condoning the delay of 307 days in filing the application.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The facts relevant for disposal of the Rule in short are that the petitioner as plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 277 of 1995 which was transferred and subsequently re-numbered as Title Suit No. 07 of 1996. The suit was filed after complying with due procedure and upon hearing ultimately decreed vide judgment and decree dated  30.03.2010. Thereafter, on 08.02.2011 the defendants filed the Miscellaneous Case No. 02 of 2011 under order 9 rule 13 of Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the judgment and decree dated 30.03.2010 paying the prescribed mandatory deposit etc. Primarily  the defendant alleged that the judgment and decree dated 30.03.2010 was an ex-parte order and ought to be set-aside. The PW-1 and DW-1 deposed in the Miscellaneous Case which was allowed by order dated 13.01.2013 along with condonation of delay of 307 days and thus setting aside the judgment and decree dated 30.03.2010 passed by the Trial Court being aggrieved by the order passed in Miscellaneous Case no. 02 of 2011 allowing the application under order 9 rule 13 of Code of Civil Procedure the plaintiff as petitioner preferred this instant Revisional Application and is hence before us.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Md. Harun-Ar-Rashid Learned Advocate appeared for the petitioner while Mr. Moinuddin Learned Advocate appeared for the opposite party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Learned Advocate Mr. Md. Harun-Ar-Rashid on behalf of the petitioner submits that the Miscellaneous Case can be allowed but basically on 2 grounds that is for non service of summons and another ground being that order 9 rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not applicable in the instant case. Since the defendant executed Vokalatnama, written statement and also cross-examined the plaintiff. He further drew our attention to the operative portion of the judgment and decree dated 30.03.2010 and primarily tries to focus upon the word “<strong>দোতরফা সুত্রে শুনানী অন্তে ডিক্রি হইলচ</strong> in his argument he stresses on the point that it is ‘clear’ that the judgment dated 30.03.2010 was not an ex-parte order since the ordering portion itself reads “<strong>দোতরফা সুত্রে শুনানী অন্তে ডিক্রি হইল</strong>চ stating that the judgment was executed upon presence of both the plaintiff’s and defendant’s sides. He also submits that according to Article 164 of the limitation Act the miscellaneous case has to be filed within 30 days of knowledge of the decree when in case of non service of summons.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand learned Advocates Mr. Moinuddin on behalf of the defendant opposite party submits that judgment and order dated 30.03.2010 is actually an ex-parte order and defendants were not present on that particular day before the court and had no knowledge that judgment was going to be passed on that day. He persuades that the use of the term “<strong>দোতরফা সুত্রে</strong>চ is only an inadvertent error on the part of the Trial Court and which is evident from the order passed in Miscellaneous Case No. 02 of 2011 dated 13.01.2013 allowing the application along with condonation of delay of 307 days and also submits that the original Title Suit was filed in the year 1995 and the suit was dragged on for long 15 years mainly due to various delaying tactics resorted to by the plaintiff. He stresses upon the fact that it is evident from the records that the suit was dismissed several times and that it would be eventually restored repeatedly on various pleas of the plaintiff’s. He further persuades that lastly when it was taken up for hearing due to some unavoidable circumstances on the part of the learned Advocate for the defendant which was inadvertent and totally unintentional, the defendant otherwise diligent regarding  the case however could not be present in court on that day. He alleges that the defendant had  no knowledge of the judgment being passed on 30.03.2010 and which they ultimately learnt later, and finally on 24.01.2011 after receiving knowledge of the judgment filed the Miscellaneous Case No. 02 of 2011 on 08.02.2011, In this context he assails that he filed the case within 30 days of knowledge of the decree in accordance with the statutory rules.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have heard the Learned Advocates from both sides, perused the materials on record including the miscellaneous application and order passed by the Trial Court allowing the application, wherefrom, it transpires and as is evident from the records that the defendant received summons etc. and in filing the Miscellaneous Case is barred by Article 164 of the Limitation Act, and it also appears from the records that the plaintiff-petitioner had actually prayed for adjournment several times from last 15 years on different pleas and it is also evident from the record that the suit was dismissed for default thrice, firstly on 07.02.19999, secondly on 10.05.2001 and lastly on 24.07.2005 and it was restored each time on the prayer of the plaintiff.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">However, upon perusal of the records, we have marked the lack of diligence and delaying tactic shown by the petitioner pending the suit, whereas on the other hand no such conspicuous lack of diligence appears on the part of the defendant, while it is also evident upon examination that the petitioner had on different pretexts created by themselves dragged the suit up to 15 years. It also transpires that even after hearing and examining PW-1 the defendant for some reasons could not appear on the day of the judgment and which they have submitted and stated  that they had no knowledge of the same which is unintentional and inadvertent. It is true that the plaintiff’s suit was discharged and restored thrice and adjourned several times and also restored several times but on the other hand the defendant as is ex-facie evident from the records only once failed to be diligent which was due to inadvertence of the learned advocate for the defendant-petitioner-opposite party. Thus relying upon equitable principles, we are of the considered view that if the plaintiff-opposite party-petitioner could be given so many chances even after failing thrice, it is only fair that the  defendant opposite parties having failed only once ought to be given a similar chance. Pursuance to the submissions of the learned Advocates we are of the considered view that for some inadvertent fault of the learned advocate for defendant and that is only once, the party should not suffer, and, therefore, we feel that the Trial Court correctly allowed the application in Miscellaneous Case No. 02 of 2011 dated 08.02.2011. The learned Advocate for the petitioner argued that Article 164 of the Limitation Act provides that in the event of prayer for setting aside a decree passed ex-parte, time shall start from the date of the decree or where the summons was not duly served when the applicant has knowledge of the decree. The learned advocate for the petitioner tried to persuade us that in this case summons was served, it is evident that summons was served and all other due process were complied with, and, therefore, the defendant cannot rely on having received knowledge of the judgment and decree.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Now the instant civil revision arises out of a Miscellaneous Case for setting aside the judgment and decree under order 9 rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and, therefore, we feel that for our purpose order 9 rule 13 of Cpc. is applicable in the instant case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Order 9 rule 13 reads as under;</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">   “In any case in which a decree is passed ex-parte against defendant, he may apply to the Court by which the decree was passed for an order to set it aside; and if he satisfies the court that the summons was not duly served, or that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing when the suit was called on for hearing, the Court shall make an order setting aside the decree as against him upon such terms as to costs, payment in to Court or otherwise as it thinks fit, and shall appoint a day for proceeding with the suit.<br/>   Provided that where the decree is of such a nature that it cannot be set-aside as against such defendant only it may be set-aside as against all or any of the other defendants also.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">After perusal of order 9 rule 13, that order 9 rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure quite expressly states the criteria and condition and situations under which an application for setting aside an ex-parte order may be allowed. We have examined that order 9 rule 13 provides for a disjunctive clause, wherein it provides for situations or circumstances where a defendant may be prevented by any “sufficient cause” for appearing before the court. In the case before us, it is evident from the order dated 08.02.2011 of the trial court, that the court upon examining the facts and upon exercising its own discretion allowed the application under order 9 rule 13 which discretion the court is lawfully empowered to exercise. Our considered view is that under the facts and circumstances,  it is only fair that the application under order 9 rule 13 ought to be allowed and the Trial Court correctly allowed the same and has elaborated upon the reasons for allowing the same in his Order in the Miscellaneous Case filed by the defendant against the ex-parte Judgment and Decree passed by the Trial Court. The last contention of the petitioner is that the Judgment and Decree is not actually an ex-parte order and further persuades that it also “apparent” from the ordering portion of the judgment dated 30.03.2010 wherein it is stated that the Judgment is passed “<strong>দোতরফা সুত্রে</strong>চ Against this contention of the learned Advocate for the petitioner our considered finding is that using the word “<strong>দোতরফা সুত্রে</strong>চ was actually an inadvertently error on part of the Trial Court and which is obvious from the fact that the Trial Court allowed the application under order 9 rule 13 of Cpc. and in his order explained the facts and grounds of allowing the application quite elaborately,  and which is also apparent from the Judgment where the Trial Court made an observation that after cross examination of PW-1, the defendant did not come, therefore, it is evident and obvious that the order “<strong>দোতরফা সুত্রে</strong>চ used in the ordering portion of the judgment was only an inadvertent error on the part of the Trial Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">   Taking all the facts and circumstances into consideration, we arrive at our considered finding that the Trial Court vide its Order no.155 dated 13.01.2013 in Miscellaneous Case No.02 of 11 arising out of Title Suit No. 07 of 1996 correctly allowed the application under Order 9 rule 13 of the Cpc. , and, therefore, we do not find any merits in this rule.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the result, the Rule is hereby discharged without any Order as to costs and the judgment and order dated 08.02.2011 passed by the Trial Court is hereby affirmed. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Communicate at once.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">ED.</div></div></div>
