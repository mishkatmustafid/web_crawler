Abdul Motaleb Howlader on 10.09.2002 at about 12:30 hours lodged a First Information Report (F.I.R.) with Shyampur Police Station, DMP, Dhaka alleging that on 08.09.2002 at 7:00 a.m. his only son, namely Md. Mosharraf Hossain aged about 14 years was abducted on his way to work at about 7:15 a.m from in front of the shop of Idris Miah by accused A.K. Azad alias Baira Azad and others and taken away in a Microbus in presence of the local witnesses. Thereafter, on 10.09.2002 at 9:30 hours said A.K. Azad made a telephone call to the informant and demanded Taka 2,00,000/-for releasing his son. Upon the aforesaid F.I.R. Shyampur Police Station Case No. 21 dated 10.09.2002 under sections 7,8 and 30 of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 (the Ain, 2000) was started. <br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>      After completion of investigation police submitted a final report in favour of the accused persons recommending prosecution of the informant Md. Abdul Motaleb Howlader (hereinafter referred to as the informant) under section 17 of the Ain, 2000 for lodging a false case and also recommended for prosecuting witnesses No. 1. Shafiqul Islam, 2. A. Jobber Japani, 3. Md. Mustafizur Rahman and 4. Md. Lutfor Rahman under section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for giving false evidence.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>      Thereafter, on 25.11.2003 one Assistant Public Prosecutor for the State filed an application for prosecuting the informant Md. Abdul Motaleb Howlader and the accused petitioners before the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No. 2, Dhaka, who upon hearing accepted the final report and took cognizance against the informant Md. Abdul Motaleb Howlader and the present respondents under section 17 of the Ain, 2000 and issued process.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>      The informant and present respondents appeared before the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal and obtained bail.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>      The case was transmitted to the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No. 2, Dhaka where the informant and others filed an application under section 265C for discharging them from the case. Thereafter, upon transfer of the case, the learned Judge of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No. 1, by order dated 26.04.2005, framed charge against the respondents under section 17 of the Ain, 2000 and discharged the informant Md. Abdul Motaleb Howlader from the charge under section 17 of the aforesaid Act.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>      Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid proceeding, the respondents filed an application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the High Court Division and obtained Rule and an order of stay.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>      By the impugned judgement and order, the High Court Division made the Rule absolute thereby quashing the proceedings against the accused, respondents herein. Hence the appellant filed Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 809 of 2012.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>      Leave was granted to consider whether or not there was any irregularity in taking cognizance by the learned Judge of the Tribunal against the respondents either under the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Ain, 2000 or the Code of Criminal Procedure. <br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    Mr. Momtaz Uddin Fakir, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the police while investigating the allegations made against the appellant, which was later recorded as Shyampur Police Station Case No. 21 dated 10.09.2002 lodged by one Md. Abdul Motaleb Howlader regarding the abduction of his son, found that the story of abduction was false and recommended for discharge of the persons accused in that case, including the appellant and at the same time recommended that the informant of that case namely Abdul Motaleb Howladeer and the four persons who gave statements to the police in support of that case should be proceeded under section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and section 17 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000. The learned Advocate further submitted that the learned Judge of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, although discharged Abdul Motaleb Howlader, framed charge against the respondents. He submitted that there was no illegality committed by the learned Judge of the Tribunal. He further submitted that the grounds stated by the High Court Division for making the Rule absolute, are not tenable, inasmuch as section 17(2) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 does not require that the person who lodges a complaint under section 17(2) must be an aggrieved person. He submitted that the law clearly requires that any person may lodge such a complaint. Finally, he submitted that it has been found by the Tribunal that the respondent Abdul Motaleb Howlader was instigated by others to lodge a false case against the appellant which was done with <em>mala-fide </em>intention in order to harass him. Those persons who instigated the informant to lodge the false case also supported the false case by giving false statement before the police as witnesses. As such the Tribunal rightly framed charge against the respondents, who gave false statements to the police, and they should be given exemplary punishment for lodging and supporting that false case.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    Mr. Khandker Mahbub Hossain, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents submitted that the language of section 17(1) and 17(2) read together clearly indicate that <strong>""কোন ব্যক্তি''</strong> mentioned in section 17(2), refers to the same <strong>""কোন ব্যক্তি''</strong> mentioned in section 17(1). In other words, he submitted that the person who lodges the complaint under section 17(2) must be the person against whom and to whose detriment the earlier false case was lodged. He submitted that otherwise there would be an absurd situation where the person against whom the false case was lodge neither files any complaint himself nor comes forward to give evidence before the Court and yet proceedings will continue against the informant of that case. He further submitted that according to the definition contained in section 4 (1)(h) of the Code of Criminal Procedure the report of a police officer is not a complaint. Hence, the recommendation within the police report to prosecute the informant or complainant of a case cannot be treated as a complaint to prosecute that informant or complainant. He also pointed out that under section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure a Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence shall at once examine the complainant which indicates that a <em>prima facie</em> assessment of the complaint is being made by the Magistrate in order to decide whether or not to proceed further. He submitted that in the same way when some one is to be prosecuted for lodging a false case, the person against whom the false case was lodged must be examined to establish <em>prima facie</em> that it was a false case lodged with the intention to cause loss to that person. Unless the person against whom the complaint was lodged is examined, there cannot be any assessment as to whether the intention of the complainant was to cause his loss or did in fact cause his loss.      <br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgement and other connected papers on record.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    The High Court Division in the impugned judgement took the view that section 17(2) requires an aggrieved person to file the case under section 17(1). In this case, since the prosecution against the complainant was recommended in the police report, it was considered that it did not fulfill the requirement of section 17 since “no person filed any complaint against the accused petitioner”. It was noted by the High Court Division that on the basis of an application filed by the Assistant Public Prosecutor on behalf of the State the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal took cognizance against the informant of the earlier case as well as the respondents herein. However, subsequently the learned Tribunal Judge framed charge only against the four respondents while discharging the informant who was alleged to have lodged the false F.I.R. It was further observed by the High Court Division that prolongation of the impugned proceedings is a sheer abuse of the process of the Court.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    In the case of <strong><em>Md. Nurul Huq (Md) vs. State</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>55 DLR 588</em></strong> it was held that none had filed any petition for prosecuting the informant for making a false complaint or filing a false case. It was the view of the High Court Division in that case that section 17(1) requires that the complaint under section 17(2) must be filed by any person. In that particular case, the prosecution was commenced upon the direction of the <strong>নারী ও শিশু অপরাধ দমন বিশেষ আদালত</strong> given to the Magistrate to file a case under section 17(1) against the informant(complainant). It was thus considered that the Judge of the Tribunal was not “a person” contemplated by section 17(2).     <br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    The issue in the present case is whether the High Court Division was correct in its view that the written complaint under section 17(2) must be made by an aggrieved person. We note that the High Court Division in the earlier case of Md. Nurul Huq, cited above, did not go so far as to say that the complaint must be filed by an aggrieved person. However, in that case the High Court Division held that the direction by the Tribunal to the Magistrate of the cognizance Court to file a case under section 17(1) was held to be illegal.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    Section 17 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain is a special law which creates an offence of lodging a false case or complaint. The provision did not exist in the earlier special law which it replaced, namely  Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    However, there always was and still is a provision in the Penal Code for punishment for instituting false case against any person charging him of having committed an offence. Under section 211 of the Penal Code, a person who institutes or causes to be instituted any criminal proceeding against a person knowing it to be false, is liable to be punished under that section. In such an event cognizance by any Court can only be taken upon a written complaint of the Court where the proceedings arising out of the complaint are taking place. However, even such complaint in writing by the Court has to be done after preliminary inquiry as required by section 476 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    Special Laws generally carry harsher punishment than general law. Hence, the requirement of section 17(2) should not be taken so lightly. Section 17 of the Ain, 2000 provides as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">  ""১৭। মিথ্যা মামলা, অভিযোগ দায়ের ইত্যাদির শাস্তি-(১) যদি কোন ব্যক্তি অন্য কোন ব্যক্তির ক্ষতিসাধনের অভিপ্রায়ে উক্ত ব্যক্তির বিরুদ্ধে এই আইনের অন্য কোন ধারার অধীন মামলা বা অভিযোগ করার জন্য ন্যায্য বা আইনানুগ কারণ নাই জানিয়াও মামলা বা অভিযোগ দায়ের করেন বা করান তাহা হইলে মামলা বা অভিযোগদায়েরকারী ব্যক্তি এবং যিনি অভিযোগ দায়ের করাইয়াছেন উক্ত ব্যক্তি অনধিক সাত বৎসর সশ্রম করাদন্ডে দন্ডিত হইবেন  এবং ইহার অতিরিক্ত অর্থ দন্ডেও দন্ডনীয় হইবেন। <br/>(২) কোন ব্যক্তির লিখিত অভিযোগের ভিত্তিতে ট্রাইব্যুনাল উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন সংঘটিত অপরাধের অভিযোগ গ্রহণ ও মামলার বিচার করিতে পারিবে।''</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    It is true that the section does not specify that the written complaint must be filed by a person aggrieved. Hence, it can be filed by any person. As can be seen from a combined reading of section 211 of the Penal Code along with sections 195(1)(b) and 476(1)of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a complaint can be made in writing by the Court which was in seisin of the case where the false criminal charge was found to have been made, but only after recording a finding that the case imputed a false charge of a criminal offence. However, the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain does not require the Court to lodge the complaint, rather any person may do so.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    It is our view that in the event of a case under special law, any written complaint can be filed by anyone, since it is invariably a cognisable offence, but should not be acted upon without taking proper precautions, as is, for example, required under section 195(1)(b) read with section 476(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for a case to proceed under section 211 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    We are of the view that before proceeding with a case of false complaint or information against the informant or complainant, it would be prudent for the Court or Tribunal concerned to examine the materials on record to assess the <em>prima facie</em> nature of the allegation. It would be a futile exercise to proceed against the complainant/informant of a case charging him with having lodged a false case if the allegation of a false case having been brought by the accused is ultimately not likely to be substantiated in Court. <br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    We note that this case has been going on since 2003. It is also noted that the informant of the original case has been left out of the charge by the Tribunal framing charge only against the witnesses. We can only endorse the view of the High Court Division that prolonging this type of case any further would be an abuse of the process of the Court.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>    With the above observations the Criminal Appeal is disposed of. <br/> <br/><strong>         Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

During pendency of the appeal the defendants filed an application under Order XXXIX Rule 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) praying for local inspection. After hearing the parties, the learned Additional District Judge by his order dated 08.05.2004, rejected the application.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved, the defendants filed Civil Revision No. 1794 of 2004 before the High Court Division and obtained Rule, which upon hearing the parties and considering the materials on record, was made absolute.

The learned Advocate further submitted that the High Court Division failed to appreciate that possession cannot be ascertained by local investigation under order XXVI Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure which the High Court Division ultimately directed. He further submitted that the appellate Court rejected the application for local inspection after assigning cogent reasons, but the High Court Division, having accepted that an application under Order XXXIX Rule 7 was not tenable, seriously erred in observing that the appellate Court could have passed an order directing local investigation under Order XXVI Rule 9 of the Code.<br/><br/>Mr. Md.

This provision comes under the heading “Commissions for local investigations” and provides as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“9. In any suit in which the Court deems a local investigation to be requisite or proper for the purpose of elucidating any matter in dispute, or of ascertaining the market-value of any property, or the amount or any mesne profits or damages or annual net profits, the Court may issue a commission to such person as it thinks fit directing him to make such investigation and to report thereon to the Court within such time not exceeding three months as may be fixed by the Court: </em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Provided that the Court may, on the prayer of the Commissioner and on sufficient cause being shown, extend the time.”  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Essentially the purpose of local investigation under this provision is to ascertain the nature and feature and market value etc. of any property. Again, quite clearly this provision is not meant for ascertaining possession of property, which can only be done by taking evidence in the course of trial. <br/><br/>In view of the above discussions, we are of the opinion that the High Court Division was in error in making the Rule absolute.

Appeal No.01 of 2008 affirming the decision dated 23.09.2007 passed by Administrative Tribunal No.1, Dhaka, in A.T Case No.151 of 2006.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>      The facts, leading to the filing of this appeal, are précised below:<br/><br/>         The respondent instituted A.T. Case No.151 of 2006 for declaration that the letter communicated under Memo No. সম/শ-২ (বিমা)-২৩/৯৫/২৩৩ তারিখ ১০/৭/১৯৯৩, awarding punishment to him, which was served upon him on 28.09.2006 was illegal, void, collusive and the same was not binding upon him. The case of the respondent, in short, is that on 21.01.1986, he joined as Assistant Commissioner under the Ministry of Establishment. He was promoted as Senior Assistant Secretary on 14.09.1994 and thereafter as Deputy Secretary on 10.02.2003. While he was serving as Thana Nirbahi Officer at Atgoria, Pabna, the Secretary, Ministry of Establishment, framed charge against him stating that at the time of serving as Magistrate at Bagerhat, he, without writing the statements of the witnesses under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure himself, allowed the Investigating Officer to write those statements and thereafter put his signatures in those statements. The respondent in his reply denied the allegation. It has further been stated in the petition before the Administrative Tribunal that being satisfied, the concerned Secretary, after hearing the respondent, informally told him that no action would be taken against him. Thereafter, the respondent got two promotions and selection grade. While searching his position to get promotion as Joint Secretary, the respondent came to know that in that proceeding punishment in the form of “censure” had been awarded to him. He filed an application addressing the Secretary of the concerned Ministry to get the order of ‘censure’ and got the said order on 18.09.2006. Thereafter, he preferred an appeal before the President of the Republic but did not receive any reply. Then he filed the instant Administrative Tribunal case.<br/>         The Government, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Establishment, contested the case by filing a written objection contending, inter alia, that Eklas Khan, Mizan Khan and Yousuf Sheikh, the witnesses of G.R. No.57 of 1995 arising out of Bagerhat P.S. Case No.6 dated 18.05.1992 were produced by the Investigating Officer before the respondent for recording their statements under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The respondent, without recording their statements himself, allowed Investigating Officer of the said case to write the statements of those witnesses and then he put his signatures in the said statements which were found in the judgment in S.T.C. Case No.36 of 1993 by the Tribunal. Bringing such allegation, a departmental proceeding was initiated against the respondent and the same was established on holding departmental inquiry. Accordingly, the respondent was awarded punishment. The order awarding punishment was duly communicated to the respondent. Therefore, the case should be dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong>      The learned Member of Administrative Tribunal No.1, Dhaka, upon hearing the parties and considering the evidence on record, by the decision dated 23.09.2007 allowed the said case and declared the punishment awarded to the respondent void.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>      Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the decision dated 23.09.2007 passed by the learned Member, Administrative Tribunal No.1, Dhaka, the Government-respondent preferred A.A.T. Appeal No.01 of 2008 before Administrative Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka, which was dismissed by the decision dated 11.02.2010.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>      Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the decision passed by the Administrative Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka, the appellant as the leave-petitioner moved this Division by filing Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.794 of 2010, in which, leave was granted on 21.07.2013, resulting in Civil Appeal No.99 of 2013.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>      Mr. Goutam Kumar Roy, learned Deputy Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the appellant, submits that there is a specific finding by the Special Tribunal that while acting as Magistrate of Rampal, Bagerhat, the respondent put his signatures in the statements of three witnesses recorded under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which were alleged to have been written by another person and on such allegation, the Government initiated a departmental proceeding against the respondent and that as there was no specific denial on behalf of the respondent, the Administrative Tribunal and Administrative Appellate Tribunal committed an error of law in interfering with the punishment awarded to the respondent and as such, the impugned decision should be set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>      Mr. Bivash Chandra Biswas, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing on behalf of the respondent, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>      We have considered the submissions of the learned Deputy Attorney General for the appellant and the learned Advocate-on-Record for the respondent, perused the impugned decision and the materials on record.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>      Before entering into the merit of the appeal, it is necessary to go through the ground, for which, leave was granted. The ground is quoted below:<br/>“There is a specific finding by the Special Tribunal that while acting as Magistrate of Rampal, Bagerhat, the respondent put his signatures in the statements of three witnesses recorded under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure alleged to have been written by another person and on such allegation, the Government initiated a departmental proceeding against the respondent and that as there is no specific denial on behalf of the respondent, the Administrative Tribunal and Administrative Appellate Tribunal committed an error of law in interfering with the punishment awarded to the respondent and as such, the impugned decision should be set aside.”<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    Having gone through the record, we find that while performing the function of the Magistrate, First Class, the respondent recorded the statements of some of the witnesses under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is alleged that the respondent did not record the statements of Eklas Khan, Mizan Khan and Yousuf Sheikh with his own hand and that he signed those statements alleged to have been written by another person. Unless the allegations brought against the respondent are inquired into, it is difficult to believe that the allegations brought against him are true. In reply to the show cause notice, the respondent in writing denied the allegations brought against him and as such, the allegations could not be established without any inquiry. The respondent also alleged that the allegations were brought against him out of a conspiracy at the instance of a vested quarter. Therefore, the censure made by the appellant against the respondent cannot be said to be legal.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    The case in hand has similarity with <strong><em>Ridge v. Baldwin, [1964] AC 40.</em></strong> In the cited case, the Chief Constable of Brighton has been tried and acquitted on criminal charge of conspiracy to obstruct the Court’s justice. Two other Police Officers were convicted and the Judge took opportunities to comment adversely on the Chief Constable’s leadership of the force. Thereupon, the Brighton Watch Committee, without giving any notice or offering any hearing to the Chief Constable, uninimously dismissed him from service. His Solicitor then applied for a hearing and was allowed to appear before a later meeting. The committee confirmed their previous decision, but by a vote of nine against three. The Chief Constable exercised his right of appeal to the Home Secretary, but his appeal was dismissed. Finally, he turned to the Courts of law, claiming a declaration that his dismissal was void since he had given no notice of any charge against him and no opportunity of making his defence. This was refused by the High Court and by a uninimous Court of appeal. The House of Lords by a majority of 4 to 1 held that the initial dismissal was not only a breach of principle of natural justice, it was contrary to the express provisions of the statutory regulations governing police discipline which in cases of misconduct required notice of the charge and an opportunity for self-defence. The hearing given to the Chief Constable’s Solicitor was held to be irrelevant since even no notice of specific charge was given and natural justice was again violated.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    In the case in hand, relying only on the adverse remarks of the Tribunal, the respondent herein was censured without giving him any opportunity of being heard.  <br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    The Administrative Tribunal and the Administrative Appellate Tribunal rightly found that the allegations brought against the respondent could not be substantiated. It is not permissible to take disciplinary action against a person solely on the basis of adverse remarks made by a Tribunal in a criminal case unless the allegations imputed in the adverse remarks are proved in disciplinary proceeding.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    In the light of the findings made before, we do not find any substance in this appeal. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.   <br/> <br/>     <strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

One Md. Tayab Ali, the original defendant, on the basis of an agreement for sale obtaining an arbitration award instituted Title Suit No. 166 of 1966 in the First Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka and obtained an <em>ex parte </em>decree. Subsequently, he filed Title Execution Case No. 57 of 1967 procuring a forged Vokalatmana in the name of Pran Bollav Sarker and collusively suppressing all process of this suit   obtained an order of attachment of the suit land on 19.04.1969. Hence, the plaintiff filed the instant suit.<br/> <br/>         Defendant No. 1 filed a written statement denying the statements in the plaint, contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that the plaintiff entered into an agreement with Md. Tayab Ali and a dispute arose whereupon an arbitration was held which ended in an award. The award was placed before the Court in Title Suit No. 166 of 1966. Pran Ballav appeared by filing a Vokalatnama. The case was thereafter transferred to the Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka. During pendency of the suit, by a registered kabala No. 4183 dated 01.03.1971, one Md. Imam Uddin, the predecessor of respondent Nos. 1-8 purchased the entire suit land and got himself impleaded as plaintiff No. 2 in the suit.<br/> <br/>         The suit proceeded and the trial court fixed 20.02.2001 for arguments and, thereafter, decreed the suit in part declaring the <em>ex parte</em> decree dated 13.09.1967 passed in Title Suit No. 166 of 1966 as not binding upon the plaintiff and refused the prayer for declaration of the right, title and interest of plaintiff No. 2 in the suit land on the ground of his failure to produce the deed of purchase dated 01.03.1971.<br/> <br/>         Being aggrieved by the said judgement and decree Md. Imam Uddin filed Title Appeal No. 202 of 2001, renumbered as Title Appeal No. 1 of 2005. Sharafat Ali the defendant No. 9 and Harun-Or-Rashid predecessor of the petitioners herein filed Title Appeal No. 160 of 2001, renumbered as Title Appeal No.1 of 2004 before the District Judge, Dhaka. The learned District Judge transferred both the appeals to the Court of Jananirapatta Bighnakari Oparadh Daman Tribunal for disposal.<br/> <br/>         On 15.05.2007 the said Imam Uddin filed an application in Title Appeal No. 1 of 2005 for producing the aforesaid sale deed dated 01.03.1971 as additional evidence whereupon the defendant raised objection in writing and on hearing both the parties the appellate Court rejected the application for production of additional evidence by order dated 18.01.2010.<br/> <br/>         Being aggrieved by the rejection order passed by the appellate Court on 18.01.2010 the plaintiff filed Civil Revision No.1320 of 2010 before the High Court Division and obtained Rule, which was made absolute by the impugned judgement and order. Hence, the defendant as petitioner has filed the instant civil petition for leave to appeal before this Division.<br/> <br/>         Mr. Shamsul Haque, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that by the impugned judgement the High Court Division has erroneously allowed the opportunity to produce additional evidence by way of a deed of the year 1971, which was not produced within the last 34 years. He further submits that the plaintiff could have produced the deed before the appellate Court or the High Court Division, but did not do so and hence, the High Court Division erroneously allowed extra premium to the plaintiff.<br/> <br/>         Mr. Qamrul Hoque Siddique, learned Advocate appearing for respondent Nos. 1,3-7 &amp; 9-10 made submissions in support of the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division. <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates for the parties concerned, perused the impugned judgement as well as other evidence and materials on record.<br/> <br/>         We find from the judgement of the High Court Division that it was observed that Md. Imam Uddin was added as co-plaintiff by order of the Court on the basis of his being in possession of a deed dated 01.03.1971. This is the very document which was sought to be adduced as additional evidence and the contesting defendant has fought against that order up to this Division and also the addition of the co-plaintiff was opposed on the ground of assignment during pendency of the suit. It was held by the High Court Division that “To arrive at a correct decision and for proper adjudication into the matter in dispute it was necessary to adduce additional evidence so that the learned Court can arrive at a correct decision as to the fate of the suit as well as appeal.” <br/> <br/>         Having perused the evidence and materials on record, we note that the basis of claim of the added plaintiff is the document of the year 1971. Without such evidence the plaintiff will not be able to establish the genealogy and his claim to title in the property.   <br/> <br/>         With regard to production of additional evidence in the appellate Court, Order XLI Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“27 (1) The parties to an appeal shall not be entitled to produce additional evidence, whether oral or documentary, in the Appellate Court. But if-</em><br/><em>(a)the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred has refused to admit evidence which ought to have been admitted, or</em><br/><em>(b) the Appellate Court requires any document to be produced or any witness to be examined to enable it to pronounce judgement, or for any other substantial cause, the Appellate Court may allow such evidence or document to be produced, or witness to be examined.”  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>         Effectively this is an exclusionary provision restricting the production of additional evidence with the exceptions as mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) of rule 27 (1). In the facts of the instant case, in the absence of any order of the appellate Court requiring production of any evidence, any party may, by permission of the appellate Court, produce the deed in question “for any other substantial cause”, as provided in Rule 27 (1) (b).<br/> <br/>         We are of the view that the reasons stated by the High Court Division for allowing the production of the purchase deed dated 01.03.1971 of the added plaintiff is justified. <br/> <br/>         In view of the above discussion, we do not find any reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order. <br/> <br/>         Accordingly, the civil petition for leave to appeal is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>         Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Thereafter, Ahsanullah died without leaving any heirs. The entire properties were devolved to Amanullah, who died leaving behind his wife, sons Azmat Ali and Mamud Ali and one daughter Tufatan Nessa. By this time, Tufauan Nessa died leaving behind her husband Muslem Uddin, two sons Ali Ahmed and Mohammad Ali and two  daughters Ayna and Majfal. The defendant Nos. 1-6 are the heirs of Azmat Ali and defendant Nos. 7-9 are the heirs of Mamud Ali who gave .07 decimals of land to Md.

At this on searching in the Court he came to know that on 13.5.1991 the defendants obtained a collusive decree on 23.7.1981 in Partition Suit No. 331 of 1979. Thereafter, the plaintiff petitioners Nos. 1-2 filed  the instant Other Class Suit No. 50 of 1991 for declaring the said decree dated 23.7.1981 in partition Suit No. 331 of 1979 as not binding on them and hence the Case.<br/> <br/>            The defendant Nos. 1-6 appeared in the suit and submitted written statements by denying the Case of the plaintiffs alleging, inter alia, that the suit was not maintainable in its form and manner, bad for defect of parties and barred by limitation. The plaintiffs were aware of the decree from the beginning. A deed was registered during the pendency of the suit on. 15.7.1981.<br/> <br/>         The specific case of the contesting defendants is that they instituted partition suit No. 114 of 1978 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Tangail and the said suit was transferred in the Court of Munsif, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Tangail as partition Suit No. 331 of 1979 which was decreed preliminary on 24.1.1981 and finally on 23.7.1981. The defendant No. 10 Anisur Rahman filed Other Class Suit No. 38 of 1981 for setting aside the impugned  decree and the said suit on transfer in the Court of Upazilla Court, Mirzapur was numbered as Other Class Suit No. 317 of 1983 and the same was dismissed on 5.8.1984 against which Other Class Appeal No. 155 of 1984 was dismissed on 20.7.1986. Against the said judgment, dismissing Other Class Appeal No. 1551 of 1984, Anisur Rahman preferred Civil Revision No. 782 of 1986 in the High Court Division which being summarily dismissed, a Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 334 of 1986 was unsuccessfully moved before the Appellate Division and by suppressing all those fact the instant suit has been filed and as such the same is liable to be dismissed with costs.<br/> <br/>         While the position was such, after filing written statement, the defendant opposite party Nos. 1-6 filed an application for rejecting the plaint of the suit under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It was stated in the application that the plaintiffs and their vendors were aware of the Partition Suit No. 331 of 1979 and decree dated 23.7.1981 against which they contested the matter up to the Superior Courts like the High Court Division and the Appellate Division of the Honourable Supreme Court of Bangladesh. But they by suppressing those fact have filed the instant suit for setting aside the decree passed in Partition Suit No. 331 of 1979. Their said suit being barred by limitation and principle and Res-judicata the plaint thereof is liable to be rejected.<br/> <br/>         In view of the facts and circumstances of the case  the learned Assistant Judge of the Trial Court rejected the plaint of the Other Class Suit No. 50 of 1991 vide judgment and order dated 24.09.1993. Against which these plaintiff petitioners preferred Other Class Appeal No. 32 of 1993 before the District Judge, Tangail and the said Appeal was  ultimately heard by the learned Joint District Judge, Tangail, who by the impugned judgment and decree dated 4.11.2001 dismissed the said Other Class Appeal.<br/> <br/>         As against the said judgment and decree as passed by the learned Court of appeal below, the petitioners filed this instant civil revision and obtained the Rule.<br/> <br/>         Pursuant to the service of the Rule, the learned Advocate Mr. H. R. Nandi entered appearance on behalf of the opposite-parties while the learned Advocate Mr. Abul Qashem appearing on behalf of the petitioners. The opposite parties filed no counter affidavit in this Rule.<br/> <br/>         The learned Advocate Mr.  Abul Qashem for the petitioners, submits that there being a prima facie case and no issue having been framed and no evidence having been taken in Other Class Suit No. 50 of 1991, after filing the written statements, for determination of question raised in the suit, the order of rejection of the plaint is illegal and erroneous. The plaintiffs having filed their suit by disclosing specific cause of action by paying proper court fee on correct valuation by writing the plaint on sufficient stamp paper, their suit not being barred by limitation in any way and the suit not appearing from its statement to be barred by any law, the learned Judge of the Appellate Court has committed error of law in failing to hold and decide that the learned Assistant Judge of the trial Court had committed error of law resulting in an error in decision occasioning failure of justice by rejecting plaint of Other Class suit No. 50 of 1991.<br/> <br/>         He next submits that fraud and malice in prosecution in   Partition Suit No. 331 of 1979 and decree therein having been alleged in the impugned Other Class Suit No. 50 of 1991, which being matter of scrutiny and evidence in Trial, rejection of plaint before framing issue for trial is illegal, improper and liable to be set aside. The plaintiffs not being parties in Partition Suit No. 331 of 1974, but their legally purchased land having been included in the decree of the said suit and they having challenged the validity of the said decree by praying for declaring the same is not binding on them in their instant suit, which having been registered being in proper form and manner, the Courts below has committed error of law resulting in an error in decision occasioning failure of justice by not holding and finding that the plaint of their Other Class Suit No. 50 of 1991 cannot be rejected  after having the pleadings of both parties before taking evidence in Trial. He prayed for making the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>         The learned Advocate Mr. Md. Nurul Amin appearing with the learned Advocate Mr. H. R. Nandi for the opposite parties submits that that the suit was not maintainable in its form and manner, bad for defect of parties and barred by  law of limitation. The plaintiffs were aware of the decree from the beginning, the deed was registered during the pendency of the suit. The specific Case of the contending defendants  opposite parties is that they instituted partition suit No. 114 of 1978 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Tangail and the said (Suit No. 331 of 1979) was decreed preliminary on 24.1.1981 and finally on 23.7.1981. The defendant No. 10 Anisur Rahman filed Other Class Suit No. 38 of 1981 for setting aside the said decree and the said suit (Other Class Suit No. 317 of 1983) was dismissed on 5.8.1984. Against which Other Class Appeal No. 155 of 1984 was dismissed on 20.7.1986. Again the said judgment dismissing Other Class &amp; Appeal No. 1551 of 1984, Anisur Rahman preferred Civil Revision No. 782 of 1986 in the High Court Division which being summarily dismissed, Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 334 of 1986 was unsuccessfully moved before the Appellate Division and by suppressing this fact the instant suit has been filed and as such the same is liable to be dismissed. He prayed for discharging the Rule and to affirm the impugned judgment.<br/>I have heard the learned Advocate of both the parties, perused the judgment of both the Courts below and other materials on record. Perused the application for abatement  and counter affidavit therein.<br/> <br/>         The impugned suit is for scrutiny of a decree passed in partition Suit No. 331 of 1979, the opposite parties categorically admitted that defendants Nos. 9 and 10 as heir  has their property in the suit land which also needs adjudication on admission. This matter also traveled upto the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and the trial Court  and the appellate Courts below had the duty to look into all these facts, disputes, averment and disposed of the suit on merit not in a summary manner based on a technical point  ousting the plaintiffs to establish the civil right and title.<br/> <br/>         It appears that the points discussed by the trial Court in  disposing of the application  (after the written statement  filed by the defendant) under order 7 rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure are such those needs to be proved after looking into facts from filing the suit to a matter disposed of upto the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, which is apparent from the materials on record. Even the trial Court itself found that amendment of plaint of the instant suit is required<strong>.</strong> So suit ought to be disposed of on merit, lis-pendency point was  also to be seen, as alleged.<br/> <br/>         True a plaint may be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure merely on reading a plaint but the Court should invoke its inherent jurisdiction and cannot throw out the plaint out in limini. The plea of implied bar should be decided on evidence unless the fact disclosed in the plaint clearly indicate that the suit is not maintainable. In exceptional cases recourse may be taken even under Section 151 of the Code. In an application for rejection of plaint on the ground of undisclosed cause of action the Court should not discard the plaintiff’s case. In this case written statement has already been filed alleging and or disputing several facts and the suit   ought to be decided after framing issues as such.<br/> <br/>         The powers conferred by rule 11 of order 7 Code of Civil Procedure should be exercised when the case is beyond doubt e.g. where the Court is satisfied that the plaint does not disclose a cause of action, or that the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious. The Rule 11 ought not to be applied to suits involving investigation/adjudication of complicated points of law or question of general importance. The power to reject plaint should be exercised only if he Court comes to the conclusion that even if the allegation set out in the plaint are proved, the plaintiff would not entitled to any relief.<br/> <br/>         In the present suit from the materials on record and the plaint and the written statement it appears that there are many facts mentioned in the plaint and written statements  and other materials which required to be adjudicated and the proper and appropriate course is to let the suit proceed to determine the issue as per plaint, written statement. The fact/plaint discloses, that there may be controversy of facts or an interpretation of law on which two views may he canvassed and as such rejection of plaint is not legal. Thus this Court is of the view that the Courts below failed to consider that it should determine a cause of action in considering the question of cause of action, record of suit which was challenged in the suit, applying its mind to the  impugned suit and its decree and averments in the plaint,  written statement (as in this case) and materials presuming that every allegation made in the plaint are to be adjudged  and Court must apply its mind to cause of plaintiff as set out in the body of the plaint.<br/> <br/>         In view of above facts, circumstance and legal position I am of the view that the rejection of the impugned plaint under order 7 rule 11 of Code of Civil Procedure was clearly misconceived and contrary to the law and decisions. The scope of Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure is now well settled, that a Court of revision under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure can interfere with the findings of fact, of the final Court of facts, only in exceptional cases, when the findings are shockingly perverse and those are vitiated by non-reading and misreading of the materials evidence or misconstruction of any important document affecting the merit of the suit.<br/> <br/>         In this case both the Court below committed illegality in passing the judgment and decree under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure which is laible to be interfered with by this Court.<br/> <br/>         The learned Advocate Mr. Md. Nurul Amin after part heard of the matter, by filing an application, prayed that the rule is abated, as the petitioner No. 2, the opposite party Nos. 19 21, 22, 23, 29, 33, 34, 41 and 47 died  long before. In which the petitioner filed counter affidavit stating that the application is misconceived and statements are not correct. The heirs of the petitioner No. 2 had already been substituted in accordance with law and the rule was issued only against opposite party Nos. 1-12 and as such the substitution of heirs of opposite parties the petitioner No. 2 and those are not required to be substituted and thus this application is misconceived and redundant and filed just to delay the matter. <br/> <br/>         On perusal of application, counter affidavit to it I am of the view that the application is redundant and is with wrong statements. In such circumstances this application is summarily rejected.<br/> <br/>In the result the Rule is made absolute.<br/> <br/>         The judgment and decree dated 04.11.2001 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, Tangail in Other Class Appeal No. 32 of 1993, affirming the judgment and order dated 24.09.1993, passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Mirzapur, Tangail, in Other Class Suit No. 50 of 1991, rejecting the plaint of the suit, is hereby set aside. <br/> <br/>         The trial Courts is directed to dispose of the suit on merit in accordance with law preferably within 1(one) year from the date of receipt of this judgment.<br/> <br/>         Communicate the judgment and order.<br/> <br/>         Send down the L. C. R. if any.<br/> <br/><strong>         Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The Respondent No. 1, Deputy Commissioner and Divisional Officer vide Nathi No. 4/Mushak/Medicine/Audit/ Demand/ 509/2005/ 5602 dated 4.12.2005 issued a demand notice under Section 55 of the Act upon the Petitioner demanding a deficit amount of VAT of Tk. 2,10,53,501/- for the period  from 29.9.2002 to 31.12.2004 as evident from an audit report dated 6.9.2005.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>       On 13.12.2005 the Petitioner replied to the said Demand Notice dated 4.12.2005 citing inadvertence in adjusting the said deficit VAT amount of Tk. 2,10,53,501/- to its Current Account Register. It is noted that in rectifying that error the Petitioner made an adjustment of the said deficit amount in its Current Account within the time limit as specified in the demand notice dated 4.12.2005. That notwithstanding, on 22.12.2005 the Respondent No. 1 issued a notice upon the Petitioner fixing a date for hearing the matter. It is now contended that upon hearing the parties, but without considering the applicable law and the facts and circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner on 17.5.2006 illegally allowed the Irregular Case against the Petitioner penalizing it under Section 37(2) of the Act and directing a penalty payment of Tk. 2,10,53,501/-.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>       Against the above factual backdrop, this Court is now invited to inquire to what extent it was legally within the authority and jurisdiction of the Respondent No. 1, Deputy Commissioner to impose the impugned penalty under Section 37(2) of the Act in the facts and circumstances. The preliminary question of law that needs to be determined, as submitted by the learned Advocate of the Petitioner Mr. Omar Sadat, is the extent of the distinct and mutually exclusive spheres of operations of Sections 55 and 37 of the Act in that the two provisions may not be simultaneously and concomitantly be drawn upon to initiate conjoined proceedings against any taxpayer   without, thereby, disregarding the legislative intent in that regard. The prayer is, accordingly, for any attempt at a conjunctive process of realization and penalization, as is reflected in the impugned order, to be declared as being illegal and without authority in law.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>       It is evident to this Court that the very initiation of a demand process against the Petitioner Company on 4.12.2005 against the backdrop of alleged deliberate avoidance of payment of VAT is marked by a reliance jointly on the provisions of Sections 55 and 37 of the Act. This, the Petitioner submits, stems from an apparent erroneous understanding of the law. Primarily, the demand notice of 4.12.2005 issued under Section 55(1) of the Act reflects an effort at due realization of a shortfall of VAT totalling Tk. 2,10,53,501/-. In that regard, and in keeping with the specific provisions of Section 55(1) of the Act, it is noted that such demand for payment should be followed by an opportunity granted to the Petitioner to show cause against such demand within a specified period. Thereafter, and as indicated in the notice itself, a final determination under Section 55(3) shall follow on the issue of any shortfall in payment. However, that notice of 4.12.2005 refers additionally to Section 37(5) of the Act extending an opportunity to the Petitioner to show cause within a specified period why penalties, inclusive of a fine, shall not be imposed under Section 37 by reason of infractions of various specified provisions of the Act as well as the VAT Rules, 1991 (“the Rules”). It is this very notion of the mutual interplay and connectivity of Section 55 and 37 that is so apparent on the face of the notice of 4.12.2005 that the Petitioner submits is not sanctioned in law.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>       The learned Advocate for the Petitioner Mr. Omar Sadat has referred to a series of Judgments of this Court that have underscored the functional distinction between the two Sections and, therefore, their spheres of operation. These decisions emphasize upon the fundamental objective of the Section 55 provisions being written into the law to ensure realization of shortfall in payment and those in Section 37 identifying specific offences and the sanctions that attach to the same.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>       Highlighting the necessity of a strict interpretation and application of the provisions of the Act this Court, for example, in <em>PET Industries vs. Customs, Excise</em> reported in <em>61 DLR (2009) 734</em> emphasized the distinctive features of processes variously initiated under Sections 55 and 37 and insisted on the exhaustion of a process once initiated under Section 55 strictly in accordance with the prescriptions laid down in that Section. Acknowledging that the Act lays down elaborate procedures for the realization of tax under Section 55 on the one hand and for punishment for any violation or omission as enumerated in Section 37 on the other, this Court in the <em>PET Industries Case</em> held that the <em>“concerned authority is therefore, duty bound to follow the procedure as laid down in the Act for each and every action.” </em>In that regard, this Court discerns from the scheme of the Act that it would be for such authority to appreciate that there may not be a haphazard merger of these two provisions in proceeding against an assessee. This Court notes that in such a context the Section 55 provisions, in the facts and circumstances, are to be accorded primacy at realization of any amount having previously fallen due. The rationale for that conclusion is provided thus in the PET Industries Case at paragraphs 13 and 14, page 736:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"If the entire provision of section 55 is considered then it would be clear that section 55 empowers the concerned VAT authority to take steps for realization of unpaid or less paid Vat or tax upon first issue of a notice asking to show cause and then, upon hearing, within 90 days to make a final demand in respect of any Vat or tax unpaid, evaded or less paid.</em><br/> <br/><em>On the other hand, section 37 of the said Act defines various offences and punishments for such offence. Before any final demand could be made under section 55(3), none of the provisions of section 37 could be resorted to. It is needless to say as the fiscal law demands strict interpretation so equally demands for strict application by an authority authorized to apply. The VAT Act is a comprehensive tax law. It has defined the tax to be paid as VAT on the specified sales and/or services. Similarly, it has laid down elaborate procedure for realization of the tax and punishment for any violation or omission. The concerned authority is therefore, duty bound to follow the procedure as laid down in the Act for each and every action. The Act does not empower any of the authorities created to become zealot to overpower and/or overawe any tax payer. Invoking and/or resorting to section 37 while issuing a notice under section 55(1) of the VAT Act therefore, could not be said to have been issued bona fide for the simple reason that at the time of issue of the notice, the authority concerned had not yet arrived at as to any evasion of VAT by the petitioner.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Significantly, the interpretation above makes clear that invocation of a Section 55 process necessarily entails the act of final determination as contemplated under Section 55(3) on the basis of a reply or objection submitted further to a Section 55(1) notice. It is deemed prudent to reproduce herein below the provisions of Section 55(3) of the Act as was current at the material time:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“(৩) উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন শুল্ক ও কর প্রদানের জন্য যেই ব্যক্তির নিকট হইতে দাবী করা হয় সেই ব্যক্তি লিখিতভাবে উক্ত দাবীর বির্রদ্ধে আপত্তি উত্থাপন করিলে তাহাকে শুনানির সুযোগ দান করিতে হইবে। অতঃপর উক্ত ব্যক্তির উত্থাপিত অাপত্তি বিবেচনা করিয়া সংশ্লিষ্ট মূল্য সংযোজন কর কর্মকর্তা নোটিশে দাবীকৃত শুল্ক ও করের পরিমান প্রয়োজনবোধে পুনঃনির্ধারণ করিতে পারিবেন, এবং উক্ত ব্যক্তি নোটিশে দাবীকৃত বা ক্ষেত্রমতে পুনঃনির্ধারিত শুল্ক ও কর পরিশোধ করিতে বাধ্য থাকিবেন।” </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>          Evidently, the centrality of a final determin-ation under Section 55(3), within the Section 55 realization process is, therefore, well-encapsulated in the decision in the <em>PET Industries Case.</em> Furthermore, their Lordships in that Judgment emphasized on the exhaustion of a Section 55 process in its entirety culminating in such a final determination even before any thought or intention may be entertained, if at all, by the VAT Authority to proceed under Section 37. To reiterate, Md. Abdur Rashid, J. succinctly held in the <em>PET Industries Case,</em> in the scheme of the Act <em>“(b)efore any final demand could be made under Section 55(3), none of the provisions of Section 37 could be resorted to.” </em>(at paragraph 14 page 736). It is found that their Lordships in that case emphasized significantly on the legal impossibility of any attempt at even raising the spectre of punishment under Section 37 of the Act even before any decision could be arrived at finally and conclusively under Section 55(3) as to the true extent of the shortfall in the payment of any tax or arrears in taxes. Should, however, the VAT Authority, at any instance, and indeed as occurred in the <em>PET Industries Case</em>, have strayed into a misreading of such comparative juxtaposition of Sections 55 and 37 and issued a notice referring simultaneously to both these provisions and seeking, thereby, to initiate parallel or indeed conjoint processes of determination under both the provisions, the unavoidable finding of this Court has to be that this is only but a device to bring undue pressure to bear upon a taxpayer by functionaries who have wrongly assumed ostensible authority to wield power not sanctioned in law. This rationale is found pervasive of the ratio decidendi  in a series of other decisions, most notably, <em>Abdul Motaleb vs. Customs</em> reported in <em>64 DLR(2012), 100</em> as well as in <em>Hotel Zakaria International (Pvt) Ltd. vs. National Board of Revenue (N.B.R.) &amp; Ors.</em> reported in <em>30 BLD (HCD)(2010), 388</em>.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>       Furthermore, while most of the above referred decisions have declared on the illegality of notices issued  conjointly both under Section 55 and 37 of the Act, the judgment in the <em>Hotel Zakaria International  Case, </em>it is noted, goes further in carrying out a surgical exercise in such instances of conjoint notices, thereby, recognizing the validity of the process initiated under Section 55(1) and culminating in a final determination but categorically denying such part of the notice or process bearing reference to or initiated under Section 37 of the Act to be <em>“bereft or any legal consideration whatsoever.” </em>(at paragraph 6, page 389).<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>       It is upon a consideration of the above and an application of the rationale of the judgments cited above that this Court finds the legal basis for the issuance of the notice itself of 4.12.2005 to be partially unsound to the extent that in addition to a Section 55 process of realization of short payment of VAT the notice concomitantly seeks to open up a process under Section 37 with a view to penalizing any violation of specified provisions of the Act. In that regard, this Court is of the view that the extent to which  said notice seeks to invoke provisions of Section 37, to that extent, it  indeed proceeds on a grave misunderstanding and erroneous application of the law insomuch as leading the Respondent No. 1, Deputy Commissioner to act resultantly beyond his statutory jurisdiction to so act. To that extent, therefore, the said notice is indeed shorn of any legal sanction and consequence. This preliminary finding of this Court has also to be further examined in light of developments that took place consequent upon the issuance of the notice of 4.12.2005. These are reflected in, as above noted, in the rectification by adjustment to its Current Account by the Petitioner of the deficit VAT amount of Tk. 2,10,53,501/- within the time limit as set in the demand notice of 4.12.2005. This was coupled, in lieu of an objection or cause shown to the Section 55(1) notice, by an explanation on the part of the Petitioner of the apparent unintentional slackness as contributed to such amount falling due and with the Petitioner, accordingly, tendering an unconditional apology in that regard. The Petitioner now submits that given these circumstances the Respondent No. 1, Deputy Commissioner erred in law by wholly ignoring the legal significance of such payment. That error contributed to the further misstep of seeking to draw a conclusion to the process initiated on 4.12.2005 through an Irregular Case and by arriving at specific findings of violation of various provisions of Section 37(2) of the Act. The outcome of that exercise has been an imposition of penalty equal to the sum of the shortfall in VAT payment initially demanded but otherwise already paid by the Petitioner as above. It is that exercise reflected in the Order of 17.5.2006, also incorporating the demand of payment of the penalty under Section 37(2), by the Respondent No. 1 that is the subject matter of this Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>     This Court appreciates that there is indeed a paradox in initiating a process under Section 55 of charging and realization of payments fallen due and concurrently issuing a notice under Section 37 in terms as appear to prejudge the offences perceived to be reflected in such short payments. This Court notes that there is a self-contained process of charging and realization as found in Section 55 as a whole. Given the judicial pronouncements finding on the separateness of Section 55 and the Section 37 processes, Mr. Omar Sadat aptly interprets Section 55 as envisaging a process as initiated by a notice under Sub-section 1 invariably culminating in a final determination as stipulated in Sub-section 3. Furthermore, upon a careful reading of Section 55(4), in particular, as recognizes the ability of any payer to pay up as per any demand reflected in a Section 55(1) notice, the operation of Section 55(3) resulting in a final determination is not necessarily precluded given that Section 55(4) clearly presupposes the realization of penalty and fine. Notably, therefore, Section 55(4) at the time read thus:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“৫৫(৪) উপধারা (১) এর অধীন শুল্ক ও কর প্রদানের জন্য যে ব্যক্তির নিকট হইতে দাবি করা হয়, সেই ব্যক্তি লিখিতভাবে উক্ত দাবীকৃত অর্থ কিসি¹তে পরিশোধের ইচ্ছা ব্যক্ত করিলে কমিশনার তৎকর্তৃক নির্ধরিত শর্ত ও কিস্তিতে উক্ত দাবীকৃত অর্থের মধ্য হইতে অর্থদন্ড ও জরিমানার অর্থ পরিশোধের জন্য আদেশ প্রদান করিতে পারিবেন।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>          Predicated on the above, this Court, therefore, finds that if any case falls within the four corners of Section 55, a notice issued under Section 55(1) shall always culminate in a Section 55(3) final determination of the extent of liability. There is no scope in law to act in avoidance of such requirement, nor is there any scope in law to proceed halfway under Section 55 and, pending a final determination of liability there under, alter that course of action and invoke at will any other provision of the law, for example, Section 37 of the Act. This Court notes that notwithstanding the adjustment of the claimed shortfall amount by the Petitioner in December 2005 in the Current Account Register coupled within an explanation short of being read as an objection raised to the demand or a cause shown to the notice issued, it was incumbent upon the Respondent No. 1, Deputy Commissioner to follow up on that development and strictly proceed under Section 55(3) of the Act to make a final determination. It is apparent that in the present facts and circumstances that exercise, in all probability, upon a mistaken reading of the law, was overlooked and in preference, and by direct reference to the Section 37 process initiated on 4.12.2005, the Respondent No. 1 found himself somehow constrained to arrive at the impugned finding and direction under Section 37(2) imposing a penalty there under. Given the self-contained provisions of Section 55 as make it incumbent for any notice issued under Section 55(1) to invariably culminate in a final determination under Section 55(3), it is found accordingly that it was not within the authority of the Respondent No. 1 to give that process and exercise a complete go by and rely in the alternate on the provisions of Section 37(2). That finding in the facts and circumstances necessitates a further finding that the Petitioner’s rectification by adjustment in Current Account shall not necessarily preclude a final determination under Section 55(3). That final determination may very well invoke an additional imposition of penalties and fines as referred to in Section 55(4). Indeed furthermore as, Mr. Sadat has satisfactorily submitted, the exhaustion of the Section 55 process so in its entirety would still keep open the possibility thereafter under the Act, as was current on the material dates, for the authorities to independently construct a case under Section 37 and pursue that matter upon issuing a notice and extending an opportunity to be heard under Section 37(5).<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>     It is noted that no Affidavit-in-Opposition has been filed in this case. The learned Assistant Attorney General Ms. Kashefa Hussain has submitted that the impugned determination by the Deputy Commissioner is an order that is appealable under Section 42(1)(L) before the Commissioner  (Appeal). By that reason, therefore, it was incumbent upon the Petitioner   to so appeal rather than invoking the Writ Jurisdiction of this Court. Whenever an issue as to the maintainability of a Writ Petition is so taken against the context of availability of alternate forums, this Court has to consider the same in application of the fundamental principle that the notion of exhaustion of alternate remedy does not reflect an absolute principle or rule of jurisdiction but is merely one that this Court may rely upon to regulate or manage its jurisdiction. That rationale has informed various Judgments of this Court enunciating various grounds to relax the perceived inflexibility of the requirement of initial resort to alternate remedies (<em>Dhaka Warehouse Ltd. &amp; another vs. Assistant Collector of Customs &amp; others</em> reported in <em>(1991)11BLD(AD)327 </em>as well as <em>Nagin</em><em>a</em><em> Silk Mill vs. Income Tax Officer</em> reported in <em>15DLR(SC)(1963)181)</em>. The learned A.A.G. for her part has relied upon the Judgment in <em>Bengal Glass Works Ltd. vs. Member VAT NBR &amp;others </em>reported in <em>9MLR (HC)2004,273</em> as held that since the legislature in the general scheme  of the Act did not differentiate between executive and adjudicatory orders, appeal lies against all such orders as provided under Section 42 of the Act, thereby, negating access to Writ jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution.  Against this backdrop, this Court seized of this Writ in Certiorari, however, finds relatively greater significance in Mr. Sadat’s submission that this Writ arises against the backdrop of an assumption of authority by the Respondent No. 1, Deputy Commissioner stemming from an erroneous reading of the law. Given that the relief in Certiorari is available in circumstances where the statutory duty has been to act judicially, whether in an administrative or in a quasi-judicial capacity and in the sense of acting duly and reasonably, this Court holds that this Court shall readily intervene in circumstances where there has been a blatant disregard of that duty so to act, thereby, prejudicially affecting the interests of a petitioner. By that reason, it is this Court’s finding that proceeding on an error of law the Respondent No. 1, Deputy Commissioner far exceeded his authority than as contemplated in the Act itself and in doing so acted in a manner illegal, unreasonable and arbitrary from which no consequence in the manner specified in the Impugned Order can legally follow. The said Order of 17.5.2006 is indeed in this Court’s view one without any legal effect by reason of having been passed without any lawful authority. That finding is in turn predicated on questions of interpretation of law as above rightfully clothe this Court with the jurisdiction in Certiorari and to  entertain the Petitioner’s prayer under this Application. That is indeed the rationale behind this Court’s observation below in the <em>PET Industries Case:</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“There is no dearth of authority to say when an authority is created to exercise certain authority and a procedure laid down to follow in the exercise of such authority by a statue, the authority concerned shall exercise the authority in accordance with the procedure otherwise its action shall become unauthorized. Any demand therefore made by an authority concerned for VAT or other tax, which was not made in accordance with the procedure laid down in the VAT Act, such demand must be held to be not a demand in the eye of law and this Division cannot deny or refuse to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution to strike down such unauthorized exercise of statutory power.”</em>(at paragraph 15, page 736)              </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>12.</strong>     In view of the above, this Court finds that the exercise undertaken by the Respondent No. 1 resulting in the Impugned Order of 17.5.2006 cannot be said to stem from a lawful exercise of statutory power. By that reason the Impugned Order of 17.5.2006 as imposes a penalty under Section 37(2) of the Act is declared to have been made without lawful authority and to be of no legal effect. This finding shall not in any way, however, restrain the concerned Respondents to take further action, if any, against the Petitioner but only upon a strict adherence to the relevant provisions of the Act, as in particular found in Section 55 of the Act. This shall be done with the primary aim of bringing to a final conclusion the process initiated against the Petitioner by the Section 55(1) notice dated 4.12.2005.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>     Accordingly, given the Petitioner’s preponderatingly satisfactory invocation of and reliance on the applicable law, this Court finds overall merit in the Application and is inclined to treat the Rule as this being made absolute.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>     In the result, the Rule is made absolute subject, however, to the observations and specific findings on law as above.<br/> <br/>         There is no Order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>         Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

At about 5:30 p.m. when he reached in front of Md. Shukur Ali’s Saw-mill at Taherpur Kalibari <em>Mor</em> some unknown miscreants killed the victim. Thereafter, the Officer-in-Charge, Bagmara Police Station, recorded the Ejahar on the verbal statement of Most. Rokshana Parveen(P.W.1), wife of the deceased. Accordingly, Bagmara P.S. Case No. 7 under section 302/34 of the Penal Code dated 08.12.2003 was started.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>      After completion of investigation police submitted charge-sheet No. 153 dated 04.10.2004 against the appellant and nine others under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>      Thereafter, the case record was transmitted to the Court of Sessions Judge, Rajshahi. The learned Judge of the said Court took cognizance of the offence against the petitioner and others under the same section. The case was registered as Sessions Case No. 348 of 2005. Thereafter, the case record was transmitted to the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, 2nd Court, Rajshahi for trial, who framed charge against all the accused including the petitioner under section 302/34 of the Penal Code, which was read over and explained to the accused on dock to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>      During trial the prosecution examined as many as 19 (nineteen) witnesses, but the defence did not examine any witness. The convict-petitioner and others were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when they again pleaded their innocence.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>      After hearing the parties and considering the evidence and materials on record, the trial Court convicted the petitioner and two others under section 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced him as mentioned above.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>      The convict-petitioner thereafter preferred Jail Appeal No. 357 of 2006 before the High Court Division which upon hearing, by the impugned judgement, was dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>      Mr. A.B.M. Bayezid, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the convict-petitioner submits that there was no eye witness to the occurrence, and the only evidence against the convict petitioner was his statement, recorded under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He submits that the confessional statement was an exculpatory one and, as such, could not form the basis of conviction of the convict-petitioner. He submits that the High Court Division erred in upholding the conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court for an offence under section 302/34 of the Penal Code which was based solely upon the petitioner’s uncorroborated confessional statement. The learned Advocate points out that the accused in his statement made under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure alleged that the confessional statement having been recorded by a Magistrate who was related to the victim, ought not to have been taken into consideration as evidence since the learned Magistrate was biased. He points out that the accused, when examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, also alleged that the police assaulted him and that the learned Magistrate took his signature on blank paper. The learned Advocate finally submits that the case is one of no legal evidence and, as such, the High Court Division erred in upholding the conviction and sentence of the petitioner.  <br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>      Mr. Biswajit Deb Nath, learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the respondent made submissions in support of the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division. <br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner and the learned D.A.G. for the respondent, perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    The High Court Division upheld the trial Court’s conviction of the accused found guilty under section 302 read with section 34 of the Penal Code. We find that the High Court Division did not discuss the evidence in detail, but observed that the learned Judge of the trial Court upon consideration of several decisions of the higher judiciary held that the confessional statement was true and voluntary and, as such, felt that the judgement and order of conviction and sentence did not call for any interference. Referring to the evidence of the learned Magistrate who recorded the confessional statement, the High Court Division observed that the learned Magistrate categorically stated before the Court that the convict did not raise any objection in respect of recording of the confessional statement and, accordingly, the High Court Division found that the confessional statement was true and voluntary. It was also observed that according to the doctor, who had conducted the post mortem examination, there were several injuries on the person of the deceased and in his opinion the death was due to shock and hemorrhage as a result of those injuries, and accordingly the High Court Division upheld the conviction and sentence.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    On perusal of the statement of the petitioner  recorded under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it appears to us that the convict petitioner was definitely present at the time of occurrence and took part in the killing of the victim by standing guard while, according to him, other accused persons killed the victim. He not only stood guard but also took part in the jubilation along with all the other assailants. It, therefore, cannot be said that the confession was exculpatory, or that the common intention to kill the victim was absent in the case of the petitioner. <br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    So far as corroboration of the confessional statement is concerned, we find corroboration of the confessional statement from the injuries found on the body of the deceased. Moreover, when the accused himself admits to his own complicity in the commission of the offence, even though he did not take part in the violence which led to the death of the victim, he cannot escape his liability which is imputed upon him by section 34 of the Penal Code. Clearly the petitioner and the co-accused all went to the place of occurrence with the common intention of killing the victim, and he took part by standing guard while the others dealt the fatal blows.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    We note from the confessional statement itself that the accused was specifically asked whether the police had tortured him to which he had replied in the negative. He also added that he was making the confessional statement due to pricking by his conscious. <br/> <br/>         We find from the endorsement of learned Magistrate which is found in the form of the recorded statement that upon examination of his body no sign of torture was found. Taken as a whole we do not find any irregularity or defect in the recording of the confessional statement, which in our view has been rightly found to be true and voluntary.        <br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    In view of the above discussion, we do not find any illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgment and, therefore, find no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order.<br/> <br/>            Accordingly, the jail petition is dismissed.  <br/> <br/><strong>            Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Account of Mr. Jaharlal Shaha taking the chance of forgery and false persuasion.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>      The Police after investigation submitted charge-sheet accusing accused opposite parties under Sections 409, 408, 471, 109 of the Penal Code and section 5(2) of Act II of 1947.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>      Eventually, the case was taken up for trial by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fifth Court and Special Judge, Dhaka who also framed charge under the aforesaid Provisions and then by the impugned order dated 20-08-1991 stopped the proceedings and released the accused opposite parties under Section 339C(4) of the Code as the stipulated period for concluding trial was elapsed.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>      Feeling aggrieved the petitioner preferred the instant revision for revival of the case under Section 339D(1) (b) of the Code.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>      The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State-petitioner seeks to impeach the impugned order on three fold arguments:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong><u>Firstly:</u></strong> Most of the time were allowed on the prayer of the accused-opposite parties on all false pleas to intentionally pass time for the trial as contemplated under section 339 C(4) of the Code.<br/><strong><u>Secondly:</u></strong> The State was always ready and willing to conclude the trial within the specified period as provided under the law but due to the non-co-operation of the opposite parties the time limit ran out.<br/><strong><u>Thirdly:</u></strong> In order to secure ends of justice the case is required to be revived.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>7.</strong>      No one appears on behalf of the accused opposite parties to oppose the Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>      In order to appreciate her submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to her submissions.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>      On going to the materials on record it transpires that the accused-opposite parties were being tried by the learned Judge, under Sections 409, 408, 471, 109 of the Penal Code and section 5(2) of Act II of 1947 in Special Case no. 159 of 1983 and eventually by the impugned order dated 20-08-1991 the learned Judge stopped the proceedings and released the accused-opposite parties under Section 339C(4) of the Code as the stipulated period for concluding trial was expired.  Afterwards the State, represented by the Solicitor preferred the instant Revision for revival of the case under Section 339D(1) (b) of the Code.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    The Provisions of new section 339D of the Code for revival of the case was inserted by Section 3 of Ordinance no. XXVIII of 1986 which reads as hereunder:<br/><br/>3. Insertion of a new section 339D, Act V of 1898.- In the said Code, after section 339C, the following new section shall be inserted, namely:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>" 339D, Revival of cases-(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 339C, any proceedings in respect of the trial of a case stopped under sub-section (4) of that section shall be revived, if an application for such revival is made by the Government to the Court, where such proceedings were pending on the date they were stopped within ninety days from that date; and the proceedings thus revived shall continue from the stage at which they were stopped;    </em><br/><em>Provided that where such Court is not in existence or has no jurisdiction to try the case for any reason the application for such revival shall be made to the Court which has jurisdiction to try such case.           </em><br/><em>(2) Where any proceedings are revived under sub-section (1), the accused in the case shall, if he is accused of a non-bailable offence, be released on bail to the satisfaction of the Court unless for reasons to be recorded in writing the Court otherwise directs.</em><br/><em>(3) Where any proceedings are revived under sub-section (1), the trial of the case after such revival shall be concluded within the time specified in sub-section (1), or sub-section (2) of 339C, as the case may be,</em><br/><em>(4) If the trial of a case after revival cannot be concluded within the specified time, further proceedings in respect of the trial of the revived case we shall stand stopped and the accused persons released.</em><br/><em>(5) In this section, in determining the time for the purpose of trial.-</em><br/><em>(a) the date of revival of a case shall be deemed to be the date on which the case is received for trial; and</em><br/><em>(b) only the working days shall be counted. "</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    Subsequently Section 339D of the Code was substituted by Section 5 of the Ordinance XII of 1991 which reads as hereunder:  <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>5. “Act V of 1898 Hl section 339D এর সংশোধন - উক্ত</em> <em>Code এর</em> <em>section 339D এর sub-section (1), (2), এবং (3) এর পরিবর্তে নিম্নর্রপ sub-section গুলি প্রতিস্থাপিত হইবে,যথা -</em> <br/><em>″(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 339C, the Government or an aggrieved person may, on cogent grounds:-</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;

margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>8. “ Act V of 1898 এর section 339D এর সংশোধন - উক্ত</em> <em>Code এর</em> <em>section 339D এর sub-section (1), (2), এবং (3) এর পরিবর্তে নিম্নর্রপ sub-section গুলি প্রতিস্থাপিত হইবে,যথা -</em><br/><em>″(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 339C, the Government or an aggrieved person may, on cogent grounds:-</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;margin-left: 40px;"><em>(a) where the proceedings of the case were stopped and the accused person released in the Court of a Magistrate, make an application, within thirty days from the date on which the proceedings in respect of the trial of the case have been stopped, to the Sessions Judge;

margin-left: 40px;"><br/>       ৮। Act V of 1898 এর section 339D এর বিলোপ-উক্ত Code এর section 339D বিলুপ্ত হইবে।<br/>         The Provision was made in section 6 of the new Act for application of section 339D, as if it was not repealed "which reads as hereunder:<br/><em>       ৬। কতিপয় ক্ষেত্রে Act V of 1898 এর বিলুপ্ত section 339D এর প্রয়োগ। - এই আইন দ্বারা উক্ত Code এর section 339D বিলোপ সত্বেও, এই আইন বলবৎ হইবার পূর্বে section 339D এর সংশোধন পূর্ব sub-section(4) এর বিধান অনুসারে বন্ধ হইয়াছে, এমন কোন বিচার কার্যক্রম পূনর্জ্জীবিত করার জন্য দরখাস্ত দাখিল, প্রয়োজনীয় কার্যএ্রম গ্রহণ এবং উহার নিষ্পত্তি এইরুপে করা যাইবে যেন section 339C বিলুপ্ত হয় নাই।</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    The question that arises in the instant case is that during pendency of the Criminal revision before this Court the new Provisions 339D introduced by Ordinance XXVIII of 1986 was repealed by Act XLII of 1992 came into force and this being procedural law whether it will apply to a pending case.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    Sub-section (4) of section 339C of the Cr.P.C. was in the following terms before amendment by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Second Amendment) Act 1992(Act no. XLII of 1992).</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>″(4) If a trial cannot be concluded within the specified time as mentioned in sub-section (3), further proceedings in respect of the trial shall stand stopped and the accused person released. ″</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    It was provided in sub-section (3) of section 339C that if for any reason the Sessions Judge or the Additional Sessions Judge was unable to conclude the trial of the case within 240 days he shall conclude such trial within 30 days after the expiry of the specified time. In other words, the Sessions Judge or the Additional Sessions Judge was to conclude the trial within 270 working days. But sub-section (4) of section 339C has been substituted by Act XLII of 1992 which runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>″(4) If a trial cannot be concluded within the specified time, the accused in the case, if he is accused of a non-bailable offence, may be released on bail to the satisfaction of the Court, unless for reasons to be  recorded in writing, the Court otherwise directs. ″</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    Before the Code of Criminal Procedure was further amended by Act no. XLII of 1992, shortly the new Act, it was the combined effect of all the sub-sections of section 339C and 339D of the Code that a trial of a sessions case had to be concluded within 240 days. With an additional grace of 30 days, where-after, as per sub-section (4) of section 339C of the Code, "further proceedings in respect of the trial shall stand stopped and the accused person released". That was the right which the appellant was seeking to pursue, but that right was not an absolute one. Under section 339D of the Code the proceedings could be revived upon a prayer from the prosecution within a stated period. The whole purpose of un-amended section 339C of the Code was to whip up the prosecution and activse the trial Court so as not to delay the trial of a case unnecessarily. It was also not a signal to the defence to resort to all manners of delaying tactics to get out of the trial net. The stopping of a case and the release of an accused would rouse the prosecution from its slumber and would necessarily subject it to an accountability. The purpose was not to give the accused a right not to be tried any more on the same charge or a clean bill of acquittal, even if he was accused of a heinous crime. Stoppage of the trial did not mean an end of the woes of the accused. A revival would revive his woes.        <br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    By the new Act the period of trial was extended to 360 days. By deleting sub-section (3) of section 339C of the Code the grace period of 30 days was done away with and by substituting sub-section (4) of section 339C of the Code with a new sub-section (4) the proceedings cannot be stopped now and the accused can now only obtain bail to the satisfaction of the Court with the expiry of 360 days, if the trial has not been concluded. Section 339D of the Code has been repealed. The position now is, no stoppage, no revival.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    The legal position of an amendment in procedural law has been aptly summed up by SA Rahman J, ( as his Lordships then was) in the case of Md. Aslam vs. State 19 DLR (SC) 242 in the following words:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>″ ….. When the law is altered during the pendency of an action, the rights of the parties are to be decided according to the law as it existed when the action was begun, unless the new statute shows a clear intention to vary such rights. Where the legislature has made its intention clear that the amending Act should have retrospective operation, there is no doubt that it must be so construed, even though the consequences may entail hardship to a party. But even without express words to that effect, retrospective effect may be given to an amending law, if the new law manifests such a necessary intendment. With regard to the procedural laws, the general principle is that alterations in procedure are retrospective unless there be some good reason against such a view. If a statute deals merely with the procedure in an action, and does not affect the rights of the parties, it will be held to apply prima facie, to all actions pending aswellas future. It is only if it be more than a mere matter of procedure, that is, if it touches a right in existence at the passing of new Act, that the aggrieved party would be entitled to succeed in giving a successful challenge to the retrospective effect of the Act….. ".</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    We are in respectful agreement with the afore quoted summing-up of the law on the subject.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    The new Act was not given a retrospective effect, but inspite of repeal of section 339D of the Code (provision of revival of a stopped proceeding), provision was made in section 6 of the new Act for application of section 339D of the Code, as if it was not repealed, when, before the coming into force of the new Act,( i.e. on the 1<sup>st</sup> November, 1992), a proceeding was already stopped under the unamended provision of sub-section (4) of section 339C of the Code. If a proceeding is now stopped after the coming into force of the new Act either by the High Court Division or by this Court, the prosecution will not have any corresponding right of revival of the proceeding under the repealed provision of section 339D of the Code. The accused appellant will be scot free and no proceeding can be continued against him without a fresh complaint or First Information Report. It is therefore to be borne in mind that under the unamended provision of sub-section (4) of section 339C of the Code, the accused did not enjoy an unqualified right or privilege or facility of stoppage of proceeding and release if the trial could not be completed within 270 days. His right was commensurate with the right of the prosecution to revive the prosecution. It cannot be the intention of the new Act that it is only the accused who will carry prospectively, in spite of the amendment, his right of stoppage of proceeding and release, while the prosecution will prospectively lose its right of revival. The new Act has effected a change in the procedural law, but it has not affected any vested right of the accused and the prosecution, because the accused had not in fact any absolute and vested right of stoppage and release. It was fettered and chained with the prosecution’s right to revive the proceeding. Now both the corresponding rights are gone. No one can complain of any loss thereby. By necessary intendment of any Act will be retrospective in operation in so far as sub-section (4) of section 339C and 339D of the Code of the new Act are concerned. Those will apply to pending cases.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    On meticulous examination of the record we find that the impugned order was passed on 20-08-1991 and the instant revision was filed in the year 1991 upon which the Rule was issued on 01-12-1991. Therefore, the same will attract section 6 of the Act XLII of 1992, consequently the Special Case no. 159 of 1983 will be revived. Thus the Rule have merit succeeds.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>    In view of foregoing narrative the Rule is made absolute. The Special Case no. 159 of 1993 pending in the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Fifth Court, and Special Judge, Dhaka stands revived and the same shall proceed in accordance with law and in the light of observations made above.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>    In view of the facts this is an old case of 1983, the learned Special Judge is directed to dispose of the case within six months from date.<br/> <br/>         Office is directed to communicate the order at once.<br/> <br/><strong>         Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
