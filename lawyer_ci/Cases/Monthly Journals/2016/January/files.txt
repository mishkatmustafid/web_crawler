Iqbal Kabir, J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This appeal has been presented, at the instance of the Plaintiff/Appellant against the judgment and decree dated 31.03.2011 passed by the Judge of the Artho Rin Adalat, Chittagong in Artho Rin Suit No. 33 of 2010.<br/><br/>The facts relevant for disposal of the appeal are that the plaintiff is a Bank and it has Banking business. On the other hand defendant-respondent No. 1 is a business   Enterprise and the defendant No. 2 is the owner of the said business and defendant No. 3 is the guarantor who deposited the mortgage property as collateral security against the loan.<br/><br/>The plaintiff sanctioned Tk. 14,10,00,000/- in favour of the defendants’ respondents against L/C and TR facilities as per the application dated 20-02-06. The plaintiff after considering the application allowed the same on 06-03-06. Defendant No. 2 and 3 understood the condition laid down in the sanction letter issued by the Bank  and which along with interest charges at agreed rate stood the claim of the suit. Against the aforesaid loan the defendant No. 2 executed various charge documents and deposited the same to the Bank. The land described in the schedule-1 and title deed described in schedule-2 deposited as collateral security by the defendant No. 3. In support of the mortgage the defendant No.3 on 21-03-06 executed a registered mortgage deed being No.966 and a Power of Attorney. Thereafter, on 12-03-08 the defendant applied to adjust the liability against the loan and the plaintiff Bank also agreed the same and on 02-04-08 issued a consent letter. However, the defendant failed to adjust the liability as a result the plaintiff Bank cancelled installment facility vide letter dated 02-07-09.  The plaintiff issued several remainder letters to pay the loan amount against which on 24-12-09 defendant No. 2 issued a cheque being No. 0245076 amount of Tk. 15,75,36,960/ in favour of the plaintiff that is AB Bank Limited, Export Processing Zone Branch, Chittagong. The said defendant also assured that if the cheque be placed for encashment the money would be paid. Subsequently the cheque was deposited but, it was dishonored as a result the plaintiff through his lawyer issued legal notice and finally filed a Case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. As per the regular assessment against the account under L/C and TR facilities defendant failed to adjust the liability and the plaintiff  is entitled to recover loan through legal process and hence this suit.<br/><br/>The suit was contested by the defendants by filing written statement, denying all material assertion as set out in the plaint contending, inter alia, that the defendants with good reputation doing their business and they have good relation with the Bank and others. Under L/C and TR facilities defendant No. 2 imported 3000 Mt sugar on behalf of the defendant No. 1. They  have already made a payment of Tk. 1,41,00,000/- as 10% margin and after selling 800 MT sugar paid Tk. 4,04,04,400/-  but remaining amount of Tk. 8,64,56,000/- was unpaid. During Emergency period on 1.11.2007 a criminal case was lodged against the defendant No. 2 under section 25(1) of the Special Powers Act-1974 as a result the said sugar has been damaged causing huge loss to the defendant and thereby he was not in a position to repay the loan. However, to recover the said loss the defendant has taken initiative against the government. As such the defendant prays to remit the interest and for an adjustment of the loan amount vide three monthly installments spread over 20 years.<br/><br/>The learned Judge of the trial court framed 8 issues including 4 additional issues and examined one witnesses on behalf of the plaintiff and one witness on behalf of the defendants and by the impugned judgment decreed the suit in part.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the impugned judgment and decree the plaintiff appellant preferred the instant Appeal.<br/>Mr. Najmul Karim the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that trial Court erred in law in passing the impugned judgment and decree. He submits that the Artho Rin Adalat Ain does not allow the Court to remit the interest upon invoking jurisdiction under section 57 of this Act. He submits that section 18 of this Act do not allow the defendant to claim set-off or counter claim. Accordingly the borrower defendant is barred to include set-off or counter claim in the written statement. As a result the Court has no scope and jurisdiction to entertain any counter claim and thereby set-off any amount from the claim of any suit. He further submits that Artho Rin Adalat Ain has been created by special enactment only for recovery of defaulted loan. It has no power to adjudicate any other matters. Since defendant has taken the loan and in his testimony acknowledged the entire loan facilities and as such the trial Court has no scope to pass a partial decree.<br/><br/>He further submits that in view of section 50 of this Act, Court has no jurisdiction to reduce or remit any interest which has lawfully imposed against any loan. He submits that appellant is entitled to recover the loan through legal process and as such the judgment and decree is liable to be modified and a decree may be passed in full for the entire claim of the plaintiff.<br/><br/>Ms. Afroza Najneen Akhter learned Advocate appearing for the defendants submits that the suit is premature as because without complying the provision laid down under section 12 of the Artho Rin Adalot Ain, the Bank cannot file the suit, if file it would be premature and the trial court has rightly held that the suit is premature. She further submits that since the imported goods were under the custody of the plaintiff  and it was retained as pledge therefore the plaintiff  had to comply the procedure as laid down under section 12 of the Artho Rin Adalot Ain before filing a suit. She further submits that the imported Sugar was in the custody of the Bank as a result the Bank is responsible to sell it out before filing the suit. She further submits the plaintiff without disclosing the entire fact filed this suit which is also a violation of the provision of section 8 (Ga) of the said Act. Trial Court committed gross illegality in decreeing the suit without considering the above provision of law.<br/><br/>In reply the learned Advocate  for the appellant  has taken us to the plaint where it has clearly been stated that  “বাদীর সর্বাত্মক প্রচেষ্টা স্বত্বেও বিবাদীগন ঋণের টাকা আদায় না করায় এবং বন্ধকী সম্পত্তি পত্রিকায় নিলাম বিজ্ঞপ্তির মাধ্যমে বিক্রী না হওয়ায় বাদীকে আদালতের আশ্রয় গ্রহন করিতে হইল। বিবাদীগন বাদীর পাওনা টাকার জন্য আইনতঃ দায়ি হন।"<strong> A</strong>part from that in reply to the contention of the plaint, the defendant  in their written statement admitted that they took loan and some portion of loan amount has been repaid but due to the criminal case the alleged goods were damaged and they suffered huge loss. For which the government is responsible, and they have taken initiative against the government.<br/><br/>Plaintiff clearly speak that  the plaintiff has complied the provision and procedure laid down under section 12 of the said Act before filing of the suit .The document (Ext-10-10/a) that is a letter of Agreement wherein the defendant acknowledged plaintiffs right to cancel any or all the loan(s) of credit at anytime with or without prior notice to the defendant and defendant also undertake to pay you on demand all outstanding balances together with accrued interest and charges,” clearly speaks about the position of the defendant in the loan proceedings.<br/><br/>General Letter of Trust Receipt dated 06-03-06 (Ext 3/d) shows that the defendant also agreed by saying that “ It is also expressly agreed that so long as any goods of which you have allowed us to take delivery, but for which we have not paid, remain in our possession or under our control, you hold a lien on the same and are at liberty, at our expense, if you think fit to do so to re-take possession of the same without any notice or reference to our consent, from us, and to remove the same or any part thereof from the place where they have been stored to any other place you may choose and place the same under the care of any one you may select and to dispose of them by sale or otherwise as you may think necessary.” and further said “ We quite understand and agree that the handing to us of any shipping Document or Documents as above mentioned is entirely at your option and does not in any way alter or affect our personal liability or your rights under any other security or documents (s) you may hold.” From the above documents defendant has acknowledged his rights and responsibilities in the loan proceedings.<br/>He further submits that the plaintiff is not responsible to sell out the goods and the document will further shows that the goods were not in possession of the plaintiff and as per the procedure of hypothetical mortgage the bank will keep the documents not the goods. In fact the goods were under the custody of the defendant. The letter written by M/S Khan Enterprise dated 20.07.2008 (Ext-A) to the plaintiff will affirm the said contention.<br/><br/>He further submits that the defendant also prayed to re-schedule the loan amount and accordingly it was made. Even after that the defendant failed to do so. The above submission and document shows that the plaintiff has complied the provision of law and defendant is a defaulter and responsible to pay the entire amount of loan including the interest.     <br/> <br/>We have gone through the evidences on record, heard the learned Advocate for the parties and examined the relevant law, facts and circumstances.<br/><br/>Section 12 of the অর্থ ঋণ আদালত আইন, ২০০৩ (২০০৩ সনের ৮ নং আইন) speaks that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>১২। (১) উপ- ধারা (২) এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, কোন আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান, উহার নিজ দখল বা নিয়ন্ত্রতে থাকা বিবাদীর কোন সম্পত্তি যাহা পণ বা বন্ধক (lien or pledge)  রাখিয়া  ঋণ প্রদান করা হইয়াছে, এবং যাহা বিক্রয় করিবার আইনগত অধিকার বাদীষ রহিয়াছে বা বাদীকে অর্পণ করা হইয়াছে, উহা বিক্রয় না করিয়া এবং বিক্রয়লব্ধ  অর্থ ঋণ পরিশোধ  বাবদ সমন্বয় না করিয়া, অর্থ ঋণ আদালতে কোন মামলা দায়ের করিবে না।<br/><br/>(২) উপ-ধারা (১) এর বিধান সত্ত্বেও , কোন আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান নিজ দখল বা নিয়ন্ত্রণে থাকা পণ বা বন্ধকী সম্পত্তি বিক্রয় না করিয়া মামলা দায়ের করিসে অনতিবিলমেব উক্ত সম্পত্তি পূর্ব- বর্ণিত মতে বিক্রয় করিয়া বিক্রয়লব্ধ অর্থ  ঋণের সহিত সমন্বয় করিবে এবং বিষয়টি আদালতকে লিখিতভাবে অবহিত করিবে।<br/><br/>(৩) কোন আর্থিক প্রতষ্ঠিান, বিবাদীর নিকট হইতে কোন স্থাবর সম্পত্তি (Immovable property)  বন্ধক (Mortgage) রাখিয়া অথবা অস্থাবর সম্পত্তি (Movable property) দায়বদ্ধ ষবভগঁব (Hypothecated)  ঋণ ভত্তপবব খভষলস ঐযযিভ্রখ ভত্তপবব যব পবঁযল্ড ষবগ্বষ ঢ়লঁ  বন্ধকী বা দায়বদ্ধ সম্পত্তি বিক্রয়ের ক্ষমতা ১ [***]আর্থিক প্রতষ্ঠানকে প্রদান করা হইয়া থাকিলে, উহা বিক্রয় না করিয়া এবং বিক্রয়লব্ধ অর্থ ঋণ পরিশোধ বাবদ ঢ়লন্বয় না করিয়া, অথবা বিক্রয়ের চেষ্টা করিয়া ব্যথ- না হইয়, অর্থ ঋণ আদালতে কোন মামলা দায়ের করিবে না।<br/><br/>(৪) উপ-ধারা (৩) এ উল্লিখিত বিক্রয়ের ক্ষেত্রে আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান এই আইনের ধারা ৩৩ এর উপ-ধারা (১)(২)ও (৩) এর বিধান, যতদূর সম্ভব, অনুসরণ করিবে।<br/>...<br/>(৬) কোন আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান উপ-ধারা (২) ও (৩) এর বিধান পালন না করিলে, আদালত স্ব-উদ্যোগে অথবা দায়িকের লিখিত আবেদনক্রমে, ডিক্রী প্রদান করিবার  সময় উক্ত আর্থিক  প্রতিষ্ঠান কর্তৃক উক্ত সম্পত্তির প্রদর্শিত মূল্যায়নের, যদি থাকে, সমপরিমাব অর্থ মামলার দাবী হইতে বাদ দিয়া ডিক্রী প্রদান করিবে এবং প্রদর্শিত মূল্য না থাকিলে, আদালতে, সম্পত্তির স্থানীয় অধিক্ষেত্রের সাব-রেজিস্ট্রারের প্রতিবেদন গ্রহণ করিয়া, মূল্য নির্ধারণ করিবে এবং নিধারিত উক্ত মূল্যেষ সমপরিমাণ অর্থ মামলার দাবী  হইতে বাদ দিয়া ডিক্রী প্রদান করিবে।<br/><br/>(৭) উপ-ধারা (৬) এর অধীন যে সম্পত্তির নির্ধারিত মূল্য মামলার দাবী হইতে বাদ দিয়া ডিক্রী প্রদান করা হইবে, উক্ত সম্পত্তির মালিকানা ধারা ৩৩ এর উপ-ধারা (৭) এর বিধানের অনুরুপ পদ্ধতিতে আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠানের অনুকূলে ন্যস্ত হইবে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The relevant provisions of the aforesaid Act shows that the Bank need/ exhaust  the procedure laid down under section 12(1) (2) (3) of the aforesaid Act before filing the suit. If plaintiff Bank does not follow the above procedure then the procedure also laid down in the section 12(6) and (7) of the said Ain will come into operation. <br/> <br/>We have gone through the provision of Artho Rin Adalat Ain specially the section 8(a) 12, 18, 47 and 50 of the said Act and found that no violation made by the plaintiff appellant. On our careful scrutiny and in view of the above submission, examination of evidence as well as the legal position we are of the view that after fulfilling the entire legal requirement the plaintiff has filed the suit.  The defendant acknowledged the entire loan facilities and they have adjusted only a small portion of the said loan and at the time of State Emergency a case was lodged against the defendant No. 2 under section 25(1) of the Special Powers Act-1974 as a result he suffered huge damage to the storage Sugar and it went out dated of sell, causing huge loss in his business and thus his financial capability to repay or adjust the loan with interest come to and end.  Although it has proved that due to the State Emergency the damage has been taken place and the defendant suffered a huge loss but in such a situation there is no provision in the Artho Rin Adalat Ain to remit any interest. Anyway to ensure justice the court exercised the inherent power as per section 57 of the Artho Rin Adalat Ain and decreed the suit in part in favour of the plaintiff and decreeing only to recover the reaming loan amount without interest.<br/> <br/>Section 50 of the Artho Rin Adalat Ain runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“সুদ, মুনাফা সম্পর্কিত বিধানঃ (১) ধারা ৪৭ এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, এই আাইনের আধীন কোন আদালত, ঋণ প্রদানের দিবস হইতে মামলা দায়েরের দিবস পর্যন্ত সময়কালে কোন ঋণের উপর আার্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান কর্তক আাইনানুগভাবে ধার্যকৃত সুদ, বা, ক্ষেত্রমত, মুনাফা বা ভাড়া- হ্রাস, মাফ বা নামঞ্জুর করিতে পারিবে না।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(২)   অর্থঋণ আাদালত কর্তৃক প্রদত্ত ডিত্র্রীর বিরুদ্ধে বিবাদী-দায়িক পক্ষ কোন আপীল, রিভিশন, আপীল বিভাগে আপীল বা অন্য কোনরুপ দরখাস¹ কোন উচ্চতর আদালতের দায়ের না করিলে, মামলা দায়েরের দিবস হইতে ডিত্র্রীর টাকা আদায় হইবার দিবস পর্যন্ত সময়ের জন্য ডিত্র্রীকৃত টাকার উপর [ ১২% (বার শতাংশ) ] বার্ষিক সরল হারে, কোন আাপীল, রিভিশন বা অন্য কোন দরখাস্ত কোন উচ্চতর আদালতে দায়ের  করিলে পূর্বোক্ত সময়কালের জন্য [ ১৬% (ষোল শতাংশ )] বার্ষিক সরল হারে, এবং আপীল বা উচ্চতর আদালতের ডিত্র্রী বা আদেশের বিরুদ্ধে আপীল বিভাগে আপীল করিলে, পূর্বোক্ত সময়কালের জন্য ১৮% (আাঠার শতাংশ) বার্ষিক সরল হারে, উপ-ধারা (৩) এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, সুদ,বা ক্ষেত্রমত, মুনাফা আরোপিত হইবে।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(৩)   উপ-ধারা (২) এর বিধান সত্তেও উচ্চতর আদালতে আপীল, রিভিশন, আপীল বিভাগে আপীল বা অন্য কোন দরখাস্তে আপীলকৃত বা বিতর্কিত ডিত্র্রী বা আদেশের গুণগত পরিবর্তন করিয়া কোন আদেশ বা ডিত্র্রী প্রদান করিলে, উক্ত আদালত, উপরি-উল্লিখিত সংশ্লিষ্ট বর্ধিত সুদ বা মুনাফার হার আপীল বা দরখাস্তকারীর ক্ষেত্রে প্রযোজ্য হইবে না মর্মে আাদেশ প্রদান করিতে পারিবে।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In pursuance to the above section of the Artho Rin Adalat Ain the legislature has given clear mandate enabling the plaintiff Bank to claim interest forming part of the principal amount as per the agreed contract of loan. In this case we found that the court has exercised his inherent power, though this court has no jurisdiction to do so or entrusted any power to waive any interest accrued. In this enactment there is a specific provision to recover the default loan and interest. The court has to follow the procedure laid down therein; it cannot overlook the provision laid down there.<br/><br/>We have perused the impugned Judgment and decree passed by the learned Judge Artho Rin Adalot, Chittagong in Artho Rin Suit No. 33 of 2010 and upon overall consideration of the entire matter we find that the trial court committed illegality in decreeing the suit in part. We find substance in the appeal.<br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed.<br/><br/>The impugned judgment and decree dated 31.03.2011 passed by the Judge, Artho Rin Adalot, Chittagong in Artho Rin Suit No. 33 of 2010 is set aside and the suit is decreed as per the claim of the plaintiff.<br/><br/>Let the lower Court record along with the copy of this Judgment be transmitted down and the order also be communicated to the authority concern at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Hence, the suit.<br/><br/>Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 contested the suit by filing a joint written statement denying material allegations made in the plaint and contending interalia that Golapi Dasi acquired title in suit land as stridhan property; After expiry of Golapi Dasi, her daughter Shibani Basu inherited the same as per Dayabagha School of law; During possession, Shibani Basu proposed to sell the land and defendant nos. 1 and 2 agreed to purchase the same and paid consideration money by installments; Shibani Basu executed and registered two kabalas both dated 23.09.1995; Since then defendants are in possession of the land; Shibani Basu was not suffering from insanity rather she was all along a normal and intelligent lady; Suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>After hearing the parties and assessing evidence on record, learned Assistant Judge decreed the suit on contest against defendant nos. 1 and 2 and exparte against the rest by his judgment and decree dated 27.12.1987.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved, defendants as appellants filed Civil Appeal No. 75 of 1988 in the Court of learned District Judge, Bagerhat. On transfer the appeal was heard and disposed of by the learned Subordinate Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Bagerhat, who after hearing the parties and reassessing evidence on record allowed the appeal vide judgment and decree dated 14.05.2001 by setting aside judgment and decree passed by the learned Assistant Judge.<br/><br/>Having aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree, plaintiff-respondent as petitioner preferred this revisional application under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the present rule alongwith an order of status-quo.<br/><br/>Mr. M. A. Azim Khair, learned advocate appearing for the petitioner submits that the court below committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in disbelieving advocate commissioner’s report and his testimony as PW 2 without assigning any reason. He also submits that learned Subordinate Judge arrived at a finding relating to possession of defendants in the suit land quoting cross examination of PW 5 that he stated there are houses in the suit land belonged to defendants but from testimony of the PW.5 it is evident that learned Subordinate Judge misread the evidence of PW.5 as such, impugned judgment and decree is liable to be set aside. He further submits that plaintiff described schedule of the land in accordance with provisions of order 7 rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure and as such, trial court rightly decreed the suit. In support of his submissions, learned advocate referred to the case of Naresh Chandra Das and others-Vs- Nirmal Chandra Das and others, reported in AIR 1989 ORISSA 248.<br/><br/>On the other hand Mr. Abdul Hye Sarker, learned advocate appearing for the opposite party nos.1 and 2 submits that appellate court below after reassessing evidence on record rightly and legally arrived at a finding that plaintiff- petitioner failed to prove his possession in the suit land. He also submits that suit schedule land as described in the plaint is not in accordance with provisions of order 7 rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure as such, suit for permanent injunction on an unspecified and undemarcated land is not maintainable. He further submits that since disputed question of title involve in the suit, plaintiff must establish his title by filing a regular suit for title. In support of his submissions, learned advocate referred to the case of Barada Sundari Paul and others-Vs- The Assistant Custodian, Enemy Property (Land and Buildings), Comilla and others, reported in 15 BLD(AD)95; the case of Mati Lal Karmakar and another-Vs- Kalandar Talukder and another, reported in 20 BLD186 and the case of Rafizuddin Ahmed-Vs- Mongla Barman and others, reported in 43 DLR (AD)215.<br/><br/>Heard the learned advocates. Perused revisional application, judgment of the courts below alongwith lower courts record and decisions cited by the learned advocates.<br/><br/>On perusal of the record, it appears that plaintiff stated in his plaint that his mother was suffering from insanity and he was at Dhaka for business purpose and taking advantage of the situation, defendants created two kabalas by misleading his insane mother Shibani Basu which were never acted upon and as such those kabalas are not binding upon him. It is also stated in the plaint that he recovered possession of the suit land with the help of local police. On perusal of advocate commissioner’s report, it appears that advocate commissioner categorically stated that plaintiff has been residing in the houses situated in the suit land with his wife and three minor children. Advocate Commissioner inspected the suit land in presence of local elites and examined as PW 2. It is also evident from written objection filed by defendant nos. 1 and 2 against local inspection report that defendants are residing in Khulna town, not in the suit land. In such circumstances, I am of the opinion that learned Subordinate Judge committed illegality in disbelieving Advocate Commissioner’s report terming the same exparte and not based on fact without assigning any reason in arriving at such a finding. On perusal of the testimony of PW.5, I find substance in the submission of learned advocate for the petitioner that finding of the appellate court below relating to possession based on misreading and non consideration of the evidence on record.<br/><br/>Now remains the point whether injunction can be granted on the schedule described in the plaint. It appears from the schedule that the plaintiff mentioned plot numbers and total quantum of land against those plots which tallies with khatian no.1359 marked as exhibit in the suit. Order 7 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“3. Where the subject matter of the suit is immovable property, the plaint shall contain a description of the property sufficient to identify it, and, in case such property can be identified by boundaries or numbers in a record of settlement of survey, the plaint shall specify such boundaries or numbers”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From plain reading of order 7 rule 3 it appears that requirement of law is that the property should be identified by boundaries or numbers. When the plots are identified by numbers, boundaries are not necessary.  The identifiable plot numbers having been given with total quantum of land against each plot in the schedule of plaint, there is no difficulty in identifying land of the plots. I find support of this view in the case of Naresh Chandra Das and others-Vs- Nirmal Chandra Das and others, reported in AIR 1989 ORISSA 248, wherein his lordship held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Order 7 rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure requires that where the property involved in the suit is immovable, the plaint shall contain a description of the property sufficient to identify it, and, in case of such property can be identified by boundaries or numbers in a record of settlement or survey, the plaint shall specify such boundaries or numbers. As the requirement of the rule itself shows giving boundary of the land is not essential if the survey number or plot number which makes the plot identifiable is given and necessarily a suit cannot be dismissed merely because the boundary is not stated though the identifying plot number is given”.   </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In view of the decision referred above, argument of the learned Advocate for the opposite parties that the trial court granted injunction on an unspecified and undemarcated land does not hold water.<br/><br/>Under the facts and circumstances of the case and for the reasons stated above, I am of the view that appellate court below committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in passing the impugned judgment and decree which is based on misreading and non consideration of the evidence on record.<br/><br/>Facts and circumstances of the cases cited by the learned advocate for opposite parties are quite distinguishable from the facts and circumstances of the case in hand.<br/><br/>In the result, Rule is made absolute without any order as to cost.<br/><br/>Judgment and decree dated 14.05.2001 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Bagerhat, in Title Appeal No. 75 of 1988, is set aside and the judgment and decree dated 27.12.1987 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Fakirhat, Bagerhat, in Title Suit No. 424 of 1983, is restored.<br/><br/>Order of status-quo granted at the time of issuance of the rule is hereby vacated.<br/><br/>Send down lower courts record alongwith a copy of this judgment to the court concern at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"> </div></div></div></div>

There is no exhaustive list of special circumstances and special reasons. According to this Court  “Cases may vary, situation may vary and the scale  and parameter of complete justice also vary. Sometimes it may be justice according to law, sometimes it may be justice  according to fairness, equity and good conscience, sometimes it may be justice tempered with mercy, sometimes it may be pure commonsense, sometimes it may be  the  inference of an ordinary reasonable man and so on”. . . . (21)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 104</strong><br/><strong>The power under Article 104 being an extra ordinary power is  conferred on  the Apex Court of the country  to do complete justice but it cannot all together ignore the substantive provision of statute. . . .(23)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 104</strong><br/><strong>The power of this  Court  to do complete justice  invoking  Article 104 of the Constitution  cannot be availed  of to fill up the lacuna of the petitioner’s case or to  ignore the express statutory provisions or the vested rights of the respondents which they have   acquired by lapse of time cannot be taken away under the guise of complete justice. Therefore the irresistible conclusion is that when a party to a proceeding, has deliberately committed a default or is guilty of laches or gross negligence, cannot be  allowed to invoke Article 104 of the Constitution for the exercise of the Supreme Court’s power and jurisdiction seeking relief in the name of complete justice. . . . (25)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Limitation Act, (IX of 1908)</strong><br/><strong>Section 3</strong><br/><strong>The true meaning of section 3 is that any suit instituted, appeal preferred and an application made after the period of the limitation as prescribed by the First Schedule shall be dismissed unless any of the provisions of sections 4 to 25 has been invoked in the facts and circumstances of a given case. . . . (26)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Limitation Act, (IX of 1908)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 3, 5, 29(2) and Article 158</strong><br/><strong>Arbitration Act, (X of 1940)</strong><br/><strong>Section 33</strong><br/><strong>The Arbitration Act, 1940, is a special law but it does not provide any  special  provision of  limitation for filing a suit, appeal, review or application rather the period of limitation  prescribed thereof by the First schedule to the Limitation Act, 1908 as contemplated in Article 158 is applicable  in the case of an application for objection under Section 33 of the Arbitration Act to set aside an award or to get an award remitted for reconsideration and as such Section 29 (2) of the Limitation Act, 1908  has no manner of application to such matters. Therefore, it is wrong to construe that the Arbitration Act, 1940 being a special law the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act is not applicable for condonation of delay in filing any application to set aside an award or to get an award remitted for reconsideration. An application for objection to challenge the existence or validity  of an award has to be filed within 30 days from the date of the service of notice of filing of the award and if filed beyond statutory period then the application for objections cannot be taken into consideration, especially in the absence of an application for condonation of delay under section 5 of the Limitation Act explaining sufficient cause for not making the application within such period.   . . .

No. 1579 of 2012 relate to Contract No. IMP 3/3/95 dated 08-0501995 and Award of the Arbitrators amounting to US$ 2,74,455.29.<br/> <br/>Mr. Murad Reza, the learned Additional Attorney General appearing for the petitioner in all the leave petitions submits that the Arbitrators committed  misconduct in passing the awards  against the petitioner- Government without considering the papers and documents filed by the petitioner and the terms and conditions of the contracts and the awards were otherwise invalid but the learned Joint District Judge erred in law in making the awards Rules of the Court and that the applications for furnishing Securities as required by law were filed on behalf of the Petitioner but the High Court Division  was pleased not to consider the applications, this Court  may interfere and set aside the judgment and order of the High Court Division and send the appeals on remand  to the  High Court Division with a direction for giving an opportunity to the  petitioner for furnishing security as provided under the law exercising the power conferred to this Court under Article 104 of the Constitution for complete justice. He submits that the High Court Division was pleased to dismiss all the appeals for the failure of the petitioner to deposit 50% of the decreetal amount as per order of the Court for condoning the delay in presenting the appeals beyond the period of limitation, this Court may interfere and accord a chance to the petitioner  to comply with the order of the High Court Division and press the appeals on merits by exercising the power of this  Court conferred by Article 104 of the Constitution for complete justice because huge amount of Government money is involved in the case. He then submits that the High Court Division erred in law in dismissing the appeals from Original decree Nos.127 and 131 of 2011 as not maintainable and incompetent because of the failure of the petitioner in depositing in the Court the amount which he was required to pay under the awards or failed to furnish securities to the satisfaction of the Court. The learned Additional Attorney General finally submits that the High Court Division was pleased to observe that the appellant having received  the courts notice on 17.02.2005 filed the written objection on 25.08.2005 after the statutory period of limitation which is barred as per provisions of Article 158 of the Limitation Act,1908 this Court may accord a chance to the petitioner by exercising the powers conferred to this Court under Article 104 of the Constitution for complete justice and as such this Court be pleased enough to grant leave against the aforesaid judgment and order.<br/> <br/>Mr. Habibul Islam Bhuyan, the learned Senior Advocate for the respondents submits that there is no illegality in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and as such no interference is called for by this Court. He then submits that the amount of money required to be paid under the awards or any security to be  furnished to the satisfaction of the Court for the payment of  such sum of  money as awards or for the fulfillment  of any other obligation by him under the awards as contemplated under the proviso to Section 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 is a condition precedent for entertainment of an application under section 33 challenging the award and that without such deposit it is to be construed that there was  no application in the eye of law. He then submits that in the facts and circumstances of the cases there is no scope for sending the Appeals on remand to the High Court Division with a direction for giving an opportunity to the petitioner for furnishing security as contemplated in the proviso to Section 33 of the Act, 1940 invoking the powers of this Division under Article 104 of the Constitution for doing complete justice and as such these leave petitions are liable to be dismissed.     <br/> <br/>We have heard the learned Additional Attorney General for the petitioner and the learned Senior Advocate for the respondents and perused the leave petitions, impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and other materials on record. <br/> <br/>Since common questions of law and facts are involved in all the leave petitions, for the sake of brevity, we are discussing only the C.P. No. 1578 of 2012 in details. In this case the respondent having supplied 20,000 metric tons of parboiled rice at the rate of US $ 259.98 per metric ton claimed payment of US $ 4, 74,814.09 but the petitioner raised a dispute for short supply of the consignment and the dispute was referred to an Arbitral Tribunal consisting of two Arbitrators. The petitioners raised a counter- claim of US$ 78,486.59. The Arbitrators after hearing both the parties passed a unanimous award amounting to US $ 1,52,566.60 at the rate of “Tk. 36 per One US Dollar’’ allowing the respondent-seller’s claim on 12.09.2004.  The respondent filed an application under Section 14 of the Arbitration Act 1940 before the First Court of Joint District Judge, Dhaka praying for a direction upon the Arbitrators to cause the award to be filed in the Court for making the same rule of the Court.  This was registered as Title Suit No. 18 of 2005. Though the petitioner received the Court’s notice on 17.02.2005 yet written statement and written objection under sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 were filed on 28.05.2005 which was long after the period of limitation.  The petitioner filed Arbitration Miscellaneous Case No. 79 of 2005 under Sections 30 and 33 of the Act challenging the award after the period of limitation. These cases were heard analogously and the learned Joint District Judge by a common judgment and decree dated 28.03.2007 decreed the Title Suit 18 of 2005 making the award amounting to US$ 1,52,516.66 rule of the Court in modified form striking out the words “@ Tk. 36 per one US Dollar” from the operative part of the order of the award under section 15 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 and dismissed the Arbitration Miscellaneous Case No. 79 of 2005.<br/> <br/>Admittedly, after service of the Court’s notice on 17.02.2005 upon the petitioner, written statement and written objection were filed on their behalf long after the statutory period of limitation on 25.08.2005 and the Arbitration Miscellaneous Case No.79 of 2005 was filed on 28.08.2005. It appears that the High Court Division having considered the relevant provisions of law  and the reported decisions of Cases  rightly observed that the Government-petitioner failed to deposit the required amount under the award or failed to furnish security to the satisfaction of the Court for the payment of such sum of money as the deposit contemplated under the law is a condition precedent for entertainment of the application challenging the award and without deposit it is to be construed that there was no application in the eye of law and as such the application filed by the defendant-petitioner before the trial Court is non-existent in the eye of law and the learned Joint District  Judge rightly rejected the  written objection.  It appears that the defendant-petitioner at the time of filing of the  application for objection  under section 33 of the Arbitration Act,1940  challenging the award did not make any deposit nor furnished any security  as was required  under  the proviso to Section 33 of the Arbitration Act  and that rendered the  application  under Section 33 of the Arbitration Act a nullity in the eye of law for non-compliance  with the  aforesaid provision of law and the learned Joint District  Judge rightly held that the default  of the petitioner in making the deposit of the  amount as required under the award or furnishing the security to the satisfaction of the Court in compliance with the proviso to Section 33 of the  Act rendered the    application for challenging the award  under section 33 of the Arbitration Act as non -existent in the eye of law.<br/> <br/>In the instant Cases, admittedly, the petitioner failed to deposit in the Court the amount which it was required to pay under the awards or failed to furnish securities for the payment of such sums as contemplated in the proviso to Section 33 of the Arbitration Act. It appears from the judgment of the High Court Division that when the petitioner’s notice was brought to the situation that no deposit was made in the trial Court nor in the High Court Division at the time of filing of the appeals the petitioner filed separate applications   in all these appeals seeking permission to furnish securities which were not allowed by the High Division as the said applications were hopelessly barred by limitation under Article 158 of the Limitation Act. 1908 which provides that the period of limitation to challenge the validity of the award is 30 days from the date of service of the notice of filing of the award. The petitioner invoked Article 104 of the Constitution seeking complete justice for sending the appeals on remand to the High Court Division with a direction for giving an opportunity to the petitioner for furnishing a security incompliance with the proviso to Section 33 of the Arbitration Act and also to allow the petitioner to press the appeals on merit by exercising powers of this Court conferred by Article 104 of the Constitution for complete justice. Article 104 of the Constitution confers extraordinary powers on this Court to do complete justice between the parties under special circumstances and for special reasons. There is no exhaustive list of special circumstances and special reasons. According to this Court “Cases may vary, situation may vary and the scale and parameter of complete justice also vary. Sometimes it may be justice according to law, sometimes it may be justice  according to fairness, equity and good conscience, sometimes it may be justice tempered with mercy, sometimes it may be pure commonsense, sometimes it may be  the  inference of an ordinary reasonable man and so on”. [ National Board of Revenue –Vs-  Nasrin Banu, 48 DLR(AD) 171, 178.] In the case of Nazimuddin Vs. Hamida Banu 45 DLR(AD) 38 at page 44 this Court observed :- “ Considering the vagaries of legal proceedings and the technicalities involved in adjudication, Art. 104 of the Constitution has invested  as a measure of abundant caution, the last court of the country with wide power, so that it may forestall a failure of justice and to do complete justice in an appropriate case.  It is an extraordinary procedure for doing justice for completion of or putting an end to a cause or matter pending before this court. If a substantial justice under law and on undisputed facts can be made so that parties may not be pushed to further litigation then a recourse to the provision of Art. 104 may be justified. Complete justice may not be perfect justice, and any endeavour to attain the latter will be act of vanity.”<br/> <br/>In the case of State of Punjab Vs. Bakshish Singh (1998)8 SCC 222 the Supreme Court of India held that Art. 142 even with the width of its amplitude, cannot be used to build a new edifice where none existed earlier, by ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with a subject and thereby achieve something indirectly which cannot be achieved directly.  In the Case of  Supreme Court Bar Association Vs. Union of India (1998)4 SCC  409,    the Supreme Court of India,   has described the power of the Court under Article 142  as the plenary power which  cannot be exercised ignoring  any substantive statutory provision dealing with the subject.  In this case the Supreme Court of India observed:- “ 47.......  “It however, needs to be remembered that the powers conferred on the Court by Article 142 being curative in nature cannot be construed as powers which authorise the Court to ignore the substantive rights of a litigant while dealing with a cause pending before it. This power cannot be used to “supplant” substantive law applicable to the case or cause under consideration of the Court. Article 142, even with the width of its amplitude, cannot be used to build a new edifice where none existed earlier, by ignoring  express statutory provisions dealing with a subject and thereby achieve  something indirectly which cannot be achieved directly. Punishing a contemner Advocate, while dealing with a contempt of Court case by suspending his licence to practice, a power otherwise statutorily available only to the Bar Council of India, on the ground that the contemner is also an Advocate, is, therefore, not permissible in exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 142. The construction of Article 142 must be functionally informed by the salutary purposes of the article, viz, to do complete justice between the parties. It cannot be otherwise. As already noticed in a case of contempt of Court, the contemner and the Court cannot be said to be litigating parties.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>         “48. The Supreme Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 142 has the power to make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice “ between  the parties in any cause or matter pending before it.” The very nature of the power must lead the Court to set limits for itself within which to exercise those powers and ordinarily it cannot disregard a statutory provision governing a subject, except perhaps to balance the equities between the conflicting claims of the litigating parties by “ ironing out the creases” in a cause or mater before it. Indeed this Court is not a court of restricted jurisdiction of only dispute settling. It is well recognised and established that this Court has always been a law maker and its role travels  beyond merely dispute settling. It is a problem solver in the nebulous areas (see K. Veeraswami V. Union of India) but the substantive statutory provisions dealing with the subject matter of a given case cannot be altogether ignored by this Court, while making an order under Article   142. Indeed, these constitutional powers cannot, in any way, be controlled by any statutory provisions but at the same time these powers are not meant to be exercised when their exercise may come directly in conflict with what has been expressly provided for in a statute dealing expressly with the subject.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of M.C. Mehta Vs. Kamal Nath (2000)6 SCC 213 para- 19) Supreme Court of India held that complete justice cannot be pressed into aid where it would amount to contravention of specific provisions of the statute. Article 104 of the Constitution  envisages that  the Appellate Division shall have the power to issue such directions, orders, decrees or writs  as may be necessary for doing complete justice in any cause of matter pending before it. In the case of Raziul Hasan Vs. Badiuzzaman Khan 1996 BLD (AD) 253 this Court observed :-  “ We now find that no remedy is available  to the appellant , though a gross injustice has been done to him for no fault or laches of his own. A valuable right accrued to the appellant in law and this fact should not be lost.  In that view of the matter we thought it be a most appropriate case to exercise our jurisdiction under Article 104 of the Constitution.......... But in the scheme of our Constitution we can only do complete justice under Article 104 of the Constitution in a matter or cause which is pending in appeal under Article 103 of the Constitution.”  The Appellate Division further observed  that “ in the name of complete justice this court may not grant relief which the court of first instance will not be able under the law to grant, otherwise no litigant, in search of complete justice, will rest till he reaches the end of the long tunnel of litigation in this court.”<br/> <br/>The power under Article 104 being an extra ordinary power is  conferred on  the Apex Court of the country  to do complete justice but it cannot all together ignore the substantive provision of statute.  In a number of cases the Apex Courts of the Sub-continent consistently held to the same effect. In this context it is pertinent to quote with approval Mahmudul Islam’s Constitution Law of Bangladesh (3<sup>rd</sup> Ed.) page 893 para- 5.200 which reads as under:- “ Power to do complete justice is an extraordinary power given to the highest tribunal of the land and the power is to be exercised sparingly and in exceptional circumstances to remove manifest and undoubted injustice. Facts   may be of such varied pattern, that it is difficult to lay down any fixed principles for doing complete justice. All that can be said is that ‘ complete justice’ should be done not according to the personal views of the Judges, but in exceptional circumstances on clear showing of injustice for the   removal of which the existing laws have not made any provision.”<br/> <br/>In the case of Abdul Malek Vs.  Abdus Salam 61 DLR (AD) 124  this Court held that the power of doing complete justice can be exercised in a case which is pending  in appeal under Article 103 when the Court finds that no remedy is available to the appellant though gross injustice has been done to him for no fault or latches of his own. In the case of Hussain Muhammad Ershad Vs State 6 BLC (AD) 30 this Court held that it would not be proper to invoke Article 104 of the Constitution by ignoring the provisions of sections 68 and 69 of the Penal Code when exercise of Article 104 comes in direct conflict with the express provision of the law.<br/> <br/>In the facts and circumstances of the case there is no scope to argue that this Court should interfere and set aside the judgment of the High Court Division and send the appeals on remand to the High Court Division with a direction for giving opportunity to the petitioner for depositing the required amount or furnishing security under the law exercising the power of this Court conferred by Article 104 of the Constitution for complete justice. The provisions of  proviso to section 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, in our opinion, requiring  deposit  of the award money or security in lieu thereof  is a condition precedent for entertainment of any application challenging the award and as such the power of this  Court  to do complete justice  invoking  Article 104 of the Constitution  cannot be availed  of to fill up the lacuna of the petitioner’s case or to  ignore the express statutory provisions or the vested rights of the respondents which they have   acquired by lapse of time cannot be taken away under the guise of complete justice. Therefore the irresistible conclusion is that when a party to a proceeding, has deliberately committed a default or is guilty of laches or gross negligence, cannot be allowed to invoke Article 104 of the Constitution for the exercise of the Supreme Court’s power and jurisdiction seeking relief in the name of complete justice.<br/> <br/>In the instant cases the petitioner had not made the deposits as contemplated in the proviso to section 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 and at the time of hearing of the appeals the petitioner’s applications seeking permission to furnish security is not at all bonafide.  Because of the failure in furnishing security or  depositing the required amount at the time of filing the written statements and the application for objections under section 33 of the Act against the awards which were filed in the trial Court for making them rules of the court made  them a nullity in the eye of law and consequently, the petitioners appeals were hopelessly barred by law  and the prayer of the petitioner  at the appellate stage to furnish security cannot be entertained ignoring the express statutory provisions inasmuch as vested rights have  already been accrued to the respondents.  However, the observation of the High Court Division to the following effect does not reflect the correct position of law: “When provisions of  Limitation Act apply in a Special Law it is to be treated as mandatory and in no imagination the time limit prescribed i.e. 30 days cannot be extended following the exempted provisions of law of limitation. In this subcontinent all the Courts speaks Arbitration Act is special law, it cannot condone even one day if written objection filed out of time.” Because Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1908 envisages that subject to the provisions contained in sections 4 to 25 (inclusive), every suit instituted, appeal preferred and application made after the period of the limitation prescribed thereof by the First Schedule shall be dismissed, although limitation has not been set up as a defence. The true meaning of section 3 is that any suit instituted, appeal preferred and an application made after the period of the limitation as prescribed by the First Schedule shall be dismissed unless any of the provisions of sections 4 to 25 has been invoked in the facts and circumstances of a given case. In this context Section 29 (2) of the Limitation Act, 1908 is very much relevant which reads as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>         “(2) Where any special law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed there for by the First Schedule, the provisions of the Section 3 shall apply, as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule, and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special law:-<br/>         The provisions contained in section 4, sections 9 to 18, and section 22 shall apply only insofar as, and to the extent to which, they are not expressly excluded by such special law; and<br/>         The remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The Arbitration Act, 1940, is a special law but it does not provide any  special  provision of  limitation for filing a suit, appeal, review or application rather the period of limitation  prescribed thereof by the First schedule to the Limitation Act, 1908 as contemplated in Article 158 is applicable  in the case of an application for objection under Section 33 of the Arbitration Act to set aside an award or to get an award remitted for reconsideration and as such Section 29 (2) of the Limitation Act, 1908  has no manner of application to such matters. Therefore, it is wrong to construe that the Arbitration Act, 1940 being a special law the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act is not applicable for condonation of delay in filing any application to set aside an award or to get an award remitted for reconsideration. In that view of the matter  section 5 of the Limitation Act is very much applicable for condonation of delay in filing an application for challenging any award in the trial Court under section 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. Therefore, we are of the view that an application for objection to challenge the existence or validity  of an award has to be filed within 30 days from the date of the service of notice of filing of the award and if filed beyond statutory period then the application for objections cannot be taken into consideration, especially in the absence of an application for condonation of delay under section 5 of the Limitation Act explaining sufficient cause for not making the application within such period.     </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Having considered the facts and circumstances of the instant cases, we have found that the petitioner at the time of challenging the validity of the awards before the Court of Joint District Judge miserably failed to deposit the amounts which they were required to pay under the awards as contemplated in the proviso to Section 33 of the Arbitration Act. The deposit of the amount as required to be paid under the award is a condition precedent which is a mandatory provision of law for challenging the award before the trial Court inasmuch as the petitioner is entitled to maintain an application for condonation of delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act,1908 in making such deposit under the award in the  trial Court provided that it has satisfied the Court that it had sufficient cause  within the meaning of  Section 5 of the Limitation Act,1908 for not making the deposit nor furnishing any security within the period of  limitation. But in the instant cases the petitioner has failed to pursue its cause diligently rather its failure and indifference have amounted to latches and gross negligence and as such it is hopelessly barred by limitation inasmuch as a right has already been accrued to the respondents after long lapse of time. In view of the above observations and findings we are of the view that the High Court Division rightly dismissed these appeals.<br/> <br/>For the aforesaid reasons, we do not find any merit in these leave petitions and accordingly these petitions are dismissed.     <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The case of the plaintiffs in short is that, 20 decimals of suit land along with other lands originally belonged to Sreemati Sur Bala and others through registered Kabuliyat and while in possession of the suit land, she sold the same in favour of one Abdur Rahman by sale deed No. 2031 dated 15.2.1944 and while Abdur Rahman was possessing the suit land, he died leaving behind his two sons, namely Farid and Rasul Mia who subsequently, while possessing the suit land, sold it in favour of the plaintiffs by sale deed No. 1116 dated 04.01.2004. Since then the plaintiffs were possessing the suit land. As the S.A. Khatian No. 380 was wrongly published in the name of the defendant No. 1, who has no right, title and possession in the suit land, the plaintiffs prayed for declaration of title in the suit land.<br/> <br/>The defendant contested the suit by filing written statement contending, <em>inter alia,</em> that the present suit is not maintainable and is barred by limitation. Sreemati Sur Bala and others owned the suit land by registered kabuliyat which was not renewed and then one Okkhaya Kumar Das and Nil Kumar Bhoumik were given lease in the year 1333 B.S. and while in possession of the suit land, Okkhaya Kumar Das and Nil Kumar Bhoumik died leaving behind their sons Raj Kumar Das and Bidhu Bushan Bhoumik and S.A. Khatian No. 380 was rightly published in their names and, thereafter, they sold the suit land in favour of the defendant by a saf kabala deed. The defendant mutated the suit land in his name and as such he has right, title and possession in the suit land and the plaintiffs have no right and title in the suit land and they created the kabala deed No. 2031 of 1944 falsely and as such the suit is liable to be dismissed. <br/> <br/>After hearing, the trial Court decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiffs by the judgement and decree dated 01.06.2004.<br/> <br/>Against the said judgement and decree, the defendant preferred appeal being Title Appeal No. 114 of 2004 before the learned District Judge, Comilla, which was transferred to the Court of the learned Additional District Judge, Brahmanpara, Comilla. After hearing the parties and considering the materials on record the learned Additional District Judge, allowed the appeal reversing the judgement and decree of the trial Court. <br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgement of the appellate Court the plaintiffs preferred Civil Revision No. 320 of 2005 before the High Court Division and obtained Rule. By the impugned judgment and order the High Court Division made the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>Against the said judgement and order of the High Court Division, the defendant as petitioner filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 126 of 2008.<br/> <br/>Leave was granted on the following submissions of the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“ (I). The witness of the plaintiffs, during trial, admitted the possession of the defendant in the suit land, and the appellate Court, the last Court of facts, quoting the portions of those evidence, held that the plaintiffs have no exclusive possession in the suit land, but the High Court Division without arriving at a finding as to possession on the basis of evidence on record erroneously decreed the suit and the plaintiff being out of possession, the suit was not at all maintainable without a prayer for recovery of khas possession.<br/> <br/>(II). Since the genuineness of the kabala dated 15.02.1944 was seriously challenged the appellate Court called the concerned Index Register and on perusal of the same and on considering the evidence on record, particularly the evidence as discussed by it, came to the conclusion that the above kabala dated 15.2.1944, the basic document of the plaintiffs for his title, is forged one and the High Court Division committed error in interfering with the above finding of fact as to genuineness of the kabala dated 15.2.1944, and further observation of the High Court Division that since the plaintiffs produced the certified copy of the kabala dated 15.02.1944, so it is to be presumed that the kabala dated 15.02.1944 is genuine, but such presumption is never intended to extend to the genuineness of the transaction specially when there is no evidence regarding the execution of the above kabala dated 15.02.1944 and;<br/> <br/>(III). Though the defendant failed to get his deed executed in the year 1968 registered, but fact remains that since the plaintiffs instituted the instant suit seeking declaration of title, the onus lay upon them to prove their case and they cannot rely upon the weakness of the defendant’s case, but the High Court Division taking into consideration the weakness of the defendant’s case, decreed the suit which thus caused a total failure of justice.”  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Mr. Bivash Chandra Biswas, learned Advocate-on-Record appearing on behalf of the appellant made submissions in line with the grounds upon which leave was granted. The learned Advocate upon placing before us the evidence of the defendant’s witnesses pointed out that P.Ws. 2, 3 and 4 admitted the possession of the defendant in their cross-examination. He also pointed out that the appellate Court considered the evidence of C.W. 1 and came to the conclusion that he could not come to any positive finding that the predecessor of the plaintiffs had title in the suit land. He pointed out that C.W. 1 the Mohorar from the record room of the District Registry Office categorically stated that the certified copy of deed No. 2031 of 1944 neither contains the seal of the S.R. Office nor the signature of the Record Keeper, and also the signature of A. Rashid appearing above true copy is not the signature of the then Sub-Registrar A. Rashid. He finally submitted that it is true that the production of a document more than 30 years old raises a presumption of genuineness, but that presumption has been reverted through the evidence of C.W. 1 that the Index Volume for the year 1944 of that Registry Office did not contain the document in question. Also the evidence of C.W.1 raised serious doubt about the genuineness of the certified copy, which was produced in support of the existence of the sale deed of 1944.   <br/> <br/>Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents made submissions in support of the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division. He further submitted that the High Court Division correctly held that the appellate Court below upon wrong appreciation of the evidence of C.W. 1, erroneously discarded the registered deed No. 2031 dated 15.02.1944, although the concerned Volume was not produced in Court. He further submitted that the certified copy itself being more than 30 years old carries a presumption of its genuineness. In support of his contention he referred to the decision in the case of <strong><em>Abani Mohan Saha Vs. Assistant Custodian (S.D.O.) Vested Property, Chandpur and ors.</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>39 DLR (AD)223</em></strong>. He submitted that the High Court Division correctly held that it is really very unsafe to discard a document, after more than 30 years, due to the non availability of the description of the property in question in the Index.<br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates appearing for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/> <br/>It is apparent from the evidence on record that the plaintiffs’ witnesses, namely P.W. 2, 3 and 4 all deposed in their cross-examination admitting the possession of the defendants in the suit land. The suit of the plaintiffs was for a declaration of their title in the suit land and also for a declaration that the record of rights in respect of R.S. Khatian No. 380 was collusive, fraudulent, ineffective and not binding. Therefore, the appellate Court rightly held that in such circumstances the trial Court fell into error in decreeing the suit only on the prayer for declaration of title simpliciter.<br/> <br/>When the lower appellate Court, being the last Court of fact, comes to any finding based on the evidence on record, the power of the revisional Court to interfere with such finding is limited to cases where the finding of the appellate Court is perverse, or based on wrong appreciation of the evidence. It appears from the judgement of the High Court Division that the aspect of possession of the defendant in the suit land has not at all been dealt with or reversed by the revisional Court. Hence, the impugned judgement is not sustainable on that account.<br/> <br/>It is true that a registered document carries a presumption of correctness. It is also true that a document which is more than 30 years old is given some sanctity by the law of evidence. However, in the instant case we note that the defendant has all along challenged the genuineness of the registered deed No. 2031 of 1944. The plaintiffs claimed that the original document was lost and produced a certified copy which had apparently been obtained in 1968. That certified copy is also more than 30 years old. However, unless the original Volume containing the full text of the deed is produced, the certified copy being secondary evidence, the presumption of genuineness only goes to the extent of the genuineness of the certified copy, but not to the genuineness of the original document. Moreover, we find from the evidence of C.W.1 that the certified copy did not contain the seal of the Registrar’s Office nor did it bear the genuine signature of A. Rashid, who was the then Sub-Registrar.<br/> <br/>The High Court Division observed that “Section 55 (3) of the Registration Act provides that Index No. II shall contain such particulars mentioned in section 21 relating to every such document and Memorandum as the Inspector General from time to time directs in that behalf. Section 21 provides that no non-testamentary document relating to immovable property shall be accepted for registration unless it contains a description of such property sufficient to identify the same. Though it appears that in page 59 of Index No. II the description of the property in question was not found but there is nothing on record to show that it was only in page 59 the description of the property in question ought to have been recorded.”      <br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates appearing for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/> <br/>It is our view that the observation of the High Court Division is rather misconceived. The Index of registered documents will not have the description of the property. In our view the fact that the number of the deed alleged to have been registered on 15.02.1944 is absent from the Index is sufficient to indicate that it is not a genuine document. The judgment of the appellate Court appears to be sound and based on proper appreciation of the evidence and materials on record.<br/> <br/>It is also apparent from the records, as found by the appellate Court, that the plaintiffs’ witnesses admitted possession of the defendant in the suit land. This finding of fact was not addressed by the High Court Division. In our view, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the appellate Court rightly held that a suit for declaration of title simpliciter was not maintainable. <br/> <br/>In view of the above discussion, we find merit in this appeal which is accordingly allowed without, however, any order as to costs. The impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division is set aside.  <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Suffice it to say that the respondents No. 1-3 as plaintiffs filed Title Suit No. 355 of 1983 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Dhaka for declaration that the plaintiffs are the owners in 16 annas share in the suit property by adverse possession and further declaration that the judgement and decree dated 19.01.1983 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No. 131 of 1982 is null and void, collusive and fraudulent and a paper transaction and not binding upon the plaintiffs.

(Hons) in Chemistry in the year of 1982 from the Rajshahi University and M.Sc. in Chemistry in the year of 1983 from the Rajshahi University was appointed as a Lecturer on 01.09.1986 in the Meherpur Mohila College, Kushtia.

The respondent No. 1 nationalized the College through a notification bearing Memo No. শাঃ -৯/৯-১২/৯২/শিক্ষা dated 10.07.1994 and the required number of posts were created for the teachers in the said College by the respondent No. 1 on 22.12.1994.<br/><br/>On 22.01.1995 the respondent No. 1, Ministry of Education by publishing a notification bearing Memo No. শা-৯/৯-১২/৯২/শিক্ষা appointed the petitioner and others as the Lecturers on ad-hoc basis to be effective their appointments from the date of creation of the posts on 22.12.1994 under the provision of Teachers and Non-Teaching Staff of Nationalized College (Directorate of Public Instruction) Absorption Rules, 1981 in the said Meherpur Government Mohila College. Thereafter, the Public Service Commission (PSC) recommended for regularizing the petitioners in their services under the provision of Rule 4 of Absorption Rules, 1981. Despite the above recommendation by the Public Service Commission the respondent No. 1, the Ministry of Education by publishing a notification bearing Memo No. শাঃ৯/৪-১/২০০০/২৯৪-শিক্ষা dated 16.03.2003 regularized the service of the petitioner under the provision of Rule 6(5) of the Nationalized Colleges Teachers and Non-Teaching Staff Absorption Rules, 2000 instead of under the Absorption Rules, 1981 because a lecturer in a Nationalized College shall be appointed on ad-hoc basis after fulfillment of the required conditions provided under Rule 5 of the Absorption Rules, 1981 and the Rules 3,4 and 5 of the Absorption Rules, 1981. Moreover, the Rule 8 of the said Absorption Rules, 1981 also provided that seniority of a Lecturer shall be determined on the basis of counting his/her effective service of his period of job in the Non-Government or Private College.

Accordingly a report was submitted by the respondent No. 5 on 06.07.2004. The respondent No.1, the Government of Bangladesh vide notification No. শিক্ষা /শাঃ ৯/বিবিধ-২২/২০০৪ dated 03.01.2005 nationalized the College with effect from 10.07.2004 by issuing a letter dated 03.07.2006. The office of the respondent No. 1 created required numbers of post as the teachers and the petitioners were included in the said list.<br/><br/>After being nationalized the respondent No. 1 published a notification dated 14.09.2006 appointed the petitioners and others as the Lecturers of the college on ad-hoc basis on 14.09.2006 to give effect of the appointed from the date of creation for the post which is 03.07.2006 as per provision of the Nationalized Colleges Teachers and Non-Teaching Staff Absorption Rules, 2000 (come into effect from 01.02.1978). As per the provision of law the Public Service Commission recommended the name of the petitioners for regularizing their services and forwarded the same to the respondent No. 1, Ministry of Education, through its letter bearing Memo No. বাসককস/ইউ-৯/নিয়মিতকরণ-৩/২০০৮/১৫ dated 19.02.2009 (Annexure-H of the Writ Petition).The petitioners have waited for at least 7 years after the ad-hoc appointment in the post and 4 years after the recommendation by the PSC. On 24.10.2013 by a notification published by the respondent No. 1 regularized the petitioners services in the respective posts as per provision under Rule 6(5) of the Absorption Rules, 2000 bearing Memo No. শিম/শাঃ ৮/১৪ (নিয়মিত)-১/২০০৮/ dated 24.10.2013 on ad-hoc basis in the year of 2006 instead applying the law under the Teachers and Non Teaching Staff of Nationalized College (Directorate of Public Instruction) Absorption Rules, 1981.<br/><br/>The petitioner was appointed in the year of 1995 in W.P. No. 10075 of 2011, the petitioners were appointed in the year of 2006 in W.P. No. 3230 of 2014 respectively and their names were recommended by the PSC in order to regularize their services but the respondents issued the letters regularizing their names after nearly 7 years from the dated of the recommendation accorded by the PSC, as such, the petitioners filed these two Writ Petitions challenging the said regularization order under the provision of law and the Rules were issued thereupon.<br/><br/>Mr. Shafique Ahmed, the learned Senior Counsel appearing with the learned Advocates Mr. Mahbub Shafique and K.M. Hafizul Alam for the petitioners in Writ Petition No. 10075 of 2011 submits that Rule 3 of the Teacher and Non-Teaching Staff of Nationalized College (Directorate of Public Instruction) Absorption Rules, 1981 provides that a teacher of a nationalized college shall, subject to the fulfillment of the conditions of Rule 5, be appointed on ad-hoc basis as a Lecturer or Assistant Professor under the Directorate of Public Instruction accordingly the petitioners being absorbed in the government service by way of nationalization of their respective colleges therefore they are all entitled to be counted their seniority from the taking over of the College, as such, the Rule should be made absolute.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate further submits that Rule 7(4) of the Bangladesh Civil Service Recruitment Rules, 1981 provides that the Government Employee shall be made permanent from the date of his appointment in service, is such view of the matter the petitioner is also entitled to become permanent and regularized from the date of his appointment, as such, he prays to make the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>The learned Senior Counsel appearing with the learned Advocates Mr. Mahabub Shafique and K.M. Hafizul Alam further submits in Writ Petition No. 3230 of 2014 that the petitioners were appointed on ad-hoc basis on 14.09.2006 with effect from 03.07.2006 as such the petitioners have a legitimate expectation to be regularized from the date of ad-hoc appointment hence the date of regularization of the petitioners from the date of office order of regularization have been made without lawful authority and of no legal effect, as such, the Rule should be made absolute.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate further submits that the provisions of Rule 6(5) and Rule 7 of the Nationalized Colleges Teachers and Non-Teaching Staff Absorption Rules, 2000 provide no time frame and criteria or guidelines to regularize the ad hoc appointed teachers as such there is every scope to use the said provisions arbitrarily, discriminatorily and malafide hence the provisions of Rule 6(5) and Rule 7 of the said Rule, 2000 are ultra vires to Article 27 and Article 29 of the Constitution of People’s Republic of Bangladesh.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate further submits that the petitioners were appointed on ad hoc basis on 14.09.2006 with effect from 03.07.2006 but their services have been regularized after 7 (seven) years of ad hoc appointment, particularly on 24.10.2013, and their seniority will be counted after 7(seven) years of their ad hoc appointment, i.e. from the date of regularization, as per provisions of Rule 6(5) and Rule 7 of the Nationalized Colleges Teachers and Non-Teaching Staff Absorption Rules, 2000 as such the provisions of Rule 6(5) and Rule 7 of the said Rule, 2000 are arbitrary and discriminatory to Article 27 and Article 29 of the Constitution of People’s Republic of Bangladesh, as such, the Rule should be made absolute.<br/><br/>The Rule has been opposed by the respondent Nos. 1 and 5 by filing two separate Affidavit-in-Oppositions.<br/>In Writ Petition No. 10075 of 2011, the Affidavit –in-Opposition filed by the respondent No. 5 it is stated that the service of the petitioner was regularized as per law of the land and no illegality had been committed in regularizing the petitioner in service under the relevant provisions of the 2000 Rules. Rule 6(5) of the Rules 2000 provides that Teachers/staffs shall be regularized from date of regularization and no retrospective effect is given under 2000 rules, as such, the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>It is further stated that the petitioner was regularized in service as per the existing Rules, 2000 since the Rules, 1981 is no longer in operation therefore the petitioner cannot claim the benefit of the said repealed Rules, 1981. The petitioner was regularized as per provision of the Rules, 2000 and hence he was regularized in accordance with law. The petitioners cannot challenge the regularization as per provision the Rules of 1981 since the said Rule has been repealed and the Rules, 2000 was given effect from 1978 and the petitioners services also fall under the Rules, 2000. The absorption rules was made effective from 01.02.1978 and as per Rule 9(1) of the said Rules the Absorption Rules 1998 was cancelled. He also submits that Absorption Rules, 2000 clearly stipulates that the petitioner shall be regularized from date of their regularization and their service shall be counted from the date of their regularization therefore, the petitioner cannot claim the benefit of Rules, 1981, as such, the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>In Writ Petition No. 2330 of 2014, the respondent No. 5 filed an Affidavit in Opposition wherein it is stated that the posts of the petitioners were created as per Absorption Rules, 2000 since the college was nationalized after 2000 and as such provisions of Absorption Rules, 2000 shall be applicable for them, as such, the Rule should be discharged.<br/><br/>It is further stated that regularization of the petitioners were made as per correct provisions of law. There is no reason that the petitioners services shall be regularized as per Absorption Rules, 1981 since they were never within the ambit of Absorption Rules, 1981 which is applicable for the teachers and staffs whose colleges were nationalized before 1998, when 1998 Rules came into effect replacing 1981 Rules.<br/><br/>Mr. Goutam Kumar Roy, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing along with Mr. Md. Yunus the learned Assistant Attorney General submits that these two Writ Petitions have been filed by the petitioners challenging the provision of Rule 6(5) of the Absorption Rules, 2000 being virus of the Constitution of Bangladesh and also seeking a direction for regularizing the petitioners’ services from the date of ad hoc appointment in the respective petitioners but the Rule 6(5) of the Absorption Rules, 2000 is clearly provided that a Lecturer in a nationalized college could only be entitled on regularization of his/her service but not from the date of appointment on ad-hoc basis, as such, these Rules merit no consideration from this court as these are beyond the requirement of the existing law, as such, the Rule should be discharged. The learned Deputy Attorney General further submits that the petitioners were regularized by the respondents after a proper scrutiny of the individual petitioners service record and performance but the petitioners claim of regularization from the date of ad-hoc appointment have no legal basis, therefore, these Rules are liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General further submits that the petitioners have been regularized by the orders passed by the respondent No. 1, as such, the petitioners are the servants of the republic, therefore, they cannot invoke the jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution because the petitioners have efficacious remedy under Article 117 of the Constitution for pursuing the matter before the Administrative Tribunal thus these Rules are not maintainable under the provision of existing law of the country, as such, he prays to discharge the Rule.<br/><br/>Considering the above submissions made by the learned Advocates appearing for the respective parties and also considering the Writ Petitions (Writ Petition No. 10075 of 2011 and Writ Petition No. 3230 of 2014) along with Annexures therein, and also considering the Affidavit-in-Oppositions filed by the respondent No. 5, it appears to us that the Petitioner Md. Abdur Razzaque in the Writ Petition No. 10075 of 2011 was appointed in Non-government College, namely, Mosheshpur Mohila Degree College, Kushtia on 01.09.1986 as a Lecturer in the subject of Chemistry. The said College was nationalized from the date of 15.12.1992 by an order passed on 10.07.1994. The petitioner thereafter was appointed as the Lecturer from the date of 22.12.1995 by an order dated 22.01.1995 on an ad-hoc basis. The petitioner service was regularized by the respondent No. 1 on 16.03.2003 after a required recommendation of the Public Servant Commission (PSC).<br/><br/>In this Writ Petition the questions are what should be operating law as per the petitioner is concerned and also whether the order of regularization of the petitioner service after nearly a period of 9 years i.e. the petitioner was appointed on ad-hoc basis with effect from 22.12.1994 but the petitioner service was regularized on 16.03.2003 under the provision of Rule 9(5) of the Absorption Rules, 2000.<br/> <br/>To answer the above two questions we have examined the relevant laws under the Teachers and Non-Teaching Staff of Nationalized College (Directorate of Public Instruction) Absorption Rules, 1981 as well as the provision of Rule 6(5) of the Absorption Rules, 2000 to be affective from 01.02.1978. From the above given facts it is clear that the petitioner was appointed on the ad-hoc basis with effect from 22.12.1994 and the operating law at that moment of time was the Absorption Rule 1981. In this regard we have to consider the provision under Rules 3,4 and 5 of the Absorption Rules, 1981 which reads as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“3. Ad-hoc appointment of a teacher :(1) a Teacher of a nationalized college shall, subject to the fulfillment of the condition or rule 5, be appointed on ad-hoc basis as a Lecturer or Assistant Professor under the Directorate of Public Instruction.<br/><br/>Provided that no teacher shall be appointed on ad-hoc basis as an Assistant Professor unless he has at least a Second Class Master’s degree in the relevant subject and has at least 7 years of effective service.<br/><br/>2. A Lecturer or Assistant Professor appointed on ad-hoc basis shall be entitled to such pay and allowances in their respective seals of pay as may be determined by the Government.<br/><br/>4. Regularization of ad-hoc teachers:- (1) A teacher appointed on ad-hoc basis under rule 3 shall be appointed on regular basis through the Commission either by interview or otherwise as may decided by the Commission.<br/><br/>(2). No teacher shall be eligible for regular appointment as Lecturer unless he has at least Second Class Master’s degree in the relevant subject:<br/><br/>Provided that the Commission may recommend a teacher having Third Class Master’s Degree in the relevant subject for regular appointment on his obtaining at least Second Class Master’s degree in the relevant subject within a period of 3 years from the date of communication of such recommendation to the teacher, failing which his ad-hoc appointment shall be terminated by the appointing authority.<br/><br/>5. Eligibility : (1) No person shall be eligible for appointment under those rules if he-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">a) is not a citizen of Bangladesh or a permanent resident of Bangladesh; and<br/>b) is married to, or has entered into a promise of marriage with, person who is not a citizen of Bangladesh.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(2) No regular appointment shall be made under these rules unless-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">(a) a person selected for appointment by the Commission is declared by a Medical Board or a Medical Officer set up or, as the case may be, authorized by the Director of Health Services to be medically fit for such appointment, and<br/>(b) the antecedents of the person so selected have been verified through appropriate agency and found to be such as do not render him unsuitable for appointment in the services of the Republic.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>As per the above provisions of the Rules, 1981 the petitioner can only be appointed on ad-hoc basis in the year of 1994 under the prevailing law which was the Absorption Rules 1981. Despite the fact the petitioner was regularized on 16.03.2003, therefore, we can take a decision that the operating law in the case of the present petitioner shall be the laws prevailing on the date of his appointment on ad-hoc basis. In this regard Rule 3 of the Absorption Rules, 1981 provides appointment on ad-hoc basis in a nationalized college subject to fulfillment of the conditions of Rule 5 mentioned above. It is clear to us that the petitioners were appointed under the provision of Rule 3 along with Rule 5 which was the final appointment and the operating law was the Absorption Rules, 1981.<br/> <br/>In writ petition No. 10075 of 2011 the respondent issued an office order dated 22.01.1995 (Annexure E) appointing the petitioner, Md. Abdur Razzak at serial No. 20 and also containing the process of regularizing in the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“মে­হরপুর জেলার মে­হরপুর সরকারী মহিলা ক­লজ­ক জাতীয়করন করার প্রেক্ষি­ত উও্র ক­ল­জ কর্মরত বেসরকারী আম­লর নিন্মলিখিত শিক্ষকবৃন্দকে জাতীয়কৃত ক­ল­জর শিক্ষক ও অশিক্ষক কর্মচারী আত্তীকরণ বিধিমালা-১৯৮১ অনুসা­র পদ সৃষ্টির আ­দশ জারীর তারিখ ২২/১২/৯৪ইং হই­ত তাহা­দর না­মর পা­র্শ্ব বর্নিত বিষয় ও প­দ এড-হক ভিত্তি­ত নি­য়াগ করা হইলঃ-<br/> </div><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="height:913px;

We, therefore, sought assistance from the learned Deputy Attorney General as to the delay for 9 years in regularizing the petitioner, here again, the learned Deputy Attorney General could not provide us with any explanation for such a long period of time which is nearly 9 years. We have expressed our anxiety over the conduct of the respondents in handling of this petitioner’s case with utter carelessness and arbitrary. We also consider that the conduct on the part of the respondents made the petitioner a victim. Despite the provision of law under the Absorption Rule, 1981 which clearly mentioned that a teacher shall be appointed on an ad-hoc basis in a nationalized college if and only if he or she can satisfy Rule 5 when he/she is eligible to be appointed as a teacher. In the instant case the petitioner has satisfied all requirements to become eligible to get appointment in the post of lecturer in the year of 1994, therefore, the petitioner service should be considered from the date of ad-hoc appointment with effect from 22.12.1994 pursuant to the order dated 22.01.1991(Annexure-E of the Writ Petition) under the provision of the Absorption Rules, 1981.<br/> <br/>Regarding the Writ Petition No. 3230 of 2014 the petitioners (20 in numbers) were originally appointed in the Mosheshpur Degree College in Jeinaidah by the order around the period of 1985 to 2003 as the Lecturers. After complying all the required academic qualification and other requirements for such appointment in the said Non-government/ Private College in the year of 2005.The said college was nationalized with effect from 10.07.2004 and the name of the College has been recorded as the Moheshpur Government Degree College. Regarding the appointment of the petitioners and all other teachers and non-teaching staffs the Government passed several orders including order for creating posts for Lecturer, Assistant Professor and other Teachers along with the Staffs for the Government Colleges. In course of time after creating posts in the aforesaid manner the petitioners were appointed on the ad-hoc basis by the notification dated 14.09.2006 (Annexure –G of the Writ Petition No. 3230 of 2014) also contains the provision of regularizations of their service under Rules, 2000 (come into effect 01.02.1978) which reads as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify;

We also consider the context in which this provision was introduced by the People’s Republic of Bangladesh under the provision of Articles 133 and 140(2) of the Constitution of Bangladesh by consultation with the Public Service Commission and the whole Absorption Rules is to adjust or absorb teachers from the Non-government College/School into the Government College/School. Rule 5 of the Rules, 2000 came into effect on 01.02.1997, according to us, provides the processes for first scanning for including the Non-government teachers into Government-teachers subject to the recommendation of the Public Service Commission in order to make the new absorbed teachers or Lecturers to be included into the cadre service as the government employees. As part of the said scanning process a candidate either as a Lecturer or as a staff has to satisfy the 5 requirements under the said Rule 5 including character, conduct health condition, marital status and the age of retirement. In the instant case the petitioners were appointed on the ad-hoc basis after fulfilling the above requirement of law.<br/> <br/>The 2<sup>nd</sup> form of scanning of a teacher and non-teaching staff under the provision laid down in Rule 6 of the Absorption Rule 2000 which reads as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“৬। চাকুরী নিয়মিতকরণ ইত্যাদিঃ (১) Bangladesh Public Service Commission (Constitution) Regulations, 1979 এবং প্র­যাজ্য অন্যান্য আইন অনুসা­র কমিশ­নর আওতাভুক্ত প­দ, কমিশ­নর সুপারিশ ব্যতীত, নি­য়াগকারী কর্তৃপক্ষ কোন এডহক নি­য়াগ নিয়মিত করি­ব না।<br/>(২) এডহকভিত্তি­ত নি­য়াগপ্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তির প্র­য়োজনীয় যোগ্যতা থাকি­ল এবং তাহার এডহক নি­য়াগ পরবর্তী চাকুরীকাল স­ন্তোষজনক হই­ল কমিশন উহার সুপারিশ প্রদান করি­বে।<br/>(৩) কমিশন­নর আওতাবহির্ভূত প­দ এডহক নি­য়াগ প্র­য়াজনীয় যোগ্যতারভিত্তি­ত নি­য়াগকারী কর্তৃপক্ষ নিয়মিত করি­বে।<br/>(৪) কোন ব্যক্তির এডহক নি­য়াগ নিয়মিত করা না হই­ল তিনি নি­য়াগকারী কর্তৃপ­ক্ষর সিদ্ধান্ত অনুসা­রে আর চাকুরী­ত বহাল থাকি­বনা, ত­ব প্র­য়াজনীয় যোগ্যতা থাকি­ল এডহকভিত্তি­ত নি­য়াজিত শিক্ষক­ক সরকার ক্যাডারবহির্ভূত প্রভাষক প­দ নি­য়াজিত রাখি­ত পারি­ব এবং তাহার চাকুরীর শর্তাবলী সরকার কর্তৃক নির্ধারিত হই­ব।<br/>(৫) এই বিধি অনুসা­র কোন ব্যও্রির এডহক নি­য়াগ নিয়মিত করা হই­ল সংশ্লিষ্ট প­দ তাহার আত্মীকরণ সম্পন্ন হই­ব এবং শিক্ষ­কর ক্ষে­ত্র নিয়মিতকর­ণর আ­দশ প্রদা­নর তারি­খ তিনি ক্যাডারভূক্ত হইয়া­ছন বলিয়া গন্য হই­বন। ”    </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Having qualified under the Rule 5 the petitioners became subject to scanning under the above provision, in particular, Rule 6(1) which contains that no teacher can be appointed on ad-hoc basis or can be regularized without an approval or of recommendation from the Public Service Commission under the provision of Public Service Commission (consultation) Regulation, 1979. From Annexure-H of the writ petition mentioned above contains the approval /recommendation in favour of the present petitioners to be appointed and regularized in their respective posts as Lecturers. Rule 6(5) of the Absorption Rules at the same time contained that a person absorption process would be completed after being appointed on ad-hoc basis and also after being regularized and, if those are satisfied, a teacher can be encadred on regularizing his service. In the above provision of Rule 5, Rule 6(1) and Rule 6(5) of this law require encadrement of a teacher after the absorption in his post on regularizing his post.<br/> <br/>Now, the question is when a teacher should be considered as absorbed in his post under the provision of Absorption Rules 2000. To answer the said question we have carefully examined Rules 5, 6 and 7 of the Absorption Rules, 2000 and we have to read all these Rules together in order to interpret the law which have created on the foundation to give benefit of the educational system as a whole by providing teachers and non-teaching staffs of a Non-government Private College converting into a Government College. The whole purpose is to enhance the standard and facilities of the teaching thousands of students to get their best education process. In this regard we should mention that government has introduced Rules, 2000 but given effect from 1978 not to remove or discard a teacher or Lecturer from a Non-government Private College but to include them inasmuch as a College required. These two Rules were issued challenging the legality of Rule 6(5) of the Absorption Rules, 2000 as being virus to the Constitution of Bangladesh but during the hearing of this Rule, the learned Advocates appearing for the petitioners expressed their desire not to press this part of the Rule but to given emphasis upon their submissions on seeking a direction to regularize the service of the petitioners with all service benefits from the date of their appointment on ad-hoc basis from 03.07.2006. Regarding the 2<sup>nd</sup> portion of the Rule issued by this court in Writ Petition we consider that the petitioners were given appointment on the ad-hoc basis with effect from 03.07.2006 by order dated 14.09.2006 and the petitioners have been providing their services in the College as the Lecturers and or Assistant Professors on the basis of the aforementioned appointment by the Annexure-G dated 14.09.2006 which contains that the petitioners will be regularized as soon as their appointment would be recommended by the Public Service Commission as per required Rule 6(1) of the Absorption Rules, 2000 which is in operation from 01.02.1978. It appears from the record that the petitioners appointment were recommended by the PSC on 19.02.2009 containing in Annexure-E of the Writ Petition. When the aforesaid two steps have been taken by the respondents including the respondent No. 1 in respect of the services of the petitioners the question naturally arises why the respondents have to be waited for regularizing the petitioners appointment until on 24.10.2013 which is 7 years after the ad-hoc appointment and 4 years from the required recommendation by the PSC. In this regard we sought submissions from the learned Advocates appearing for the respective parties. In response to our queries the learned Advocates for the petitioners stated that the concerned official even after knowing the required laws as mentioned above as appointment of the petitioners delayed their response in order to cause suffering to the petitioners which can be termed as malice in law. In the case of on English jurisdiction Viscount Haldane L.C in the case of Sharer v Shiehad (1914) Ac. 808 and in the case of Bangladesh jurisdiction Dr. Nazrul Islam V Bangladesh 1981 BLD (AD) 140 the phrase of Malice in Law have been described in the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Between the malice in fact and malice in law there is a broad distinction which is not peculiar to any particular system of jurisprudence. A person who inflicts an injury upon another person in contravention of the law is not allowed to say that he did so with an innocent mind; he is taken to know the law, and he must act within the law. He may, therefore, be guilty of malice in law, although so far as the state of his mid is concerned, he acts ignorantly, and in that sense innocently. Malice of fact is quite an ignorantly, and in that sense innocently. Malice of fact if quite a different thing; it means a actual malicious intention on the part of the person who has done the wrongful act, and it may be in proceedings based on wrongs independent of contract, a very material ingredient in the question whether a valid case of actions can be stated. ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>When question of malice in law arises this court can consider a writ petition even the petitioner are in the service of the Republic. In reply to our queries the learned Assistant Attorney General simply said that the government officials take decision after complying all the required formalities by the respective officers, as such, such a long period of time might have been consumed but we are surprised and expressed our anxiety over the submission made by the learned Deputy Attorney General because a citizen cannot be led to suffer for the ignorance or indifference or even carelessness on the part of any servant of the republic. We, therefore, consider for non-action on the part of the officers of the respondents have committed malice in law because they were aware that after recomm-endation of the Public Service Commission (PSC) they should have given a decision as to the appointment and regularization of the petitioners services. We also consider that the petitioner should not suffer for inaction or the fault on the part of the respondents. As the learned Advocate for the petitioner made submission not to press part of Rule regarding the vires in law, we are not passing any decision thereabout.<br/><br/>Finally we consider that after nationalization of a non- government College the respondents must act promptly in order to give peace of mind to the Lecturers or Assistant Professors who became employees of the government by virtue of the Absorption Rules, 2000 which came into effect on 01.02.1978. Rule 6(5) validly required regularization for encadre of a teacher or lecturer but the malicious inaction on the part of the respondents is to be declared illegal, therefore, without lawful authority.<br/><br/>We, therefore, find merit in part of each of the Rules.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule issued in Writ Petition No. 10075 of 2011 and the Rule issued in Writ Petition No. 3230 of 2014 are made absolute in part.<br/><br/>The respondents are hereby directed to regularize the service of the petition in W.P. No. 10075 of 2011 from 22.12.1994 under Rules, 1981 and also the petitioners in W.P. No. 3230 of 2014 from 03.07.2006 under Rules, 2000 which came effect from 01.02.1978 within 3(three) months from the receipt of this judgment and order.<br/><br/>The office is directed to communicate the judgment and order to the persons concerned immediately.<br/><br/><strong> Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

They stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that the land of Title Suit No. 152 of 1957 was part of C.S. Plot No. 67 under C.S. Khatian No. 174 and the total area of C.S. Khatian No. 174 of Mouja Dhanmondi, former Keranigonj Police Station and at present Dhanmondi Police Station was 60.13 acres and the superior landlords were Nezabot Ali Kha, Abdul Hakim and others. The land of the C.S. Plot No. 67 was owned and possessed by one Gopeswar Paul, son of late Bhubaneswar Paul as tenant under the superior landlord and C.S. record-of-rights was finally published in the name of tenant Gopeswar Paul. C.S. Plot No. 67 comprised an area of 38.48 acres. Said Gopeswar Paul while owning and possessing the said land died leaving behind two sons, namely Nilkanta Paul and Harekrishna Paul as his heirs. Subsequently, Harekrishna Paul died leaving behind only son Debraj Paul as his heir. Said Nilkanta Paul and Debraj Paul while possessing the said land, sold 4 bighas of specific chala land out of total 38.48 acres of land of C.S. Plot No. 67 to one Sreejukta Kiron Chandra Bandapadhaya, son of late Binod Chandra Bandapadhaya vide registered deed No. 1845 dated 14.07.1933 and delivered possession to him. Thereafter, Kiron Chandra Bandapadhaya sold his entire purchased 4 bighas land, equivalent to 1.33 acres with trees standing thereon to Md. Shahjahan Bhuiyan, son of late Moulvi Mohammad Abdul Wahab Bhuiyan, predecessor of the present petitioner and opposite party Nos. 21-24 vide registered sale deed No. 4623 dated 18.08.1948 and handed over possession to them and they are in possession of the said land jointly. The Government, for the construction of the residence of Government employees, acquired 16.75 acres of land including 1.33 acres of C.S. Plot No. 67 owned and possessed by Md. Shahjahan Bhuiyan vide Land Acquisition Case No. 06 of 1948-49 and compensation was prepared in his name for an amount of Tk. 3,976.11. But the Government did not take possession of the entire acquired land including the land owned and possessed by the predecessor of the petitioner as the said land was not needed for the purpose for which acquisition proceeding was started, and the said land is a small unspecified part of a bigger plot. The compensation was not withdrawn by the predecessor of the petitioner and the said amount was deposited in the Government Revenue Accounts. Since possession of 1.33 acres of land owned and possessed by the predecessor of the petitioner was not taken over by the Land Acquisition Department, the said land remained in the possession of the petitioner’s predecessor Md. Shahjahan Bhuiyan who died on 18.02.1982. On the recommendation of the Ministry of Works and Housing, the then Prime Minister directed release of the unused acquired portion of land of the owners in possession on 18.03.1974, and also directed to take back the compensation money from those awardees who had taken compensation, and further directed to publish Gazette Notification immediately in that regard. But the said direction was not acted upon. Ultimately, in the year 1984 decisions were taken by the Government for implementation of the earlier decision. Mrs. Salma Bhuiyan, mother of the petitioner on 19.06.1989 filed an application to the Minister, Ministry of Land for releasing the said property form L.A. Case No. 06 of 1948-49 and he directed the Additional Deputy Commissioner (L.A.) Dhaka to submit report after inquiry. Accordingly, the Additional Deputy Commissioner (L.A.), Dhaka after inquiry submitted report on 26.06.1989 to the Ministry of Land. In the said report it was clearly stated that the petitioners were in possession of the said property by constructing structures. The petitioner’s property not having been released, they filed Title Suit No. 133 of 2001 in the Court of the Joint District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka against the Government for declaration of their 16 annas right, title and interest in the said 1.33 acres of land and the said suit is pending for disposal. The opposite party Nos. 1-18 or their predecessor got their names recorded in respect of 50 decimals of land out of total 1.33 acres of the aforesaid land of C.S. Plot No. 67 at the field level in the recent Dhaka City Survey and they filed appeal under Rule 31 of the State Acquisition Tenancy Rules, 1955 framed under State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 and from the said case record, the petitioner found photocopy of the certified copy of the judgement and decree dated 28.05.1960 passed in Title Suit No. 152 of 1957 of the Court of Munsif, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka and the petitioner came to know that the opposite party Nos. 1-18 or their predecessor, suppressing the facts of the earlier title deed, possession of the petitioner’s predecessors as well as acquisition proceedings, obtained a decree in respect of unspecified 50 decimals of land out of total 38.48 acres of land. The petitioner does not claim any interest in the suit land of the Title Execution Case No. 32 of 1962 but claim different land by way of earlier title document because of the question of the identity of the suit land. The said judgement and decree has cast cloud upon the right, title, interest and possession of the suit land of the petitioner because of identity of the suit land and the decretal land. As the heirs of late Md. Shahjahan Bhuiyan, they filed Title Suit No. 05 of 2002 before the District Judge, 4<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka against the opposite party Nos. 1-18 and prayed for declaration that the judgement and decree passed on 28.05.1960 in Title Suit No. 152 of 1957 of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Court of Munsif, Dhaka is not binding upon the plaintiffs of the present suit.<br/> <br/>During pendency of the Title Suit No. 05 of 2002 with a view to pre-empt the possible judgement of the suit, the defendant-opposite party Nos. 1-18 forcibly tried to dispossess the petitioner from the suit land and as such, the petitioner and the opposite party Nos. 21-24 on 18.05.2009 field an application under Order 39, Rules 1 and 2 read with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/>Respondent Nos. 1-11 as defendants of the suit filed written statements stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that their predecessor purchased the land measuring an area of 50 decimals of C.S. Plot No. 67 out of total 38.48 acres of land vide registered deed No. 3075 dated 21.5.1953 from Debraj Paul and that on the same day A.M. Nur Meah and 2 others purchased 46 decimals of land from the same Debraj Paul and the said land is situated on the northern side of the land purchased by them. On 05.12.1955 aforesaid A.M. Nur Meah and others dispossessed the decree-holder opposite party Nos. 1-18, consequently, they filed Title Suit No. 152 of 1957 in the Court of Munsif and that suit was decreed in favour of the predecessors of the opposite party Nos. 1-18.<br/> <br/>After hearing the parties the learned Joint District Judge by his order dated 14.11.2012 rejected the application field under Order 39, Rule 1 and 2 read with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for temporary injunction. <br/> <br/>Against the said order passed by the Joint District Judge, 4<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka, the plaintiffs preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No. 317 of 2012, which was heard by the learned Additional District Judge, who by his judgement and order dated 05.05.2013 dismissed the appeal. <br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the said judgement and order of the appellate Court the plaintiff filed Civil Revision No. 1589 of 2013 before the High Court Division and obtained Rule, which was discharged by the impugned judgement and order. Hence, the petitioner has filed the instant civil petition for leave to appeal before this Division.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Ashad Ullah, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the petitioner and proforma respondent No. 20 to 24 claimed title to the property by way of inheritance and are in exclusive possession of the suit land since 18.08.1948 and hence, the High Court Division erroneously upheld the order of the lower Courts rejecting the application for injunction. He further submits that the High Court Division failed to consider that the land concerned in Title Suit No. 152 of 1957 and the suit land are not the same and also that the petitioner was not party to the said title suit and hence, the result of the suit is not binding upon the petitioner. Finally, he submits that the High Court Division and the Courts below failed to notice that in view of the long standing exclusive possession of the petitioner in the suit land and title by way of registered deed dated 18.8.1948 balance of convenience and in-convenience is in favour of the petitioner and hence, the High Court Division erred in discharging the Rule.  <br/> <br/>Mr. Mahmudul Islam, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the respondent Nos. 1-10 made submission in support of the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division. <br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates for the parties concerned, perused the impugned judgement and other connected papers on record.<br/> <br/>It is an admitted fact that the suit land was acquired in L.A. Case No. 06 of 1948-49 and although steps have been taken for release of the land from acquisition, the applicants have not succeeded in getting the land released. According to section 5 (7) of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948 the land having been duly acquired and compensation paid, it vests absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances. Hence, the title in the property is no longer with the petitioner. We note from the plaint that the petitioner has not included any prayer for declaration of title and hence, in any event, the prayer for temporary injunction is not sustainable.<br/> <br/>In the impugned judgement the High Court Division observed that as per the admission of the plaintiff-petitioner the suit land of Title Suit No. 05 of 2002 was acquisitioned vide L.A. Case No. 06 of 1948-49 and that the plaintiff-petitioner is yet to be successful in releasing the said suit property from the list of acquisition and requisition and that his right to the suit land is yet to be established. It was further noted that there is no record of rights in respect of the suit land in the name of the plaintiff-petitioner and that there is no rent receipt to show that the plaintiff-petitioner is in physical possession in the suit land. The High Court Division concluded that “the plaintiff-petitioner is yet to establish his right, title and possession in the suit land by way of releasing the suit land from the list of acquisition and requisition. So long the plaintiff-petitioner is unable to establish his title and possession in the suit-acquired land he cannot get any relief of temporary injunction.”     <br/> <br/>In the light of the discussion above, we find that the impugned judgement does not suffer from any illegality or infirmity and does not call for any interference. Accordingly, the civil petition for leave to appeal is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Their case, in short, is that the suit land comprising 1.80 acres out of total 2.87 acres of R.O.R. Khatian Nos.23, 25 and 26 and C.S. Khatian No.20 of Sheikh Shadi mouza, P.S.-Melandha, District-Jamalpur along with other land belonged to Bebuillah Sheikh-the predecessor of the plaintiffs and Nabu Sheikh, Vadu Sheikh and Gendi and C.S. khatian was accordingly published. That Babuillah Sheikh died leaving 2 sons Nabu Sheikh and Vadu Sheikh and daughter Gendi as his heirs. Thereafter, Gendi died leaving brothers Nabu Sheikh and Vadu Sheikh. Nabu Sheikh and Vedu Sheikh were in possession of entire 2.87 acres of land. Nabu Sheikh died leaving behind daughter plaintiff No.1, son Ayub Ali-predecessor of plaintiff Nos.2 to 8 and another son named Najimuddin-predecessor of the plaintiff Nos.9 to 14. Vadu Sheikh died leaving behind 3 daughters and 3 sons, the plaintiff Nos.15 to 19 and Salimuddin who died leaving behind plaintiff Nos.20 to 26 as his heirs. Thus the plaintiffs inherited the suit property and enjoyed the suit property continuously for more than 12 years. In suit plot Nos.384 and 386 the plaintiffs have their homestead and have been residing therein with their families. The plaintiffs have been possessing other lands in ejmali through cultivation. That during R.O.R. operation the suit property was wrongly recorded and only 1.07 acres of land out of total 2.87 acres of land was recorded in Khatian No.24 in the name of the predecessor of the plaintiffs and the suit land comprising 1.80 acres of land was erroneously recorded in the name of the defendants and thereby a cloud being created the plaintiffs instituted the suit for declaration of their title.<br/> <br/>The defendant Nos.1, 2 and 8 contested the suit by filing written statement. The material case of these defendants is that the entire 2.87 acres of land of the suit plots was made khas by the owners as the previous tenants defaulted in payment of rent and thereafter the said land was settled afresh in the name of different persons and the predecessor of the plaintiffs got settlement of 1.07 acres of land out of the suit plots and creating a new holding they paid rents for the same. That out of remaining 1.80 acres of land Bhajan Ali took settlement of .60 acre and possessed the same peacefully and after the death of Bhajan Ali his 3 sons, named, Azam, Miar and Nizam Ali owned that property. That Azam Ali sold his share to Hossain Ali. Miaruddin died leaving heirs. The R.S. Khatian was duly prepared in their names. That Yakub Ali took settlement of .60 acre of land and the record of right was duly prepared in his name. Yakub Ali died leaving Abdul Gafur and others as his heirs. Abdul Gafur subsequently died leaving defendant No.1 Nowsher Ali and others as his. Nowsher Ali purchased .7½ acre of land by registered kabala dated 01.03.1973 from Kaser. Nazer Ali sold his share to defendant No.1 Nowsher Ali and others by registered kabala dated 25.03.1975. Hafizuddin and others also sold their share to defendant No.1 Nowsher Ali and others. Haji Fakir sold .08 acre of land to Suruj Ali-the defendant No.2. That Hossain Ali Fakir took settlement of the remaining .60 acre of land and possessed the same. After the death of Hossain Ali Fakir his heirs Newaz and others possessed that land. That Ayuzuddin-son of Hossain Ali sold some land to Jamaluddin. Ahej Ali and others sold some land to Sahar Fakir-the defendant No.8. Thus these defendants have acquired the suit land and have been possessing the same. That the plaintiffs have filed this suit on false claim and as such it is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>The trial court, on consideration of the evidence adduced by both the parties, dismissed the suit by the judgment and decree dated 31.07.1993 making observation to the effect that though the plaintiffs have proved their title in the suit land, but they could not prove their possession in the suit land and that the suit is also barred by limitation. Against this judgment and decree of the trial court the plaintiffs preferred Other Appeal No.53 of 1993 before the learned District Judge, Jamalpur who, by the judgment and order dated 29.03.1995, allowed that appeal and set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court and decreed the suit declaring plaintiffs’ title in the suit land. The appellate court found that the plaintiffs had both title and possession in the suit land and the suit was not barred by limitation. Against this judgment and decree of the appellate court below the contesting  defendants preferred the above mentioned Civil Revision No.2622 of 1995 before the High Court Division and obtained rule. A Division Bench of the High Court Division, after hearing both the parties, made that rule absolute by setting aside the judgment and decree of the appellate court below and restoring those of the trial court by the impugned judgment and order. The High Court Division made observations to the effect that the plaintiffs could not prove their possession in the entire suit land and that the suit was barred by limitation.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by this judgment and order of the High Court Division the plaintiffs preferred Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.508 of 2004 before this Division. This Division granted leave to consider the submissions of the learned Advocate-on-Record for the plaintiff-leave-petitioners to the effect that in this suit the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs proved sufficiently that the plaintiffs came to know about the wrong recording of the suit land in the record of right on 17.10.1985 only when they went to pay rent and there being no evidence to the contrary, the High Court Division erred in law without discussing and considering the evidence of the P.Ws. in holding that by the evidence it has not been substantiated on what date the plaintiffs went to pay rent; that the High Court Division without discussing and considering the evidence on record has wrongly and illegally found that the plaintiffs could not prove their possession in the suit property while the appellate court below has elaborately and exhaustively discussed and considered the evidence on record and found that the plaintiffs are in possession of the suit land.<br/> <br/>Mr. Subrata Saha, the learned Advocate for the appellants has made submissions before us to the effect that in this suit both the trial court and the appellate court below, considering the facts, circumstances and the evidence on record, found that the plaintiffs have title in the suit land; that the trial court though found that the plaintiffs could not prove their possession in the suit land, but the appellate court below, on proper appreciation of the evidence adduced by both the parties, rightly found that the plaintiffs have been able to prove their possession in the suit land; but the High Court Division most arbitrarily and abruptly, without making any discussion of any evidence at all and without controverting the findings and decision of the appellate court below and also the trial court made observations to the effect that the plaintiffs could not prove their title and also possession in the suit land. The learned Advocate for the appellants has argued that the High Court Division committed wrong and also great injustice in making the above observation without making any discussion at all and without reversing the clear findings and decision of the appellate court below as to title and possession of the plaintiffs in the suit land and the clear decision of the trial court also as to title of the plaintiffs in the suit land. The learned Advocate has argued also that in this suit it is rather an admitted fact that the plaintiffs’ predecessors were the original owners of the suit land and the suit land was duly recorded in the C.S. khatian in the name of the plaintiffs’ predecessors; that the contesting defendants though have alleged that the predecessors of the plaintiffs defaulted in payment of rent and as such the original landlords took back the suit land from them and subsequently they settled the same with different persons including the predecessors-in-interest of the plaintiffs and the predecessors-in-interest of the defendants, but this defence case has not been substantiated at all by any sort of evidence; that both the trial court and the appellate court below, therefore, rightly found plaintiffs’ title in the suit land, but the High Court Division, ignoring this fact that the defendants could not adduce any evidence whatsoever before court to prove their defence case, most unreasonably and unjustly opined that the plaintiffs could not prove their title also in the suit land. The learned Advocate for the plaintiff-appellants have made submissions to the effect also that this suit is not barred by limitation also as the plaintiffs have proved by sufficient evidence that they knew about the wrong recording of the suit land on 17.10.1985 only and thereafter they filed this suit within a short time; that the appellate court below, on thorough examination and consideration of the evidence adduced by both the parties rightly found that the plaintiffs filed the suit for declaration of their title within the statutory period of limitation and as such the suit is not barred by limitation.<br/> <br/>Mr. Awlad Ali, the learned Senior Advocate for the defendant-respondents has made submissions supporting the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division. The learned Senior Advocate has argued that the High Court Division though did not make elaborate discussion in the impugned judgment, but it examined and considered the evidence on record thoroughly and found rightly that the plaintiffs failed to prove their title and possession in the suit land and the suit is also barred by limitation. The learned Senior Advocate has contended that the findings and decision of the High Court Division being correct this appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Counsel of both the sides and gone through the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division, those of the appellate court below and the trial court and also the evidence on record.<br/> <br/>In this suit it is not disputed, rather admitted that the suit land originally belonged to the predecessors of the plaintiffs. In the C.S. khatian also the suit land was recorded in the name of the predecessors of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have claimed that they have acquired the suit land by way of inheritance from their predecessors-the recorded owners of the land and have been possessing the same peacefully for more than 12 years. The contesting defendants though have pleaded a case to the effect that since the original tenants of the suit land defaulted in payment of rent the landlords took the entire 2.87 acres of land of the suit plots under their khas possession and subsequently the landlords settled those lands afresh with different persons including the predecessors of the plaintiffs and also the predecessors of the defendants, but this case of the defendants has not been substantiated at all by any evidence. Both the trial court and the appellate court below, on consideration of the facts and circumstances and the evidence on record disbelieved this case of the contesting defendants and found  plaintiffs’ tile in the suit land. The trial court in his judgment made specific observation to the effect that the contesting defendants could not prove their alleged title in the suit land rather the plaintiffs have got title in the suit land. Against this clear observations and findings of the trial court the contesting defendants did not prefer any appeal or cross appeal. However, considering the evidence on record and the facts and circumstances we also, in agreement with the trial court and also the appellate court below, find that in this suit it has been well proved that the plaintiffs have title in the suit land.<br/> <br/>As regards possession the trial court though found that the plaintiffs could not prove their possession in the suit land, but the appellate court below, on thorough examination and consideration of the evidence adduced by both the parties, found that the plaintiffs proved their possession also in the suit land. The High Court Division without discussing any evidence of any of the parties at all and without adverting to the findings and decision of the appellate court below and reversing those, and without giving any reasoning even of its own most arbitrarily made observation to the effect that the plaintiffs could not prove their possession in the entire suit property. However, we have examined the evidence adduced by both the parties.<br/> <br/>It appears that in this suit the plaintiffs have examined 4 witnesses while the defendants have examined 3 witnesses. The P.W.1 is the plaintiff No.2 himself. This witness has deposed fully corroborating the plaintiffs’ case and has asserted also that the plaintiffs are in possession of the entire suit land. The P.W.2 has deposed supporting the plaintiffs’ possession in the suit land. The P.W.3 also has deposed supporting the plaintiffs’ possession in the suit land and has denied the defendants’ possession in the suit land. The P.W.4 also has deposed stating that the plaintiffs have been possessing the suit land and that the defendants do not possess the suit land. On the otherhand the witnesses of the defendants’ side, namely, the D.Ws. 2 and 3 though in their examination-in-chief has stated that the defendants are in possession of the suit land, but in course of cross-examination the D.W.2 has stated that at present the defendants do not possess the suit land and the D.W.3 has stated that at present none of the parties possessed the suit land. The above evidence of both the contesting parties coupled with the facts that the plaintiffs are the heirs of the admitted original owners of the suit land and there is no evidence to prove that plaintiffs’ predecessors’ title in the suit land was extinguished-prove sufficiently that the plaintiffs are in possession of the suit land. The appellate court below on thorough analysis and consideration of the evidence adduced by both the parties and the facts and circumstances rightly found that the plaintiffs have been possessing the suit land.<br/> <br/>The trial court though found that this suit, being not filed within 6 years from the date of the plaintiffs’ knowledge about recording of the suit land in the name of the defendants, is barred by limitation, but the appellate court below, on careful examination of evidence on record, found that the plaintiffs have proved sufficiently that they could know about the wrong recording of the suit land in the names of the defendants on 17.10.1985 only and as such this suit filed within 6 years from 17.10.1985 is not barred by limitation. The appellate court below made observations to the effect also that there is no evidence at all on record to prove that the plaintiffs had knowledge about the wrong recording of the suit land in the name of the defendants before 17.10.1985 and in the circumstances there was no reason not to believe the plaintiffs assertion that they could know about wrong recording of the suit land only on 17.10.1985. We have also examined the evidence on record and found no reason to disagree with these findings and decision of the appellate court below the plaintiffs have title in the suit land and they have also proved their possession in the suit land. The plaintiffs have adduced evidence to prove that they could know about the wrong recording of the suit land on 17.10.1985 only. There is no evidence on record to prove that the plaintiffs had knowledge about the wrong recording of the suit land before 17.10.1985. In the circumstances the appellate court below rightly found this suit for declaration of title not barred by limitation.<br/> <br/>Before drawing the end we like to make some comments about the impugned judgment of the High Court Division. It has already been pointed out above that the High Court Division, without making any discussion of any evidence at all and without adverting to the findings and decision and the reasoning thereof made by the appellate court below, set aside the judgment and decree of the appellate court below-the last court of fact. The High Court Division did not bother even to make any reasoning as to why it set aside the judgment of the appellate court below. When the High Court Division, in exercising its revisional jurisdiction, concurs with the findings and decision made by the appellate court below it (High Court Division) may not make elaborate discussion of the evidence on record, but even then also it must give reasonings of its concurring with the findings and decision of the appellate court below. In the present case the High Court Division set aside the judgment and decree of the appellate court below without making any discussion of the evidence on record and without giving any reasoning at all of doing so. We, with high dissatisfaction, deprecate writing of this sort of judgments by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>However, from the above discussion it is evident that this appeal deserves to be allowed.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hence it is Ordered</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>            That the appeal be allowed with cost. The impugned judgment of the High Court Division be set aside and the judgment and decree of the appellate court below be upheld.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Superintendent, Dhaka Cantonment, Dhaka. Thereafter, she got allotment of House No. 57/E(E-Class), Azimpur in her capacity as Deputy Assistant Finance Controller, F.C. (Army, Pa-2), Dhaka Cantonment, Dhaka  vide Memo No. 57/E Azimpur/98 dated 15.4.2012 issued by the Respondent No. 5, Assistant Director, Directorate of Government Housing. However, the Petitioner not having been inducted into the possession of the house, the Respondent No. 5 by Memo No. 66/F-Azimpur/125 dated 9.5.2012 allotted afresh the property being House No. 66/F (E-Class), Azimpur, Dhaka in her favour. It is noted that the Petitioner is, however, yet to take possession of that property.<br/><br/>It has so transpired that while the allotment of 9.5.2012 remained current and valid with the Petitioner by that date having been  kept waiting for over a year and half in the hope that she would eventually be given possession of the property so allotted her, the Respondent No. 5 curiously, and without further explanation or prior notice to the Petitioner as a prior and current allottee, allotted the said property, i.e. House No. 66/F (E-Class), Azimpur Dhaka vide Memo No. 66/F, Azimpur/160/2 dated 26.11.2013 in the name of one Syeda Monjuara Sultana, Assistant Professor, Department of Zoology, Eden Women College, Dhaka, i.e. the Respondent No. 6.<br/><br/>It is only subsequent to this second allotment to the Respondent No. 6 that the Respondent No. 5 issued the Impugned Memo No. 54/¢S- Azimpur/167(5) or 54/G, Azimpur/167 dated 5.12.2013 in favour of the Petitioner in respect of House No. 54/¢S-Azimpur/157(5) or 54/G (E-Class) Azimpur, Dhaka by cancelling the earlier allotment of House No. 66/F (E-Class) Azimpur, Dhaka. The Petitioner filed an application on 11.12.2013 before the Respondent No. 2, Director, Directorate of Government Housing praying for maintaining the earlier allotment of House No. 66/F (E-Class), Azimpur dated 9.5.2012 in her name taking care to specifically request a withdrawal of the Memo dated 5.12.2013. It is noted that the Respondent No. 2 has yet to dispose of the said application.<br/><br/>It is against this backdrop that the Petitioner has stressed upon and has raised her core contention that the allotment of 9.5.2012 in her favour represents an undertaking given her by the Respondent No. 5. Fundamental to that undertaking, the Petitioner submits, is an assurance of a certain and predictable course of conduct to be pursued in due course in the regular discharge of administrative functions by the Respondent No. 5 that, in the circumstances, can be reasonably expected to culminate in the delivery of possession of the allotted property to the Petitioner.<br/><br/>It is also the crux of the Petitioner’s case that in discharging his administrative functions the Respondent No. 5 is expected to act fairly and reasonably, thereby, negating any possibility of him veering away or deviating from the regular course of conduct evidenced in and initiated by the issuance of the allotment letter of 9.5.2012 and doing something as is wholly unexpected in the facts and circumstances. But regrettably that is exactly what the Respondent No. 5 appears to have done by issuing the second letter of allotment of 26.11.2013 in favour of the Respondent No. 6 without prior notice to and consultation with the Petitioner.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the fact that she had been waiting for a year and a half, according to the Petitioner, also reflects the Petitioner patiently hoping that she shall eventually indeed be granted possession of the property in question as per the clear terms of the allotment of 9.5.2012 as was to all intents and purposes still extant, current and valid when the Respondent No. 6 was allotted the same property on 26.11.2013. Such introduction in the facts and circumstances of the Respondent No. 6 as a rival claimant to House No. 66/F (E-Class), Azimpur on 5.12.2013 establishes that the Petitioner’s long wait upon reliance of the initial allotment to her has been in vain and she has had, therefore, to act to her detriment relying on the representation so reflected in the allotment to her of 9.5.2012. It is, accordingly, argued by the learned Advocate for the Petitioner, Mr. M. Belayet Hossain that the Respondent No. 5 in particular and the other Respondents in general must now, therefore, be estopped from so unexpectedly altering their position and deviating from an expected course of action as evident in the memo dated 9.5.2012.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the Respondent No. 6, Mr. Mohammad Idrisur Rahman while acknowledging that the cancellation of the Petitioner’s initial allotment came belatedly on 5.12.2013 in a manner as is opaque and peremptory given that no reason is cited for the cancellation, submits nevertheless that by the very terms of the Rule Nisi issued this Application may be disposed of in a manner favourable to the Petitioner but limited to directing the disposal of the Petitioner’s application dated 11.12.2013 to the Respondent No. 2, Director, Directorate of Government Housing for maintaining her initial allotment. Mr. Idrisur Rahman argues that it would not be for this Court in judicial review in disposing the Rule Nisi in Mandamus to proceed further and direct the concerned Respondents as to the manner in which such application may be disposed of or indeed what the outcome of such disposal shall be. It is in this context that Mr. Rahman submits that the Court would be exceeding the perimeter of the Rule Nisi issued by additionally determining the legality or not of the Memo of cancellation dated 5.12.2013.<br/><br/>By referring to an application for vacating the Order of Stay on behalf of the Respondent No. 6, Mr. Rahman has stressed that in this factual milieu this Court may further not lose sight of the fact that the relative ranking of the official status of the Petitioner and the Respondent No. 6 in fact better entitles the latter by reason of her length of cadre service, pay scale, rank and status as Assistant Professor to have an edge over the Petitioner. In this regard he has referred to Rule 4 of the Bangladesh Allocation Rules of 1982 contending that the Respondent No. 6 by reason of her higher pay scale has a far superior right to be allotted an ‘E’ Type property as the case property than the Petitioner.<br/><br/>Upon considering the facts and circumstances as above this Court is immediately reminded of Lord Denning’s dictum in <em>Central London Property Trust Ltd. vs. High Trees House Ltd.</em>  Reported in <em>(1947) 1KB 130 </em>thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Where parties enter into an arrangement which is intended to create legal relation between them and in pursuance of such arrangement one party makes a promise to the other which he knows will be acted on and which is in fact acted on by the promise, the Court will treat the promise as binding on the provisions to the extent that it will not allow him to act inconsistently with it…” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>This Court notes that the notion of reasonableness of administrative action central to Lord Denning’s dictum above was of course enunciated by Lord Greene in <em>Associated Provincial Picture House Ltd. vs. Wednesbury</em> <em>Corp</em> reported in <em>(1948) 1Kb 223, </em>and<em> (1947) 2All ER 680</em>. Furthermore, Lord Diplock in the <em>CCSU Case</em> before the House of Lords reported in <em>(1985) 1 AC 374</em> and <em>(1984) 3 All ER 935 HL</em> aptly equated irrationality as constituting <em>Wednesbury unreasonabless</em>. The House of Lords, therefore, in the <em>CCSU Case</em> found irrationality to be evident in</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“a decision so outrageous in its defiance of logic… that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it”</em>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>This Court has no reservation in accepting that the facts in this present case represent a classic example of such irrational behavior peremptorily taken as evident both in the allotment of the case property on  26.11.2013 to the Respondent No. 6 and subsequent cancellation of the Petitioner’s initial allotment of 9.5.2012 by the Memo of 5.12.2013. <br/><br/>It is in that context that a catena of cases cited by Mr. M. Belayet Hossain ranging from <em>Confederation of Ex-Servicemen Association vs. Union of India</em> reported in <em>AIR 2006 SC 2945, Syed SM Hasan vs. Bangladesh </em>reported in <em>60 DLR (AD)(2008),76</em> to <em>Union of India vs. Hindustan Development Corpn.</em> reported in <em>AIR SC 1994, 988</em>  finds merit for consideration by this Court as reflecting <em>ratio decidendii</em> inspired by the dicta of Lords Denming, Greene and Diplock cited above. It is in the Indian jurisdiction, in particular, that these dicta have been relied upon to broaden the notion of administrative fair play as an essential component of discharge of public service. Discharge of administrative functions with transparency and accountability have emerged as the cornerstone of establishing Rule of Law from which no derogation is permissible. Lapses in this regard marked by arbitrary exercise of discretionary power, thereby, adversely affecting individual interests are readily made subject to judicial review. The objective here being that fair administration must always live up to the legitimate expectation of regularity in administrative functions achieved chiefly by aiming at serving both individual and the larger public interest.<br/>The Indian Supreme Court, in particular, has visited these concepts admirably and extensively in several cases of which those reported in <em>AIR 1996 SC 2410 </em>and <em>AIR SC 1994, 988 </em>prove to be particularly noteworthy to this Court.<br/><br/>In <em>Shangrila Food Products Ltd.vs. L.I.C. of India</em> reported in <em>AIR 1996 SC 2410, </em>the Indian Supreme Court found on notions of honesty, integrity and fair play as enure to the benefit of the main constituents of administrative decisions, i.e. an affected party thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“…This jurisdiction of the High Court, being extraordinary, is normally exercisable keeping in mind the principles of equity. One of the ends of the equity is to promote honesty and fair play. If there be any unfair advantage gained by a party priorly, before invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court, the Court can take into account the unfair advantage gained and can require the party to shed the unfair gain before granting relief”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Supreme Court had indeed earlier made a broad survey of the centrality of the concept of <em>“legitimate expectation”</em> in the entire debate on good administration in <em>Union of India vs. Hindustan Development Corpn.</em> reported in <em>AIR SC 1994, 988</em> thus:  </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“There is no unfettered discretion in public law. A public authority possesses powers only to use them for public good. This imposes the duty to act fairly and to adopt a procedure which is ‘fair play in action.’ Due observance of this obligation as part of good administration raises a reasonable or legitimate expectation in every citizen to be treated fairly in his interaction with the State and its instrumentalities, with this element forming a necessary component of the decision making process in all State actions. To satisfy this requirement of non-arbitrariness in a State action, it is, therefore, necessary to consider and given due weight to the reasonable or legitimate expectations of the persons likely to be affected by the decision or else that unfairness in the exercise of the power may amount o an abuse or excess of power apart from affecting the bona fides o the decision in a given case. The decision so made would be exposed to challenge on the ground of arbitrariness. Rule of law does not completely eliminate discretion in the exercise of power, as it is unrealistic, but provides for control of its exercise by judicial review. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>The mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen, in such a situation, may not by itself be a distinct enforceable right, but failure to consider and given due weight to it may render the decision arbitrary, and this is how the requirement of due consideration of a legitimate expectation forms part of the principle of non-arbitrariness, a necessary concomitant of the rule of law.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In so enunciating the concept of legitimate expectation the Supreme Court subscribed to its classic interpretation in the English jurisdiction thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>            “In Halsbury’s Laws of England, Fourt Edition, Volume 1(1) 151, a passage explaining the scope of “legitimate expectations” runs thus: </em><br/><em>            “81, Legitimate expectations. A person may have a legitimate expectation of being treated in a certain way by an administrative authority even though he has no legal right in private law to receive such treatment. The expectation may arise either from a representation or promise made by the authority, including an implied representation, or from consistent past practice. </em><br/><em>            The existence of a legitimate expectation may have a number of different consequentces; it may give locus standi to seek leave to apply for judicial review, it may mean that the authority ought not to act so as to defeat the expectation without some overriding reason of public policy to justify its doing so;”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It is predicated on the enunciation above of safeguarding individual interests against the administrative behemoth that the Indian Supreme Court further invoked the factor of public interest served by an accountable and transparent decision-making machinery thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>  “<em>Whenever the question arises, it is to be determined not according to the claimant’s perception but in larger public interest wherein other more important considerations may outweigh what would otherwise have been the legitimate expectation of the claimant.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Sadly, this case fails in all respect to live up to the standards of good and sound administration as comes across in the dicta above. Devoid of transparency, shorn of reasons given, marked by absolute disregard of the Petitioner’s interests, and resulting in a decision unilaterally made, and peremptorily so, the Impugned Order of cancellation and re-allotment reeks of decision-makers acting arbitrarily at their own sweet will. This Court finds that this state of affairs does not indeed bode well for good public administration or indeed public interest.<br/><br/>In the context above, and contrary to what the learned Advocate for the Respondent No. 6 has sought to stress upon by highlighting the limited scope for intervention in Mandamus, it is first and foremost to be noted in the facts and circumstances that the Petitioner’s application of 11.12.2013 to the Respondent No. 2, as reflected in Prayer ‘A’ of this Writ Petition and resultantly transported into the Rule Nisi, importantly contemplates a withdrawal of the Annexure- ‘F’ Memo No. 54/G, Azimpur/167 dated 5.12.2013 as is in evidence of a cancellation of her earlier allotment. It is this Court’s opinion that Prayer ‘A’ so construed is not one of Mandamus simpliciter but significantly reflects an impugnment of the Annexure-‘F’ Memo of 5.12.2013 in additionally seeking its cancellation/withdrawal precisely because the Petitioner deems its issuance and continued effect to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect. Indeed, the cancellation of the Memo of 5.12.2013 appears to this Court to be a prerequisite for considering the Petitioner’s representation as evident in her application to the Respondent No. 2 dated 11.12.2013. That intent of the Petitioner for withdrawal and cancellation of the Memo of 5.12.2013 is clearly further evident in Prayer ‘B’ of the Writ Petition in which she has expressly sought ancillary relief to be granted in the form of being inducted into the possession of the disputed case property being House No. 66/F (E-Class), Azimpur, Dhaka. In other words, the Petitioner’s prayer for consideration of her application dated 11.12.2013 clearly, in this Court’s opinion, presupposes and is predicated upon the illegitimacy of the action of the Respondent No. 5 in issuing the cancellation Memo of 5.12.2013 as well as the second allotment of the same property issued on 26.11.2013 in favour of the Respondent No. 6.<br/><br/>There is indeed found no constraints for this Court to mould its response to the Petitioner’s case in a manner where Orders in Mandamus and Certiorari may issue in tandem should the facts so demand. This combination of Certiorari and Mandamus by which a decision can be quashed and simultaneously a direction may ensue for a matter to be considered in accordance with law is known as<strong><em> “certiorarified mandamus”</em></strong>. This Court holds that such a moulding of relief becomes necessary when equity needs to be served and there is need for an appropriate remedy in judicial review to evolve in the facts and circumstances to further the course of justice within the available constitutional range. As held in <em>Supreme Court Bar Assn vs. Union of India</em> reported in <em>(1998) 4 SCC 409</em> the Court may indeed balance equities between conflicting claims of litigating parties by <em>“ironing out the creases”</em> as it were. Indeed, <em>Mukharji, J</em> aptly observed in <em>ITC Ltd. Vs. State of Karnataka</em> reported in <em>1985 Supp SCC 476: 1985 Supp (1)SCR 145 </em>that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>            ““Thou shall not do’t” used to be the previous form of remedy encouraged by courts. But the new attitude is towards positive affirmative actions, directing people or authorities concerned that “thou shall do’t” in this manner.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>This Court, therefore, see no reason why an Order in <em>Certiorarified Mandamus</em> will not issue requiring the Respondents to dispose of the Petitioner’s application dated 11.12.2013 in a manner wholly favourable to her and in keeping with the terms and tenor of the original allotment in her favour dated 9.5.2012. This Court is equally inclined now to declare both the allotment to Respondent No. 6 of 26.11.2013 and the cancellation Memo of 5.12.2013 to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect. Resultantly both Orders are, hereby, quashed.<br/><br/>It is noted that the additional Rule of 2.9.2014 was issued by this Court on the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Let an additional Rule be issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why issuance of the Memorandum being No. A: Ko: Writ-9/2014/597 dated 26.08.2014 issued by respondent No. 7 directing the respondent No. 3 not to allot House No. 66/F (E-Class), Azimpur, Dhaka in anybody’s favour during pendency of the Rule issued in Writ Petition No. 315 of 2014 (annexure- H) shall not be declared to have been without any lawful authority and is of no legal effect and/or pass such other or further order or orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>That intervention by this Court was intended to be an act of restraining any governmental action pertaining to the disputed case property in any manner prejudicial to the Petitioner’s interest while the initial Rule Nisi of 2.1.2014 awaits final substantive disposal. The Impugned Memo of 26.8.2014 reads to this Court as reflecting an act short of being contumacious of this Court’s authority and more aptly as an act of overly zealous set of Respondents acting out of misplaced and inappropriate concern. By that reason, this Court finds that Impugned Order in this regard to be, consequentially, without lawful authority and of no legal effect as well.<br/><br/>Given the findings and observations above this Court is now inclined to favourably dispose of this case. Accordingly, the Respondent Nos. 2 and 5, in particular, and all the Respondents, in general, are, hereby, directed to dispose of the Petitioner’s application dated 11.12.2013 in a manner that would ensure a due and proper delivery of possession of the case property being House No. 66/F (E-Class), Azimpur, Dhaka in her favour no later than a period of 2 (two) weeks from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this Judgment and Order. All Respondents in this regard shall note that the allotment of 26.11.2013 in favour of the Respondent No. 6 and the cancellation Memo of 5.12.2013 are, hereby, quashed and set aside as being illegal, without lawful authority and of no legal effect<em>.</em><br/><br/>The Respondent Nos. 2 and 5 and all the Respondents in general shall proceed on the basis of the above findings of this Court in determining the favourable disposal of the Petitioner’s application dated 11.12.2013 with the result that the Petitioner at the end of the day is given an unqualified possession of the case property being House No. 66/F (E-Class), Azimpur, Dhaka wholly unencumbered of any rival claim whatsoever including that of the Respondent No. 6.<br/><br/>In the result, both the Rules are made absolute with the observations and directions above.<br/><br/>There is no Order as to costs.<br/><br/>Communicate this Order at once. <br/><br/><strong>        Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

This court finds with firm believe that the DCT concern without lawful authority thereafter proceeded to reopen the assessment, for the assessment year 2006-2007, harassing the assessee-writ-petitioner to travel up to Tax Ombudsmen and to the highest court of the country, incurring a great monetary expenses....(38)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Income Tax Ordinance (XXXVI of 1984)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 83A(5) and 93(1)(2)</strong><br/><strong>As the Tax Inspector has admitted that the assessee-writ-petitioner has submitted the bank statements before him no concealment of the documents can be alleged against the assessee-writ-petitioner. Further it appears that nothing has been said in the affidavit-in-opposition as to the categorical allegation of non-obtaining the prior approval of Inspecting Joint Commissioner, as has been alleged by the assessee-writ-petitioner. The opening version of sub-section 2 of section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 categorically provide that no proceeding under section 93(1) can be initiated unless the criterion of sub section (2) is observed. Therefore, this court finds that the DCT concern has failed to comply the mandatory provision of section 83A(5) and section 93(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 which left the step under section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, nugatory one. . . .(45)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Income Tax Ordinance (XXXVI of 1984)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 93(2)(3)(a)(b) and 94 (2) </strong><br/><strong>It appears from section 94(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 that the limitation of two years have been provided in the said section meaning thereby that the provision of section 93(3)(a) and (b) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 is applicable both for ordinary and the Self Assessment Scheme and in case of Self Assessment Scheme the same became barred after the elapse of two years and the provision of section 93(3)(a) and (b) cannot be invoked after the assessment barred by limitation under the provision of section 94(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. Because, the Self Assessment Scheme is a privilege and on an from the issuance of the receipt by the DCT concern as to receiving of a compliant return the same became finalized which become absolute after the elapse of two years, as provided in section 94(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. But the provision of section 93(2) being applicable for ordinary assessment will remain applicable as against five years of any assessment made in ordinary manner. Therefore, this court also on this count finds that the action taken by the DCT concern in respect of re-opening of the Self Assessment return after two years, by way of serving a notice dated 12.3.2008, calling upon the assessee-writ-petitioner to explain as to his six banks accounts, is a palpable illegality committed by him. . . .

The writ-petitioner is the Director of income tax payee six private limited companies, namely (1) Balaka Hatchery Limited, having TIN. 306-200-4430/Coys-2, (2) Balaka Sweater Industries Limited, having TIN. 306-200-4326/Coys-2, (3) Balaka Composite Textile &amp; Sweater Mills Limited, having TIN. 306-200-4262/Coys-2, (4) Balaka Re-rolling Mills Limited, having TIN. 306-200-4414/Coys-2, (5) Balaka Royel Textile Mills Limited having TIN. 306-200-4414/Coys-2 and (6) Balaka Royel &amp; and Printing Limited and also shareholder of South Point Hospital Limited.<br/> <br/>It has been stated in the writ petitions that the four Textile Mills under the Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation, namely (1) Amin Textile Limited, (2) R.R. Textile Mills Limited, (3) Dost Textile Mills Limited and (4) Valuka Wollen Mills Limited, situated at Foujderhat Industrial Area in Chittagong, manufacturing low cost fabrics, were all loosing concern under the government management and the government was facing severe consecutive loss in those four textile mills for long. In order to save the loss and to pay the dues to the workers, the government decided to run the mills by private entrepreneur and accordingly the writ-petitioner was selected, being a textile expert, for managing the said four textile mills. Thereafter, the writ-petitioner entered into a contract with the Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation (BTMC) as to the management procedure and financial affairs and accordingly obtained loan from 6(six) private Banks namely the (1) Premier Bank Limited, (2) Social Investment Bank Limited, (3) South East Bank Limited, (4) Mutual Trust Bank Limited, (5) Bangladesh Commerce Bank Limited and (6) Jamuna Bank Limited to invest in the said four textile mills for the purpose of importing raw materials from abroad and to maintain the expenses of the said mills including payment of back salaries to the workers. The writ-petitioner, having immense experience in the field, successfully started maintaining the said four textile mills and still doing the same job with success. The writ-petitioner obtained loan of Tk. 395,83,19,572.00 from aforesaid Banks and regularly transacted the said amount in the bank by way of paying back the loan dues and to withdraw the fresh amount from the bank account and in such course of transaction the writ-petitioner had a liability in the bank loan up to the date of filing his income tax return for the assessment year 2006-2007 at an amount of Tk. 18,75,83,796.00 to the said Banks.<br/> <br/>Despite the fact of such loan liability on the shoulder and the payment of income tax regularly, the writ-petitioner had some undisclosed money in his hand and taking the privilege of the S.R.O. No. 200/Ain-2005, dated 6<sup>th</sup> July, 2005, the writ-petitioner declared his previously undisclosed amount and paid income tax on the said undisclosed amount at an amount of Tk. 33,75,000.00 through Pay Order No. 0177135 of the Bank Asia Limited, MCB. Sk. Mujib Road Branch, Chittagong, dated 17.10.2006.<br/> <br/>It has been further stated that the writ-petitioner filed its income tax return for the assessment year 2006-2007 on 18.10.2006 under the Self Assessment Scheme, provided under section 83A(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes, Companies Circle-11, Taxes Zone-2, Chittagong, issued the receipt of the return, which deemed to be the finalization of the assessment for the assessment year 2006-2007. Thereafter, the writ-petitioner by availing the privilege of the S.R.O. being No. 98-Ain/2007, dated 4<sup>th</sup> June, 2007 paid a penalty @ 5% to the tune of Tk. 28,245.00 on his rest undisclosed income for the assessment year 2006-2007 through the Pay Order No. 6591446 of  Sonali Bank Ldt. Agrabad Corporate Branch, Chittagong, on 27.9.2007 and accordingly the writ-petitioner submitted a revised return for the assessment year 2006-2007 to the concerned Deputy Commissioner of Taxes which was duly received.<br/> <br/>It has been stated that thereafter the writ-petitioner received a notice from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes, Companies Circle-2, Taxes Zone-1, Chittagong, issued on 31.5.2005 under the provision of section 83(1) and 79 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 directing him to be present in a hearing on 12.6.2007 in respect of its income tax return for the assessment year 2006-2007.<br/> <br/>The writ-petitioner complied the said notice and the authorized representative of the writ petitioner Mr. Omar Bhattacharjee, ITP submitted all the papers and documents in support of the income from (1) Amin Textile Limited, (2) R.R. Textile Mills Limited, (3) Dost Textile Mills Limited and (4) Valuka Wollen Mills Limited, before the concerned DCT.<br/> <br/>The DCT concern in the meantime made a secret investigation in respect of the writ-petitioners income tax return for the assessment year 2006-2007 through the Tax Inspector of Companies Circle-2, Chittagong, on 8.10.2007 upon which the DCT concern made an assessment on 31.12.2007 for the assessment year 2006-2007 under the provision of section 83A(1), 83A(2)/83(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. Such a proceeding for the assessment being illegal the writ-petitioner preferred a writ petition on 8.5.2008, before the High Court Division and later obtained a rejection of the writ petition as not pressed and thereafter the writ-petitioner filed a complaint petition, being No. 143 dated 19.8.2008, before the Tax Ombudsmen, under the provision of section 13 of the Tax Ombudsmen Act 2005 against the taxes department. The Tax Ombudsmen upon hearing both the parties delivered his recommendation on 24<sup>th</sup> November, 2008 upon which the DCT concern made further assessment on 18.1.2009 relating to the assessment year 2006-2007.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved with and highly dissatisfied by the said assessment order dated 31.12.2007 made by the DCT concern, the writ-petitioner preferred the instant writ petition and obtained the rule as aforementioned.<br/> <br/>In Writ Petition No. 5539 of 2009 similar facts have been stated as to the tax return for the assessment year 2006-2007 with an addition that the writ-petitioner submitted its income tax return for the assessment year 2003-2004, 2004-2005, 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes, Companies Circle-11, Taxes Zone-2, Chittagong, under the Self Assessment Scheme as provided under section 83A of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. But the DCT concern after the proceeding taken in respect of the assessment year 2006-2007 further initiated proceeding under section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 in respect of the assessment year 2003-2004, 2004-2005, 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 and issued show cause notice on 12.3.2008 calling upon the writ-petitioner to explain as to the source of investment and income which have been shown under the provision of S.R.O. 200/Ain/2005, dated 6<sup>th</sup> July, 2005 earlier upon which the writ-petitioner deposited huge amount of taxes. The said notice was received by the writ-petitioner on 30.7.2009 against which the writ-petitioner by a letter seriously objected the said proceeding under section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. That being not stopped by the DCT concern, the writ-petitioner preferred the instant writ petition No. 5535 of 2009 and obtained the rule as aforementioned.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><u>Respondent’s Contentions.</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Pursuant to the service of notice of the rule, the learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir along with the learned Assistant Attorney General Ms. Nurun Nahar and Mr. Saikat Basu, appeared on behalf of the Taxes Department and filed affidavit-in-opposition in the respective writ petition.<br/> <br/>In Writ Petition No. 4761 of 2009 the taxes department stated that the writ-petitioner was asked to explain the source from where the money was deposited to the bank. But the writ petitioner failed to mention/explain the source of fund and as the writ petitioner did not mention the assessment year in respect of deposit of tax at an amount of Tk. 33,75,000.00 as per S.R.O. 200/Ain/2005, dated 6<sup>th</sup> July, 2005, the said declared undisclosed income was remained un-interfered, unchanged by the Tax Ombudsmen as well as the DCT concern. The issuance of receipt under section 83A(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 is not the final assessment rather the return may be selected for further proceeding as per the section 83A(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and on the basis of definite information regarding concealment of income as per the provision of section 83A(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, the said declared undisclosed income was incredible, absurd, irrelevant, inconsistent against the deposited money of Tk. 395,83,19,572.00 found in several Bank accounts. The National Board of Revenue (NBR) selected the writ petitioners income tax return, filed under Self Assessment Scheme for the purpose of audit and the DCT concern for the purpose of auditing got local investigation report by the Inspector of taxes, issued letter to the writ petitioner informing his intention of audit and issued the notices under section 83A(1) and 79 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 directing the writ petitioner for production of books of account, asking for documentary evidence in favour of the shown income, expenditure and other requirement. But the writ petitioner filed a complain before the Honorable Tax Ombudsmen. The writ petitioner failed to produce documents before the Tax Ombudsmen to improve his case and accordingly the Tax Ombudsmen did not interfere the order of the assessment of the DCT concern who put his observation and recommendation regarding the complaint through his recommendation dated 28.11.2008. No injustice was committed to the writ petitioner to enabling him to invoke the writ jurisdiction of the High Court Division. The writ petitioner failed to produce any documents for his source of fund deposited in the bank accounts and accordingly the DCT concern was justified in making assessment of the selected file in accordance with the prior approval of the National Board of Revenue as per the section 83A(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. The DCT concern complied the recommendation of the Tax Ombudsmen and made the assessment on 18.1.2009 under section 83A(1), 83A(2), 83(2), 156 and section 20(2) of the Tax Ombudsmen Act 2005, without waiting for written order from the National Board of Revenue due to the time constraint of sixty days to implement the order of the Tax Ombudsmen. The instant writ petition is not maintainable under the provision of section 33 of the Tax Ombudsmen Act 2005 and accordingly the respondents have prayed for discharge of the rule.<br/> <br/>By a supplementary-affidavit-in-opposition a photocopy of notice dated 22.2.07, issued under <strong>নথি নং- ৩৪৯-১০৬-১০০৩-সা-১১/৯১৯,</strong> has been filed before this court, stating that the supplementary affidavit is very much necessary for proper disposal of the rule. But without any statement as to the said notice in the supplementary affidavit excepting that an audit was held within the meaning of section 83A(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and for the purpose of holding audit a notice dated 22.2.2007 was served upon the assessee-writ petitioner.<br/> <br/>In writ petition No. 5539 of 2009 the Taxes Department stated in the affidavit-in-opposition that the concerned DCT came to notice from different sources that the writ petitioner had been maintaining a number of accounts in different banks. Thereafter, the DCT concern collected the bank statement from the said banks, taken prior approval of the Commissioner of Taxes as per the provision of section 113(f) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and huge amount of money was found deposited in the writ petitioners bank accounts. Accordingly, the DCT concern proceeded to re-open the cases from the assessment year 2003-2004 to 2006-2007, under section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 for concealment of income. Thereafter, issuing the notice, under section 93, 83(1) and 79 and being empowered under the provision of section 93(3)(b) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, the DCT concern re-assessed the income tax cases as he has reason to believe that the writ petitioner has for any assessment year concealed the particulars of his income or furnish inaccurate return thereof or omitted or failed to disclose materials fact for the assessment for such year within five years from the end of assessment year for which the assessment is to be made.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><u>Appraisal of the Facts.  </u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>These two writ petitions relates to the assessment year 2003-2004, 2004-2005, 2005-2006, 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 of the assessee-writ petitioner Nurun Nabi, who having obtained the management of the denationalized Textile Mills namely (1) Amin Textile Limited, (2) R.R. Textile Mills Limited, (3) Dost Textile Mills Limited and (4) Valuka Wollen Mills Limited, previously under the Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation (BTMC), and upon obtaining loan from four private Banks to the tune of Tk. 395,83,19,572.00, started to manage and administer those denationalized textile mills under the agreement with the government of Bangladesh. Admittedly the writ petitioner is a regular income tax payer and submitted all his income tax returns as aforesaid, under the provision of Self Assessment Scheme prevailing at the relevant period under the provision of section 83A of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. The said provision of Self Assessment Scheme indicates that upon submission of the return the DCT concern shall issue a receipt of receiving the return under the Self Assessment Scheme and the said receipt shall be treated as a deemed finalization of the assessment for the relevant assessment year. Accordingly, the writ petitioner upon obtaining the receipt from the DCT concern was satisfied as to his finalization of the assessment for those assessment years from 2003-2004 up to 2007-2008.<br/> <br/>It appears that the National Board of Revenue under the provision of section 83A(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 selected the return of the writ petitioner for the assessment year 2006-2007 for audit and it appears from the subsequent assessment order that the DCT concern upon serving notice under section 83(1) and 79 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 called upon the writ petitioner to submit certain evidence and to attend the hearing of the re-opening of assessment case for the assessment year 2006-2007. Wherefrom, the dispute arose and ultimately the writ petitioner preferred the instant writ petition challenging the re-opening of the assessment case for the assessment year 2006-2007, before this court.<br/>        </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><u>Arguments of the Parties.</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Mosharaf Hossain, appearing on behalf of the assessee-writ-petitioner, while taken this court through the provision of section 83A(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, prevailing during the assessment year 2006-2007, strenuously argued that the National Board of Revenue is empowered under the provision of section 83A(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 to select for an audit of any return, submitted under the Self Assessment Scheme as provided in the said section 83A of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and it is incumbent upon the DCT concern to hold an audit, experte, to make him satisfied as to any prospect of further proceeding with an end to re-open the said assessment and thereafter to serve notice under section 83(1) and 79 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, calling upon the concerned assessee to submit documents supporting the return and to remain present at the hearing of the case. But the DCT concern did not comply the mandatory provision of section 83A(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 in respect of holding an audit, rather directly serve the notice under section 83(1) and 79 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, calling upon the assessee-writ-petitioner to attend the hearing of the re-opened case for the assessment year 2006-2007. That being a palpable illegality the same cannot be sustained under the provision of law and as such the rules are required to be made absolute.<br/><br/>On the other hand the learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir, appearing on behalf of the Taxes Department refuted the argument of the assessee-writ-petitioner and submitted that the DCT concern hold an audit after the return, for the assessment year 2006-2007 was selected for audit by the National Board of Revenue under the provision of section 83A(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 by way of serving a notice dated 22.2.2007, a copy of which has been annexed with the supplementary-affidavit-in-opposition, filed by the Taxes Department. Thereafter, the DCT concern appraising the same direction for his further proceeding to re-open the case, admittedly served notice under section 83(1) and 79 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, calling upon the writ petitioner to attend the hearing and to submit the evidence in support of the return. But that not being complied with, the DCT concern had no other alternative but to proceed in making the assessment order, which being lawful under the provision of law, the same cannot be declared to have been passed without lawful authority.<br/><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir next argued that the writ petitioner availed the provision of Tax Ombudsman Act 2005 and having failed to prove that no audit was held and that any legality committed by the DCT concern, failed to attend the further hearing held by the DCT concern upon getting the recommendation from the Tax Ombudsmen, whereupon the DCT concern further complied the observation as made by the Tax ombudsman and re-assessed the tax liability of the writ petitioner, which being lawful has been erroneously challenged in the instant writ petitions and therefore the rules are required to be discharged by this court.<br/><br/>Further from the Writ Petition No. 5539 of 2009 it appears that the DCT concern upon delivering the re-assessment order in respect of the assessment year 2006-2007, further found that huge amount of transaction has been made by the assessee-writ-petitioner in different banks which was not disclosed earlier in the returns filed under Self Assessment Scheme for the assessment year 2003-2004, 2004-2005, 2005-2006, 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 and thereafter the DCT concern upon serving a notice under section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 re-opened those assessment years and upon obtaining a report from the Tax Inspector served a different notice upon the writ petitioner lastly on 4.5.2008, but as the writ petitioner preferred the instant writ petition, the same was stopped at that stage.<br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Mosharaf Hossain vigorously argued that the DCT concern committed palpable illegality in re-opening the deemed finalized assessment for the assessment year 2003-2004, 2004-2005, 2005-2006 and 2007-2008 since the assessee-writ-petitioner did not conceal any of the bank transaction as made in respect of the accounts maintained with different banks relating to the denationalized enterprises, as the assessee-writ-petitioner upon disclosing his earlier undisclosed income availed the privilege of S.R.O. No. 200/Ain-2005 dated 6.7.2005 and S.R.O. being No. 98-Ain/2007, dated 4<sup>th</sup> June, 2007 and paid a huge amount income tax. Moreover, the Tax Inspector in his report categorically stated about the liability of the assessee-writ-petitioner amounting to Tk. 22,00,00,000.00  which indicates that there is no concealment as to any income of the writ-petitioner for those assessment years.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Mosharaf Hossain next argued that by inserting the provision of section 83A(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 through the Finance Act 2003, the legislature has empowered the DCT concern to re-open a Self Assessment return deemed to be finalized by issuance of the receipt, if definite information came to the possession of the DCT concern. This empowerment made available to the DCT concern to the provision of section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and any Self Assessment return may be re-opened under such provision subject to the provision of section 94 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, which prescribed the time limit for such re-opening. The learned Advocate Mr. Mosharaf Hossain, contends that the DCT concern in the instant case failed to understand the implication of section 94 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and without obtaining the prior approval of the Inspecting Joint Commissioner proceeded to re-open the assessment as aforesaid and therefore the instant rule challenging the illegal step taken by the DCT concern is required to be made absolute as have been taken without lawful authority.<br/><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir in this respect meticulously argued that the provision of section 83A(5) is an independent provision as it contains a non-obstantive clause indicating that irrespective of the provision of re-opening of a deemed assessment under the provision of section 83A(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, the DCT concern may proceed to reopen any of the Self Assessment Scheme deemed finalized assessment, if definite knowledge of concealment reached to the hands of the DCT concern and in the instant case the DCT concern upon obtaining definite knowledge of bank transaction of a huge amount served the notice under section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, being empowered under the provision of section 83A(5) read with section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and all those assessment years having been within five years, the DCT concern lawfully served the notice.<br/><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir further argued that the DCT concern lawfully proceeded to reopen the deemed finalization of the tax liability for the assessment year 2003-2004, 2004-2005, 2005-2006, 2006-2007 and 2007-2008, since the privilege obtained by the assessee-writ-petitioner under the provision of S.R.O. No. 200/Ain-2005 dated 6.7.2005 and S.R.O. being No. 98-Ain/2007, dated 4<sup>th</sup> June, 2007 cannot be treated as have been a fact of non-concealment of income of the assessee-writ-petitioner, since the Tax Inspector in his report categorically stated that the assessee-writ-petitioner transacted huge amount in the bank account but did not mention the same  in the Self Assessment return, filed for those assessment years and that being the definite and constructive knowledge of the DCT concern, the issuance of notice under section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 was quite lawful and as such the instant rule is required to be discharged.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><em><u>Deliberation of the Court.</u></em></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>We have heard the learned Advocates and perused the materials on record and we have also meticulously considered the supplementary affidavit being annexed with the photocopy of a notice dated 22.2.2007 and also the respective assessment order passed by the DCT concern, initially for the assessment year 2006-2007 dated 31.12.2007.<br/> <br/>The pertinent question raised in writ petition No. 4761 of 2009 is relating to whether the DCT concern complied the provision of section 83A(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. For a better appraisal we do reproduce the provision of section 83A(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 prevailing during the assessment year 2006-2007:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong><em><u>Income Tax Ordinance 1984</u></em></strong><br/><strong><em><u>Section 83A:</u></em></strong><strong><em> Self Assessment.—</em></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>(1)..........................</em><br/><em>(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1) and section 93, the Board or any authority subordinate to the Board, if so authorized by the Board in this behalf, may select, in the manner to be determined by the Board,[a portion, not exceeding twenty percent.] of the returns filed under sub-section (1) and refer the returns so selected to the Deputy commissioner of Taxes for the purpose of audit and the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes shall thereupon proceed, if so required, to make the assessment under section 83 or section 84, as the case may be;</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>Provided that the Deputy commissioner of Taxes shall not proceed to make any audit in respect of a return, where such return is filed in accordance with rules for self assessment made by the Board for that year and shows at least fifteen percent, higher income than the income last assessed, even if the return is selected for audit.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The aforesaid provision of section 83A(2) of the Income Tax ordinance 1984 is a mandatory provision so far the question of holding an audit is concerned, since the provision contains a <em>“<u>shall</u>” </em>which further indicates that upon holding the audit, the DCT concern shall make him satisfy as to the requirement of further proceeding in respect of reopening of the deemed finalized assessment and thereafter he could assess the relevant return under the provision of section 83 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, if the assessee-writ-petitioner remained present at the hearing or under the provision of section 84 if the assessee failed to comply the notice and to attend the hearing before the DCT concern. In any case the holding of an audit is a mandatory one.<br/><br/>         In this respect the referred case of Spectra S.N. Tex Limited-Vs-The Commissioner of Taxes, reported in Income Tax Reference No. 39 of 2012, wherein one of us was a party decided as under;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>The provision of section 82BB(3) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 has an indication that upon auditing the return if the DCT concern considers for fresh assessment, he can proceed for assessment afresh. This provision indicates the two way exercise in the matter, firstly ‘Audit’ and then if required ‘fresh assessment.’ Because, these two words have been used in the section in disjunctive manner indicating step to be taken one after another.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Therefore, it appears that the holding of an audit is a must one.<br/> <br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir relied upon the notice Annexure-A in the supplementary affidavit-in-opposition filed in Writ Petition No. 4761 of 2009 and submited that the DCT concern lawfully hold the audit after getting the selection of the Self Assessment return from the National Board of Revenue for audit and therefore the main ground as has been taken by the assessee-writ-petitioner goes. This has prompted us to meticulously examine the point as to the fact of holding of audit by the DCT concern prior to reopening of the deemed finalized assessment for the assessment year 2005-2006.<br/> <br/>Annexure-A appended to the supplementary affidavit-in-opposition, as aforesaid, is dated 22.2.2007 which has been issued under the <strong>নথি নং- ৩৪৯-১০৬-১০০৩-সা-১১/৯১৯</strong> addressed to <strong>জনাব মোঃ নুর্রন্নবী</strong> and for a better appraisal the entire Annexure-A is reproduced below;<br/> </div><div style="margin-left: 40px;

The Assessee-writ-petitioner, challenging the aforesaid assessment dated 31.12.2007, went to the Tax Ombudsmen under the provision of section 20 of the Tax Ombudsmen Act 2005, being complaint No. 143 dated 19.8.2008, upon which the DCT concern contested the said complaint case by filing a written explanation, which was considered by the Tax Ombudsmen in its judgment dated 24.11.2008. The relevant Paragraph in the judgment runs as follows;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>অভিযোগ পত্রের অনুলিপি প্রেরণপূর্বক অভিযোগ বিষয়ের অভিযুক্ত কর কর্মকর্তাকে ব্যাখ্যা দাখিলের জন্য নোটিশ জারী করা হয়। জবাবে সার্কেলে নিয়োজিত কর কর্মকর্তা লিখিত ব্যাখ্যা দাখিল করেন। ব্যখ্যায় তিনি জানান যে করদাতা ২০০৬-২০০৭ কর বৎসরের স্ব-নির্ধারন পদ্বতি রিটার্নে কমিশন ব্যবসার আয়, কৃষি আয় ও গৃহ সম্পত্তি হইতে মোট আয় প্রদর্শন করেন ৬,০৮,০০০/- পরবর্তীতে জাতীয় রাজস্ব বোর্ডের নির্দেশনা মেতাবেক রিটার্ন নীরিক্ষার জন্য নির্বাচিত হয়। <u>নীরিক্ষা কার্যত্র্রমের অংশ হিসাবে করদাতাকে ৮৩(১) ও ৭৯ ধারার </u>নোটিশ প্রদানপুর্বক প্রদর্শিত আয় প্রমানের সুযোগ দেওয়া হয়। কিন্তু করদাতার প্রতিনিধি শুনানীতে হাজির হইলেও কোন তথ্য প্রমান দাখিল করিতে ব্যর্থ হন। তাই করদাতার আয়ের উৎস সম্পর্কে কর পরিদর্শক দ্বারা তথ্য সংগ্রহ এবং উহা পর্যালোচনাপূর্বক ৮৩(এ)(১)/৮৩(এ)(২)/৮৩(২) ধারায় কর নির্ধারণ করা হয়।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>This statement also proves that the DCT concern has not stated anything before the Tax Ombudsmen as to the issuance of the notice dated 22.2.2007.<br/> <br/>It appears that the Assessee-writ-petitioner in Writ Petition No. 4761 of 2009 has categorically raised the objection that the DCT concern did not hold any audit after getting the selected return from the National Board of Revenue. But nothing has been said in the affidavit-in-opposition as to the allegation of non-holding of audit, rather it has been admitted in Paragraph No. 10 in the affidavit-in-opposition that the DCT concern “for the purpose of auditing got local investigation report by the respective Inspector of Taxes, issued letter informing the Assessee-writ-petitioner his intention of audit and issued notices under section 83A(1) and 79 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 for production of books of accounts asking for documentary evidences in favour of the shown income, expenditure and other requirement found in the Inspectors report and consequently the DCT concern had to dispose of the cases under section 83A(1)/83A(2)/83(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984.<br/> <br/>All these statements and claim in the affidavit-in-opposition indicates and establishes the fact that the Annexure-A which has been annexed to the supplementary-affidavit-in-opposition is a tainted one. Had it been a genuine document, the DCT concern would definitely mentioned the same in his assessment order and even, failing to mention the same in the assessment order, it would have been mentioned before the Tax Ombudsmen as to such failure or even he could mention in the affidavit-in-opposition as to such failure in mentioning the said notice in the assessment order or before the Tax Ombudsmen with an explanation as to such failure. But nothing has been done excepting by way of filing a photocopy of the said notice annexing the same with the affidavit-in-opposition with a flimsy statement  that audit was held within the meaning of section 83A(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and for the purpose of holding audit a notice dated 22.2.2007 was served upon the Assessee-writ-petitioner. This sort of activity of the tax executive is not only deplorable but liable to be taken into consideration seriously. The supplementary affidavit was sowrn in by one Alamgir Kabir, Assistant Commissioner of Taxes, Chittagong, who supplied the said photocopy to the learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir and be fooled him in considering the said documents as a genuine document and to submit the same before this Highest Court. Therefore, a serious action is required to be taken against the Assistant Commissioner of Taxes Mr. Alamgir Kabir by the tax department or the National Board of Revenue upon getting this judgment at their end.<br/> <br/>It appears that no audit was held after the deemed finalized Self Assessment return, for the assessment year 2006-2007, was selected by the National Board of Revenue and that being a mandatory provision of law any violation of the same renders the further proceeding a nullity. This court finds with firm believe that the DCT concern without lawful authority thereafter proceeded to reopen the assessment, for the assessment year 2006-2007, harassing the assessee-writ-petitioner to travel up to Tax Ombudsmen and to the highest court of the country, incurring a great monetary expenses.<br/> <br/>In Writ Petition No. 5539 of 2009 the re-opening of the deemed finalization for the assessment year 2003-2004, 2004-2005, 2005-2006 and 2007-2008 has been challenged wherein, it appears, that after the deemed finalization of the assessment on the assessment year 2006-2007, the concerned DCT served a notice under section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 on the assessee-writ-petitioner showing his intention to re-open the deemed finalization of the tax liability of the aforesaid assessment years.<br/> <br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir has correctly argued before this court that the provision of section 83A(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 has rendered a gateway to the DCT concern to invoke the provision of section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 to re-open any deemed finalization of the assessment, since the Finance Act 2003 has inserted the said provision in the section which is therefore applicable from the Assessment year 2004-2005. From the provision of section 83A(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 it appears that the criteria as to possessing definite information by the DCT concern, is an important requirement to obtain the gateway to enter into the provision of section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984.<br/> <br/>The Provision of section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 reads as follows, prevailing at that time;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;

margin-left: 120px;"><em>Provided that the tax shall be charged at the rate or rates applicable to the assessment year for which the assessment is made</em>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The aforesaid provision of sub-section (2) of section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 further provides for two requirement in respect of reopening of any deemed finalization of any tax liability of an assessee which are (1)  possession of definite information and (2) approval of the Inspecting Joint Commissioner in writing.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Mosharaf Hossain categorically argued that no such definite information or prior approval of the Inspecting Joint Commissioner was obtained by the DCT concern.<br/> <br/>It appears that the DCT concern has obtained a Tax inspectors report which has been annexed as Annexure-D in Writ Petition No. 5539 of 2009, wherefrom it appears that the Tax Inspector had found that there was a bank statement of different banks in the official income tax file, submitted by the asessee and  accordingly he stated “নথিতে রক্ষিত করদাতা কর্তৃক দাখিলকৃত বিভিন্ন ব্যাংক বিবরণী হইতে আলোচ্য বর্ষের ব্যাংক হিসাবের মোট জমা উওোলন চিত্র নিম্মে দেওয়া হইল”<br/> <br/>Thereafter, the tax inspector in the annexure table, appended with the report made a statement of the transaction in The Premier Bank, Agrabad Branch, Social Investment Bank, Agrabad Branch, Jamuna Bank Limited, Agrabad Branch, Southeast Bank Limited, Agrabad Branch, Mutual Trust Bank, Khatungonj Branch, Bangladesh Commerce Bank, Agrabad Branch and Jamuna Bank Limited, Bhatiary Branch, wherefrom it appears that an amount of Tk. 395,83,19,572.00 was deposited in the bank account against which a withdrawal was made of an amount of Tk. 414,59,03,368.00. This shows that a liability approximately amounting to Tk. 22,00,00,000.00 is remaining against the assessee-writ-petitioner, which the learned Advocate Mr. Mosharaf Hossain explained as a bank loan liability of the assessee-writ-petitioner in respect of the administration and maintenance of the four denationalized textile mills.<br/> <br/>As the Tax Inspector has admitted that the assessee-writ-petitioner has submitted the bank statements before him no concealment of the documents can be alleged against the assessee-writ-petitioner. Further it appears that nothing has been said in the affidavit-in-opposition as to the categorical allegation of non-obtaining the prior approval of Inspecting Joint Commissioner, as has been alleged by the assessee-writ-petitioner. The opening version of sub-section 2 of section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 categorically provide that No proceeding under section 93(1) can be initiated unless the criterion of sub section (2) is observed. Therefore, this court finds that the DCT concern has failed to comply the mandatory provision of section 83A(5) and section 93(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 which left the step under section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, nugatory one.<br/> <br/>Another pertinent question lies here.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Mosharaf Hossain has drawn the attention of this court to the provision of section 94 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 which has provided a time limitation in respect of the assessment of any income tax liability after the filing of the return. In his opinion the deemed finalization assessment under the provision of section 83A(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 cannot be re-opened after 15 (fifteen) months or under the provision of section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 after two years and any attempt to re-open the deemed finalization of the assessment after that period will be a nullity.<br/> <br/>The provision of section 94 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 prevailing at that period reads as follows;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><em><u>Income Tax Ordinance 1984</u></em></strong><br/><strong><em><u>Section 94:</u></em></strong> <strong><em>Limitation for assessment.—</em></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;margin-left: 40px;"><em>(1)   Subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3), no order of assessment under the provisions of this Chapter in respect of any income shall be made after the expiry of six months from the end of the assessment year in which the income was first assessable.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;

margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>(4)   Where the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes fails to give effect to any finding or direction contained in an order referred to in sub-section (3) within the period stipulated therein, such failure of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes shall be construed as misconduct.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears from section 94(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 that the limitation of two years have been provided in the said section meaning thereby that the provision of section 93(3)(a) and (b) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 is applicable both for ordinary and the Self Assessment Scheme and in case of Self Assessment Scheme the same became barred after the elapse of two years and the provision of section 93(3)(a) and (b) cannot be invoked after the assessment barred by limitation under the provision of section 94(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. Because, the Self Assessment Scheme is a privilege and on an from the issuance of the receipt by the DCT concern as to receiving of a compliant return the same became finalized which become absolute after the elapse of two years, as provided in section 94(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. But the provision of section 93(2) being applicable for ordinary assessment will remain applicable as against five years of any assessment made in ordinary manner. Therefore, this court also on this count finds that the action taken by the DCT concern in respect of re-opening of the Self Assessment return after two years, by way of serving a notice dated 12.3.2008, calling upon the assessee-writ-petitioner to explain as to his six banks accounts, is a palpable illegality committed by him and as such this court is inclined to hold that the issuance of such notice and all other subsequent notices was of without lawful authority having no legal implication.<br/> <br/>Under the reasoning and discussion as above, this court finds merit in both the rules Nisi issued in Writ Petitions being No. 4761 of 2009 of 2009 and Writ Petition No. 5539 of 2009, which are required to be made absolute.<br/> <br/>In the result, both the rules Nisi are made absolute.<br/> <br/>The impugned assessment order dated 18.1.2009 under section 83A(1) /83A(2) /83(2)/156/section 20(2) of the Tax Ombudsmen Act 2005, by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes, Companies Circle-2, Taxes Zone-1, Chittagong, for the assessment year 2006-2007, Annexure-F of the assessee-writ-petitioner is relating to Writ Petition No. 4761 of 2009 and the impugned notice dated 30.3.2008 and 4.5.2008 under section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes, Companies Circle-2, Taxes Zone-1, Chittagong, so per as to relates the assessment of income of the assessee-writ-petitioner for the assessment year 2003-2004, 2004-2005, 2005-2006 Annexure-F and F(1) and the notice dated 24.5.2009 asking the writ-petitioner to produce books of accounts and other documents for the assessment of income of the writ-petitioner for the assessment year 2003-2004, 2004-2005 and 2005-2006, Annexure-H as challenged in the Writ Petition No. 5539 of 2009 are hereby declared to have been issued without lawful authority having no legal implication.<br/> <br/>However, there shall be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The Tribunal also by the said judgment convicted accused Dulal under section 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life along with fine of Taka 50,000/- (fifty thousand) in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment  for 5(five) years.<br/><br/>        2. The prosecution case, as projected in the First Information Report (in short, the FIR) and also unfurled at trial, in short, is that Most. Sofura Begum, the informant of this case has been living at Barma Colony under Bayeejid Bostami Police Station of Chittagong Metropolitan town. She had a daughter Rozina who is the victim of the case and at the time of occurrence who is only 5 years old.<br/><br/>        3. On 08.12.2000 at 12'O noon Rozina taking her meal had gone towards the residence of Iqbal who is also a neighbour and tenant under Sofura Begum. Alamgir, 8 years old, another son of the informant Sofura Begum was searching Rozina for feeding her ire-cream. But Rozina was found missing till 4.00 pm. The informant and her other well wishers had searched Rozina hither to thither without any result. Iqbal had announced the missing news of Rozina from 4.00 pm to 6.00 pm through the mike and the informant paid Taka 300/- for his such service. Iqbal and Dulal had also searched Rozina after the announcement of the mike and at 9.00 pm of the night Iqbal and Dulal coming from in front of the toilet of the informant disclosed that they have got a message having information about Rozina. The gathering who were present there had gone through the letters and came to know that the kidnapper asked the mother of the victim to send Taka 12,000/- (twelve thousand) at “Balir Pahar” near KAFCO on the way to the mazar of Hazrat Mohsen Awlia. Iqbal cautioned the informant that it will be wise not to send more people to the kidnapper but for his such remarks the local people suspected him and confined him but at one stage Iqbal on the false plea to go into the toilet had fled away successfully at night.<br/><br/>        4. On the next morning, that is, on 09.12.2000 the informant had been also searching Rozina and at the same time were trying to collect the amount of Taka 12,000/- and at one stage of this occurrence Dulal Gazi and Saleh Ahmed asked Parveen, the wife of Iqbal to give a photo of Iqbal but Parveen asked them to find out the photo in their own ways and when they were searching her house for a photo of Iqbal found a gunny bag within the rack, the mouth of the bag was closed and opening the said bag found the dead body of Rozina within the said bag. The informant and other found the dead body of Rozina within the said bag.<br/><br/>        5. The informant, narrating the above facts lodged the FIR with Baeijid Bostami Police Station on 09.12.2000 at 18.05 hours and on the basis of the said FIR Baeijid Bostami Police Station Case no. 8 dated 09.12.2000 corresponding to G.R no. 911 of 2000 were started. Md. Ahsan Habib, sub-Inspector of Police having been in the place of occurrence on 09.12.2000 made an inquest report on the dead body of Rozina and sent the dead body through police constable Syed Ahmed (PW 15) to the morgue for the post mortem examination on the dead body of the deceased and accordingly post mortem examination was held on the dead body of the victim by PW 5 Doctor Prodip Kumar Chandra.<br/><br/>        6. The case was investigated by Police Sub-Inspector Ahsan Habib who at his turn arrested accused Parveen and Dulal, prepared sketch map and index of the place of occurrence, collected the post mortem examination report and tried to arrest accused Iqbal, examined the witnesses but before submitting the police report he was placed in a training at Dhaka for 6 weeks when the case was endorsed to Police Sub-Inspector Rezaul Karim for investigation. But before submitting the police report, Police Sub-Inspector Ahsan Habib joined in the Police Station and the case was again endorsed to him but before submitting report he was transferred elsewhere. Thus, the case was endorsed to Police Sub-Inspector Mofizuddin who on completion of the investigation submitted police report on 27.01.2002 recommending the trial of accused Parveen Akter alias Parveen, wife of Iqbal and Dulal, son of Solimuddin under sections 302/201/34 of the Penal Code and at the same time made an endorsement that though the allegations against Iqbal regarding the causing murder of Rozina has been established but his correct address could not be ascertained and he will be sent for trial whenever his correct address will be available to the police.<br/><br/>        7. The Metropolitan Magistrate Court, Chittagong on receipt of the police report making the case ready for trial sent the record to the Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Chittagong where the case record was received on 15.02.2004 and the case was registered as Sessions Case no. 78 of 2004 and on the same day it was transferred in the Court of Metropolitan Additional Sessions Judge, 4<sup>th</sup> Court, Chittagong for trial. When the case was pending in the Court of Metropolitan Additional Sessions Judge, 4<sup>th</sup> Court, Chittagong, the prosecution filed an application for further investigation to include accused Iqbal in the case on 22.03.2004 and the trial Court after hearing both the parties passed an order dated 07.07.2004 for further investigation in to the case by the Criminal Investigation Department (in short, the CID) of police and at this turn the case was investigated by the CID of Police and on completion of the investigation submitted a supplementary police report recommending the trial of accused Jashim Uddin alias Iqbal under sections 302/201/34 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>        8. Since the accused Jashim Uddin alias Iqbal was an absconding accused from the very beginning of the case the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Chittagong making the case ready for trial sent the same again to the Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Chittagong where the case record was again received on 13.05.2009 it was registered as Sessions Case no. 850 of 2009 and on the same day it was transferred in the Court of Metropolitan Additional Sessions Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Chittagong where charge under sections 302/201/34 of the Penal Code was framed against the accused Parveen Akter alias Parveen, Dulal and Jashim Uddin alias Iqbal. Since all the three accused were fugitive on the date of framing charge their answers on the charge could not be recorded by the trial Court and when the said trial Court was  taking preparation for examining the witnesses the government transferred the case in the Druto Bichar Tribunal, Chittagong (in short, the Tribunal) by a gazette notification dated 31.05.2009 and accordingly the Metropolitan Additional Sessions Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Chittagong making an endorsement to that effect sent the record on 14.07.2009 to the Tribunal and the record was ultimately received by the Tribunal on 19.07.2009 where the case was re-numbered as Sessions Case no. 23 of 2009.<br/><br/>        9. During the trial at Druto Bichar Tribunaol, Chittagong the prosecution examined 18 witnesses and tendered one witness who was not cross-examined by the prosecution and since the accused were fugitive  during the trial, state defence lawyers were appointed to defend the accused and though prosecution witnesses were cross-examined by the state defence lawyer but after the completion of the recording of the evidence, the accused could not be examined under section 342 of the Code and the Tribunal considering the evidence and other materials on record found the accused Iqbal, Parveen and Dulal guilty under section 302 read with section 34 of the Penal Code by his judgment and order dated 06.04.2010 and awarded death sentence upon Jashim Uddin alias Iqbal and Parveen and sentenced Dulal to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life with a fine of Taka 50,000/- and also found them guilty under section 201of the Penal Code but no separate sentence was given under sections 201/34 of the Penal Code and after pronouncement of the judgment made the reference under section 374 of the Code for confirmation of the death sentence of Jashim Uddin alias Iqbal and Parveen.<br/><br/>        10. Mr. A.K.M. Zahirul Huq, the learned Deputy Attorney General with Mr. Md. Aminur Rahman Chowdhury and Mr. Shah Md. Hatem, the learned Assistant Attorney Generals appearing for the State having taken us through the FIR, charge sheet, the charge, evidence on record and the judgment under the reference passed by the Tribunal makes his submissions supporting the reference. He submits that a very painful and gruesome murder of the victim Rozina who was only 5 years old at the time of occurrence has been taken place in connection of the case for no fault of the victim Rozina or her mother and brother. Accused Jashim Uddin alias Iqbal along with his so-called wife Parveen very purposefully has been living in the place of occurrence which is in fact a Colony, that is, small houses in the disguise of tenant and he had come there one month before the date of occurrence in order to commit such type of organized crime of kidnap and murder.<br/><br/>        11. The learned Deputy Attorney General also submits that Parveen who has been shown as wife of Jashim alias Iqbal in fact she was not his wife. She and Dulal also are the partners of Jashim alias Iqbal who formed a crime party for committing such organized crime in this or that way in the locality and Rozina an innocent girl of 5 years have become the real victim in the hands of this group. The accused had kidnapped Rozina in order to realise a ransom of Taka 12,000/- only from the guardian of Rozina but ultimately they very brutally murdered Rozina through strangulation. Since Rozina was a very minor girl of 5 years there was no any minimum resistance on the part of Rozina and it was very easy for the accused to cause the death of such a minor girl of 5 years without any hurdle and hindrance. As such, no neighbour could have detected anything of the said murder of Rozina.<br/><br/>        12. He next submits that when everybody was searching Rozina, Iqbal as a resident of the said Colony along with Dulal played a very fantastic drama showing a letter containing message that the victim Rozina has been kidnapped by the kidnapper for Taka 12,000/- and Jashim alias Iqbal and Dulal disclosing the contents of the said letter also asked the informant not to share the same with others, in that case, the victim may face an ill fate. The behaviour of the accused were very much alarming, as such, the local people had suspected the involvement of the accused Jashim alias Iqbal and Dulal with the occurrence of this case.<br/><br/>        13. He also submits that whenever such a letter was found at the instance of accused Jashim alias Iqbal and Dulal the neighbours had suspected Jashim alias Iqbal and he was in the close guard of the informant party but ultimately on the false plea of attending natural call Jashim fled away successfully immediately after occurrence from the place of occurrence and thereafter he has been never found till now and that is a strong circumstances to hold that nobody else but Jashim alias Iqbal had committed the crime of murder of Rozina along with his other accomplice.<br/><br/>        14. He also submits that on the following day on 09.12.2000 the dead body of Rozina was found within a closed gunny bag in the rack of the house of Jashim Uddin alias Iqbal and Parveen and the dead body was recovered in presence of the local witnesses from the said rack which ultimately clearly indicates that nobody else but the dwellers of the hut committed the murder and thereafter concealed the dead body within the rack putting the same within a gunny bag and it is also in the evidence on record that the rack was under the lock and key and the key was in the possession of the accused Parveen. The witnesses taking the key from Parveen unlocked the rack and found the dead body. So, the very natural and irresistible conclusion would be that nobody else but Jashim alias Iqbal, his wife Parveen and Dulal after causing the murder of Rozina concealed the dead body in a rack within their house.<br/><br/>        15. The learned Deputy Attorney General very candidly submits that it is fact that there is no eye witness of the occurrence but the circumstantial evidence in some times may be more stronger than that of the eye witnesses. The dead body was found within the house of Jashim Uddin alias Iqbal and Parveen. So, it is nobody but accused Iqbal and Parveen who had murdered Rozina and kept the dead body in their own hut within a gunny bag. Had the murder been committed by any other person other than the dwellers of that hut, the dead body would not be in the house of the accused Jashim alias Iqbal and his wife Parveen. This very strong circumstances has proved the prosecution case that nobody else but the Jashim Uddin alias Iqbal, his wife Paveen and Dulal had committed the gruesome murder of Rozina and the trial Court on the right assessment of the evidence and other materials on record found them guilty and considering the gravity of the offence and the involvement of the accused Jashim alias Iqbal and Parveen rightly awarded death sentence upon them and imprisonment for life upon Dulal. So, the judgment and the order of conviction and sentence as awarded upon the convicts did not call for any interference from this Court. Thus, according to his submissions there is no ground for interference in the judgment and order of conviction and sentence of the convicts and with these words he canvasses for the acceptance of the death reference for convicts Jashim and Parveen and with this submission he concluded his submissions in this death reference.<br/><br/>        16. On the other hand, Syeda Mymuna Begum,the learned state defence lawyer appearing for the convicts Jashim Uddin alias Iqbal and Parveen makes her submissions opposing the death reference. She submits that it is fact that Rozina a 5 years old girl was murdered in connection of this case and though the convicts have been made accused in this case but there is no any eyewitness of the occurrence that the convicts had murdered the deceased. The convicts are also the dwellers of Burma Colony where the informant has been living with his other family members. Had the murder been committed by the convicts that would have been revealed to the neighbours. An offence may be grave but before convicting the accused their involvement with the occurrence must be proved by legal evidence but in this particular case there is no any legal evidence to convict the accused. The convicts Jashim and Parveen have been living in the place of occurrence as husband and wife and though the dead body was found in their house but they had no knowledge about the same and without any eye witness of the occurrence the accused should have not been convicted and sentenced under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>        17. She also submits that the trial Court in fact without any proper scanning and scrutinizing of the evidence on record emotionally found the accused guilty under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and awarded the highest sentence of death upon the accused Jashim alias Iqbal and Parveen. The materials on record did not justify the conviction and sentence of the convicts Jashim alias Iqbal and Parveen.<br/><br/>        18. She also submits that abscondent of an accused is not any evidence or strong circumstances against him or them that they have committed the murder of the deceased. An accused may go on abscondment for many reasons but that should not be the only criteria to consider his or their involvement with the occurrence of offence. The learned Advocate in her concluding submissions submits that in her estimation it is a case of nil evidence, so the death reference should be rejected acquitting the convicts Jashim alias Iqbal and Parveen from the charge levelled against them.<br/><br/>        19. We have considered the above submissions and the arguments of the learned Advocates of both the parties with profound attention and have gone through the materials on record particularly the FIR, charge, evidence, inquest report, postmortem examination report, judgment pronounced by the trial Court and the other materials on record meticulously.<br/><br/>        20. Now, in order to appreciate the arguments as advanced by the learned Advocates of both the parties in support of the reference and also in support of the convicts, let the evidence on record be critically scrutinized and analyzed for determination whether the prosecution could prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the convicts had committed the murder of victim Rozina.<br/><br/>        21. PW 1 Safura Begum, the informant as well as the mother of the victim Rozina has said that Rozina is her daughter who was 5 years old at the time of occurrence, on 08.12.2000 at 12'O noon Rozina taking meal had gone towards the house of their tenant Iqbal, Alamgir his another son coming her house with ice cream was searching Rozina but Rozina was found missing, thereafter, she and others had been searching Rozina hither to thither but ultimately could not trace her, at 4.00 pm Iqbal had approached her to announce the missing news of Rozina through mike and ultimately he (Iqbal) announced the same till 6.00 pm, at 9.00 pm of the night Iqbal and Dulal coming from in front of a toilet showed a letter having information about Rozina containing a direction to send Taka 12,000/- at “Balir Pahar” of KAFCO on the way to the mazar of Hazrat Mohsen Awlia  where there will be a man with a cap on his head and he will receive the money and in the letter there was also a caution not to share it with the police and other people.<br/><br/>        22. She further stated that for the letter the local people had strongly suspected accused Iqbal land Dulal and the local people asked Iqbal and Dulal to write something but Dulal did not know to write and Iqbal though started to write but for his nervousness ultimately could not write, the local people considering the prevailing circumstances had suspected Jashim alias Iqbal and confined him in her house but at one stage of the night he on the false plea of attending natural call had fled away successfully and on the following morning the informant and others  were searching Rozina and at the same time she was trying to procure Taka 12,000/-when the local people also asked her to lodge a G.D entry against Iqbal but they were also telling that to lodge a G.D they need a photo of Iqbal and to that end Dulal, Gazi and Saleh had gone in the house of Iqbal to  collect a photo of Iqbal, the wife of Iqbal asked them to find out the photo on searching, they took the key of a rack of bamboo from Parveen and unlocking the said rack found a closed plastic bag within the rack and opening the said bag found the dead body of Rozina, the local people including herself found the dead body of Rozina within the said bag, Parveen took an attempt to flee away but failed, the local people caught her and ultimately the police arrested her when she told the local mob that Iqbal is not her husband but she was living with Iqbal and she also disclosed that she, Iqbal and Dulal murdering Rozina had concealed the dead body in that manner.

PW 19 and the last witness Narayan Chandra Proshad Roy who was in fact examined as PW 17 in this case but the materials on record go to show that he as PW 17 gave evidence in support of the investigation done by him and he as PW 19 tried to give evidence supporting the investigation held by Police Sub-inspector Ahsan Habib who is the 1st Investigation Officer of this case.<br/><br/>        48. However, PW 19 testified that Police Sub-Inspector Ahsan Habib was the 1<sup>st</sup> Investigating Officer of this case who on 09.12.2000 being informed about the occurrence through police wireless had gone at Burma Colony and found the dead body of Rozina in the house of Mannan, he had prepared the inquest report on the dead body and sent the same to the morgue for post mortem examination and he being appointed as the Investigating Officer seized the alamats of the case at 19.35 hours, he prepared the sketch map and index of the place of occurrence and also recorded the statements of the witnesses, he also arrested accused Parveen and Dulal from the place of occurrence and before completion of the investigation he was directed to attend a training as such he handed over the case docket to the concerned Officer-in-Charge and later on Police Sub-Inspector Md. Mofizuddin held the investigation and submitted police report recommending the trial of Parveen and Dulal with an endorsement that though the allegation of causing murder of Rozina has been established also against accused Iqbal but since his address has not been ascertained he could not be sent for trial but whenever his address will be available he would be sent for trial.<br/><br/>        49. He further stated that later on by the order of the Court the case was investigated by the CID A.S.P Abdul Hamid and when Abdul Hamid was transferred elsewhere the case was endorsed to him for investigation. He further stated that he had served with Police Sub-Inspector Ahsan Habib at Chittagong Metropolitan Police as such he is acquainted with the hand writing and signature of Ahsan Habib. He further stated that the inquest report, challan, seizure list, sketch map and index have been prepared by Ahsan Habib. He proved the signature of Ahsan Habib on those papers.<br/><br/>        50. In cross-examination of the state defence he stated that Ahsan Habib did not record the statement of any eye witness who had found the occurrence of murder. The prosecution could not seize any alamat of demanding ransom save and except the letter. The Burma Colony is a crime zone. He denied the defence suggestion that Ahsan Habib did not go to the place of occurrence and did not prepare the inquest report and did not write the challan and did not prepare any seizure list and sketch map, index etcetera.<br/><br/>        51. These are the evidences that have been given by the prosecution in this case. It appears that the prosecution examined 18 witnesses and tendered 1 witness in this case in order to prove the charge against the accused. Out of the 18 witnesses, examined so far, there is 1 doctor, 6 police personnel and the rest 11 are the local witnesses and within these 11 local witnesses PWs 6 and 7 are the brother and mother of accused Jashim alias Iqbal.<br/><br/>        52. As it appears from the prosecution case as well as from the evidence adduced at trial that the occurrence of murder of Rozina had not been witnessed by any witness. On 08.12.2000 after midday Rozina was found missing from her house as well as within the adjacent area of her house but on the following day on 09.12.2000  her dead body was found within a plastic bag in a bamboo rack in the house of accused Iqbal and Parveen and when the informant and others became sure that Rozina has been murdered.<br/><br/>        53. The inquest report (exhibit 2) prepared by Ahsan Habib is going to show that he found some blackish mark on the throat and neck of the deceased and he  did not find any notable injury on the person of the deceased.<br/><br/>        54. The post mortem examination on the dead body of the deceased was done by PW 5 Doctor Prodip Kumar Chowdhury who found one abrasion 2½˝X½ ˝ on the right side of the neck along with three bruises with nail mark ¼˝X⅛˝ each on both the left side of the neck and also found clotted blood on both sides of the neck and inside the trachea and in the opinion of the doctor death was due to asphyxia as the result of manual strangulation which is antemortem and homicidal in nature.<br/><br/>        55. The marks of injury as has been found by Ahsan Habib at the time of preparation of inquest report do tally with the post mortem examination report. The doctor found abrasion and bruises with the nail mark on the right and left side of the neck and the doctor (PW 5) considering the above injuries opined that Rozina met her death due to asphyxia as a result of manual strangulation. The medical evidence regarding the death of Rozina is very much consistent with the prosecution case. Over and above there is nothing in the record to show that Rozina met her death by any other means other than of the manual strangulation. So without any hesitation it can safely be said that the minor 5 years old Rozina was strangulated to death.<br/><br/>        56. Now, the vital question before us is as to who had strangulated Rozina to death as has been found in the medical evidence of this case. It is an admitted fact in this case that there is no eye witness of the occurrence of murder of Rozina. Prosecution examined 18 witnesses in this case but none of them found to murder the victim Rozina. From the evidence on record it appears that accused Iqbal who later on became Jashim, which is his real name was inducted as a tenant under Sofura Begum at Burma Colony under Bayeijid Bostami Police Station before 1 month 8 days of the occurrence with his so-called wife Parveen.<br/> <br/>        57. In this case, the plain submissions of the prosecution is that though there is no eye witness of the occurrence of murder of Rozina but there is very strong circumstantial evidence against the accused which have been revealed from the evidence on record. Now, let us examine whether this submissions of the prosecution is justified or not.<br/> <br/>58. PW 1 Sofura Begum in her evidence stated in the following ways:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“………………… তখন প্রতিবেশী দুলাল ও আমাদের সাথে খুঁজতে থাকে। রাত অনুমান ৯ টায় ইকবাল ও দুলাল আমাদের ঘরের পিছনে টয়লেটের দিকে যায় এবং সেখান থেকে এসে বলে রোজিনাকে পাওয়া গেছে। এই কথা বলে তারা দুজন আমাকে ১টি চিঠি দেয়। তখন উপসিহত লোকজন চিঠির খাম ছিড়ে এবং ভিতর থেকে ১টি চিঠি বের করে পড়েন। চিঠিতে লেখা ছিল যে আমার মেয়েকে নাকি দোকানের সামনে থেকে তুলে নিয়েছে। আমি যেন কোন ভাড়াটিয়ার সাথে আমার ছেলেকে দিয়ে ১২,০০০/- টাকা দিয়ে মোহছেন আওলীয়া মাজারে যাওয়ার পথে কাফকো বালির পাহাড়ে পাঠাই। সেখানে টুপী পড়া একজন লোক থাকবে। তাকে যেন টাকা দিয়ে আসে। ঘটনা যেন পুলিশকে না জানানো হয় বা এলাকার কোন মাস্তান পাঠানো না হয়। চালাকি করলে মেয়েকে হারাতে হবে। টাকা দিলে রাত ১১ টায় মেয়েকে গোডাউনের সামনে দিয়ে যাবে ………….”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>        59. PW 3 hearing the hue and cry at 9.00 pm of the night of the occurrence when the letter was discovered coming into the house of Sofura Begum had heard about the contents of the letter and also heard that the letter was discovered by accused Iqbal and Dulal. PW 4 heard about the letter on the following morning while the PW 12 heard about the letter at 12.00 pm of the night of occurrence.<br/> <br/>        60. The above noted letter was discovered by the accused Iqbal and Dulal for which the local people had suspected them and confined Iqbal in the house of the informant and it is in the evidence of PW 1 that when Iqbal was confined in her house, in the last portion of the night on the pretence to attend a natural call fled away successfully and from then he is absconding till now. He neither had faced the trial nor took any attempt appearing in the proceeding to prove his innocence.<br/> <br/>        61. When PW 1 and her inmates took a decision to lodge a G.D entry on 09.12.2000 against Iqbal they were feeling to have a photo of Iqbal and on that pretext the inmates of PW 1 asked Parveen to hand over a photo of Iqbal and whenever the witnesses of this case were searching the house of Iqbal for a photo of Iqbal they found the dead body of Rozina within a bamboo rack in the house of Iqbal and Parveen. In this connection the evidence of PW 3 runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“……………তখন ইকবালের স্ত্রী পারভীন বাসায় ছিল। তার নিকট ইকবালের ছবি চাই। সে আমাদেরকে ছবি খুজে নিতে বলে। এক পর্যায়ে তার নিকট হতে চাবি নিয়ে বাশের র্যাক খুলে দুলাল র্যাক এর ভিতর থেকে ১টি প্লাষ্টিকের বস্তা বের করে এবং মুখ খুলে। তখন বস্তায় রোজিনার লাশ দেখি। ঐ সময় পারভীন পালাতে চায় কিন্তু লোকজন তাকে ধরে ফেলে। আমরা লাশ বোনের বাড়ীতে এনে রাখি ……………”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>        62. From the above noted gorgeous an dashing evidence of PW 3 it has been revealed as to how they had recovered the dead body of Rozina from the house of Iqbal and Parveen. PW 4 on the same subject stated in the following ways:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“……………আমরা ইকবালের ছবি চাইলে সে ছবি না দিয়ে আমাদেরকে ছবি খুঁজতে বলে। আমরা খুঁজতে খুঁজতে বাঁশের র্যাকেও খুঁজি এবং বাঁশের র্যাকের বাশের দরজা খুললে  ১টি বস্তা পাই। বস্তার মুখ খুলে সেখানে রোজিনার লাশ পাই। খবর পেয়ে পুলিশ আসে এবং রোজিনার লাশ নিয়ে যায় ……………”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>63. PW 12 on the same subject stated in the following ways:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“……………পরদিন ৯/১২/২০০০ ইং তাং সকালে লোকজন ইকবালের ঘরে খুঁজে ১টি র্যাকের ভিতর প্লষ্টিকের বস্তায় রোজিনার লাশ পায়। তখন ইকবালের ঘরে পারভীন ছিল। সে ইকবালের স্ত্রী পরিচয়ে থাকত। লাশ পাওয়ার পর দুলাল প্রমুখ চিৎকার করে বলে যে রোজিনাকে পাওয়া গেছে। তখন আমি ঘরের দরজায় ছিলাম ……………” </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>64. PW 1 as to the recovery of the dead body stated in the following ways:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“……………চিৎকার শুনে আমি সহ লোকজন দৌড়ে ইকবালের ভাড়া ঘরে যাই এবং রোজিনার লাশ দেখি। এই সময় ইকবালের স্ত্রী পারভীন পলাতে গিয়ে নালায় পড়ে যায় ……...”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>        65. From the above noted evidence of PWs 1,3,4 and 12 it has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt that the dead body of Rozina was recovered from the house of Iqbal and Parveen which they had placed within a plastic bag and shelved within a bamboo rack.<br/><br/>        66. Now, if we consider the above noted evidence, facts and circumstances of this case along with the evidence of PWs 6 and 7 who are nobody but the full brother and mother of accused Iqbal we will get a clear picture as to the nature of job of accused Iqbal which he had been performing at the relevant time. PW 6 testified that in 2000 he and his mother had visited the house of accused Iqbal at Burma Colony when they were instructed by accused Parveen to address Jashim as Iqbal. What does it indicate? It indicates and shows that Iqbal had taken shelter in the Burma Colony changing his name to commit such type of organised crime.<br/><br/>        67. PW 7 the mother of Iqbal stated about an occurrence of crime committed by her son accused Jashim in the following ways:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“……………জসিমকে ত্যাজ্যপুত্র করার ৬/৭ মাস পূবে কুমিল্লা থেকে একজন লোক ২০,০০০/- টাকা নিয়ে আমাদের বাড়ী আসে এবং বলে যে তার ছোট ভাইকে অপহরণ করা হয়েছে এবং জসিম নামে একজন মোবাইলে বলেছে যে ২০,০০০/- টাকা দিলে ছেলেকে ফেরত দিবে। তখন জসিম ঘরে ছিল না। আমরা টাকা নেইনি। এর ২ দিন পর পুলিশ আমার স্বামীকে ও ২য় ছেলেকে ধরে নিয়ে যায় এবং ২ মাস ১৮ দিন পর খালাস পায় ……………”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>        68. From the above noted fantabulous and unimpeachable evidence of the mother of the accused Jashim alias Iqbal it has been found that the offence of kidnap followed by murder of Rozina is not the first offence committed by Iqbal rather he had started this type of job much earlier and from the evidence of PW 7 it is clear that a victim  party had come to her to hand over the ransom of a kidnap committed by Jashim but ultimately though the mother and father of Jashim did not receive the said amount but they were put into the jail. As such we get a clear picture as to the nature of the job of accused Iqbal which he had chosen at the relevant time.<br/><br/>        69. PW 7 also supporting the evidence of PW 6 stated that whenever she had visited the house of Jashim at Burma Colony in the year 2000 she was instructed not to address her son Jashim as Jashim but as Iqbal. These are all the incriminating circumstances against the accused Iqbal.<br/><br/>        70. When the dead body of a person is found in the house of the accused, the obvious conclusion would be that it is nobody but the accused murdering the victim had kept the dead body in their own house. In this particular case the dead body of Rozina was recovered from the house of Iqbal and Parveen. So, it is clear like anything else that nobody else but the dwellers of that hut had committed the murder of Rozina thereafter in order to hiding the dead body kept the same within their house.<br/> <br/>        71. In the case of Haji Md. Jamal Uddin and others-Vs- the State, 14 BLD 33 this Court has given a valuable observation as to when the accused can be convicted relying on the circumstantial evidence alone. In the reported case it has been held in the following ways:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Now, the principle of law for convicting the accused only on the basis of circumstantial evidence has been well-settled by many decisions of our Court, a few of them may be mentioned here, one of which is in the case of Safiqullah alias Kala Mia –Vs-the State, reported in 1985 BLD(HCD) 129, in para 21, wherein it has been observed:<br/> <br/>66. It has been well settled that when a case rests on circumstantial evidence, such evidence must satisfy, 3 tests:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>i.</strong> the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be cogently and firmly established.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>ii.</strong> those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>iii. </strong>the circumstances taken cumulatively, should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within the human probability, the crime was committed by the accused and none else. The circumstantial evidence, in order to sustain conviction, must be complete chain and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused. It must be qualitatively such that on every reasonable hypothesis, the conclusion must be that the accused is guilty not on fantastic possibilities nor freak inferences but rational deductions which reasonable minds make from the probative force of facts and circumstances.” And similar principles have been laid down in the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarder-Vs-The State reported in AIR 1984(SC) 1622, and also in the case of Keshob Chandra Mistry and others-Vs-The State reported in 1985 BLD(AD) 301, wherein it has been held by their Lordships:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>    “Where all the evidence is circumstantial, it is necessary that cumulatively its effect should be to exclude and reasonable hypothesis of the innocence of the accused.”<br/>   <br/>     The above principle has been followed in the case of State-Vs-Badsha Molla reported in 41 DLR (1989) at page 11 to which I am a party.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>         72. Now, keeping in view the above principles, if we examine the circumstantial evidence as in this case we find that there appears a unbreakable chain of circumstances which obvious conclusion is that nobody else but accused Iqbal land Parveen had committed the murder of Rozina and the chain of circumstances has established basing on the following facts.<br/> <br/>        73. Firstly, Iqbal and Parveen had been living as tenant of Sofura Begum in an adjacent house of Rozina.<br/> <br/>        74. Secondly, immediate after missing of the victim Rozina, a letter was discovered at the instance of accused Iqbal and Dulal.<br/> <br/>        75. Thirdly, the dead body was recovered from the house of accused Iqbal and Parveen.<br/> <br/>        76. Forthly, when the local people had suspected accused Iqbal he was confined in the house of the informant from where he fled away successfully on the false plea to attend a natural call and Parveen also became absconding releasing on bail and still they are futigive.<br/> <br/>        77. Fifthly, this is not the only kidnap and murder by accused Iqbal rather before 2000 he had kidnapped a boy for which Taka 20,000/- was demanded and the same was tendered to his mother although his mother did not receive the same.<br/> <br/>        78. Sixthly, Iqbal had been residing in the place of occurrence changing his real name with a woman who was not his legal and married wife and whenever a person changes his name it means that he had the intention to commit crime and in order to escape from the hands of the legal action this type of calculated device is used by the veteran criminal.<br/> <br/>        79. Now, though in this case there is no eye witness of the occurrence but the above noted established facts have formed a strong chain of circumstances which led us to hold irresistibly that nobody else but accused Iqbal and Parveen had committed the murder of deceased Rozina. The culminative effect of the above facts exclude any reasonable hypothesis of innocence of the convicts Jashim alias Iqbal and Parveen.<br/> <br/>        80. In the case of State-Vs-Moslem 55 DLR 116 it has been held that the circumstantial evidence, if convincing is more cogent than the evidences of eye witness. This Court in the reported case held in the following ways:<br/>            “Circumstantial evidence may be and frequently is more cogent than the evidence of eye-witnesses. It is not difficult to produce false evidence of eye-witnesses. It is, on the other hand, extremely difficult to produce circu-mstantial evidence of a convincing character and therefore, circumstantial evidence, if convincing, is more cogent than the evidences of eye-witnesses.” (para 48 of the judgment)<br/> <br/>        81. In this case other than the circumstantial evidence there appears extra judicial confession of accused Parveen. Regarding the extra judicial confessions of accused Parveen, the evidence of  PW 1 runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“……………ঐ সময় পারভীন জানায় যে ইকবাল তার স্বামী নহে। এমনিতেই তার ঘর করত। আমার মেয়েকে ইকবাল, দুলাল ও পারভীন খুন করে বস্তায় ভরে লুকিয়ে রেখেছিল………...”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>82. On the same subject PW 4 stated in the following ways:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“……………লাশ পাওয়ার পর ইকবালের স্ত্রী আমাদের নিকট স্বীকার করে যে ইকবাল  ও দুলাল এবং সে রোজিনাকে অপহরণ করতে গিয়ে খুন করে এবং লাশ বস্তায় লুকিয়ে রাখে………...”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>83. PW 12 stated in the following ways:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“……………পারভীন জানায় যে ইকবাল, সে ও দুলাল রোজিনাকে মুক্তি পণের জন্য আটক করেছিল এবং পরে খুন করে লাশ লুকিয়ে রেখেছিল………...”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>84. PW 15 stated in the following ways:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>পারভীন স্বীকার করে যে সে তার স্বামী ইকবাল রোজিনাকে খুন করেছিল।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>        85. From the extra judicial confession of accused Parveen it appears that immediate after occurrences she candidly admitted that she, IQbal and Dulal had committed the murder of Rozina.<br/> <br/>        86. In the case of State-Vs-Md. Abdus Samad Azad 9 BLC 39 it was held that extra judicial confession can be the foundation of conviction and consequential sentence of its maker.<br/> <br/>        87. In the case of <em><strong>Syed Ahmed-Vs-Md. Abdul Khaleque and others</strong></em> 51 DLR 43 it has been held that if the extra judicial confessions is held faithful and acceptable, then conviction can be based on such confession without any corroboration. The details observations of this Court in that case runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Usually, as a matter of caution, Court requires some material corroboration to an extra judicial confessional statement, a corroboration which connects the accused person with the crime in question and extra judicial confessions, if true and voluntary, can be relied upon and a conviction can be based on the evidence of extra judicial confessional statement. Extra judicial confessions are not usually considered with favour but it does not mean that such a confessions coming from a person who has no reason to state falsely and to whom it is made in the circumstances which tend to support his statement should not be believed. If after a careful and cautious scrutiny, the evidence4 as to extra judicial confessions is held truthful and acceptable and the words are clear and unequivocal, then conviction can be based on such confession without any corroboration.”(para 22 of the judgment)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>        88. From the evidence of PWs 1, 4, 12 and 15 we find that they have consistently testified in the trial Court that Parveen candidly admitted that she, Iqbal and Dulal had committed the murder of Rozina though the PW 15 stated that Parveen told him that she and her husband had committed the murder. PW 15 is a police constable who carried the dead body from the place of occurrence to the morgue. Thus it seems to us that Parveen made her extra judicial confession at the initial stage of the case before PWs 1, 4 and 12 which was consistent with the prosecution case and thereafter when police arrived at the scene she also repeated the same.<br/> <br/>        89. However, not only the extra judicial confession of Parveen but also the other circumstances which have been found in this case that she has been living with Iqbal but she was not the legal and married wife of Iqbal. From the facts of the recovery of the dead body from a bamboo rack which was under the lock and key, the key was in the possession of Parveen. So, this fact led us to hold that nobody else but she and Iqbal as the dwellers of the hut committing the murder of the deceased kept the dead body within the rack putting the same in a plastic bag in order to hide the occurrence of murder of Rozina. As such not only the circumstantial evidence against Parveen but her extra judicial confession alone is sufficient to find her guilty regarding the murder of the deceased.<br/> <br/>        90. In this case both the convicts Jashim Uddin alias Iqbal and Parveen were fugitive accused at trial. In the case of Abul Kashem-vs-State 56 DLR 133 it was held that absconsion of the accused itself is not an incriminating material against an accused inasmuch as even an innocent person implicated in a serious crime sometimes absconds during the investigation to avoid repression by the police.<br/> <br/>        91. It is fact that the absconsion of an accused is not the conclusive proof of his guilt and sometimes to avoid the police harassment an accused may abscond. But the record is going to show that immediately after occurrence accused Jashim Uddin had fled away and thereafter he was never found in the locality till now and another accused Parveen was arrested from the place of occurrence on 09.12.2000 and after a reasonable gap she was enlarged on bail on 24.02.2008 but from 06.05.2008 she is a fugitive accused. The above facts indicate that when the local people had suspected accused Jashim he perceiving the consequence of his involvement with the gruesome murder of Rozina fled away before the recording of the case while Parveen enlarging on bail became a fugitive accused from justice and till now they are fugitive and they were defended in the trial Court by the state defence lawyer as well in this Court also.<br/> <br/>        92. Thus, we find that the trial of this case was held in the absentia of convict Jashim Uddin and Parveen from  the very early stage of  the  case and at present there is no whereabouts of them. Such abscondence of convicts Jashim and Parveen is considered to be a corroborating evidence against them (PLD 1969 SC 89, Gul Hassan and another-Vs-the State).<br/> <br/>93. In the case of <em><strong>Nizam Hazari-Vs-State</strong></em>, 53 DLR 475 it was held in the following ways:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“No inflexible rule can be laid down on abscondence. Abscondence of an accused will be judged in the light of the facts and circumstances of the case. Absondence of accused, sometimes furnishes corroboration of prosecution evidence. But abscondence by itself may not afford corroboration to the interested testimony yet in the body of the evidence it has its own significance.”(para 23 of the judgment)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>94. From the materials on record we find that soon after the occurrence convict Jashim had fled away and remained absconding during the trial and trial was held in his absentia.  And convict Parveen is fugitive from justice from 06.05.2008 when the case was awaiting for trial. Such abscondence of the accused is an incriminating circumstances connecting them in the offence and conduct of a person in aboscondence after commission of crime is an evidence to show that they are concerned in the offence.<br/> <br/>95. In the case of Mobrak Hossain-Vs-State, 1981 BLD 286 it is held that absondence of accused is a relevant fact under section 9 of the Evidence Act and unless accused explains his conduct, absondence may indicate guilt of the accused.<br/> <br/>96. Taking into account, the absconsion of the convict Jashim soon after the occurrence and Parveen before starting of the trial of the case furnish sufficient corroboration in the commission of crime and if all the materials are taken culminatively, point to the only hypothesis of the guilt of convicts and not towards their innocence.<br/> <br/>97. In the case of Zakir Hossain and another-Vs-State 55 DLR 137 wherein it is held in the following ways:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“It is obvious that accused appellant remained absconding with clear cut guilty knowledge about his overt act in the occurrence resulting in murder of the son of informant, PW 1 Moslem and, as such, his absconsion will create adverse opinion against him. It is true that sometimes absconsion takes place due to apprehension of police harassment and threat but when absconsion takes place by anyone with guilty knowledge he cannot take any plea of police harassment.”(para 49 of the judgment)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>        98. The above view has also been reflected in the case of State-Vs-Lalu Miah reported in 39 DLR(AD) 117 wherein it was held that absconsion by itself has no fault as it may be due to apprehension of police harassment, but absconsion with guilty knowledge will be an offence and it will be used against the absconder. From the case in our hands we have found that convicts Jashim Uddin alias Iqbal and Parveen remained absconding during trial of the case being quite aware of the proceeding against them with the guilty knowledge as to their direct participation in the offence about murder of the deceased Rozina. Therefore, in the light of above decisions, the absconsion of Jashim Uddin alias Iabal and Parveen with their above guilty knowledge will operate against them and it was not an absconsion for mere apprehension of police harassment or for any other reason.<br/><br/>        99. The unbreakable chain of circumstances along with the aboscondment of the convicts as has been found in this case which is also corroborated by the extra judicial confession of accused Parveen led us to hold that nobody else but accused Iqbal alias Jashim and Parveen forming a organised crime group or syndicate in order to earn something had committed the very gruesome and heart rending murder of a minor girl of 5 years. <br/><br/>        100. Now, having regards to the above discussions and the evidence and other materials on record we find that the trial Court committed no error of law and fact in order to find the convicts Iqbal and Parveen guilty under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code for causing murder of Rozina.<br/><br/>        101. Now, as we have found it earlier that the trial Court relying on the circumstantial evidence corroborated by extra judicial confession of Parveen rightly found Iqbal alias Jashim and Parveen guilty under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and awarded them the sentence of death but we are of the opinion that the ends of justice would be met if the sentence of death is commuted to imprisonment for life to those convicts.<br/><br/>        102. In the result, the Death Reference being no. 21 of 2010 against convicts Jashim Uddin alias Iqbal (still absconding) and Parveen (still absconding) is rejected but the conviction under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code against the said two convicts is upheld and the sentence of death is commuted into the sentence of imprisonment for life. Since these two convicts are absconding now, their sentence will run from the date of their arrest or they surrender to undergo the sentence.<br/><br/>        103. Let a copy of this judgment and order be communicated to the Court concerned at once along with the lower Court’s record.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Case No. 841 of 2001 under Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>It is to be noted that as against the judgment and order dated 29-11-2005 passed by learned Sessions Judge the accused respondent Md. Rasel alias Russel preferred Criminal Appeal No.5038 of 2005 and the accused Md. Rubel preferred Criminal Appeal No.5105 of 2005 before the High Court Division.  A Division Bench of the High Court Division by the impugned Judgment and Order dated 04-01-2011 dismissed the appeals with alteration and modification  of the conviction  and sentence of the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel and the accused Md. Rubel from under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code to one under sections 304 Part II/34 of the Penal Code and  thereby reduced the sentence of the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel  from death penalty to rigorous imprisonment for 10 (ten) years and to pay a fine of Tk. 10,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year more and also  reduced the sentence  of the accused Rubel  from rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Taka 20,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year more to rigorous imprisonment for 10 (ten) years and to pay a fine of Tk. 10,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year more. <br/> <br/>The prosecution case, in brief, is that, on 26.12.2001 at 10:00 a.m. Shafiqul Islam Shanto, the son of the informant Md. Serajul Islam (P.W.1), was returning home after playing game of cricket at Eidgah field. When Shanto came in front of their house, the accused-persons namely, Rasel alias Russel, Rubel and Rabiul, sons of A. Mannan Driver blocked his way and forcibly snatched sunglass from his pocket. In the event of objection raised by Shafiqul Islam Shanto, an altercation took place between them. At the behest of the accused Md. Rubel, the accused Rasel alias Russel dealt fist blows on the nose, mouth and head of the victim Shafiqul Islam Shanto causing bleeding injuries and as a result, the victim Shafiqul Islam Shanto fell to the ground and blood came out from his mouth and nose. When the people rushed to the place of occurrence the accused-persons took to their heels.  Md. Saiful Islam, the younger brother of the informant, along with his relations took the victim Shanto to Khanpur Hospital for treatment where the doctor on duty gave the victim initial treatment and considering his critical condition the victim was sent to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital for proper treatment. The victim died in the Dhaka Medical Hospital at 5:30 p.m.<br/> <br/>The First Information Report (F.I.R) was lodged by Md. Serajul Islam (P.W.1), the father of the victim Shafiqul Islam Shanto. The police after taking up investigation of the case visited the place of occurrence, examined witnesses under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and prepared Sketch map with index and after completion of investigation, having found a prima facie case, submitted charge sheet being No.341 dated 30.09.2002 of Fatullah Police Station, Narayanganj under Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code against the accused persons including the accused respondent.<br/> <br/>The learned Sessions Judge, Narayanganj at the commencement of trial of the case framed charge under Sections 302 / 34 of the Penal Code against the accused persons including the accused-respondent. The charge was read over and explained to the accused- respondent, Md. Rasel alias Russel and the accused Md. Rubel, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The accused Md. Rabiul, had been all throughout absconding and the charge could not be read over and explained to him.<br/> <br/>In the trial the prosecution in all examined as many as 16 witnesses but none was examined on behalf of the defence. On the closure of the evidence of the prosecution the accused respondent Md. Rasel alias Russel and the accused Md. Rubel were examined under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure whereupon they pleaded not guilty informing the Court that they would not adduce any evidence on their behalf. Because of abscondence the accused Md. Rabiul could not be examined under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/>From the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses the defence case, as it transpires is that being hit by a cricket ball the victim Shanto had died.  The accused persons pleaded not guilty and prayed to be acquitted.<br/> <br/>The learned Sessions Judge, Narayanganj after hearing both the prosecution and the defence and on perusal of the evidence and materials on record by judgment and order dated 29.11.2005 convicted and sentenced the accused respondent Md. Rasel alias Russel and the accused Rubel under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced the accused  respondent Md. Rasel alias Russel to death and the accused Rubel to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Tk. 20,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year more. The learned Sessions Judge, Narayanganj referred the Death Reference No. 173 of 2005 to a Division Bench of the High Court Division. Against the aforesaid judgment the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel preferred Criminal Appeal No. 5038 of 2005 and the accused Rubel preferred Criminal Appeal No. 5105 of 2005 before the High Court Division. Both the Death Reference, the Criminal Appeals and the Jail Appeal were heard analogously.  The High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order dated 04.01.2011 rejected the Death Reference and dismissed both the Criminal Appeals and the Jail Appeal with alteration and modification of their conviction and sentence from under Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code to one under sections 304 Part II/ 34 of the Penal Code and sentenced both of them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to pay a fine of Tk. 10,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 1 year each.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the  aforesaid judgment and order  dated 4-01-2011 passed by the High Court Division the State preferred  Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal  No. 196 of 2011 before this Division.<br/> <br/>Mr. Motahar Hossain, the learned Deputy Attorney General, appearing for the petitioner submits that the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division clearly shows non-application of judicial mind in rejecting  the Death Reference and dismissing the  Criminal Appeals and Jail Appeal with modification and alteration of conviction and sentence of the accused respondent from under sections 302/34  to one under section 304 Part II /34 of the Penal Code  and thereby the High Court Division altered the sentence of the accused respondent from death penalty to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years  and fine of  Tk. 10,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year more. He then submits that the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division clearly shows non-consideration of the evidence on record both oral and documentary while the learned Sessions Judge  rightly convicted  the accused respondent  on consideration of oral and documentary  evidence on record as the prosecution proved the guilt of the accused respondent beyond  reasonable doubt and as such the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division is liable to be set aside and the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed  by the learned Sessions Judge be restored.<br/> <br/>We have heard the learned Advocates for both sides and perused the Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal, impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and other materials on record.<br/> <br/>The informant Mohammad Serajul Islam, as P.W.1 deposed that on 26.01.2001 at 12:30 pm. while his son, Shafiqul Islam Shanto, was returning home after playing game of cricket at Eidgah field the accused persons, namely, Md. Rasel alias Russel and Md. Rubel, blocked his way and forcibly snatched a sunglass from his pocket when Shanto resisted an altercation took place between them and the accused  respondent Rasel alias Russel at the behest of accused Rubel kept dealing fist blows to Shanto causing bleeding injuries and as a result Shanto fell to the ground and blood came out from his nose and mouth. At the relevant time the informant was at a garment factory at Khanpur. Having received information about the occurrence he came to Khanpur Hospital to see Shanto in senseless condition and heard about the occurrence from his younger sister Shamima, younger brother Saiful, and Shanto’s friends Rajib and Sajib. Considering the critical condition, Shanto was sent to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital by a Microbus with the help of his brother Saiful and other relatives. He forthwith went to Dhaka Medical College Hospital to hear that Shanto had died. He came back from Dhaka and lodged the First Information Report (hereinafter referred to as FIR) of the case with Fatullah Police Station. This witness further deposed that police held inquest on the dead body of Shanto in Dhaka Morgue and prepared inquest report. He identified the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel and Rubel, in the dock. He further deposed that at the time of occurrence the victim Shanto being a student of Class IX was 16 years old. In his cross-examination this witness stated that having heard about the occurrence from his younger brother, Saiful and younger sister, Shamima he lodged the F.I.R. of the case with Fatullah Police Station. He denied the defence-suggestions that the accused-persons did not deal any blow to his son Shanto or that Shanto died when he went to play cricket or that he falsely implicated the accused persons in the case out of grudge and enmity.<br/> <br/>On perusal of the evidence on record, we have found that the informant of the case, Md. Sirajul Islam, father of the victim Shafiqul Islam Shanto, as P.W.1 proved the prosecution case. In this case the prosecution examined 16 witnesses on their behalf. But there were 5 eye witnesses, namely, P.W.3 Md. Irfan Sarder, P.W.5 Saiful Islam, P.W.6 Nurul Islam, P.W.9 Moslam and P.W.11 Neela Begum who  witnessed the occurrence from a close distance. P.W.3 Md. Imran Sarder, a neighbour of the informant P.W.1, as an eye witness corroborating the evidence of other P.Ws deposed that as a neighbour he knew the informant and his son Shanto and that on 26.12.2001 at 12.00/12.30 p.m. he witnessed an altercation at the time of snatching a sunglass by the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel and the accused Rubel from the victim Shanto and suddenly at the behest of the accused Russel the accused respondent Russel dealt fist blows to Shanto causing bleeding injuries as a result Shanto fell to the ground and blood came out from his nose and mouth. He along with Saiful Islam (P.W.5), uncle of Shanto, poured water on the head of Shanto. Shanto was taken to the Khanpur Hospital and thereafter he was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where he died. P.W.5 Saiful Islam another eye witness of the occurrence corroborating other prosecution witnesses in material particulars deposed that on 26.12.2001 at 12.00/12.30 p.m. at the behest of the accused Rubel, the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel kept assaulting Shanto with fist blows causing bleeding injuries and as a result Shanto fell to the ground in injured condition and blood came out from his nose and mouth. This witness along with his sister Shamima and neighbour Nurul Islam took Shanto initially to the Khanpur Hospital. Subsequently he along with his sister took Shanto to the Dhaka Medical Collage Hospital. P.W.6 Nurul Islam, a neighbour of the informant P.W.1, saw the occurrence from a close distance and he corroborated the evidence of other prosecution witnesses, namely, P.W.3, P.W.5, P.W.9 and P.W.11 in material particulars. Moslem, a shopkeeper of the locality being an eye witness of the occurrence as P.W.9 corroborating the evidence of other prosecution witnesses deposed that on 26.12.2001 at 12/12.30 p.m. while he was staying beside the place of occurrence he saw that at one stage of altercation accused respondent Rasel alias Russel dealing fist blows to Shanto caused injuries and as a result Shanto fell to the ground. Shanto was taken initially to the Khanpur Hospital by his relatives and thereafter he was taken to the Dhaka Medical Collage Hospital where he died. Another eye witness, Neela Begum, an old lady of the neighbourhood, as P.W.11 corroborating the evidence of other prosecution witnesses deposed that on the date of occurrence at noon when she was going to take bath she saw the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel and the accused Rubel to deal fist blows on the head of Shanto causing injuries. Subsequently she heard that Shanto was taken to the Dhaka Medical Collage Hospital for treatment where he died. All these eye witnesses corroborated the evidence of the informant P.W.1 and other prosecution witnesses and they also corroborated each other in material particulars and thus they proved the prosecution case beyond reasonable doubt. P.W.2 Shamim Ahamed deposed that when he went to Khanpur Hospital to see Shanto, the occurrence was narrated to him by Shanto and his friends Sajib and Rajib. Other prosecution witnesses, namely, P.W.4 Mrs. Hena Begum, mother of the victim Shanto, P.W.7 Mojibur Rahaman, P.W.8 Boshir, P.W.10 Jalal Hossain and P.W.12 Nazir Hossain were in the neighbourhood at the relevant time but they were not the eye witnesses. They deposed that hearing hue and cry they went to the place of occurrence immediately after the occurrence and came to learn that  when Shanto was returning  home after playing cricket game from Eidgah Field the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel and the accused Rubel blocked his way and forcibly snatched his sunglass which resulted in an altercation between them. At the behest of the accused Rubel the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel dealt fist blows to Shanto causing bleeding injuries and as a result blood came out from his nose and mouth and he fell to the ground. They heard that Shanto was taken to the Hospital where he died. They also corroborated the evidence of other prosecution witnesses. P.W.13 Dr. Md. Nur Hossain who performed the post-mortem examination of the dead body of the victim Shanto and proved the post-mortem report which corroborated the evidence of the prosecution witnesses in respect of the injuries inflicted to the victim Shanto. P.W.14 Md. Feroz Khan as a part Investigation Officer deposed that during investigation he visited the place of occurrence, drew sketch map with index and recorded the statements of witnesses under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. P.W.15 Md. Abdul Hye, Officer-in-Charge, Fatullah Police Station another Investigation Officer, took over the charge of investigation after departure of P.W.14 Feroz Khan. P.W. 15 after completion of investigation having found a prima facie case against the accused persons submitted charge sheet under the aforesaid provisions of law against them including the accused  respondent Rasel alias Russel.<br/> <br/>From a careful scrutiny of the evidence on record and so also in view of the discussions made hereinabove, it is clear that at the time of snatching a sunglass an altercation took place between the victim Shafiqul Islam Shanto and the accused Rubel and the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel and at the behest of the accused Rubel, the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel suddenly dealt fist blows on the nose, mouth and head of the victim Shanto causing bleeding injuries and as a result Shanto fell to the ground and blood came out from his nose and mouth. Shanto was initially taken to the Khanpur Hospital then to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital in a critical condition where he died on the same date at 5-30 P.M. From the evidence on record it appears that the victim Shanto was killed by fist blows of the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel at the behest of accused Rubel. So it is proved beyond resonable doubt that the accused persons, namely, Md. Rasel alias Russel and Md. Rubel killed the victim Shanto.<br/> <br/>Now, the pertinent question to answer is whether the offence as committed by the aforesaid accused-persons will come within the purview of an offence of murder punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code or culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under section 304 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>Culpable homicide has been defined in section 299 of the Penal Code as under: “Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injuries as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide”.<br/><br/>According to Section 300 of the Penal Code Culpable homicide amounted to murder in any of the four circumstances “:..... If the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death or-<br/>         2ndly, if it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injuries as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or<br/>         3rdly, if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injuries to any person and the bodily injuries intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or-<br/>         4thly, if the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodily injuries as is likely to cause death and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injuries as aforesaid.”<br/> <br/>In the case of State –vs- Tayab Ali 40 DLR (AD) 6 this Division underlined the difference between culpable homicide amounting to murder and culpable homicide not amounting to murder in the following terms : <strong>“</strong>All murders are culpable homicide but all culpable homicides are not murder. Excepting the General Exceptions attached to the definition of murder an act committed either with certain guilty intention or with certain guilty knowledge constitutes culpable homicide amounting to murder. If the criminal act is done with the intention of causing death then it is murder clear and simple. In all other cases of culpable homicide, it is the degree of probability of death from certain injuries which determines whether the injuries constitute murder or culpable homicide not amounting to murder. If death is likely result of the injuries it is culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and if death is the most likely result, then it is murder.<strong>”</strong> The difference between "Culpable Homicide" and "Culpable Homicide amounting to Murder is the mere degree of probability of the death being caused; when death is probable, it is Culpable Homicide and when death is most probable, then it is Murder". Culpable homicide is not murder when the case is brought within any of the five Exceptions to section 300 of the Penal Code. In order to prove the charge of murder the prosecution must be required to bring the case under any of the four clauses of section 300 of the Penal Code. The prosecution case as appears from the evidence of the informant P.W.1 and corroborated by five eye witnesses, namely, P.W.3, P.W.5, P.W. 6, P.W.9 and P.W.11 is that when the victim Shafiqul Islam Shanto after playing game of cricket at Eidgah field came in front of their house, accused Rasel alias Russel, Rubel and Robiul blocked his way and forcibly snatched a sunglass from his pocket when Shanto raised objection an altercation took place between them. At the behest of the accused Rubel, the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel suddenly dealt fist blows on the nose, mouth and head of Shanto causing bleeding injuries as a result Shanto fell to the ground and blood came out from his nose and mouth. Thereafter, Shanto was taken to the Khanpur Hospital wherefrom he was transferred to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital where he died on the same day at 5.30 P.M. So, there is no doubt that the death of Shanto occurred as a result of the fist blows dealt by the accused respondent Russel at the behest of the accused Rubel. We have to decide whether the accused respondent Russel committed culpable homicide amounting to murder or culpable homicide not amounting to murder. In this context it is worthwhile to refer to the following decisions of the appex courts of the Sub-Continent.<br/> <br/>In the case reported in AIR 1979 S.C 1532 the Supreme Court of India held that as a general rule a person who voluntarily inflicts injuries on another so as to endanger his life must always, except under extraordinary circumstances, be taken to know that his act is likely to cause death. In the same case the Supreme Court observed that the question whether the accused had the knowledge that his act was likely to cause death is a question of fact depending upon the circumstances of the particular case, the weapon used, the part of the body on which the injuries was inflicted, the number of the injuries caused, the deliberateness of the act etc. In the case of Jagtar Singh v. State of Punjab reported in AIR 1983 S.C. 463 the relevant fact is that the deceased Narinder Singh accompanied by Romesh Kumar was proceeding towards Nandan Cinema. When they were passing in front of the house of the accused appellant Jagtar Singh, deceased Narider Singh was injured by the projecting parnala of the house of the appellant. Deceased Narinder Singh protested to the accused appellant and asked him to raise the height of the parnala. There was exchange of abuses in this back ground, accused appellant Jagtar Singh and Joginder Singh caught hold of Narinder Singh and on being instigated by Joginder Singh, the accused appellant Jagtar Singh gave one blow with knife which landed on the chest of deceased Narinder Singh. After some time Narinder Singh succumbed to his injuries. The appellant Jagtar Singh also caused injuries to the companion of deceased Narinder Singh. In this case the Court found that there was no premeditation and no malice and the quarrel took place on the spur of the moment<strong>.</strong> The meeting was a chance meeting. The appellant never expected to meet the deceased.  The quarrel was of the trivial nature even in such a trivial quarrel the appellant wielded a weapon like a knife and landed a blow in the chest. The Supreme Court of India observed: “In these circumstances, it is a permissible inference that the appellant at least could be imputed with a knowledge that he was likely to cause an injuries which was likely to cause death. Therefore, the appellant is shown to have committed an offence under Section 304, Part II of the I.P.C. and a sentence of imprisonment for 5 years will meet the ends of justice.” Accordingly, the appeal was partly allowed, the conviction of the appellant for an offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sentence of imprisonment for life were set aside. Appellant was convicted for having committed an offence under Section 304, Part II of the Indian Penal Code and he was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 5 years.<br/> <br/>In the case of Government of Bangladesh vs Siddique Ahmed reported in 31 D.L.R (AD) 29 the Appellate Division observed: “Section 304 of the Code which consists of two parts, does not create any offence but provides for the punishment of manslaughter or culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The Section makes a distinction in the award of punishment. Under the first part of the Section, the intention to kill is present, and the act would have amounted to murder if the act is done with the intention of causing such bodily injuries as is likely to cause death, but the act having fallen within any one of the five exceptions, in Section 300 of the Code, the offence will fall within its ambit. The second part of the Section is attracted to a case where the act is done with the knowledge likely to cause death but without any intention of causing death or to a case where bodily injuries is caused as is likely to cause death. The first part applies to a case where there is guilty intention, and the second part where there is no such intention, but there is guilty knowledge”. In the case of Thola vs State of Tamil Nadu reported in AIR 1984 S.C. 759 the fact was that the accused started protest using filthy language against certain organisers of a chit fund who had no connection with the deceased, in front of the house of the deceased.  Hearing the noise the deceased came out of his house and asked the accused to  leave the place but the accused on spur of moment gave only one blow with knife to the deceased and pushed him to some distance. The Supreme Court of India held that in the circumstances of the case though requisite intention to commit murder could not be attributed to the accused, he wielded a weapon like a knife and therefore, he could be attributed with knowledge that he was likely to cause an injuries which was likely to “cause death”. In such a situation he could not be convicted under S. 302 of the Penal Code. Accordingly, he was convicted under section 304 Part II of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>Culpable homicide is not murder when the case falls within any of the five exceptions mentioned in section 300 of the Penal Code. In the case of Jagrup Singh v. The State of Haryana reported in AIR 1981 S.C. 1552 the Supreme Court of India held that where the accused struck the deceased with the blunt side of a gandhala in the heat of the moment without premeditation and in a sudden fight, the case would be culpable homicide not amounted to murder pursuant to Exception 4 to Section 300 of the Penal Code. Clause “Thirdly” of Section 300 is not applicable to such a case. The Supreme Court of India held that the accused would be convicted under Section 304 Part II of the Penal Code and not under Section 302 of the Penal Code. In this context it is profitable to reproduce Exception 4 to section 300 of the Penal Code which reads as under “Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender’s having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.”  In the case reported in AIR 1979 SC 133 the Supreme Court of India enumerated the elements of Exception 4 in the following  manner: (1) without premeditation;(2) in a sudden fight; (3) in the heat of passion; (4) upon a sudden quarrel; and (5) without the offender taking undue advantage or without acting in a cruel or unusual manner. From the facts and circumstances of the instant case it appears that the case does not fall under any of the circumstances as stated in section 300 of the Penal Code. Rather this case falls under Exception 4 to Section 300 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>In view of the foregoing decisions the established principle of law is that when in an altercation which is trivial in nature the accused without any premeditation in the hit of passion suddenly dealt  blows not by any deadly weapon but by a fist on the vital organs of the victim causing bleeding injuries as a result the victim died not instantaneously on the spot but in the hospital a few hours after the occurrence, the requisite intention to commit murder could not be attributed to the accused rather he could be attributed with the knowledge that he was likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death or to cause such bodily injuries as was likely to cause death within the purview of Section 304 part II of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>In this case at the time of snatching of a sunglass an altercation took place between the victim Shanto and the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel and the accused Rubel and without any pre-mediation in the heat of the passion the accused respondent Russel suddenly dealt fist blows on the neck, mouth and head of the victim Shanto causing bleeding injuries as a result Shanto fell to the ground and blood came out from his nose and mouth. There was no intention of causing death or causing any such bodily injuries as was likely to cause death.  The altercation was trivial in nature and there was no use of any deadly weapon to cause the death of the victim Shanto. Moreover, the victim did not met his death instantaneously after the occurrence on the spot. In fact he died in the Dhaka Medical Collage Hospital a few hours after the occurrence.  From the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the aforesaid decisions we are of the view that the accused respondent in the heat of passion suddenly dealt fist blows to the nose, mouth and head of the victim Shanto causing bleeding injuries and therefore the requisite intention to commit murder could not be attributed to the accused respondent, rather he could be attributed with the knowledge that he was likely to cause death but without any intention to cause death or to cause such bodily injuries as was likely to cause death which brings the case within the purview of Section 304 Part II of the Penal Code. Therefore, the High Court Division rightly found that the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel committed culpable homicide not amounting to murder under sections 304 Part II/34 of the Penal Code and convicted and Sentenced him there under to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to pay a fine of Tk. 10,000/- in default to rigorous imprisonment for 1 (one) year more.<br/> <br/>In view of the discussions made herein above, and so also on consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case we  are of the view that there was no illegality in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division in dismissing the appeals and affirming the judgment and order dated 29-11-2005 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Narayangonj in Sessions Case No. 77 of 2005 with alteration of conviction from under sections 302/34 to one under Sections 304 part II and 34 of the Penal Code and reduction of sentence imposed upon the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel  from death penalty to rigorous imprisonment for 10 (ten) years and to pay a fine of Tk. 10,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year more. Consequently, the High Court Division rightly passed the impugned judgment and order dismissing the Criminal Appeal No.5038 of 2005 and the Jail Appeal No.1528 of 2005 and affirming the judgment and order passed by the learned Sessions Judge in Sessions Case No. 77 of 2005 with alteration of conviction and reduction of sentence. The Death Reference was also rightly rejected by the High Court Division.<br/><br/>         In the result, the instant Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal is dismissed. The impugned judgment and Order of conviction and sentence dated 04-01-2011 passed by the High Court Division is affirmed so far as it relates to the accused respondent Rasel alias Russel.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
