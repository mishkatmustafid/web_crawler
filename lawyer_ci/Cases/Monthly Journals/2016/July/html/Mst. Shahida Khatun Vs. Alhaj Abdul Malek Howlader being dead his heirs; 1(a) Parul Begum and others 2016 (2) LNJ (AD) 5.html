Harun-Ar-Rashid, Advocate, instructed by Syed Mahbubar Rahman, Advocate-on-Record.<br/><strong>For Respondents: </strong>Not represented<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Md. Abdul Wahhab Miah. J:</u></strong> This petition for leave to appeal has been filed against the judgment and order dated the 12th day of June, 2012  passed by a learned Judge of the Single Bench of the High Court  Division in Civil Revision No.700 of 2005 discharging the Rule.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Facts necessary to dispose this petition are that respondent No.1  as the plaintiff filed Title Suit No.284 of 2000 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Dohar for declaration of title and for recovery of khas  possession. Subsequently, the suit being transferred to the Court of Assistant Judge, First Court, Dhaka was renumbered as Title Suit No.400 of 1997.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the suit the petitioner herein was defendant No. I. Eventually, the suit was decreed exparte on 03.09.2002. The plaintiff levied Title Execution Case No.5 of 2002 for execution of the decree and pursuant to the decree, he was put into possession of the suit land. Thereafter the defendant filed an application before the Executing Court under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) on 01.03.2004 with the prayer to put him into possession of the suit land on the ground that the suit land on the ground that the plaintiff obtained the decree by practicing fraud. The Executing Court by its order dated 03.10.2004 rejected the application.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Against the order of the Executing Court, the defendant filed Civil Revision No.302 of 2004 before the District Judge, Dhaka under section 115(2) of the Code. The learned District Judge, Dhaka summarily rejected the same on 03.10.2004. Against the order of the learned District Judge, the defendant filed Civil Revision No.700 of 2005 before the High Court Division under section 115(4) of the Code and obtained a Rule. A learned Judge of the Single Bench by the impugned judgment and order discharged the Rule; hence this petition for leave to appeal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">During hearing of the petition, it transpired that against the exparte decree the decree the defendant had filed Title Appeal No.619 of 2002 before the District Judge, Dhaka and eventually the appeal was dismissed. Thus it is clear that the exparte decree is still in force.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Harun-Ar-Rashid, learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner has argued that since the exparte decree was obtained by practising fraud. The executing Court had power to put back the defendant int possession of the suit land. We cannot accept the submission of Mr. Harun-Ar-Rashid for the simple reason that rightly or wrongly so long the decree remains that cannot be nullified or set at naught by putting the defendant into possession of the suit land which the plaintiff got through the due process of law in execution of the decree passed in the suit. We are of the view that If the defendant succeeds to set aside the exparte decree he would not be without any remedy and he shall be surely entitled to restitution of possession of the suit land under section 144 of the Code. Mr. Harun-Ar-Rashid has referred to some decisions in which the High Court Division and this Court as well interfered on the ground of fraud under section 151 of the Code. It does not require any elaboration for the proposition that If fraud is detected Court can always act under section 151 of the Code, but when the decree passed in a suit or a case is in existence no relief can be given to the defendant by way of restitution or restoration of possession of the suit land wherein the plaintiff was put in the possession through due process of law. We would like to observe further that since the appeal has been dismissed, the remedy of the defendant is to file revision application before the High Court Division.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">With above observation this petition is dismissed.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed.</strong></div><div> <hr/><div id="ftn1"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><strong><u>Civil Petition For Leave To Appeal No.</u></strong></a><strong><u> 3039 Of 2012 </u></strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 12<sup>t</sup><sup>h</sup> June, 2012 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.700 of 2005).</div></div></div></div>
