N. Deb Choudhury, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/><strong>1.</strong> This first appeal has been filed against the judgment and decree dated 17.06.2009 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, Second Court, Narayangonj in Title Suit No. 31 of 2009, rejecting the plaint.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> The plaintiff-appellant on 25.01.2009 filed Civil Suit No. 31 of 2009 before the Joint District Judge, Second Court, Narayangonj for specific performance of contract.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> Plaintiff’s case for the purpose of the disposal of this first appeal in short, is that the defendant No. 1 agreed to sell the suit land at a consideration of Tk. 11,02,000.00 in favour of the plaintiff and on receiving Tk. 10,92,000.00, executed a registered bainapatra on 13.03.2007 and the plaintiff on different occasion approached the defendant No. 1 and lastly on 01.01.2009 requested the defendant No. 1 to execute and register the kabala; but, the defendant No. 1 ultimately denied the same and accordingly, filed the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Defendant No. 1 contested the suit by filing written statement and contended inter alia that the defendant No. 1 being aged of 85 years and taking advantage of his ailment, the plaintiff created the bainapatra. The defendant No. 1 never received any amount from the plaintiff nor given possession of the suit land. After knowledge of the bainapatra, defendant No. 1 filed a criminal case being Petition Case No. 978 of 2007 under Section 341, 384, 506 and 109 of the Penal Code on 15.05.2007 against the plaintiff and in that criminal case on being negotiated by the local elderly persons, defendant No. 1 and plaintiff filed joint compromise petition and as per terms of the compromise the plaintiff undertook not to file any case pursuant to the bainapatra dated 13.03.2007 and also stated in the written statement that the present suit is barred by limitation.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> The defendant No. 1 on 31.03.2009 filed an application under Order 7 Rule 11 (d) of the Code of the Civil Procedure for rejection of the plaint on the ground that the bainapatra was executed on 13.09.2007 and the suit was filed on 25.01.2009 and in view of Section 54A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and in view of Article 113 of the Limitation Act, 1908, the present suit is hopelessly barred by limitation.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> The trial Court by order dated 17.06.2009 on considering the statements made in the plaint and in view of Section 54A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and Article 113 of the Limitation Act, 1908, rejected the plaint.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Being aggrieved the plaintiff preferred the instant first appeal and during pendency of the appeal filed an application for injunction and on 17.11.2009, Rule was issued being Civil Rule No. 911 (F) of 2009 and ad-interim order was passed restraining defendant-respondent No. 1 from dispossessing the plaintiff-appellant from the suit land and also from transferring the suit land to anyone till disposal of the Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> Mr. Shasti Sarker, the learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff-appellant submits that the trial Court while rejecting the plaint failed to consider the third column of Article 113 of the Limitation Act, 1908 which clearly provides under the hearing “Time from which period begins to run” is the date fixed for the performance or if no such date is fixed, when the plaintiff has notice that performance is refused and in the present case the defendant No. 1 ultimately refused on 01.01.2009 and filed the suit on 25.01.2009 and as such the suit as filed cannot be held to be barred by limitation. He next submits that the provisions of Section 54A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 are for the purpose of execution and registration of the instrument of the sale and have no manner of application in the present case. In support of his submissions he relied upon a case of Khan Mohammad Amir vs. Atiqur Rahman and others, reported in 5 ALR (2015) 307 and on submitting the above he prayed for setting-aside the impugned judgment and decree of rejection of the plaint on allowing the appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> We have heard the learned advocate for the plaintiff-appellant, perused the plaint, written statement, application and the impugned judgment and decree of the trial Court.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> Admittedly the bainapatra was executed and registered on 13.03.2007 and there is no period mentioned in the bainapatra for execution and registration of the instrument of the sale. The suit is for specific performance of contract has been filed on 25.01.2009 i.e. after almost 1 year 9 months 13 days from the date of bainapatra. Section 54A of the Transfer of Property Act has been inserted by Act No. XXVI of 2004 which specifically mentioned that the same will come into effect from 1<sup>st</sup> July, 2005. Section 54A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 reads as follows:<br/> </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size:14px">“54A. <strong>Contract for sale to be registered,</strong><strong> etc-</strong> <em>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Act or any other law for the time being in force, a contract for sale of any immovable property can be made only by an instrument in writing and registered under the Registration Act, 1908, whether or not the transferee has taken possession of the property or any part thereof. </em><br/><em>In a contract for sale of any immovable property, a time, to be effective from the date of registration, shall be mentioned for execution and registration of the instrument of sale, and if no time is mentioned, six months shall be deemed to be the time.”</em></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px"> <br/><strong>11.</strong> From a plain reading of Section 54A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, it appears that the said section starts with the words “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Act or any other law for the time being in force” and it has also provides that in every instrument of contract for sale of any immovable property, the time to be effective from the date of registration, shall be mentioned for the execution and registration of the instrument of sale and if no time is mentioned, 6(six) months shall be deemed to be the time. So, it appears that in every contract for sale there should be a time mentioned for execution and registration of the instrument of sale and if no time is mentioned it will be deemed to be 6(six) months.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> Admittedly the contract for sale in the present suit, executed and registered on 13.03.2007 and there is no time mentioned in the contract for sale for execution and registration of the instrument of sale and in view of Section 54A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, the time shall be deemed to be 6(six) months for execution and registration of the instrument of sale.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> Article 113 of the Limitation Act, 1908 reads as follows:<br/> </span></div><table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td style="height:26px; text-align:justify; width:133px"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong><em>Description of suit</em></strong></span></td><td style="height:26px; text-align:justify; width:144px"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong><em>Period of limitation </em></strong></span></td><td style="height:26px; text-align:justify; width:240px"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong><em>Time from which period beings to run</em></strong></span></td></tr><tr><td style="height:47px; text-align:justify; width:133px"><span style="font-size:14px">113.

The second part of third column “or, if no such date is fixed, when the plaintiff has notice that performance is refused” cannot override the first part of the third column.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> In view of the above there is no option; but, to hold that the contract for sale dated 13.03.2007 be deemed for the purpose of execution and registration of the instrument of sale to be 6(six) months and as such, 13.09.2007 was the last date for execution and registration of the instrument of sale and failing thereto in view of Article 113 of the Limitation Act, 1908, the last date for filing the suit was 13.09.2008. Accordingly, the suit as filed on 25.01.2009 is hopelessly barred by limitation.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> It is the settled principle of law that while the ultimate result of the suit is as clear as the daylight, such a suit should be buried at its inception so that no further time is consumed in a fruitless litigation.

(Abdul Hamid Road Branch, Pabna) as plaintiff instituted the aforesaid Artha Rin Mortgage Suit No.43 of 1996 in the Court of Joint District Judge and Artha Rin Adalat, Pabna claiming an amount of Tk. 16,90,54,541.55 with interest against the defendant-respondents.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> Plaintiff’s case in short is that  the defendant No.1, company was registered on 11.11.67 by the joint stock company  and thereafter started production of cotton on 9.11.68. After liberation the defendant company  was nationalized  on 26.03.1972 by the Govt. of Bangladesh and its management was entrusted with Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation,  who availed loan from bank to run the mill. Pursuant to the policy decision of the Government the defendant company owing Calico Textile Mills, which was denationalized and its management was returned to its original sponsors and shareholders and the Government retained certain percentage shares of the defendant No.1, Company.   In the process of denationalization a tripartite agreement was executed between the Government of Bangladesh and the original sponsors of the defendant company and shareholders and the plaintiff bank. Loan in the name of BTMC amounting to TK. 5.17 crore as on 03.07.88 was transferred to Agrani Bank as per tripartite agreement dated 27.05.1988 executed by BTMC, defendant Mill and Bank. The Managing Director of Calico Cotton Mills under took to pay BTMC’s transferred liability on 24.05.1988  (exhibit-8) and thereafter, the defendant Mill further under took in writing to pay BTMC’s liability vide letter dated 15.04.1992 (exhibit-9). The plaintiff bank in not getting loan amount with interest   as per terms of loan sectioned letter served a   legal notice on 17.04.1996 claiming to repay outstanding loan of TK. 1,10,16,572.00 in CC (Pledge), TK. 1,60,58,457.83 in CC (hypo) &amp; BTMC’s transferred liability of TK. 12,81,92,866.00 totaling TK. 15,52,67,894.83 as on 31.03.1996   and thereafter, the defendant Calico Cotton Mill’s Chairman &amp; Director replied to the legal notice on 26.04.1996 (Exhibit-12) admitting the claim of the bank but on various pretext they did not come forward to adjust the loan liabilities and hence, the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The defendant-respondents duly appeared in the suit and filed two sets of written statements taking the general pleas of maintainability of the suit, absence of cause of action and of being barred by limitation, bad for defect of parties. The claim of the plaintiff is false and without any basis and as such, the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> At the trial the plaintiff side examined only one witness and the defendant side in all examined two witnesses and both the parties exhibited some documents to prove their respective cases.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> The learned Joint District Judge and Artha Rin Adalat after hearing the parties and on considering the evidence and materials on record decreed the suit in-part by the impugned judgment and decree dated 7.5.2003.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 7.5.2003 the plaintiff-Agrani Bank Limited filed this appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> Mr. Md. Mamunur Rashid, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the plaintiff-appellant-bank in the course of his argument after placing the impugned judgment and decree,  the evidence of PW-1, DW-1 and DW-2 and other materials on record including the tripartite agreement (Ext.7) submits that the Artha Rin Adalat erred in law in decreeing the suit in-part without properly considering the facts and circumstance of the case and the case made out by the plaintiff-bank that the liability of loan during the period of management of BTMC was transferred to Agrani Bank as per tripartite agreement (Ext.7) and everything was stated in the tripartite agreement which was admitted in evidence and it is on record that on 5.7.1988 the loan transferee  branch of the bank was informed that total liability of  Tk. 5,17,03,151.37 which was transferred through tripartite agreement and interest was charged up-to 03.07.1988. As per section 50 Artharin Adalat Ain-2003 no court can disallow interest which is to be calculated from the date of granting loan up-to the date of filing suit and as per section 50(2) of the Ain the Court is bound to grant pendente lite simple interest @ 12% p.a. from the dated of judgment to till realization. He further submits that the learned trial Judge had misunderstood and misappreciated the evidence on record and misjudged the issues in the suit and thereby   arrived at a erroneous decision to decree the suit in-part against the defendant Nos.1 to 3, (a), 9(b) and 10.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> Finally, Mr. Md. Mamunur Rashid submits that  admittedly a tripartite agreement having been executed between the defendants, Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation (BTMC) and the  plaintiff in which the defendants admitted the loan liability of the defendant No.1 during the time B.T.M.C. was in the management of the defendant No.1, company and the defendants acknowledged to pay the same with interest and as such,  the finding of the Artharin Adalat in the  language <strong>“</strong><strong>বি,টি,এম,সি, এর ব্যবসহাপনা থাকাকালে কত টাকা ১ নং বিবাদী প্রতিষ্ঠানের নামে ঋণ গ্রহন করা হয় এবং কত পার্সেন্ট সুদে উও্র ঋণ গ্রহন করা হয় ইহা বাদী ব্যাংক প্রমান করিতে পারে নাই।</strong>” is perverse being contrary to law and fact.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> Mr. Habibul Islam Bhuiyan, the learned Advocate, appearing on behalf of the defendant-respondent No.5, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment,  which was according to him just, correct and proper. He submits that the plaintiff-bank has utterly failed to prove  its claim with regard to the amount of Tk. . 13,99,95,226.00 allegedly transferred from  BTMC and as such, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> We have heard the learned Advocates for both the sides and perused the record. Now, only the material question is to be considered in this appeal whether the Artha Rin Adalat committed any wrong or illegality in not giving decree against the loan of B.T.M.C. as well as  interest against C,C (hypo)   and pledge  loan from the date of filing of the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> On scrutiny of the record, it appears that the plaintiff bank claimed  two kinds of loan, that is, one was transferred from BTMC amounting to TK. 13,99,95,226.00  and the loan taken by the defendant-mill after denationalization amounting to TK. 1,18,45,285.50 (CC pledge) and Tk. 1,72,14,40.05 (CC hypo) although with regard to the claim of Tk. 13,99,95,226.00 the plaintiff-appellant did not mention in the plaint on which date and from which bank how much money was taken as loan on what interest while the defendant-respondent No. 1 (mill)  was under the control of BTMC. It further appears that the defendant respondents in their  written statement  categorically stated that the Government has issued 18.04 crore Treasurery Bond in favour of the plaintiff bank against the loan Exhibit-Kha (4),   which was admitted by PW-1 in his evidence.  It also appears from  the memo No. <strong>0/4/nwg-03/16/386(1) </strong><strong>vide-</strong><strong> cÖ`: N/4</strong>,  the Ministry of Textile has decided  to remit the 100% interest of the loan with a condition that the loanee will submit 10% down payment against the loan and accordingly, the defendant-respondent No. 1 submitted the said 10% down payment.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> The learned judge of the Artha Rin Adalat on the facts of the case and on consideration of the legal position  observed:  “এ ছাড়া প্রদঃ ঘ/৪ বস্ত্রমন্ত্রনালয়ের ০/৪/হাম-০৩/১৬/৩৮৬(১) পত্র পর্যালোচনা করিয়া দেখা যায় ১ নং বিবাদী প্রতিষ্ঠানের নামে বি,টি,এম,সি-র ব্যবসহাপনায় থাকাকালে গৃহীত ঋণের সুদ মওকুফ করা হয়। যাহার প্রেক্ষিতে বানিজ্যিক ব্যাংকের যে আর্থিক ক্ষতি হয় তাহার শতকরা ৫০ ভাগ সরকার বহন করে।  উক্ত সিদ্ধান্তর প্রেক্ষিতে ১ নং বিবাদী প্রতিষ্ঠান ও কুষ্টিয়া টেক্মটাইল মিলের ঋণ পুনঃ তপসিলের সুবিধার্থে সরকার ১৮.০৪ কোটি টাকার বন্ড বাদী ব্যাংক বরাবর ইস্যু করে। সরকার কর্তৃক ইস্যুকৃত উও্র বন্ডের যে টাকা বাদী ব্যাংক ১ নং বিবাদী প্রতিষ্ঠানের নামে গৃহীত ঋণের বিপরীতে প্রদত্ত হইয়াছে তাহা দাবীকৃত টাকা হইতে বাদ যাইবেz কিন্তু বাদী ব্যাংক তদমর্মে কোন হিসাব বা কোন প্রতিবেদন দাখিল করে নাই। ফলে, বাদী ব্যাংক বি,টি,এম,সির হিসাবে কত টাকা প্রাপ্য হইবে তাহার সঠিক কোন হিসাব আদালতে উপস্থাপন করে নাই। অত্র মোকদ্দমায় বি,টি,এম,সি-এর ব্যবসহাপনায় থাকাকালে গৃহীত ঋণ ৬৭,৬৯,০০০/- (সাতষটির লক্ষ উনসত্তর হাজার) টাকার বিপরীতে  বিবাদীগনের উপর ১৩,৯৯,৯৫,২২৬/- (তের কোটি নিরানব্বই লক্ষ পঁচানব্বই হাজার দুইতশ ছাত্রিশ) টাকা বাবদ ডিএ্রী প্রদান করা অযৌও্রিক। অত্র ঋণ মওকুফের জন্য সরকারের  বিবেচনাতে আছে এবং বি,টি,এম,সি-র নিয়ন্ত্রনে থাকাকালীন গৃহীত ঋণের টাকা অত্রাকারে অত্র মোকদ্দমার অন্তর্ভুও্র হইলে জটিলতা সৃষ্টি হইবে। সে কারনে বি,টি,এম,সি, গৃহীত ঋনের বিষয়ে অত্র মোকদ্দমায় সিদ্ধান্ত হইল না। তবে বি,টি,এম, সি-র পরিচালনায় থাকা কালে গৃহীত ঋণের পরিমান, পরিশোধীত ঋণের পরিমান, সরকার কর্তৃক বন্ড মাধ্যমে পরিশোধের পর এবং সরকার কর্তৃক সুদ মওকুফের পরও বাদী ব্যাংকের কোন পাওনা থাকিলে সংশ্লিষ্টদের পক্ষভুও্র করিয়া বাদী ব্যাংক যথাযথভাবে উও্র টাকা আদায় করিতে পারিবে।”<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> This being purely a finding of fact based on correct evaluation of the facts and materials of the case.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> It is also found  that in this case the plaintiff-bank to prove its claim examined one witness as PW-1, who in his cross-examination stated that: আমি বাদী ব্যাংকে ১৯৮০ সালে যোগদান করি। এই ঋণ মনজুর ও প্রদানের সময় আমি বাদী ব্যাংকে কর্মরত ছিলাম। তখন আমি সিডি অফিসার ছিলাম। বিবাদী কত টাকা ঋণের জন্য আবেদন করে জানি না। কত টাকা মনজুর হয় বলতে পারব না। ১ নং বিবাদী  প্রতিষ্ঠান মাঝে সরকারী করনে ছিল। বি,টি,এম,সি, পরিচালনার সময় ৩ কোটি টাকার উপরে ঋণ নেয়। মুল ঋণ ছিল ৬৭,৬৯,০০০/- টাকা যাহা সুদে ৫ কোটি টাকার উপরে হয়। বি,টি,এম,সি, মুল শাখা ঢাকা হইতে ঋণ নেয়। ঐ ঋণের কাগজপত্র কোথায় আছে মনে নাই। This witness in his cross-examination also stated that: সি, সি, হাইপো খাতে সুদ আসলে কত টাকা ও সি,সি, প্লেজ খাতে কত টাকা দাবী করি মনে নাই। সি, সি, প্নেজ গুদামের বন্দকী সামগ্রি আমাদের নিয়ন্ত্রনে আসে।<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> Taking into  consideration of all these aspects of the case,  we are unable to differ with the view taken by  the  Artha Rin Adalat that the plaintiff could not prove by adducing evidence as to what amount was taken by the defendants from  BTMC which reached at the figure of TK. 13,99,95,226/=.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> Now, turning to consider the second point whether the Artha Rin Adalat committed any wrong or illegality in not giving interest against C,C (hypo)   and pledge  loan from the date of filing of the suit, as prayed for.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong> On perusal of the record, it appears that the Artha Rin Adalat after a detailed discussion of the attending circumstances borne out by records held that in view of the provision of section 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure the plaintiff-bank is not entitled to get interest pendente lite  against C, C hypo   and pledge  loan. In coming to this conclusion the said Court observed that: “১ নং বিবাদী প্রতিষ্ঠানটি একটি নিস্ক্রিয় শিল্প প্রতিষ্ঠান ও প্রতিষ্ঠানটি  বন্ধ রহিয়াছে । সরকার কর্তৃক গঠিত নিস্ক্রিয়/ রুগ্ন শিল্প প্রতিষ্ঠান বাছাই কমিটি নিস্ক্রিয় ও রুগ্ন শিল্পের বিপরীতে গৃহীত ঋণের ১০০% সুদ মওকুফের সুপারিশ রহিয়াছে । এমতাবস্থায়, দেওয়ানী কার্য্য বিধির ৩৪ ধারা মতে মামলা দাখিলের পর হইতে সি,সি হাইপো ও প্লেজ ঋণের বিপরীতে পুনরায় সুদ আরোপ করা অযৌক্তিক ও ন্যায় বিচারের পরিপন্থি।<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong> Now, in approaching the controversy it will be profitable to notice the provision contained in section 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which is quoted hereunder:<br/> <br/>34.-(1) Where and in so far as a decree is  for the payment of money, the Court may, in the decree, order interest at such rate as the Court deems reasonable to be paid on the principal sum adjudged, from the date of the suit to the date of the decree, in addition to any interest adjudged on such principal sum for any period to the institution of the suit, with further interest at such rate as the Court seems reasonable on the aggregate sum so adjudged, from the date of the decree to the date of payment, or to such earlier date as the Court thinks fit.<br/>(2) Where such a decree is silent with respect to the payment of further interest on such aggregate sum as aforesaid from the date of the decree to the date of payment or other earlier date, the Court shall be deemed to have refused such interest, and a separate suit therefore shall not lie.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong> From the provisions of this section, it transpires that the Court is empowered to grant interest from the date of the suit to the date of the decree and then on the full amount which includes the amount claimed on the date of the suit and the interest thereon granted by the Court for the aforesaid period. Further, this section provides for award of interest on the aggregate sum till the date of realization or an earlier date. It also transpires that the decree holder does not have any statutory right to get interest automatically.   Therefore, we find no difficulty whatever in holding that the grant or award of interest pendent lite is purely a matter of statutory power wherein the discretion of the Court is absolute.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong> On perusal of the  entire evidence on record,   it is found that  in the instant  case there are evidence enough on record both oral and documentary  to suggest  that the plaintiff-appellant did not care at all to submit any audit report in order to show the exact amount of money that was revealed through the process of audit as per Ext.7, tripartite agreement although   the respondent-defendant company has produced its audit report wherefrom it appears that after making through inquiry the outstanding dues of the defendant company was found to be TK. 24,98,000/= only which was  duly proved as Ext.4(Kha-1).<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong> Furthermore, in the facts and circumstance of the case the contention as raised by Mr. Md. Mamunur Rashid that as per section 50 Artharin Adalat Ain-2003 no Court can disallow interest which is to be calculated from the date of granting loan up-to the date of filing suit and as per section 50(2) of the Artharin Adalat Ain-2003  the Court is bound to grant interest pendente lite  is plainly misconceived inasmuch as in this case the impugned judgment  was delivered prior to the new Ain being Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 came into force. Therefore, we find no substance in either of the contentions as raised by the learned Advocate for the plaintiff-appellant-bank.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong> For the foregoing reasons stated above, both on law and  fact we are of the view that in the facts and circumstance of the case the Artha Rin Adalat committed no wrong in not awarding interest pendente lite  against C,C hypo   and pledge  loan. The learned judge of the Adalat on the facts of the case and on consideration of the legal position rightly decreed the suit in-part. No interference is therefore called for.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong> In the result, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong> Let a copy of this judgment along with the lower Court’s record be sent down at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></span></div></div></div>

Abdur Rahim made a petition of complaint before the Executive Magistrate, Barguna alleging inter alia that he purchased a car being No. Dhaka Metro-Cha 13-5455 through Bank. The witnesses No. 01 helped him in releasing the car from the bank. A sum of Taka 2,04,000/- (two lac four thousand) is still due to the bank. The accused hired the car at a rent of Taka 60,000/- (sixty thousand) per month from the complainant. Accordingly he handed over the car to the accused on 02.11.2013 that the witnesses No. 02 is the driver. On 02.02.2014 he brought the car to his house located at Town Hall Sarak, Barguna. The accused snatched away the car and kept the same in his possession and the accused caused irreparable loss to the complainant by the keeping the same in his possession. On the basis of this complaint M.P case being No. 211 of 2014 under section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was initiated.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The learned Executive Magistrate, Barguna examined the complainant under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and directed the Officer-in-Charge, Barguna Sadar Police Station, Barguna to hold investigation having regard to ownership of the car and submit report and that thereafter on 10.04.2014 the investigating officer submitted report.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> The accused petitioner filed an application for discharging him from the case.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> On 02.06.2014 the learned Executive Magistrate on perusal of the record and hearing the parties directed the officer in charge, Barguna Sadar Police Station to hand over the aforesaid car to the accused petitioner observing inter alia that the accused petitioner has purchased the car from Abdul Kalam Azad the real owner of the car and accordingly the aforesaid car was handed over to the accused petitioner.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid order dated 02.06.2014 the complainant filed a Criminal Revision No. 69 of 2014 before the learned Sessions Judge, Barguna.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> On transfer the aforesaid revision was heard by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Barguna who was pleased to allow the aforesaid revision vide order dated 25.06.2015 and thereby reversed the order of the learned trial  court.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> Being aggrieved by the order of the Additional Sessions Judge, Barguna passed on 25.06.2015 reversing the earlier order of the Executive Magistrate, Barguna passed on 02.06.2014 the accused petitioner filed the instant miscellaneous case which is hence before us.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> Learned Advocate Mr. Sheikh Muhammed Sirajul Islam appeared on behalf of the petitioner while learned Advocate Mr. Md. Zakir Hussain Masud re-presented the complainant-opposite parties.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> Mr. Sheikh Muhammed Sirajul Islam, learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that it appears from the materials on record that neither an information was lodged before any police station nor any petition of complaint was filed before the learned District Magistrate or an Executive Magistrate on any allegation of penal offence, but despite that the learned Executive Magistrate issued a notice upon the instant petitioner to show cause and issued search warrant for recovery of the car and directed the Officer-in-Charge, Borguna to submit report with respect to ownership of the car.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> He further contends that provision under section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can only be invoked when there is an allegation of Penal offence. He further assailed that in absence of substantive allegations, procedural law cannot be applied and hence the entire proceedings including the impugned judgment and order arising out of a case Under Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not maintainable at all and is liable to be quashed. He asserts that in the absence of any substantive allegation either in the form of F.I.R or petition of complaint, isolated proceedings under procedural law i.e. under section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is illegal and without jurisdiction. Moreover, he contends that the provision of section 98 under code of Criminal Procedure is applicable only when there are allegations of theft, forgery etc. and in absence of any specific allegation under a specific provision of the Penal Code, the application under section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is illegal. He further argues that given that there had been a “criminal” case against the petitioner over the car, even then recovery of the car by issuing search warrant upon an application under section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure would be illegal inasmuch the aforesaid car is not a “stolen” car.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> In support of his submissions he relied upon two decisions of this court one in the case of Saiduzzaman Vs. Munira Mostafa, 56 DLR(2004) 275 and another decision in the case of Q.H. Belali Vs. Capt. A. Azim Khan, 40 DLR(1988) 295. And accordingly the learned Advocate submits that the judgment and order of the Revisional court is not just and legal and that it is liable to be quashed and hence prayed for making the Rule Absolute.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> Mr. Md. Zakir Hussain Masud learned Advocate for the complainant opposite party No. 2 submits that the judgment and order of the Revisional court is just and proper and there has been no illegality in the order passed by the Sessions Judge, Barguna on 25.06.2015 and therefore the Rule bears no merit and ought to be discharged for ends of justice.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> We have heard the learned Advocates, perused the materials on records including the respective judgment and order passed by the Executive Magistrate, Bagruna dated 02.06.2014 including the judgment and order passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Barguna dated 25.06.2015. In the case before us, it is manifest from the records that the complaint was in limine, directly filed under Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The complainant as is obvious did not initiate his complaint upon any specific provision of the Penal Code which might be pertinent or appropriate to the context of the facts and circumstances leading to filing a case.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> The learned Advocate for the petitioner while placing his arguments inter alia persuaded that in the absence of any substantive allegation either in the form of an F.I.R or any petition of complaint, “isolated” proceeding under Section 98 cannot be brought since the law does not contemplate resorting to such ‘isolated’ proceeding without first initiating a case whatsoever under the appropriate provisions of law. Upon our attempt to weigh the appropriateness or inappropriateness of a case only particularly on the point of the illegality of directly resorting to Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, we have examined the provisions of section 98 which falls under chapter VII part B of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> Now, it is a settled principle of law that in order to construe the actual meaning and intention of a statute it must be read as a whole and not in part or in an isolated manner. Bearing this principle in mind, we have perused the provisions contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure including those under Chapter VII of the Code. A thorough scrutiny of the relevant provisions reveal that the provisions of the criminal law do not contemplate or consider the sustainability or maintainability of an isolated proceeding or case under Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In support of our views, we find it worthwhile to quote from the part of Section 98(1) for our purpose which is produced hereunder. Section 98(1) “If a District Magistrate, [or an Executive Magistrate specially empowered by the Government in this behalf], upon information and after such inquiry as he thinks necessary, has reason to believe that any place is used for the deposit or, sale of stolen property”.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong> We have drawn our notice to the phrase “upon information” and after such inquiry and also the term “reason to believe” which conspicuously leads to the existence of a case or proceeding arising out of which and in pursuance of which the Magistrate, either Executive or Judicial as the case may be empowered to act upon, shall upon  receiving the necessary “information” and pursuant to ‘inquiry’ and only if he has reason to believe that facts and circumstances exist which makes it imperative to act only then he may act in accordance with the procedural provisions of Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong> Accordingly, upon scrutiny into Section 98 and after scanning through the preceding sections under Chapter VII including other provisions of the Code, and after an understanding into the meaning and intention of the statute, we are of the considered view that the law as it exists does not provide any scope to file or initiate a separate case or proceeding in an isolated manner in under Section 98 in the absence of a pending case or proceeding filed in pursuance of an F.I.R or complaint whatsoever under any of the provisions of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong> Section 98 only confers power upon Magistrate, empowered in this behalf to act in a particular manner to act according to the necessity appertaining to the facts and circumstances arising out of a particular case before the concerned Court arising out of an F.I.R or a complaint as the case may be. Hence a Magistrate, either Executive or Judicial as the case may be, to be able to act in accordance with the provisions of Section 98 being empowered in this behalf, can only proceed under the Section in a pending case and not in the absence of a case or proceeding and the existence of a case or proceeding is a sine qua non that is, an essential condition for resorting to the provisions of Section 98 of the Code.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong> Another aspect to which the learned Advocate for the petitioner had accentuated upon, is that Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is applicable in case the goods were ‘stolen’ property, but he emphasises that in the instant case as is apparent from the records there is no allegation of the disputed property, that is the car being ‘stolen’.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong> It is true that Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does conceive of its applicability in situations or circumstances where the property is stolen or documents are forged etc. In context of the petitioner’s submissions we have also looked into the decisions cited by the learned Advocate for the petitioner in the case of Saiduzzaman Vs. Munira Mostafa, 56 DLR(2004) 275 and another decision in the case of Q.H. Belali Vs. Capt. A. Azim Khan, 40 DLR(1988) 295.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong> Upon perusal it appears that these decisions however primarily focused upon the non-applicability of Section 98 in situations where the property in dispute does not involve the allegation of theft, forged documents etc. which may authorise a Magistrate being empowered under the provision of Section 98 to issue a search warrant. It is true that in the case we are dealing with at present, the issue of the property not being ‘stolen’ or ‘forged’ etc. has arisen and the petitioner contended that hence the case does not fall within the mischief of Section 98 of the Code. We do not disagree with the point raised by the learned Advocate for the petitioner given that the property in dispute, that is the car not being a ‘stolen’ property cannot be recovered by resorting to the procedures laid down in Section 98 of the Code. Rather, in the event of a proper case being filed, the appropriate court could have passed an appropriate order in respect of the property under Section 516A of the Code as deemed fit pending conclusion of the inquiry or trial or it could pass an appropriate order under Section 517 of the Code.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong> But however, in the case before us, these are hypothetical issues only, given that no complaint or case was priorly filed under any Section of the Penal Code, therefore in the absence of existence of any case before any court, renders unlawful the entire proceeding arising out of Section 98 and it will be a futile exercise to dwell further on this issue or give our, if any, which views could have been discussed had the situation or circumstance been different and not upon hypothesis.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong> Upon examination of the materials before us, it is also revealed that the Magistrate’s order dated 02.06.2014 was passed upon factual aspects and he determined the ownership of the car as it appeared to him after weighing the facts and evidences. The Revisional Court also reversed the order of the Magistrate relying upon factual aspects only upon facts of evidences. We do not want to dwell upon the legality or appropriateness of the order of the Revisional Court dated 25.06.2014 passed from a factual point of view by the Additional Sessions Judge, Barguna. Our anxiety arise out of the facts that neither of the courts below applied a judicious mind and failed to address or otherwise appreciate the non-maintainability and unlawful standing of an application under Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the absence of a pending case. It somehow escaped the minds of both the courts below, and it did not even occur to them that in absence of a pending case filed under the provisions of the Penal Code, an isolated proceeding under Section 98 is not maintainable and is liable to be dismissed in limine. Moreover, in passing the Order, it escaped their judicious notice that the property in dispute, in this case, the car, not being ‘stolen’ property would not in any case come within the mischief of Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. But rather in an appropriate case, the appropriate court could have after exercising due discretion passed an order, under Section 516A or Section 517 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as the case may be. Drawing our attention to the two decisions cited by the petitioner, we upon perusal of those arrive at our considered finding that the ratio decidendi of both the cases, cited by the petition  mainly revolved around the non-applicability of Section 98 in cases other than ‘stolen’ goods, forged documents, etc. and emphasises that ‘search warrants’ therefore cannot be issued in circumstances except those expressly postulated in Section 98 of the Code which among a few others provide for authority to Magistrate, to issue search warrants.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong> We are of course in agreement with the ratio decidendi of these two decisions but bearing our respect towards the principles expounded in these decisions, however we are of the considered view that neither of the two decisions, in the case of Saiduzzaman Vs. Munira Mostafa, 56 DLR(2004) 275 and another in the case of Q.H. Belali Vs. Capt. A. Azim Khan, 40 DLR(1988) 295 somehow address upon the non-maintainability and lack of legal sustainability of an isolated application under Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to issue an order of search warrant in absence of any pending case filed under any provisions of the Penal Code arising out of an F.I.R or complaint. These two decisions are more or less silent on this particular issue. The 56 DLR decision in para 7 of the judgment however only touched upon the issue of non-maintainability of ‘isolated’ proceedings upon an application under Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure holding it to be ‘without jurisdiction’ of the Metropolitan Magistrate. But apart from this allusion, these decisions do not elaborate upon the aspect of the non-maintainability or unlawfulness of an isolated proceeding under Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. We are of the considered view that an application under Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure not being isolatedly entertainable or lawfully maintainable at all, therefore in this case the application filed under Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the Magistrate Court is not maintainable and is liable to be dismissed not being sustainable in the eye of law.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong> It appears that the entire issue are essentially disputed matters of facts presented in the complaint petition and which ought to be decided upon in pursuance of a pending case or criminal proceedings initiated or filed under the relevant section of the Penal Code before a proper criminal court conferred with the jurisdiction to hear and decide upon the matter or under any other law relevant thereto.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong> Hence, it is our considered opinion that considering the facts and circumstance before us, an appropriate order could only be passed by a proper criminal court, constituted under section 6(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in exercise of the power conferred upon such criminal court under Section 516 A or Section 517 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure as the case may be. Since the facts and circumstances of the case before us, do not fall within the purview of Section 98 of the Code, but appropriate orders under Section 516A or Section 517 whatsoever could only be passed if the same was arising out of a pending case filed under any provisions of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong> As we also opined elsewhere, in the case before us, both the courts below while arriving at their findings based upon matters arising out of the facts only, but did not for once even raise the issue on point of law, that is, in this case, the question of maintainability or legal sustainability of an application to issue search warrant under Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the absence of F.I.R, complaint case or proceeding whatsoever under the provisions of the Penal Code. And as is obvious from the records, the Revisional Court gave its own findings regarding ownership of the car relying upon facts again and reversed the finding of the Magistrate upon factual aspects only, but did not even once try to nor made any attempt to scrutinise the legal standing of such an application. <br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong> At one stage of the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner, an issue regarding the Jurisdiction of an Executive Magistrate not being a proper criminal court and not being empowered conferred with the powers of such court to entertain such an application came up. Well, in an appropriate case we would have been inclined to examine and scrutinise the issue of the Jurisdictional bounds and limits of an Executive Magistrate. But that issue not being the case before us, given that in the present case, the application under Section 98 in absence of substantive allegation in the form of an F.I.R or complaint etc. whatsoever, being unlawful and therefore not maintainable in a isolated manner, at all, even before an appropriate court, hence we are not inclined to mull over or dwell upon the Jurisdictional issue of an Executive Magistrate in this particular case.  <br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong> Be that as it may, upon an overall consideration of the facts and circumstances of the cases and after perusal of the findings of the courts below, and the decisions cited by the petitioner we are inclined to conclude that in this case, irrespective of the fact that the property in dispute, the car, being not a stolen property does not come within the mischief of Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, even precluding this particular aspect, the application under Section 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not maintainable in absence of a pending case, under the provisions of the Penal Code and having no legal standing and ipso facto makes such an application un lawful. Therefore we find merits in the Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong> In the result, the Rule is made absolute. <br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong> The Officer-in-charge (O.C), Barguna Sadar Police Station, Barguna is hereby directed to recover the aforesaid Car being No. Dhaka Metro Cha-13-5455 from the opposite party No.2 and hand over the same to the accused-petitioner within 10(ten) days from the date of receiving of this judgment. <br/> <br/><strong>34.</strong> Communicate this judgment and order at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></span></div></div></div>

The petitioner applied for appearing in the examination wherein admit card no.7465 was issued in her name. On finding her qualified in both the written and the viva voce examinations the respondent no. 4 on 26.04.2009 issued an appointment letter in her favour with a direction to join as an Assistant Teacher in Keshabpur N. S. Government Primary School, Bauphal, Patuakhali. Subsequently the office of the respondent no. 4 issued an amended letter of appointment on 25.05.2009 directing the petitioner to join at Dakkhin Konokdia Government Primary School, Bauphal, Patuakhali as an Assistant Teacher [Annexure-‘C(2)’ to the Writ Petition]. In compliance with the amended letter of appointment the petitioner went to the designated school on 20.05.2009 for joining to the selected post but without assigning any reason her joining was not accepted by the respondents. Thereafter the petitioner came to know that her appointment had been cancelled by the respondent no. 4 and that an office order dated 22.07.2009 was issued to that effect. Challenging the said decision of cancellation of the appointment the petitioner moved this Court invoking the writ jurisdiction. During the pendency of the Rule issued in Writ Petition No. 7090 of 2009 it was conveyed to the petitioner that in the event she withdrew the Writ Petition her case would be considered by the respondents. Accordingly the Rule issued in Writ Petition No. 7090 of 2009 was discharged for non-prosecution at the instance of the petitioner. The petitioner approached the respondents on several occasions to take initiative for her joining and lastly when they failed to do so on 05.05.2015 she served a notice demanding justice requesting the respondents to accept her joining but the same yielded no result. The petitioner eventually moved this Court and obtained the Rule as stated above.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> Mr. Golam Mohiuddin, learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner, submits that although the petitioner was appointed as an Assistant Teacher through a transparent appointment process, her joining was not accepted illegally. The learned Advocate submits further that the impugned order of cancellation of the appointment was issued without giving any notice to the petitioner and providing her any opportunity of being heard which is violative of the principle of natural justice. The learned Advocate lastly submits that the petitioner was not dismissed, removed or suspended from the post of Assistant Teacher of the Government Primary School but her very appointment was cancelled illegally and thus the Writ Petition is maintainable inasmuch as the action of the authorities was malafide which is violative of the fundamental rights of the petitioner.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The Rule is not opposed.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> We have heard the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner and perused the writ petition, the supplementary affidavits including the annexures thereto.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Admittedly the petitioner appeared in the written and viva voce examinations and having been qualified was appointed on 26.04.2009 as an Assistant Teacher at Keshabpur N. S. Government Primary School, Bauphal, Patuakhali. Subsequently her appointment order was amended and she was asked to join at Dakkhin Konokdia Government Primary School, Bauphal, Patuakhali. On the basis of the amended appointment letter dated 20.05.2009 the petitioner wrote a letter to the respondent no. 4, District Primary Education Officer, Patuakhali seeking permission to join the school (Annexure-‘J’ to the Supplementary Affidavit dated 29.11.2015); but the District Primary Education Officer did not accord her permission to join in the school and kept silent till the issuance of the order of cancellation of appointment. After about two months, the petitioner received the impugned letter dated  22.07.2009 and came to know that her appointment had been cancelled on the basis of a decision dated 22.06.2009 taken by the Director (policy and operation) on behalf of the Director General of Primary Education Directorate, Dhaka. The order of cancellation of the appointment of the petitioner was issued on the allegation that the authority had found dissimilarity between the signature of the petitioner made in the application for seeking appointment and the other one in her joining letter dated 20.05.2005 (as contained in Annexures-‘J’ and ‘K’ respectively). In the advertisement for appointment of teachers a condition, among others, has been set out to the effect that the application could not be accepted if it was not written by the concerned candidate. An application for seeking appointment of teacher can be rejected at any time without prior notice even after appointment if it has been filed containing false and fabricated information and papers. In the instant case, no such allegation had been brought against the petitioner to the effect that she had provided false information or submitted false documents at any point of time. There is in fact no dispute that the petitioner was appointed as an Assistant Teacher in a Government Primary School through a competitive examination. It appears from the appointment letter dated 26.04.2009 that the petitioner and other teachers were appointed temporarily for 2 (two) years under certain terms and conditions. Those conditions are reproduced below:</span><br/> </div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:14px">“গণপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলা­দশ সরকার<br/>­জেলা প্রাথমিক শিক্ষা অফিসা­রর কার্যালয়<br/>পটুয়াখালী।<br/><br/><u>নি­য়োগ আ­দেশ</u><br/>স্মারক নংঃ জেপ্রাশিঅ/সশিনি/নি­য়াগ/পটুয়া/৭১২,  তারিখঃ ২৬/০৪/২০০৯ইং</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;

Dag No. 1267 by kabala dated 26.09.69 and after constructing his dwelling house he had been living therein. In order to use and access the pucca road of Battala, Gopalgonj Town, he as well as his predecessor used the pathway on foot which went through the southern side of plot No. 1251 of the defendants which stands on the eastern side of the plot of the plaintiff and then using the Government Halat (i.e. access pathway) situated on plot Nos. 1263, 1256 and 1257. The said pathway was in existence for more than 50 years. The said pathway over the southern side of plot No. 1251 is about 3 to 4 cubits wide and the plaintiff further stated that this pathway has been the only convenient access on foot to the pucca Battala Road from his plot. The defendants with ulterior intention of grabbing the Halot on the plots No. 1263, 1256 and 1257, started raising wall on ½ decimal of land on plot No. 1251 which was situated on the entrance to the aforementioned pathway. Despite repeated objections from the plaintiff, the defendants continued with the construction. Thereafter, the plaintiff applied to the local Chairman on 16.6.1993 and 24.7.1993 to settle the matter, but the Chairman failed to ensure the attendance of the defendants and as such no settlement was reached. Finally, the plaintiff requested the defendants on 20.9.1993 to stop the ongoing construction of the wall on the entrance to the pathway, which they refused, and threatened dire consequences if the plaintiff and his family members did not stop using the pathway. As a result, the access to and from the plaintiff’s plot No. 1267 was blocked from all sides and the dwelling of the plaintiff became uninhabitable. Being aggrieved by the ongoing construction of wall by the defendants, the plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 56 of 1994 seeking declaration of right of way over the disputed plot No. 1251 belonging to the defendants. During trial, the plaintiff moved an application for amendment of the plaint and stated that despite an injunction, the defendants were still continuing with the construction of the wall and had constructed a latrine and prayed to the Court for a direction upon the defendants to demolish the wall, otherwise the plaintiff’s property would be landlocked and for this reason the plaintiff has filed this suit.   <br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The defendants-respondents contested the suit by filing joint written statement contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that plot No. 1268 is situated on the western side of the plaintiff’s plot No. 1267 and the road to Pourashava is situated on the western side of the said plot No. 1268 and if the plaintiff got possession of some land to the north of Plot No. 1268 amicably from the co-sharers, he would have access to the town. The defendants further stated that the plot No. 1251 situated to the east of the plot No. 1267 comprises an area of .06 acre of land and the defendants have been living therein by constructing dwelling hut since the time of their predecessor, and the dispute arose between the plaintiff and the defendants regarding boundary of plots No. 1267 and 1251 and then after necessary survey, the defendants raised wall between the said plots long ago and there was no vacant land in the southern side of plot No. 1251 and there was also no mention of Halot in the C.S. Khatian in respect of .01 acre of land against each of the plot Nos. 1256, 1257 and 1263 and those plots were never used as public Halot. The defendants further stated that an area of 3 cubits width is lying vacant from east to west on the southern part of plot No. 1268, which connected the Pourashava Road, situated at plot No. 1270, and the plaintiff had been using the said vacant land as passage till the filing of the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> After hearing the parties and considering the materials on record the learned Assistant Judge, Gopalgonj, decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiff. <br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Against the said judgement and decree, the defendants filed Title Appeal No. 136 of 1997 before the learned District Judge, Gopalgonj, who after hearing dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgement and decree passed by the trial Court.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Being aggrieved by the said judgement and decree of the appellate Court the defendants filed Civil Revision No. 1563 of 1998 before the High Court Division and obtained Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Upon hearing the parties and considering the materials on record, by the impugned judgment and order, the High Court Division made the Rule absolute. Hence, the plaintiff as petitioner filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 70 of 2002.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> Leave was granted on the following submissions of the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner:</span></div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px">The High Court Division failed to appreciate the provision of section 15 of the Easements Act, 1882 (Act V of 1882) in holding that the suit is barred by limitation. The attention of the Court was drawn to the fact that section 15 of the Easements Act, 1882 and section 26 of the Limitation Act, 1908 are two similar provisions, both of which deal with acquisition of right by easement and both of the said provisions provide that the ‘period of 20 years shall be taken to be a period ending within two years next before the institution of the suit wherein the claim to which such period relates is contested.’ The provision is interpreted to mean that one should bring a suit within 2(two) years of interruption of his enjoyment (distinct from actual user) of easement right.</span></li><li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px">The High Court Division failed to take into consideration section 23 of the Limitation Act, which provides that a fresh period of limitation begins to run at every moment of the time during which the breach or the wrong, as the case may be, continues <em>de die in diem</em>. And it is a settled principle that infringement of right of way is a continuous wrong as it constitutes a continuous nuisance. Therefore, the High Court Division erred in law in holding that the suit was barred by law; and</span></li><li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px">The High Court Division erred in law and on facts by misconstruing the evidence of the plaintiff’s witness (P.W.1) (the petitioner himself) given in the trial Court and holding that the cause of action arose in 1990 and that the plaintiff should have instituted the suit within 2 years. However, the High Court Division failed to notice the fact that the trial Court in its judgement dated 26.8.1997 stated that the plaintiff, by way of amending his plaint, affirmed that the defendants were still continuing with the construction of the wall despite injunction of the Court and had built a pucca latrine. The defendants did not controvert at all, or failed to submit enough evidence to controvert such assertion of the plaintiff and as such the statement of the plaintiff was deemed to have been accepted by the defendants. This fact signifies that the construction of the wall was a continuing action and continued up to year 1994 as well. Moreover, the High Court Division failed to take notice of the fact that the plaintiff continued to request the defendants to stop construction of the wall and that every instance of refusal by the defendants constituted a fresh cause of action. Furthermore, the plaintiff asserted his right of way by way of applying to the local Chairman on 16.6.1993 and 24.7.1993 requesting his intervention to solve the dispute and such action constitutes exercise of enjoyment of the right of way by the plaintiff in the eye of law.  In addition to the above, the plaintiff alleged that finally on 20.9.1993 he requested the defendants to stop construction of the wall on the entrance of his right of way, which signifies that the construction of the wall was still continuing and the plaintiff was still exercising/enjoying his right of way and that the defendants have not adduced sufficient evidence during the trial to controvert such facts. Therefore, with every instance of refusal by the defendants to allow the plaintiff to exercise his right of way amounted to a fresh cause of action under section 23 of the Limitation Act and, therefore, evidently, the suit is not barred by law.” </span></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px"> <br/><strong>9.</strong> Mr. A.B. Siddique, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant made submissions in line with the grounds upon which leave was granted. The learned Advocate further elaborated his submissions by referring section 15 of the Easement Ac and also section 23 of the Limitation Act. He also pointed out that no argument was made or ground taken by the defendants with regard to limitation. Referring to the evidence of D.W. 1, he pointed out that it was admitted in the cross examination of defendant No. 2, who deposed as D.W.1 that when he was constructing the wall, the plaintiff raised objection and also filed an application before the Chairman. He also pointed out that the application dated 16.06.1993 made by the plaintiff before the Chairman was exhibited as evidence and, therefore, there was no question of the suit being barred by limitation.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> Mr. Md. Nawab Ali, learned Advocate-on-Record   who had entered appearance on behalf of the respondent No. 2, was absent when the appeal was taken up for hearing.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocate appearing for the appellant, perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> We find from the judgement of the trial Court that the evidence of the witnesses was elaborately discussed. The learned Judge also observed that the R.S. <em>Porcha </em>exhibit-‘Ka’-‘Ka’(2) showed a <em>Halot </em> comprising 1 decimal of  land of plot Nos. 1256, 1257 and 1263. He also referred to the report of the Advocate Commissioner, which indicated that the disputed land was used by the defendants as a private path till the present day. Upon discussion of the evidence, facts and circumstances the learned trial Judge decreed the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> The appellate Court referring to paragraph 7 of the written statement of the defendants, observed that the plaintiff’s had no way of movement to the road which leads to the town via plot No. 1268. We may note at this juncture that the written statement of the defendants referred by the appellate Court only indicates that a pathway to the road going to the town would only exist if the plaintiff came to an arrangement with co-sharers of plot No. 1268.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> We find from the judgement of the appellate Court that an issue on the point of limitation, maintainability of the suit, and defect of parties was framed by the trial Court, but the defendants did not raise those issues at the time of trial of the case, and at the time of hearing of the appeal also they did not press those issues. We note from the revisional application filed before the High Court Division that there was no ground taken with regard to limitation. Hence, it was not proper on the part of the High Court Division to reverse the concurrent findings of the trial Court and the appellate Court upon finding that the suit was barred under section 15 of the Easement Act.<br/>  </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Section 15 of the Easement Act provides as follows:</strong><br/><strong><em>15.</em></strong><em> Where the access and use of light or air to and for any building have been peaceably enjoyed therewith, as an easement, without interruption, and for twenty years, </em><br/><em>and where support from one person’s land or things affixed thereto has been peaceably received by another person’s land subjected to artificial pressure or by things affixed thereto, as an easement, without interruption, and for twenty years,</em><br/><em>and where a right of way or any other easement has been peaceably and openly enjoyed by any person claiming title thereto, a an easement, and as of right, without interruption, and for twenty years,</em><br/><em>the right to such access and use of light or air, support or other easement shall be absolute. </em><br/><em>Each of the said periods of twenty years shall be taken to be a period ending within two years next before the institution of the suit wherein the claim to which such period relates is contested.  </em></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px"> <br/><strong>15.</strong> The High Court Division took the view that since the suit was not filed within two years from 1990, i.e. when the wall was erected by the defendants, the suit is barred.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> In our view the finding of the High Court Division is quite erroneous. The requirement of the law is that in establishing the right of easement it has to be shown that the right was openly enjoyed as an easement, and as of right, without interruption for 20 years and the period of 20 years shall be taken to be a period ending with the interruption of the enjoyment of the easement right when the cause of action arises and the suit is to be instituted within 2 years from the date when the cause of action arises. <br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> In the facts of the instant case the construction of the wall was commenced in 1990 and continued as late as 1993 when, as admitted by D.W.1 in his cross examination, the plaintiff filed an application before the Chairman having objected to construction of the wall. The application was dated 16.06.1993. We are told about another application on 24.04.1994. So, in view of facts referred above, we do not find that the suit was in any way barred by limitation. On the other hand, the R.S. <em>Porchas</em> exhibited in the case clearly show that there is a recorded pathway across plot Nos. 1256, 1257 and 1263. In such view of the matter, the trial Court and the lower appellate Court have rightly found that the plaintiff proved a case of easement right and the suit was correctly decreed. Clearly the impugned judgement is erroneous both in facts and on law.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong> In the light of the discussion above, the appeal is allowed, however, without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong> The impugned judgement passed by the High Court Division is hereby set aside. <br/> <br/><strong>End.</strong></span></div></div></div>

Chand Mia (hereinafter referred to as ‘the vendee’) entered into an agreement with the SA recorded owners Ms. Radha Rani Basak and Ms. Nanda Rani Basak (hereinafter referred to as ‘the vendors’) for purchasing a parcel of land of 0.0508 ajutangsha under the SA Khatian no. 209, SA Plot nos. 792 &amp; 793 (currently, City Survey Khatian no. 2030 and City Survey Plot nos. 6985 &amp; 6986) at a price of Tk. 9,125/- upon making an advance payment of Tk. 8,551/- on 15.08.1963. Thereafter, the vendee repeatedly requested the vendors to execute registration of the said agreement but the latter avoided their performance on different excuses. The vendee then filed Case no. 6526 of 1967 under Section 6(2) of The Disturbed Persons (Rehabilitation) Ordinance, 1964 before the Board of Revenue of the erstwhile East Pakistan impleading the vendors as the defendants seeking permission for filing a suit for specific performance of contract against the vendors and the same was allowed by the said concerned authority. Upon obtaining such permission the vendee filed Title Suit no. 290 of 1969 in the Court of learned Subordinate Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Dhaka praying for specific performance of contract impleading the vendors and the deputy custodian as the defendants. In the said suit the vendors did not contest, only the Assistant Custodian of Enemy Property contested the suit by filing a written statement and the said suit was decreed in favour of the vendee on 30.08.1971, against which the Government never preferred any appeal. Following obtaining the said decree the vendee filed Execution Case no. 20 of 1971 before the Executing Court which ordered for execution of the deed of sale on 25.10.1971 and, then, the vendee got the property in question registered on 27.10.1971 and, thereafter, he mutated his name in respect of the property in question and had been possessing the same by paying rents and all types of bills, rates and taxes, including WASA, Gas, electricity and Municipal Corporation Taxes.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> Eventually, the said vendee (the petitioner’s husband) sold out half portion of the suit property to the petitioner by executing a registered deed of sale being no. 30373 of 1973 dated 18.12.1973. The petitioner’s husband thereafter applied to the RAJUK seeking permission for construction of a three-storied building which was approved by the RAJUK on 26.02.1968 and the petitioner and her husband jointly constructed a two-storied building thereon and since then they have been possessing the property through the tenants.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> It is stated that during operation of the revisional survey, the name of the petitioner’s husband was duly enlisted and published under the Khatian no. 1712 wherein the SA Plot no. 793 has been converted and shown as the RS Plot nos. 1253 &amp; 1254 with an area of 0.0080 &amp; 0.0428 respectively, in total 0.0508. Thereafter, during operation of the City Survey the names of the petitioner and her son were duly prepared and published in the Khatian no. 2030 wherein the RS Plot nos. 1253 and 1254 have been renamed as the City Survey Plot nos. 6985 and 6986 respectively. It is claimed that the petitioner and her family members have been possessing the case property since 15.08.1963 and the same has never been enlisted as an Enemy Property until initiation of E.P. Case no. 5 of 1978 and, then, inclusion of the same under the “Ka” and “Kha” lists of the vested property through publication of the Gazette Notifications dated 06.05.2012 and 30.09.2012 under the অর্পিত সম্পওি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ at serial nos. 957 and 103 respectively.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Being aggrieved with the said inclusion in the vested property list, the petitioner approached this Court and obtained the instant Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Respondent nos. 1 to 5 contested the Rule by filing an affidavit-in-opposition contending, <em>inter-alia,</em> that the case property, along with some other properties, were actually owned by some Hindu persons who left the then East Pakistan for India for good during the communal disturbance of 1947 and, thereafter, in 1965 the property in question was declared as enemy property under the Defence of Pakistan Rules, 1965. The Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) as the Assistant Custodian of the enemy property took the management of the case property vide E.P. Case no. 5 of 1978  against which the petitioner filed Title Suit No. 215 of 1978 in the 6<sup>th</sup> Court of Assistant Judge, Dhaka and achieved nothing. It is alleged that the papers and documents annexed to the writ petition and subsequent affidavits are forged and fabricated and, even, if for argument’s sake, the decree passed in Title Suit No. 290 of 1969 on 30.08.1971 is believed to be a genuine one, the same is to be taken as an <em>exparte</em> decree. <br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Mr. Md. Haroon Ar Rashid, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner, takes us through the supporting papers and documents of the petitioner as to her title and possession over the case property, which include deed of sale, records of right and payment of the bills, rates etc annexed to the writ petition as well as to the subsequent supplementary-affidavits to the writ petition, and submits that it is clearly evident from these appendixes and enclosures that the petitioner is the legal owner and possessor of the case property and, therefore, inclusion of the case property in the “Ka” and “Kha” lists under the অর্পিত সম্পওি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ is an arbitrary and colourful action of the respondents under the cover of the provisions of the said special law. In an endeavour to elaborate the preceding point of argument, he next submits that in view of the fact the predecessors-in-interest of the petitioner’s husband had been possessing and enjoying the case property uninterruptedly from time immemorial and, then, the petitioner’s husband had been possessing and enjoying it since 15.08.1963, when Ms. Radha Rani Basak and Nanda Rani Basak had entered into an agreement for selling the case land to the petitioner’s husband and, lastly, the petitioner &amp; her children have been possessing the suit land since 18.12.1973 when the petitioner’s husband transferred the suit land in the petitioner’s name and, furthermore, in the light of the fact that previously the petitioner’s husband had and, currently, the petitioner and her son have mutated their names with regard to the case property and have been paying the rents and different bills etc without ever been evicted by the respondents, therefore, inclusion of the case property in the “Ka” and “Kha” lists under the অর্পিত সম্পওি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ was completely illegal.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> He, then, places annexure I, which is the judgment and decree dated 30.08.1971 passed by the Subordinate Judge, Ist Court, Dhaka in Title Suit no. 290 of 1969, and submits that the suit was decreed on contest in the light of the fact that the Assistant Custodian had filed a written statement in the said suit and, thus, there is no scope to treat the said decree as an <em>exparte</em> decree under the provisions of Article 3 of the Bangladesh (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1972 (hereinafter referred to as the PO 12). He, as an addition to this count of his submissions, canvasses that the respondents have never preferred any appeal against the said judgment and decree passed on 30.08.1971 in Title Suit no. 290 of 1969 nor have they taken any action against the execution of the decree under the provisions of article 8 of the Bangladesh Transfer of Immovable Property (Temporary Provisions) Order, 1972 (hereinafter referred to as PO 142) and, thus, he argues that by not questioning the said judgment and decree dated 30.08.1971 or its subsequent execution and, also, by not enlisting the case property in the list of the enemy property during operation of the Defence of Pakistan Ordinance, 1965, the respondents are estopped from claiming the case property to be a vested property. The learned Advocate for the petitioner further submits that the inclusion of the case property in the list of the enemy property in the year 1978 and, on the basis of that, initiation of Enemy Property Case no. 5 of 1978 was completely illegal inasmuch as the Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provisions) Ordinance, 1969 (Ordinance No. 1 of 1969) was repealed on 23.03.1974.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> With regard to the maintainability of the present writ petition Mr. Haroon Ar Rashid, the learned Advocate for the petitioner, forcefully submits that since the petitioner is agitating the allegation of violation of her fundamental right, namely right to property under Article 42 of the Constitution, the present writ petition is maintainable inasmuch as for invoking writ jurisdiction under Article 102(1) of the Constitution the petitioner does not require to show the availability of the alternative efficacious forum. The learned Advocate for the petitioner in support of his submissions refers to a series of decisions, which include the case of (i) Md. Abdus Sukkur Vs Chairman, National Board of Revenue and others 17 BLD (AD) 43, (ii) Priyatosh Talukdar Vs Assistant Custodian, Vested and Non-Resident Property, Chittagong and others 39 DLR (AD) 178, (iii) Government of Bangladesh and another Vs Syed Chand Sultana and other 51 DLR (AD) 24, (iv) Begum Lutfunnessa Vs The People’s Republic of Bangladesh and others 42 DLR (AD) 86, (v) Sunil Kumar Ghosh and others Vs Bangladesh 7 BLD 131, (vi) Sreemati Parul Kusum Roy Vs Bangladesh and others 1988 BLD 6. (vii) People’s Republic of Bangladesh Vs Chairman, Court of Settlement and others 49 DLR 560, (viii) Akbar Hossain Khan (Md) and another Vs Md Awlad Hossain Khan and another 49 DLR 561, (ix) Nurunnahar Begum and others Vs Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and another 49 DLR 433 and (x) Lutfur Rahman (Md) Vs Ministry of Law and Parliamentary Affairs and another 49 DLR 432.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> By making the above submissions the learned Advocate for the petitioner prays for making the Rule absolute. <br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> Ms. Nasrin Parveen, the learned Assistant Attorney General appearing on behalf of the respondents, at the very outset takes us through the annexures appended to the writ petition as well as to the subsequent affidavits filed by the petitioner and submits that there are plausible reasons for arousing suspicions as to the genuineness of those papers.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> She questions about the authenticity of the papers and documents filed by the petitioner before this Court by pinpointing to the discrepancies and ambiguities apparent on their face and, for example, she seeks to draw our attention to some documents of Pakistan regime such as plaint of the Title Suit no. 290 of 1969, judgment and decree passed by the learned Sub-Judge which contains the word “Dhaka”, though at the relevant point of time its spelling was “Dacca”. To substantiate her suspicion about the genuineness of the petitioner’s claim she then points out to another fact that the petitioner has produced only the papers which are apparently favourable to her and abstained from submitting some vital documents such as the plaint plus the written statement of the Title Suit no. 215 of 1978 wherefrom somewhat detailed information could have been gathered with regard to the title and possession of the case property.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> She, then, refers to the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit no. 290 of 1969 and submits that the judgment and decree is an exparte decree inasmuch as the Deputy Commissioner was made the defendant in the said suit as the Custodian of the property, but he could not contest the suit as at the relevant point of time the country was under the state of war. She submits that the written statement filed by the Assistant Custodian should not be taken to have been filed by the party to the said suit and, accordingly, she argues that the said judgment and decree is not a decree in the eye of law inasmuch as article 3 of the P.O. 12 provides that an <em>exparte </em>decree passed from Ist March, 1971 to 1<sup>st</sup> March, 1972, both exclusive, shall be deemed to be null and void. She, thus, argues that since the said decree is a nullity, the respondents or any other party have no legal obligation to challenge the same either in any original forum or appellate forum.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> She further submits that non-enlistment of the case land in the enemy property list before creation of Bangladesh does not debar the Government of Bangladesh to enlist the property in the enemy property list inasmuch as since introduction of the provisions regulating the enemy property on 06.09.1965 through the Defence of Pakistan Ordinance, 1965, the same remains in continuous operation by dint of the saving clauses of the subsequent statutes regulating the matters relating to the enemy property and, subsequently, vested property.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> Then, she submits that the petitioner ought to have approached the competent forum namely, the tribunal constituted under provisions of অর্পিত সম্পওি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ given that adjudication of her case involves taking oral evidence to either establish or controvert the genuineness of the papers submitted by her. To further explain her argument on the maintainability issue of this writ petition, she submits that had these papers and documents been produced before the said forum, there would have been a proper and effective adjudication of the present case and vehemently submits that the writ petition is liable to be discharged outright only on the ground of maintainability as the Legislature has created a special forum for adjudication upon the disputes with regard to the vested property and the petitioner instead of availing the said forum invoked Article 102 of the Constitution knowing fully well that the writ petition is not maintainable.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> She contends that the petitioner has not approached this Court <em>bonafide </em>given the fact that she sought to avail the forum under Article 102 of the Constitution when a special forum was available to her. She terms the petitioner’s move before this Court to be an attempt to frustrate the provisions of a special law and to obtain a favourable order from this Court by resorting to the means of suppression of the real facts. She argues that the forum under Article 102 of the Constitution is not available to a petitioner who does not come with clean hands. In support of her submissions, she refers to and relies on the case of Concord Progati Constructions Ltd. Vs BPDB 66 DLR 475.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> By making the above submissions, the learned Assistant Attorney General prays for discharging the Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong> In adjudication of this case, we have given a patient hearing to the submissions advanced by the learned Advocate for the petitioner and the learned Assistant Attorney General, minutely perused the writ petition, supplementary-affidavits, affidavit-in-opposition, together with their annexures, and also attentively read through the relevant provisions of law and the case decisions placed before us and, then, those have been considered by us very carefully.  <br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong> Since the question of maintainability has been raised by the respondents, at first the said issue requires to be taken up for examination by us before embarking upon the factual aspect as well as the other legal issues involved in this case. <br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong> In order to properly deal with the maintainability issue, it would be profitable for us to look at the provisions of Article 102(1) of the Constitution in the backdrop of the plea taken by the petitioner that since her fundamental right has been violated, she is competent to directly invoke the jurisdiction of Article 102(1) of the Constitution without going to the other forum. The said Article runs as follows:-<br/> <br/><em>102. (1) The High Court Division on the application of any person aggrieved, may give such directions or orders to any person or authority, including any person performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic, as may be appropriate  for the enforcement  of any of the  fundamental rights conferred by Part III of this Constitution. </em><br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong> Our plain and simple understanding on the provisions of this Article is that if an aggrieved person comes out with an allegation of playing foul with her/his fundamental rights by any one, this Court is the only forum to provide appropriate remedy to the said aggrieved person by issuing necessary direction or order upon any person or authority, be that private or public.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong> It follows that we have to first carry out an examination of the facts of this case to see whether there has been any infringement of any fundamental rights guaranteed under part III of the Constitution. It is contended by the petitioner that by inclusion of her property in the list of the vested property, Article 42 of the Constitution has been violated. Let us, thus, look at the provisions of Article 42 of the Constitution, which runs as follows:<br/> <br/><em>Article 42 (1) Subject to any restrictions imposed by law, every citizen shall have the right to acquire, hold, transfer or otherwise dispose of property, and no property shall be compulsorily acquired, nationalized or requisitioned save by authority of law.</em><br/><em>(2) A law made under clause (1) of this article shall provide for the acquisition, nationalization or requisition with compensation and shall fix the amount of compensation or specify the principles on which, and the manner in which, the compensation is to be assessed and paid; but no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that any provision of the law in respect of such compensation is not adequate.   </em><br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong> From a plain reading of the provisions of the aforesaid Article it appears that it is a qualified right inasmuch as the very wordings “subject to any restrictions imposed by law” speak itself that it is not an absolute right like the other fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 26 to 29 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong> Since the অর্পিত সম্পওি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ has been enacted by the Legislature for declaring the ownership of certain type of property to have been vested in the Government in continuation of the operation of the provisions of the Defence of Pakistan Ordinance, 1965, then, Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provisions) Ordinance, 1969, then, the Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provisions) (Repeal) Act, 1974 and Vested and Non-resident Property (Administration) Act, 1974, therefore, every citizen will qualify to enjoy the right to acquire or hold the property only within the boundaries of this statute. On a careful reading of the entire অর্পিত সম্পওি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ it transpires to us that the citizen shall be competent to own, possess, hold and enjoy any property only subject to the limitations and restrictions imposed by the provisions of the said law. Moreover, in the backdrop of providing a safeguard provision in the said অর্পিত সম্পওি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ for challenging the enlistment of any person’s property in a forum specially created for the affected persons only, the petitioner’s right under Article 42 has not in any way been violated. Accordingly, it is our view that the petitioner was not competent to invoke the forum under Article 102(1) of the Constitution directly. <br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong> The learned Advocate for the petitioner, in an effort to bring this case within the purview of Article 42 of the Constitution, has referred to 3 (three) Appellate Division cases and 6 (six) High Court Division cases.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong> We would take up all these cases one by one so as to see whether the facts of those cases are similar to the facts of the present case warranting application of the <em>ratio</em> laid down in those cases. In other words, what factors urged and persuaded the Apex Court to consider the facts of the said cases to be the actions taken by the state functionaries in violation of Article 42 of the Constitution and, thereby, allowed the petitioners of those cases to invoke Article 102(1) of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong> In the case of the Priyatosh Talukdar Vs Assistant Custodian, Vested and Non-Resident Property, Chittagong and others 39 DLR (AD) 178,  the plaintiff-appellant filed Mortgage Suit no. 43 of 1964 in the First Court of Subordinate Judge, Chittagong, against the heirs of one Umesh Chandra Chowdhury and got an ex-parte decree on 29 August 1966. The decree-holder, appellant, then started Execution Case no. 4 of 1967 but respondent no. 1, Assistant Custodian of enemy Property, (subsequently designated as vested property), filed an objection under section 47 of the CPC taking the ground that the suit land being an enemy property is exempt from attachment or sale in execution of any Court decree as specifically provided in article 8 of the East Pakistan Enemy Property (Lands and Buildings) Administration and Disposal Order, 1966. This objection was accepted and the Execution Case was dismissed by the trial Court by its order dated 28 January 1970. But the decree-holder challenged this order by an appeal (F.M.A. no. 28 of 1970) whereupon a Division Bench of the High Court Division at Chittagong, by judgment and order dated 4 March 1984, maintained this order with the modification that the execution proceeding shall remain stayed as long as the suit property remains a vested property. Leave was granted by the Apex Court to the decree-holder to examine the validity of the said order. It is clearly apparent from the fact of this case that neither the petitioner of the said case had invoked Article 102(1) of the Constitution, nor is there any observation by the Apex Court with regard to invocation of Article 102(1) and Article 42 of the Constitution. As evidently the said decision has no applicability or relevance in the present case, it is beyond our comprehension why this decision has been cited in this case by the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong> In the case of Bangladesh Vs Syed Chand Sultana and other 51DLR (AD) 24, a property owned by Advocate Mozffar Hossain of this Court, who died in 1989, was listed as an abandoned property. In the said case there was no allegation against the petitioner that he had left for India before 1970 or went to Pakistan during the war time in 1971 or thereafter. It was an admitted position in the said case that the petitioner of the said case hails from Jessore and upon being allotted a plot by the RAJUK, he had been living therein and, thus, the High Court Division found the inclusion of the property in the list of the abandoned property to be <em>exfacie</em> illegal. Moreover, there was not a single disputed question of fact, which required taking evidence and cross examination. The scenario of the present case is completely different from that of the cited case, for, firstly, it is an absurd suggestion to draw a conclusion on the ownership, title and possession of the property of this case in the backdrop of the claim of the petitioner’s husband that in the year 1963 he had made a bainapatra with a Hindu family who never appeared before any Court or Government authority and, secondly, there are allegations of fabrication of papers which require taking deposition and cross examination of the concerned witnesses. Thus, the <em>ratio</em> of the cited case is not applicable in the present case. <br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong> In the case of Begum Lutfunnessa Vs the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and others 42 DLR (AD) 86 when the writ petition was filed on 19.08.1986 challenging the inclusion of the petitioner’s property in the abandoned property list, no Court of Settlement was constituted. Furthermore, from paragraph 10 of the cited case, it appears that the Apex Court found the ex-facie illegality in the actions taken by the Government. Also, the distinctive feature of the said case from the present case is that while there was no need of examining any witness in the cited case, the fact of the present case commands that for a proper resolution of the allegations of fabrication of the papers, on the basis of which the petitioners seek to claim their title, the relevant witness should be called up for giving deposition and cross-examination.   <br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong> In all the three cases, the actions of the Government were so arbitrary that on the face of the annexed papers the Courts were in a position to understand and spot the illegality and, accordingly, unhesitatingly termed the impugned action to be <em>ex-facie</em> illegal and <em>malafide</em>, and given the aforesaid background of those cases the Apex Court, when found that the authority did not have any jurisdiction to take the impugned actions, the Courts rightly termed the actions to be without jurisdiction. Upon skimming through the 6 (six) decisions of the High Court Division, we find that in those cases the Court found the actions of the Government to be ex-facie illegal or <em>malafide</em> or the impugned action having been taken by an incompetent authority, the Court termed it as ‘<em>coram non-judice</em>’ or the authority sought to apply the provisions of law maliciously and the Courts considered the action as ‘<em>malice-in-law</em>’. Thus, it appears that the facts and scenario of the above-cited 6 (six) High Court cases were completely different from the facts of the present case.<br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong> From the discussions made hereinbefore it appears that the present writ petition’s facts and circumstances do not attract the provisions of Article 42 of the Constitution.   <br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong> Now, let us see whether the petitioner is competent to invoke Article 102(2)(a)(ii) of the Constitution for a certification (<em>Certiorari</em>) by this Court to the effect that enlistment of the petitioner’s property as a vested property has not been done in accordance with law or whether this is a fit case seeking a direction upon the respondents under Article 102(2)(a)(i) of the Constitution (<em>mandamus</em>) to release the petitioner’s property from the list of the vested property. We would, thus, look at the said provisions of Article 102(2) (a)(i) &amp; (ii), which are reproduced below: <br/> <br/>Article 102(2): The High Court Division may, <u>if satisfied that no other equally efficacious remedy is provided by law- </u></span></div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px">on the application of any person aggrieved, make an order-</span><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li><span style="font-size:14px">directing a person performing any functions in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of a local authority to refrain from doing that which he is not permitted by law to do or to do that which he is required by law to do; or</span></li><li><span style="font-size:14px">declaring that any act done or proceeding taken by a person performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of a local authority has been done or taken without lawful authority and is of no legal effect; (underlined by us)</span></li><li><span style="font-size:14px">It appears from a careful reading of the above provisions that this Court would be in a position to exercise its power and jurisdiction under article 102(2) of the Constitution if no equally efficacious forum for getting any remedy is available.<span style="font-size:14px"> </span></span></li></ol></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>33.</strong> Apparently, in the case at hand, the petitioner challenges the respondents’ actions in enlistment of the petitioner’s property as a vested property by publications of two gazette notifications under the mandate of অর্পিত সম্পওি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১. The said অর্পিত সম্পত্তি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ has also made provisions for seeking redress for an aggrieved person by way of challenging the enlistment of any property as vested property. From the reading of the entire provisions of the said অর্পিত সম্পত্তি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ it appears to us that the Legislature has created a special tribunal namely, অর্পিত সম্পত্তি প্রত্যর্পণ ট্রাইবুনাল for adjudication of the claims on vested properties empowering it not only to declare a property to be not a vested property, but also to restore the possession of the property to the title holder. Moreover, given that there is a mandatory time limit for adjudication of the matters by the said tribunal in the said অর্পিত সম্পত্তি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ as well as there is a provision for preferring appeal against the judgment and decree of the tribunal, we find that the forum is a better forum than the ordinary fora.<br/> <br/><strong>34.</strong> With all the above features of the অর্পিত সম্পত্তি প্রত্যর্পণ ট্রাইবুনাল, we have no other option but to hold that the said tribunal being a forum equipped with necessary powers to remedy the grievance of the petitioner, she ought to have approached the tribunal. Upon elaborately discussing and categorically examining all the case laws of our Apex Court on this issue, latterly a Division Bench of this Court has sought to revisit the said point in the case of Concord Pragati Construction Ltd Vs BPDP 66 DLR 475 wherein it was held that availability of an alternative forum with the competency of providing the same remedy debars this Court to entertain a writ petition under Article 102(2) of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong> It follows that the present writ petition is not apposite to be fitted into the purview of Article 102 of the Constitution and liable to be discharged on the maintainability ground.<br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong> It is, however, the plea of the petitioner that when the Gazette notifications were published, at that relevant point of time, there was no tribunal in operation and, thus, the petitioner had to resort to Article 102(2) of the Constitution. It is, therefore, necessary to look at the date of publications of the impugned notifications, the date of setting up the tribunals under the mandate of অর্পিত সম্পওি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ and the date of filing the present writ petition. From the scrutiny of the annexed papers it transpires that annexure-H is the ‘Ka’ schedule of the vested properties published under the Gazette Notification dated 06.05.2012 and has been impugned herein, for, at its page 41589 under serial no. 957, a homestead of .0508 acres under the SA khatian no. 209 &amp; Plot nos. 792 &amp; 793 with the name of Ms. Radha Rani Basak has been included in the said ‘Ka’ list, which the petitioner claims to be the owner of it, and annexure-H1 is the ‘Kha’ schedule of certain vested properties which has been published in the Gazette notification on 30.09.2012 where the petitioner’s homestead of 0.0428 acres under the SA khatian no. 2030 &amp; plot no. 6986 is listed therein and the petitioner has challenged the said enlistment.<br/> <br/><strong>37.</strong> From annexure-L, which is a Gazette notification dated 06.03.2012, it transpires that the Government has set up one tribunal for each of the district of the country and the District Judges of each of the districts have been appointed as the Judges of the tribunals. From annexure-M, which is the Gazette notification dated 18.07.2012, it transpires that the Additional District Judges, in addition to the District Judges of all the districts, have been appointed as the judges of the tribunals under অর্পিত সম্পত্তি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ upon cancelling the annexure-L. From annexure-N, which is the Gazette Notification dated 10.07.2013, it appears that the first Joint District Judges of all the districts have been appointed as the judges of the first tribunal for each of the districts and the other Joint District Judges of the every districts of the country have been appointed as the Judges of the additional tribunals of a district by cancelling annexure-M.<br/> <br/><strong>38.</strong> Evidently annexure-H, which is the ‘Ka’ schedule, was published on 06.05.2012 and under the original provisions of Section 10 of the অর্পিত সম্পত্তি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ the petitioner could have filed an application before the tribunal within 90 days i.e. within 06.08.2012. However, before the expiry of the said ninety days, by Act no. xxii of 2012 on 21.06.2012 the time was extended for further 120 days from 09.06.2012 and, thereafter, by several amendments the said time limit was extended from time to time before the expiry of the stipulated period of filing an application in the tribunal and, finally, it was extended till 31.12.2013. Thus, it is evident that the petitioner had ample opportunity to approach the tribunal before filing this writ petition on 19.11.2012. If, for the sake of argument, it is conceded that the initial time limit of ninety days was not noticed by the petitioner, nevertheless, the subsequent extension of time at first 120 days, then, of 300 days and thereafter upto 31.12.2013 could have been availed of by the petitioner. <br/> <br/><strong>39.</strong> At the fag end of the hearing of this case, the learned Advocate for the petitioner very humbly submitted that the petitioner was not aware of publication of the first Gazette Notification on 06.05.2012 and only when she came to know about enlistment of her property in the “Kha” listed vested property from the Gazette Notification dated 30.09.2012, she approached him (the learned Advocate before us, Mr. Haroon Ar Rashid), but he was under an impression that since the time limit of 90 (ninety) days have already expired, there was no scope for the petitioner to approach the tribunal. Mr. Rashid, in the facts and circums-tances, made an humble and earnest prayer to this Court not to reject this writ petition on the ground of maintainability given that at the time of filing this writ petition he sincerely was of the opinion that there was no forum available for the petitioner.<br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong> In order to deal with the above submissions, we are required to investigate into the veracity of the claim as to whether the learned Advocate committed a <em>bonafide</em> mistake in computation of the limitation period. Secondly whether the learned Advocate was professionally competent in dealing with the petitioner’s case in the backdrop of the fact that even after filing the present writ petition, he had more than 1 (one) year time in his hand to seek redress in the tribunal. Finally, if the above two factors are held in favour of the learned Advocate, in that event, whether the petitioner is entitled to get protection under the provisions of the Limitations Act, 1908, in particular the provisions of Section 14 read with Section 29 of the Limitation Act, 1908.<br/> <br/><strong>41.</strong> Apparently, for the petitioner there was no reason to be in a hurry for approaching this Court as no step was taken by the Government to evict her. In view of the admitted fact that the time-limit for filing an application in the tribunal was extended from time to time, initially from 90 (ninety) days to further 120 days, then for further 300 (three hundred) days and lastly the time to file application in the tribunal was extended to 31.12.2013, the learned Advocate ought to have consulted with other experienced lawyers on the matter, for, lawyers may be considered to be the cognoscenti of the legal field only when they render proper advice to their clients by finding out the relevant provisions of law upon putting their best efforts, not by holding an attitude of all-knowing persons or claiming themselves that since they are Advocates, they are acquainted with the provisions of all the laws and readily capable of advising clients without looking at the texts of the laws.<br/> <br/><strong>42.</strong> In this case, Mr. Haroon Ar Rashid’s plea of unawareness about extension of time appears to us to be a <em>bonafide</em> mistake albeit he should have searched for the detailed provisions relating to the time-limitation for filing applications before the tribunal, which he did at the time of the hearing of this case in this Court. The factors that lead us to be lenient in treating his conduct to be <em>bonafide</em> are that, firstly, this Rule was fixed for hearing at his instance and subsequently it was upgraded on his prayer. Had he intended to drag on this matter, he would not have been eager to get this Rule disposed of and, secondly, the way he conceded that he was under an impression that the time had already expired, his demeanour before this Court does not command us to hold a contrary view.<br/> <br/><strong>43.</strong> The answer to the second point, that the petitioner’s Advocate could have filed an application in the tribunal upon withdrawing this writ petition any time before the expiry of 31.12.2013 in order to avail the adjudication of this case from the tribunal, is same to the first point given that it is Mr. Haroon Ar Rashid who being an Advocate of the High Court miserably failed to advise his client properly. The learned Advocate had ample opportunity to be familiar with the relevant provisions of limitations either by perusing the said provisions or by sharing the matter with the Senior Advocates.<br/> <br/><strong>44.</strong> While a lawyer’s motto should be to achieve targeted result from a competent forum for his/her client, the lawyers must not seek to win a case by circumventing the due procedure laid down in a statute. This sort of tendency of a lawyer may be observed by the Court not only as a professional incompetency, but it may be taken as a malpractice. Making clients happy by any means, even by adopting an improper route, is not befitting with the cannons of the legal profession. In the case of AKM Azaduzzaman Vs Public Service Commission 4 ALR 2014 (2) 278, a Division Bench of this Court, when found that the petitioner was wrongly advised to invoke the writ petition, the Court indicated at discharging the Rule with an expectation that the learned Advocate would non-prosecute the Rule and, thereby, help the Court to save its valuable time. When the learned Advocate opted to have a full judgment, the Court did not have any option but to deliver a detailed judgment. In the said circumstances the Court lambasted the learned Advocate for insisting upon the Court to deliver the full judgment instead of non-prosecuting or withdrawing the writ petition.<br/> <br/><strong>45.</strong> In the case of Bandar Nagari Bahumkhi Samabay Samity Ltd Vs Bangladesh 5 ALR 2015(1) 194 this Court imposed a fine of Taka 5,000/- to be paid from the pocket of the learned Advocate for the petitioner when the Court found the conduct of the learned Advocate to be unbefitting with the norms of the legal profession.<br/> <br/><strong>46.</strong> In this case since it is very much apparent that due to the learned Advocate’s professional immaturity and incompetency the petitioner’s case is before us, it would not be improper to impose a fine upon the learned Advocate of the petitioner. However, given the fact that it was a <em>bonafide</em> mistake on part of the learned Advocate Mr. Haroor Ar Rashid, we are taking a lenient view for this time and, thus, not slapping any cost upon him. Nonetheless, we feel it pertinent to record a note of caution that the repetition of this kind of mistake in future by Mr Harron Ar Rashid shall be taken seriously by this Court towards slapping an exemplary fine.  <br/> <br/><strong>47.</strong> We may now take up the third point for our examination. In other words, the issues on the Limitation Act, 1908 to be examined with an aim to see whether the petitioner would be eligible to approach the tribunal after discharging the instant Rule on the maintainability ground.<br/> <br/><strong>48.</strong> For the purpose of effective adjudication on this point, we went through the entire provisions of the Limitation Act, 1908. From a minute perusal of the provisions of Section 3 together with Sections 14 &amp; 29, we find that the petitioner might have an opportunity to seek redress from the tribunal. For a better understanding on the relevant part of the said provisions namely Section 3 of the Limitation Act, it may be reproduced hereunder:<br/> </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Dismissal of suits, etc. instituted after period of limitation:</strong> <u>Subject to the provisions contained in sections 4 to 25</u> (inclusive), every suit instituted, appeal preferred, and application made, after the period of limitation prescribed thereof by the first schedule shall be dismissed, although limitation has not been set up as a defence. (underlined by us) </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px"> <br/><strong>49.</strong> It appears from the aforesaid provisions that if a suit, application, appeal, revision, review is filed before any Court or tribunal beyond the time-limitation prescribed in the first schedule of the Limitation Act, 1908 the same shall be dismissed subject to the provisions contained in Sections 4 to 25 of the said Limitation Act, 1908. <br/> <br/><strong>50.</strong>  From the minute reading of the provisions of Sections 4-25, Section 14 appears relevant for the purpose of adjudication of this case, which is reproduced below:<br/> </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>14. Exclusion of time of proceeding </strong><strong>bonafide in Court without jurisdiction:</strong> In computing the period of limitation prescribed for any suit, the time during which the plaintiff has been prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in a Court of first instance or in a Court of appeal, against the defendant, shall be excluded, where the proceeding is founded upon the same cause of action and is prosecuted in good faith in a Court which, from defect of jurisdiction, or other cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain it. <br/>(2) In computing the period of limitation prescribed for any application, the time during which the applicant has been prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in a Court of first instance or in a Court of appeal, against the same party for the same relief shall be excluded, where such proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in a Court which, from defect of jurisdiction, or other cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain it.<br/><strong>Explanation I.-</strong> In excluding the time during which a former suit or application was pending, the day on which that suit or application was instituted or made, and the day on which the proceedings therein ended, shall both be counted.<br/><strong>Explanation II.-</strong> For the purposes of this section, a plaintiff or an applicant resisting an appeal shall be deemed to be prosecuting a proceeding.<br/><strong>Explanation III.-</strong> For the purpose of this section misjoinder of parties or of causes of section shall be deemed to be a cause of a like nature  with defect of jurisdiction.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px"> <br/><strong>51.</strong> A plain reading of Section 14 of the Limitation Act gives us an understanding that if in good faith a litigant files any suit, application, appeal, revision and review and, subsequently, if it surfaces that approaching of the said forum was done under a mistaken view, the said time period may be excluded from the computation of the time period stipulated in the first schedule of the Limitation Act, 1908. <br/> <br/><strong>52.</strong> Now the question comes up for consideration that whether the time period prescribed in a special statute, such as <strong>Awc©Z m¤úwË cÖZ¨c©Y AvBb, 2001</strong>, can be linked up with the provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1908. The learned Advocate for the petitioner, in a desperate attempt to bring this case within the ambit of Article 102(2) of the Constitution, had referred to the case of Md. Sukkur Vs Chairman, National Board of Revenue and others 17 BLD (AD) 43 by submitting that when special law prescribes a time limit, Section 14 is incapable of rescuing a petitioner. The above submission was advanced aiming at convincing us that since the petitioner is by now time barred to approach the tribunal, she has no forum available to save her property.<br/> <br/><strong>53.</strong> In the said case of Md. Abdus Sukkur Vs Chairman, National Board of Revenue and others 17 BLD (AD) 43, the petitioner, as a Government servant, had approached the Administrative Tribunal seeking retrospective promotion and the application was though allowed by the Tribunal, however, the Appellate Tribunal rejected it on the ground of limitation as the petitioner had filed the application beyond the period of limitation prescribed in the relevant law. The decision was upheld by the Appellate Division. In the said case, in our view, the petitioner had rightly approached the Tribunal and, then, had availed all the appellate forum upto the Appellate Division. But, in the case at hand, the petitioner instead of filing an application before the Tribunal invoked the writ jurisdiction directly. Thus, so for as the issue of forum is concerned, the decision goes against the petitioner as the cited decision clearly shows that approaching the tribunal was a correct step by the petitioner of the cited case. Since the petitioner of the said case failed on the issue of limitation, a pertinent question has now arisen that because of the lack of the knowledge on the limitation point, whether a citizen should be deprived of enjoying his/her right to property. We shall endeavour to deal with this issue at this juncture.<br/> <br/><strong>54.</strong> Apparently, from the reading of the said case, it may appear that Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1908 is not applicable in this case as well. However, in the recently decided case of Abdul Wahab Sheikh Vs Md. Kamal Hossain and others 20 BLT (AD) 282 our Appellate Division upon examining the wordings  of Section 29 of the Limitation Act, 1908 in tandem with revisiting the cases of Md. Abdus Sukkur Vs Chairman, National Board of Revenue and others, 17 BLD (AD) 43; 46 DLR (AD) 1, Government of Bangladesh Vs. Md. Abdul Karim 47 DLR (AD) 146; Jahangir Kabir Vs Bangladesh 48 DLR(AD) 156 and the case of Abul Bashar Vs ICB 52 DLR (AD) 178 has reviewed  its own view having held that unless any special law expressly excludes the applicability of Section 14 and the other Sections of the Limitation Act, 1908 as mentioned in Section 29 of the said Act, they shall be applicable. <br/> <br/><strong>55.</strong> Given the above constructions of the provisions of Section 29 of the Limitation Act, 1908, as interpreted in the above cited case by our Apex Court, apparently the said provision transpires to be a helpful and safeguard provision for a petitioner, who is required to deal with the time-limitation under a special law, for agitating his right before the tribunal. Section 29 of the Limitation Act, 1908 now may be quoted below: <br/> </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>29. Saving- (1) …………..…………</strong><br/>(2) <u>Where any special law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule, the provisions of section 3 shall apply,</u> as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule, and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law-<br/>(a)     the provisions contained in sections 4,  <u>sections  9 to 18,</u> and section 22 <u>shall apply only in so far as, and to the extent to which, they are not expressly excluded by such special law</u>; and<br/>(b)     the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply. (underlined by us)</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px"> <br/><strong>56.</strong> From the perusal of the above provisions of law it appears that the provisions contained in Sections 4, 9 to 18 and Section 22 shall be applicable for computation of time-limit for institution of any suit, making any application, preferring any appeal and filing revision or review under a special law if applicability of the said provisions has not been expressly negated or ousted in the concerned special law. From the very wordings of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1908 any one with ordinary prudence would take the above view. It is widely known to the learned members of the Bench and Bar, even to most of the lay people, that the time which are required and consumed for obtaining certified copy or the vacation period of the Courts are usually deducted from not only the limitation period of ordinarily laws, but also from the special laws’ time-limitation. The source of this long-standing practice is none other than Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1908 which speaks about applicability of the Sections 4, 12 and 14 of the Limitation Act, 1908 in reckoning the limitation period under the special laws.   <br/> <br/><strong>57.</strong> In the অর্পিত সম্পত্তি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন ২০০১, evidently, the application of the provisions of Section 14 having not been excluded expressly, therefore, we hold that the provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act may be taken into consideration in computation of the time limit. In other words, since the অর্পিত সম্পওি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ is a special law wherein a certain time-limit has been stipulated to file any application before the tribunal and since, as per the provisions of Section 29(2)(a), provisions of Section 14 shall be applicable for not being excluded by any express provision of the অর্পিত সম্পওি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ we are of the view that the petitioner is well competent to seek the protection and benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1908 and, thereby, she may be allowed to exclude the time spent in this Court from the date of filing this writ petition. However, in computation of the number of days for exclusion, it is highly likely that the petitioner might encounter a dilemma in the backdrop of the fact that there was no certain amount of days, such as 120 days or 300 days etc, for filing an application before the tribunal when the latest extension was made upto 31.12.2013 by the latest amendment of law and, thus, the pertinent question may arise before the tribunal that how many days the petitioner may get for approaching the tribunal from the date of pronouncement of this judgment by which the petitioner came to know that she should have availed the said forum, namely tribunal, provided in the অর্পিত সম্পওি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১.<br/> <br/><strong>58.</strong> It may appear to be a difficult situation for the tribunal to find a straight-forward resolution of this issue. However, to overcome this hurdle, the tribunal may calculate the limitation applying the following method. When the petitioner had filed the writ petition on 19.11.2012, a limitation of 300 days was in operation with effect from 24.09.2012 and, on the basis of the fact that these 300 days were available for the petitioner from 24.09.2012, the petitioner may be given a time of the said 300 days time from the date of delivering this judgment i.e from today. However, the time from 24.09.2012-19.11.2012 i.e. 55 days shall be deducted from 300 days in the light of the fact that the last limitation of the said 300 days commenced from 24.09.2012 and the petitioner filed her writ petition on 19.11.2012. <br/> <br/><strong>59.</strong> If the petitioner files an application in the tribunal within the above time period, then, the tribunal shall be at liberty to examine the authenticity of the deed of Bainapatra of the year 1963 between the petitioner’s husband and Ms. Radha Rani Basak &amp; Ms. Nanda Rani Basak and to investigate whether the papers submitted before us relating to the judgment and decree dated 30.08.1971 passed in Title Suit no. 290 of 1969 are genuine. Also, the tribunal may ask the petitioner to submit some other papers which we considered in our observation made hereinbefore in this judgment to be crucial for a fair disposal of this case but the same were not submitted before us, such as certified copies of the plaint, written statement and order sheets of the Title Suit no. 215 of 1978 filed before the 6<sup>th</sup> Court of Assistant Judge, Dhaka. Notwithstanding the above observations of this Court as to the <em>modus operandi</em> of the trial of the case by the tribunal, it shall be open to the tribunal to take any other step that may deem appropriate for effective adjudication of the petitioner’s case towards ensuring a fair trial and justice for her.<br/> <br/><strong>60.</strong> In the result, the Rule is discharged, however, without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>61.</strong> Office is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the Secretary, Ministry of Land and also to the Bangladesh Law Commission so as to let them consider whether applicability of the provisions of Sections 4, 12 and 14 of the Limitation Act, 1908 should be specifically incorporated in the অর্পিত সম্পওি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১ to ease the functions of the said tribunal and, further, whether the Tribunals should be equipped with the powers of passing interim orders of injunction or any other direction pending disposal of the cases before the said tribunals and also to examine any other lacunas of the অর্পিত সম্পওি প্রত্যর্পণ আইন, ২০০১.<br/> <br/>Office is directed to communicate this judgment to them at once.<br/> <br/><strong>End.</strong></span><br/> </div></div></div>
