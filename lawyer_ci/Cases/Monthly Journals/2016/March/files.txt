(5)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>The power of judicial review given to the High Court Division is a constitutional power, which can be exercised by it on the basis of an application moved by a citizen and this power has been specifically preserved for a citizen to invoke such right/privilege in the High Court Division under article 102(1). Judicial review vested in the High Court Division under article 102(1) is one of the basic structures of the constitution and it cannot be taken away by the Parliament. The Parliament in exercise of its legislative power cannot curtail the constitutional jurisdiction conferred on the High Court Division. The Parliament can confer upon the Administrative Tribunal in exercise of its legislative power the power of judicial review of administrative actions and nothing more. ......(9)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>By creation of Tribunals the Parliament cannot curtail the powers of the High Court Division given under article 102(1) to issue writs, directions and orders. The High Court Division’s power is extensive. It is a court of record and it has the power of contempt. It has the control and superintendence over the courts and tribunals subordinate to it. The High Court Division’s power is constitutional while the power of the Tribunal is legislative and the Tribunal has been created by a subordinate legislation.      . . .(10)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 44(2), 102 and 117(2)</strong><br/><strong>The constitution guaranteed the High Court Division not to become mere appendages to the administration. The basic human freedoms, including freedom of religion and </strong><strong>the rights of all minorities–religious, cultural,</strong><strong> linguistic will not cease to exist because these are guaranteed rights and will be enforceable on the application of a citizen in the High Court Division. These powers cannot be exercised by a Tribunal created under article 117(2). After the creation of Administrative Tribunal, the jurisdictions of the High Court Division in service matters and its propriety which it had exercised have to be exercised by the Tribunal established under article 117(2). If this provision is taken into consideration with article 44(2), there will be no confusion in coming to the conclusion that an effective alternative institutional mechanism for judicial review in respect of service matters has been created by the Parliament. ....(11)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 102 and 117(2)</strong><br/><strong>There cannot be any doubt in holding the view that the jurisdiction and powers conferred upon an Administrative Tribunal is an ‘alternative’ forum with the object to relieve the High Court Division from the huge backlog and the Parliament has been given the power to establish such Tribunal subject to certain limitations without affecting the fundamental rights of a citizen…...(15)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 102</strong><br/><strong>The power of judicial review in respect of legislative actions has been assigned to the Supreme Courts by the constitution but it has not given to the District Courts and the Tribunals created by Subordinate legislations. It is, therefore, not fair and permissible to equate the Judges of the Supreme Court with the Judges of the District Courts or Tribunals although all of them are part of judiciary. Moreso, the power of judicial review is given to the Supreme Court of  Bangladesh by the constitution but the said power to the lower judiciary is given by subordinate legislation. . . .(30)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 7(2), 26(2), 44(1), 101, 102 and 117(2)</strong><br/><strong>There is no doubt that the constitution is the supreme law of the country and therefore, any Court or Tribunal can exercise any of the provisions of the constitution but with regard to judicial review in respect of legislative actions, this power has been restricted to the High Court Division in our constitution. When the constitution itself has preserved the right of a citizen to move the High Court Division for infringement of fundamental rights against any administrative action, such power cannot be exercised by any Tribunal other than the one established by the constitution i.e. the High Court Division. This power has been assigned to the High Court Division as will be evident from articles 7(2), 26(2), 44(1), 101 and 102(1). Article 101 which provide that the High Court Division shall have such original, appellate and other jurisdictions and the powers that are conferred on it by the constitution or any other law.       . . . (40)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 102 and 117(2)</strong><br/><strong>To invoke the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the constitution, any person aggrieved by the order, action or direction of any person performing the functions in connection with the affairs of the Republic, the forum is preserved to the High Court Division. The conferment of this power cannot be curtailed by any subordinate legislation - it being the inalienable right of a citizen. This power cannot be conferred upon any Tribunal by the Parliament in exercise of legislative power or by the High Court Division or the Appellate Division in exercise of its power of judicial review. This Court itself noticed in Mujibur Rahman that “The Tribunals are not meant to be like to the High Court Division or subordinate court over which the High Court Division of the Supreme Court exercises both judicial review and superintendence. The Tribunals are not in addition to the court described in Chapters I and III of Part VI. There is no command nor any necessary intendment in the constitution that the Tribunal or Appellate Tribunal is to be construed as a forum substitute, alternate or co-equal to the High Court Division”. . . .(41)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102 </strong><br/><strong>The constitution has conferred legislative power to promulgate law empowering a court to exercise all or any of the powers of fundamental rights. Though the Parliament has such power, this clause is to be read not in isolation. Parliament’s power is limited to the extent of giving powers of judicial review of administrative actions only and not more than that. . . . (42)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 44(1) and 102(1) </strong><br/><strong>If the right to move the High Court Division is guaranteed and this power having been conferred on the High Court Division by the constitution, it cannot be said that for enforcement of that right and as the right to judicial review under article 102(1) is a guaranteed one, if a citizen’s fundamental rights is infringed, the remedy for enforcement of that right is conferred by the constitution under article 102(1). Therefore, the exercise of this power by the High Court Division cannot be curtailed or taken away by the Parliament. . . . (50)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 7(2), 26(2) and 102 </strong><br/><strong>The oath of a Judge is somewhat different from other constitutional office holders. Judges have to subscribe an oath to “Preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the laws of Bangladesh”. In respect of other holders of constitutional posts they are not required to subscribe an oath to defend ‘the laws’. They have to subscribe oath to ‘preserve, protect and defend the constitution’. So, the Judges of the highest Court are defenders of the ‘law’ and the ‘constitution’. . . .(53)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 7(2), 26(2), 65 and 102 </strong><br/><strong>It is the Supreme Court alone which is empowered to examine whether or not any law is inconsistent with the constitution. The Parliament has given the legislative power under article 65 to promulgate law but this power is circumscribed by limitations and if it exercises any power which is inconsistent with the constitution, it is the Supreme Court which being the custodian of the constitution and is manned by the Judges who are oath bound to protect the law to examine in this regards. The Supreme Court is the only organ of the State to see that any law is in consonance with the constitution. So, where the constitution confers the power upon the Supreme Court to strike down laws, if found inconsistent, such power cannot be delegated to a Tribunal created under subordinate legislation. . . .(54)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102 </strong><br/><strong>The Supreme Court cannot delegate its power of judicial review of legislative action to a Tribunal. It is only on the principle that the donee of a limited power cannot, by the exercise of that very power, convert the limited power into an unlimited one or in </strong><strong>the alternative a delegatee cannot exercise same or more power than the delegator.</strong><strong>...(54)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 7(2), 26(2) and 102 </strong><br/><strong>The Parliament has the power to invest the power from time to time upon both the Divisions of the Supreme Court by subordinate legislation but this conferment of power cannot supersede the constitutional powers conferred upon this Court. Similarly, the Parliament by this legislative power cannot take away the powers of both the Divisions of the Supreme Court which are invested on it by the constitution.          . . .(58)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 44, 102 and 142 </strong><br/><strong>Though the Parliament has been given wide power to invest upon any court of those powers of the High Court Division, it cannot give all powers to any Court or Tribunal similar to those given by the constitution upon the High Court Division. It can be done by a constitutional amendment but then also, the question will arise as to whether the right to move the High Court Division being one of the basic features of the constitution, the Parliament cannot delegate such power by setting up a parallel Tribunal with powers equal to those of the High Court Division. This will be hit by ‘basic feature’ doctrine and it will be beyond the amending powers of the Parliament under article 142 of the constitution. . . . (59)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article117</strong><br/><strong>Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980(VII of 1981)</strong><br/><strong>Section 4(1) </strong><br/><strong>The Tribunal can adjudicate upon in relation to only terms and conditions of service of any public servant or of any statutory public authority. Though an exclusive jurisdiction has been invested upon the Tribunal, it has no power to nullifying any law, rules or regulations. The Tribunal has been given limited power in the relation to those mentioned in sub-section (1) of section 4. Therefore, this Court has rightly held in Mujibur Rahman that the Tribunal cannot strike down any law or rule on the ground of its constitutionality. . . . (64)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 44 and 102 </strong><br/><strong>The right of judicial review under article 102(1) is a guaranteed one which is embodied in the constitution itself, but if that right is not guaranteed, even if a citizen’s fundamental right is infringed, he will be left with no remedy at all. True, article 102(1) has not been retained in the fundamental rights chapter as has been kept in India but in view of article 44(1), it is akin to fundamental right. Similarly the observation that the enforcement of fundamental right is available only when ‘no other equally efficacious remedy is provided by law’ is also not a correct view, inasmuch as, whenever there is infringement of fundamental rights, any person can move the High Court Division for judicial review of the administrative action under Article 102(1). The question of equally efficacious remedy arises only when it will exercise power under article 102(2) i.e. writ of certiorari and other writs mentioned in sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (2). If there is an alternative remedy, the High Court Division’s power is debarred. It is only in exceptional cases, it can exercise this power. . . . (64)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102 </strong><br/><strong>There is thus no gainsaying the fact that if the vires of any law is challenged notwithstanding ouster of the jurisdiction of the High Court Division by an Act of Parliament, the High Court Division has power of judicial review to examine the constitutionality of the law. . . . (69)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980(VII of 1981)</strong><br/><strong>Section 4(2)</strong><br/><strong>If a public servant or an employee of statutory corporation wants to invoke his fundamental rights in connection with his terms and conditions of service, he must lay foundation in the petition of the violation of the fundamental rights by sufficient pleadings in support of the claim. It will not suffice if he makes evasive statement of violation of his fundamental rights or that by making stray statements that the order is discriminatory or malafide. A malafide action or act is a disputed question of fact and law, and the Tribunal is, therefore, competent enough to decide the question of malafide or collusion or arbitrariness in taking the decision. The expression ‘malafide’ has a definite significance in the legal phraseology and the same cannot emanate out of fanciful imagination or even apprehensions but there must be existing definite evidence of bias and actions which cannot be attributed to be otherwise bonafide, however, by themselves would not amount to be malafide unless the same is accompanied with some other facts which would depict a bad motive or intent on the part of the authority and the same cannot be decided in summarily proceedings in writ jurisdiction. . . . (77)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 (VII of 1981)</strong><br/><strong>Section 4(2)</strong><br/><strong>If an order is said to be without jurisdiction or is contrary to law, the appropriate course open to the applicant is to plead to the Tribunal with such plea and ask for vacating the order or action. It is altogether within the tenor of the Tribunal. . . . (78)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Coram Non Judice</strong><br/><strong>Coram non Judice is a Latin phrase which means ‘not in the presence of a judge’. It is a legal term typically used to indicate a legal proceeding held without a judge, with improper venue such as before a court which lacks the authority to hear and decide a case in question, or without proper jurisdiction. . . . (78)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>Mere superficial pleadings on the point of fundamental rights will not confer any </strong><strong>power on the High Court Division in respect of the terms and conditions of service.</strong><strong> . . . (78)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102 and 117(2)</strong><br/><strong>Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 (VII of 1981)</strong><br/><strong>Section 4(2)</strong><br/><strong>The Tribunal is created as an ‘alternative’ forum of the High Court Division in respect of specific purposes. If any administrative action is found without jurisdiction or coram non judice or malafide, the ribunal is competent to deal with the same and adjudicate these issues satisfactorily. These issues are within its constituents of the Administrative Tribunal. If the order complained of was passed by an officer who is not competent to make such order, the order would be without jurisdiction. If the Rules provide for the constitution of a domestic tribunal with designated persons but the tribunal was constituted by persons not authorized by the Rules, the action would be <em>coram non judice</em>. If the decision is taken malafide out of vengeance or with motive to take revenge, in all those cases the Tribunal can strike down the action taken against the applicant. . . . (79)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 117(2)</strong><br/><strong>Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980(VII of 1981)</strong><br/><strong>Section 4(1)</strong><br/><strong>Article 117(1)(a) specifically provides that the Tribunal can exercise jurisdiction in respect of matters relating to ‘the terms and conditions of persons ......’ Section 4(1) of the Act of 1980 was also couched with the similar language. The language used in those provisions are so wide enough to come to the conclusion that the Tribunal is competent to deal with those issues. The Tribunal has been given all powers relating to the terms and conditions of service and therefore, there is no reason to restrict the powers of the Tribunal by judicial pronouncement. These matters are within the powers of the Tribunal and therefore, if </strong><strong>a public servant wants to challenge the actions as above under article 102(1), it will be barred under clause (2) of Article 117. </strong><strong>...(79)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 (VII of 1981)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 7B, 8(2) and 10A</strong><br/><strong>In all practical purposes the Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal is exercising powers of a civil court and disposing of civil disputes determining the terms and conditions of service, that is to say, the right to his office, privileges promotion including pension rights. The Tribunal has power to substitute the heirs in case of death of the applicant. The Tribunal has been given the power under section 7B to amend the pleadings. Again in section 8(2), it is provided that the decision of the Administrative Tribunal be binding upon the parties, that is, the government. Again in section 10A, it is provided that the Administrative Appellate Tribunal has power to punish for contempt of its authority or that of the Administrative Tribunal, as if it were the High Court Division of the Supreme Court’. The language used in Section 10A is self explanatory that the Tribunal has been created as an ‘alternative’ forum of the High Court Division in respect of matters mentioned above. It can also initiate execution proceeding for enforcement of the judgment. Therefore, the Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal has all the trappings of a Civil Court. . . . (96)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 (VII of 1981)</strong><br/><strong>Section 7</strong><br/><strong>Despite the absence of any provision empowering the Tribunal to pass any interim order, the Tribunal is not powerless since it has all the powers of a civil court and in proper cases, it may invoke its inherent power and pass interim order with a view to preventing abuse of the process of court or the mischief being caused to the applicant affecting his right to promotion or other benefit. But the Tribunal shall not pass any such interim order without affording the opposite party affected by the order an opportunity of being heard. However, in cases of emergency, which requires an interim order in order to prevent the abuse of the process and in the event of not passing such order preventing such loss, which cannot be compensated by money, the Tribunal can pass interim order as an exceptional measure for a limited period not exceeding fifteen days from the date of the order unless the said requirements have been complied with before the expiry of the period, and the Tribunal shall pass any further order upon hearing the parties. . . . (99)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980(VII of 1981)</strong><br/><strong>Section 3(3)</strong><br/><strong>A Tribunal is constituted with a judicial Officer in the rank of a ‘District Judge’ and therefore, he is a ‘civil court’ and not ‘persona designata’. While prescribing the powers of the Tribunal, it is specifically provided that ‘a Tribunal shall have all the powers of civil court’. Monetary compensation cannot be measured while considering the status of an officer. An officer’s dignity, status, privilege, position in office etc. cannot be measured in terms of money. . . . (100)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Interpretation of Statute </strong><br/><strong><em>The inherent powers of a Tribunal reminds the Judges of what they ought to know already, namely that if the ordinary rules of procedure results in injustice in any case and there is no other remedy it can be broken for the ends of justice. This power furnishes the legislative recognition of the old age and well established principle that every Tribunal has inherent power to act ex debito justitiae i.e. to do that real and substantial justice and administration of which alone it exists to prevent abuse of the process of the court. This power can be exercised when no other power is available under the procedural law. Nothing can limit or affect the inherent power of a Tribunal to meet the ends of justice since it is not possible to foresee all possible circumstances that may arise to provide appropriate procedure to meet all those situation. This inherent power is recognized. All tribunals whether civil or criminal possess this power in the absence of any provision, as inherent in their constitution, all such powers as are necessary to do the right and to undo a wrong in course of administration of justice on the principle “quando lex aliquid alique, concedit, conceditor, it sine quo res ipsa eshe non potest” i.e. when the law gives a </em></strong><strong><em>person anything it gives him that also without which the thing itself cannot exists.  </em></strong><strong> . . .(101)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Interpretation of Statute</strong><br/><strong>It is a power of a Tribunal in addition to and complementary to the powers expressly conferred under the procedural law but this power should not be exercised if its exercise is inconsistent with, or comes into conflict with, any of the powers expressly or by necessary implication conferred by the procedural law. It cannot be exercised capriciously or arbitrarily. It should be borne in mind that authority of the Tribunal exists for advancement of justice and if any attempt is made to abuse that authority so as to produce injustice the Tribunal has power to prevent such abuse. Therefore, while exercising this power the Tribunal is to consider whether the exercise of such power is expressly prohibited by any other provision and if there is no such prohibition, then the Tribunal will consider whether such power should be exercised or not in the facts of a given case. . . .

The respondent Sontosh Kumar Shaha was a Senior Assistant Judge, Chuadanga and while he was serving as such two departmental proceedings under the provisions of the Government Servants (Discipline and Appeals) Rules, 1985 were initiated against him on the allegation of corruption. He was placed under suspension and departmental inquiries were held. The inquiry officers found no evidence of corruption against him in respect of one proceeding but in respect of the other, the report  was  somehow  misplaced  from  the  records maintained with the Ministry and the Supreme Court, the concerned Ministry reported that the allegations could  not  be  established  against  him.  Pursuant thereto, Law and Justice Division of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs by letter under memo dated 17th January, 2002, recommended to the Supreme Court for its approval to exonerate him from the charges and also to withdraw his suspension order. The Supreme Court did not approve the proposal and accordingly, the Ministry thereafter sent letters to drop the proceedings. This time the Supreme Court on perusal of the inquiry report directed the Ministry to issue second show cause notice upon him on 20th November, 2003. The respondent challenged the said order in Writ Petition No.7316 of 2003. The writ petition was summarily rejected on the ground that the recommendation of the Ministry was disapproved by the Full Court. Subsequently, it was detected that the proposal for suspension was neither placed before the G.A. Committee nor the Full Court in accordance with rule 3(d) of the High Court Division Rules. The respondent thereupon moved the High Court Division in another writ petition. The High Court Division upon hearing the parties made the rule absolute observing that the proposal for suspension and the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings were not placed before the  G.A.  Committee and also the Full Court  and therefore, the direction given by the Supreme Court was without jurisdiction.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>      The Rules of 1985, was a piece of legislation which was promulgated by the President with the consultation of the Public Service Commission with the object to regulate the conditions of service, pay, allowances, pensions, discipline and conduct of Public Servants and statutory corporations. This Court in Masdar Hossain (52 DLR (AD) 82) declared that judicial service is not a service of the Republic within the meaning of article 152(1) of the constitution, and it is functionally and structurally distinct and separate service from the administrative service of the government and that the judicial service should not be placed at par on any account and should not be mixed up  with  the  administrative  services.  This  Court further declared that Bangladesh Judicial Service Recruitment Rules, 1981 are applicable to the officers of judicial service and directed the government to promotion,   grant   of   leave,   discipline,   pay, allowances, pension and other terms and conditions of service in accordance with articles 116 and 116A  for the  judicial  service  and  Magistrates  exercising judicial works.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>      Neither the President nor the Parliament framed law or Rules in respect of the conditions of service, pensions, benefits, discipline and conduct for the judicial service and Magistrates exercising judicial works. Therefore, as per direction and guidelines in Masder Hossain, the Rules of 1985 are made applicable to the judicial officers until such law or Rules are framed by the government. It was also declared that the judicial review against any disciplinary action taken against the members of judicial service is available in the Administrative Tribunal.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>      Learned Attorney General argues that in presence of alternative remedy in the Administrative Tribunal, the judicial review against the decision of the disciplinary action for taking penal action against Sontosh Kumar Shaha is not maintainable and the High Court Division  is  not  justified  in interfering with the direction. Mr. Mahmudul Islam, Learned Counsel argues that since the proposal for suspension of the respondent No.1 and the initiation of the proceedings had not been placed before the G.A. Committee and the Full Court, the decision taken for taking disciplinary action against him was violative to article 116 of the constitution, and therefore, judicial review of the said decision in the High Court Division is maintainable. Mr. Mahmudul Islam has submitted that the views taken by this court in Mujibur Rahman  V.  Bangladesh, 44 DLR (AD)111,  is required to be reconsidered, inasmuch as, the said views are inconsistent with Part III of the constitution. On this point, the Attorney General also agrees  with  opinion  of  the  learned  Counsel  Mr. Mahmudul Islam and adds that there are inconsistent opinions of this Court and the High Court Division on the question of maintanability against any disciplinary action taken against a public servant and therefore, there is need for revisiting Masder Hossain’s case afresh. Since a constitutional point has been raised at the Bar, the Chief Justice reconstituted a larger Bench to decide the questions of law.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>      In Part III of the constitution there are hosts of fundamental rights - some of them are conditional and some of them are unconditional. Fundamental rights are conferred primarily for the benefit of individuals and can, therefore, be waived, and can form the subject of a lawful compromise. The fundamental rights are succinctly narrated below. Those laws which are inconsistent with the fundamental rights to be void. If any law is inconsistent with any provisions of Part III of the constitution the same shall to the extent of such inconsistency be void; all citizens are equal before law and they are entitled to equal protection of law; the State shall not discriminate against any citizen on the ground of religion, race, caste, sex etc.; there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in respect of appointment or in the service of the Republic; there shall be protection of law to all the citizens and no action detrimental to his life, liberty, body or reputation or property shall be taken except in accordance with law; no citizen shall be deprived of life and personal liberty except in accordance with law; no citizen shall be arrested without being informed the grounds of his detention etc.; there shall not be any forced labour in contravention of the provisions of law; no person shall  be  convicted  of  any  offence  except  for violations of law; every citizen shall have the right to move freely within the country subject to such restrictions imposed by law; every person shall have the  right  to  assemble  and  participate  in  public meetings and processions peacefully; a citizen has the right to form associations or unions, subject to such restrictions  imposed  by  law  in  the  interest  of security of the State; every citizen has freedom of speech and expression; every citizen has right to hold profession, his trade or occupation, business subject to public order and morality; every citizen has the right to profess, practice or propagate any religion; every citizen shall have the right to acquire, hold and transfer any property subject to law; and finally, the  right  to  move  the  High  Court  Division  in accordance with clause (1) of article 102 for the enforcement of rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution is guaranteed.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>      Mr. Mahmudul Islam submits that there is no doubt that the right of a citizen to seek redress to the High Court Division for enforcement of fundamental rights is guaranteed; and therefore, the views taken by this Court in Mujibur Rahman V. Bangladesh, 44 DLR(AD) 111 are required to be reviewed since some of the findings are inconsistent with article 44 of the Constitution. In support of his contention he has relied on some decisions of this Court and of Indian jurisdiciton. He has also referred some provisions of the High Court Division Rules and submits that since the decision taken against Sontosh Kumar Shaha was in violation of High Court Division Rules, the High Court Division was justified in making the rule absolute.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>      In Mujibur Rahman, the latter was compulsorily retired from his service as Collector of Customs. The Administrative Tribunal set aside the order of retirement. On appeal from the said judgment, the Administrative Appellate Tribunal interfered with the Tribunal’s judgment on the ground that as the order of compulsory retirement was passed by the Chief Martial Law Administrator, the judicial review of the said order was barred. A writ petition was filed by Mujibur Rahman but the High Court Division summarily rejected the petition on the ground that the petition was not maintainable under clause (5) of article 102. This Court considered article 117 of the constitution and some decisions from home and aboard and held that the Tribunals created under article 117 are not meant to be like the High Court Division or subordinate courts over which  the  High  Court  Division  can  exercise judicial review and superintendence. The Tribunal has been set up in exercise of its legislative power by the Parliament. The Tribunal was construed as a forum substitute, alternate or co-equal to the High Court Division.  The  judicial  review  by  the  High  Court Division in respect of terms and conditions of service of the Republic has been deliberately excluded by clause (2) of Article 117.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>      We have meticulously perused the  judgment  in Mujibur Rahman and noticed some inconsistency in the conclusion arrived at therein. What disturbed us is that  keeping  the  findings  in  paragraph  36,  the majority opinion that "The tribunals are not meant to be like High Court Division or the subordinate court over which the High Court Division of the Supreme Court exercising both judicial review and superintendence. The tribunals are not in addition to the courts described in Chapters I and III.’ and the observations that “Within its jurisdiction the Tribunal can strike down an order for violation of principle  of  natural  justice  as  well  as  for infringement of fundamental rights, guaranteed by the Constitution, or of any other law, in respect of matters relating to or arising out of sub-clause (a), but such tribunals cannot, like the Indian Administrative Tribunals in exercise of a more comprehensive jurisdiction under Article 323A strike down any law or rule on the ground of its constitutionality,’ We find no elaborate discussion in drawing such inference. Again it has been observed, ‘in the service of the Republic who intends to invoke fundamental right for challenging the vires of a law will seek his remedy under Article 102(1), but in other cases he will be required to seek remedy under Article 117(2).’ The above findings and conclusions are  required  to  be  reconsidered  with  a  view  to avoiding confusion in the minds of the litigants.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    The observations particularly in the first portion is correct-there is no doubt about it, but the conclusion reached at by it is not sound one over which I will discuss later on. In arriving at the conclusion this Court has assigned no reasons and secondly, a citizen’s right to move the High Court Division under article 102(1) for enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III is guaranteed. Clause (2) of article 44 provides that the Parliament may empower any other court to exercise ‘all or any of those powers,  that  is,  for  enforcement  of  the  rights conferred by Part III, but this power cannot be so conferred affecting the powers of the High Court Division. The power of judicial review given to the High Court Division is a constitutional power, which can be exercised by it on the basis of an application moved  by  a  citizen  and  this  power  has  been specifically preserved for a citizen to invoke such right/privilege  in  the  High  Court  Division  under article 102(1). Judicial review vested in the High Court Division under article 102(1) is one of the basic structures of the constitution and it cannot be taken  away  by  the  Parliament.  The  Parliament  in exercise of its legislative power cannot curtail the constitutional  jurisdiction  conferred  on  the  High Court Division. The Parliament can confer upon the Administrative Tribunal in exercise of its legislative power the power of judicial review of administrative actions and nothing more. This has been settled in Kesavananda Bharati case (AIR 1997 S.C. 1461) and this court has accepted the said view.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    In Mujibur Rahman case, this Court noticed article 44(1) in paragraph 47, but it has totally ignored the tenor of article 44(1). By creation of Tribunals the Parliament cannot curtail the powers of the High Court Division given under article 102(1) to issue writs, directions and orders. The High Court Division’s power is extensive. It is a court of record and it has the power of contempt. It has the control and superintendence over the courts and tribunals subordinate to it. The High Court Division’s power is constitutional while the power of the Tribunal is legislative and the Tribunal has been created by a subordinate legislation.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    The constitution guaranteed the High Court Division not to become mere appendages to the administration. The basic human freedoms, including freedom of religion and the rights of all minorities – religious, cultural, linguistic will not cease to exist because these are guaranteed rights and will be enforceable on the application of a citizen in the High Court Division. These powers cannot be exercised by a Tribunal created under article 117(2). After the creation of Administrative Tribunal, the jurisdictions of the High Court Division in service matters and its propriety which it had exercised have to be exercised by the Tribunal established under article 117(2). If this  provision  is  taken  into  consideration  with article 44(2), there will be no confusion in coming to the conclusion that an effective alternative institutional mechanism for judicial review in respect of service matters has been created by the Parliament. In Minerva Mills Ltd. V. Union of India, AIR 1980 S.C.1789, the Supreme Court of India observed that the power of judicial review is an integral part of the constitutional system and without it, there will be no government of laws and the rule of law would become a teasing illusion and a promise of unreality. If there is one feature of the constitution which, more than any other, is basic and fundamental to the maintenance of democracy and the rule of law, it is the power of judicial review and it is unquestionable, which is, part of the basic structure of the constitution. It was concluded:<br/>“Of course, when I say this I should not be taken to suggest that, however, effective alternative institutional mechanisms or arrangements for judicial review cannot be made by Parliament. But what I wish to emphasize is that judicial review is a vital principle of our Constitution and it cannot be abrogated   without   affecting   the   basic structure of the Constitution. If by a constitutional   amendment,   the   power   of judicial review is taken away and it is provided that the validity of any law made by the Legislature shall not be liable to be called in question on any ground, even if it is outside the legislative competence of the Legislature or is violative of any fundamental rights,  it  would  be  nothing  short  of subversion of the Constitution, for it would make a mockery of the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States and render the fundamental rights meaningless and futile. So also if a constitutional amendment is made which has the effect of taking away the power of judicial review...........”<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    Under our constitutional dispensation particularly articles 44(2) and 117(2), it is possible to set up an alternative mechanism in place of the High Court Division for providing judicial review in respect of the terms and conditions of service of the Republic and other public organisations. Over a span of time after the creation of Administrative Tribunal, there is no doubt that a service jurisprudence has been developed in this country to the satisfaction of the litigants. Initially there was confusion in the minds of some as to whether the Tribunal will be able to address and adjudicate upon the problems properly since the Tribunal is manned by the District Judge who has no expertise in those field. We find no serious infirmity on the question of judicial review of administrative actions by the Tribunal. The public servants and other litigants have accepted the system.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    In S.P. Sampath Kumar V. Union of India, AIR 1987 S.C. 386, Bhagwati, C.J. while concurring with the majority opinion observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Thus it is possible to set up an alternative institution in place of the High Court for providing judicial review. The debates and deliberations spread over almost two decades for exploring ways and means for relieving the High Courts of the load of backlog of cases and for assuring quick settlement of service disputes  in  the  interest  of  the  public servants as also the country cannot be lost sight of while considering this aspect. It has not been disputed before us- and perhaps could not have been – that the Tribunal under the scheme of the Act would take over a part of the existing backlog and a share of the normal load of the High Courts. The Tribunal has been contemplated as a substitute and not as supplemental to the High Court in the scheme of administration of justice. To provide the Tribunal as an additional forum from where parties could go to the High Court would certainly have been a retrograde step considering the situation and circumstances to meet which the innovation has been brought about. Thus barring of the jurisdiction of the High Court can indeed not be a valid ground of attack.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>15.    </strong>This Court in Mujibur Rahman held that “There is no command nor any necessary intendment in the constitution that the Tribunals or the Appellate Tribunal is to be construed as a forum substitute, alternate or co-equal to the High Court Division’. The views expressed above are not sound. It ought to have explained the powers of the Tribunal with a view to removing any confusion. The opinion that it is not a forum substitute is true but it is not correct to assume that it is not a forum ‘alternate’ inasmuch as, the court made the above observation ignoring the language used in article 44(2). In this connection it is necessary to expound the constitutional back up of the creation of the Tribunal. Articles 44(2) provides:<br/>“(2) without prejudice to the powers of the High Court Division under Article 102, Parliament may by law empower any other court, within the local limits of its jurisdiction, to exercise <u>all or any of those powers</u>.” (emphasis supplied)<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    There cannot be any doubt in holding the view that the jurisdiction and powers conferred upon an Administrative Tribunal is an ‘alternative’ forum with the object to relieve the High Court Division from the huge backlog and the Parliament has been given the power to establish such Tribunal subject to certain limitations without affecting the fundamental rights of a citizen. We have discussed above, all the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III are not inalienable - some of them are conditional and this clause (2) contains in Part III. It is a forum created by the Parliament providing for judicial review with an object to relieve the High Court Division of the burden of huge backlog of cases and ensuring quick disposal of service related matters in an alternative dispute resolution mechanism. The constitution has empowered  the  Parliament  to  give  such  power  of judicial review upon a Tribunal under article 117 in respect of –<br/>(a) the terms and conditions of persons in the service of the Republic, including the matters provided for in Part IX and the award of penalties or punishments;<br/>(b) .....................................<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    Keeping the High Court Division’s limited power of judicial review under Article 102(1) only in respect of violation of fundamental rights and legislative actions, we have reason to believe that unless the High Court Division is not determined to allow the Tribunal to perform the power of judicial review in its respective field and if it does not usurp its powers, one day it will be seen that a service jurisprudence  in  the  Tribunal  level  has  been developed. By this time, we may legitimately say that the   Tribunals   have   been   functioning   to   the satisfaction of the litigants, in general. This will augment the High Court Division’s control and supervision over other courts subordinate to it and the peoples confidence over the judiciary will be strengthened.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    If the Judges of the High Court Division are over burdened  with  cases,  how  can  they  supervise  and control its subordinate courts and Tribunals? Apart from the above, the High Court Division has the power to transfer a case pending in a subordinate court to it which involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of constitution or on a point of general public importance, the determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the case under Article 110. Therefore, while the power of judicial review of legislative action is vested in the High Court Division along with violation of fundamental rights, it should ensure that frivolous claims are filtered out through the process of adjudication of the Tribunal. It is hoped that the High Court Division shall be guard in exercising its power of judicial review and avoid to interfere with those matters which are   cognizable   under   Article   117(1)   of   the constitution. This is necessary for the interest of justice and in that case, it can properly supervise and administer justice.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    The High Court Division has over the years accumulated case load almost four hundred thousand. As the population is increasing, the backlog problem is becoming acute. The bar of jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition on any of the above matters is a measure for effective, expeditious and satisfactory disposal relating to service disputes of public servants and the power of judicial review in respect of those matters by the High Court Division has been debarred by clause (5) of article 102 read with clause (2) of article 117. There is thus a forum where matters of importance and grave injustice over service matters can be brought for determination. One may pose a question as to what nature of jurisdiction a Tribunal has barring the judicial review of the High Court Division. This Tribunal has all the powers and jurisdiction relating to the terms and conditions of persons in the service of the Republic that were being exercised by the High Court Division. This is a new alternative dispute resolution mechanism. There are courts under the prevailing laws in the country by which both the High Court Division and the District Courts  exercise  such  powers.  The  Parliament  in exercise of its legislative power has also given concurrent jurisdictions to the High Court Division and the Sessions Judges say, section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This power has been given upon a court subordinate to the High Court Division with a view to enabling the litigants to avail of prompt and less expensive criminal justice from the lower tier of the judiciary. The difference between these two enactments  is  that  under  the  Code  of  Criminal Procedure the power of judicial review has been given to the High Court Division from the judgment of the sessions Judges, but in respect of service matters, the appellate power of judicial review has been given upon the Administrative Appellate Tribunal and then to this Court. The object is to afford the service holders to get prompt and less expensive relief in a lower tier of the judiciary. And the final power of judicial review has been given upon this Court on limited matters only on the question of law.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    Article 44(1) says that the right to move the High Court Division under clause (1) of article 102 itself is a fundamental right, that is to say, this right is guaranteed. Under the Indian provision, though there is an enabling provision in clause (3) of article 32 of the constitution empowering the Parliament to any other court to exercise all or any of the powers exercisable by the Supreme Court, no such legislation was made in India till 1985, when Part XIV containing articles  323A  and  323B  have  been  inserted.  This article 323A is almost in <em>pari materia </em>to article 117(1)  of  our  constitution.  By  Article  323A  the Parliament has been given power to constitute Central Administrative Tribunal and by article 323B, the State Legislature has been given the power to constitute Administrate Tribunals in the State level.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    The object of establishing such Tribunals in India by constitutional amendment was to take out the adjudication of disputes relating to the recruitment and conditions of public services of the Union and of the States from the hands of the civil courts and the High Courts and to place it before the Administrative Tribunals for the Union or the States. This departure was made with the object that the traditional civil courts gripped with rules of pleadings and strict rules of evidence and traditional four tier appeals, and endless revision and reviews under the Code of Civil Procedure, were not treated to be needed expeditious dispensation of litigation relating to the service matters. Reference in this connection is the case of Vatchirikuru Village Panchayat V. Deekshi Thulu Nori Venkatarama, 1991(2)SCR 531.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    Under   the   Indian   Central   Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, the Tribunal would adjudicate upon disputes and complaints with respect to the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public service and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union and Corporations and other  authorities  under  control  of  the  Union Government excepting (a) members of the defence services, (b) officers and servants of the Supreme Court or of any High Court, (c)   members of the Secretarial staff of Parliament or of any legislature of any States or Union territorial etc.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>    In India there was no separate provision like articles 44 and 101 of the out constitution, but similar provisions have been incorporated in clauses (1) and (3) of article 32 but no such provision is included in article 226 with the result that in case of violation of fundamental rights, its citizens can move the Supreme Court only under article 32. Whatever other remedy may be open to a person aggrieved, he has no right to complain under article 32, if there is no infringement of fundamental rights. Article 32 is included in Part III in the Chapter of ‘fundamental rights’  but  Article  102  of  our  constitution  is included in Part VI under the heading ‘The Judiciary’.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>    The Constitutional Bench in L. Chandra Kumar (AIR 1997 SC 1125) held that if the power under Article 32 of the constitution, which has been described as the “heart” and “soul” of the constitution, can be additionally conferred upon “any other Court” there is no reason why the same situation cannot subsist in respect of jurisdiction conferred upon the High Courts under Article 226 of the constitution. So long as the jurisdiction of the High Couts under Articles 226/227 and that of Supreme Court’s power under Article 32 is retained, it is observed, there is no reason why the power to test the validity of legislations against the provisions of the constitution cannot be conferred upon Administrative Tribunals created under the Act or upon Tribunals created under Article 323B of the Constitution. It is observed that, apart from the authorization that flows from Articles 323A and 323B, both Parliament and the State Legislatures possess legislative  competence  to  effect  changes  in  the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the High Courts. This power, it is further observed, is available to Parliament under Entries 77, 78, 79 and 95 of List I and to the State Legislatures under Entry 65 of List II; Entry 46 of List III can also be availed  of  both  by  Parliament  and  the  State Legislatures for this purpose.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>    The Supreme Court of India summarized its opinion in L. Chandra Kumar that the Tribunals function in this respect is only supplementary and all such decisions of the Tribunals will be subject to scrutiny before a Division Bench of the respective High Courts. The Tribunals will consequently also be left with the power to test the vires of subordinate legislations and rules.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>    As regards the powers of Central Administrative Tribunal of India section 14 provides:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“14. Jurisdiction, powers and authority of the Central Administrative Tribunal-(1) Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, the Central Administrative Tribunal shall exercise, on and from the appointed day, all jurisdiction, powers  and  authority  exercisable  immediately before that day by all courts (except the Supreme Court [xx]) in relation to-<br/>(a)        recruitment, and matters concerning recruitment, to any All India Service or to any civil service of the Union or a civil post under the Union or to a post connected with defence or in the defence services, being, in either case, a post filed by a civilian;<br/>(b)        all service matters concerning-<br/>(i)   a member of any All-India Service;<br/>or<br/>(ii)  a person [not being a member of an All-India Service or a person referred   to   in   clause   (c)] appointed to any civil service of the union or any civil post under the union; or<br/>(iii) a civilian [not being a member of an All-India Service or a persons referred to in clause (c) ] appointed to any defence services or a post connected with defence.<br/>and pertaining to the service of such member, person or civilian, in connection with the affairs of the Union or of any State or of any local or other authority within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India or, of  any  corporation  [or  society]  owned  or controlled by the Government.<br/>(c) all service matters pertaining to service in  connection  with  the  affairs  of  the  Union concerning a person appointed to any service or post referred to in sub-clause (ii) of sub-clause (iii) of clause (b), being a person whose services have been placed by a State Government or any local or other authority or any corporation [or society] or other body, at the disposal of the Central Government for such appointment.<br/>(3) Save as otherwise expressly provided in this  Act,  the  Central  Administrative  Tribunal shall also exercise, on and from the date with the effect from which the provisions of this sub- section apply to any local or other authority or corporation [or society], all the jurisdiction, powers  and  authority  exercisable  immediately before that date by all courts (except the Supreme Court [xx] in relation to-<br/>(a)  recruitment,  and  matters  concerning recruitment, to any service or post in connection with the affairs of such local or other authority or corporation [or society]; and<br/>(b) all service matters concerning a person [other than a person referred to in clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1)] appointed to any service or post in connection with the affairs of such local or other authority or corporation [or society] and pertaining to the service of such person in connection with such affairs.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>27.</strong>    We noticed from the above that the Parliament did not  empower  the  Tribunals  to  declare  legislative actions ultra vires the constitution but by judicial pronouncement the Supreme Court in L. Chandra Kumar has given such power. Reasons assigned by the Supreme Court are that the ‘constitution confers the power to strike down laws upon the High Courts and Supreme Court it also contains elaborate provisions dealing with......... though the tribunals created by ordinary legislations cannot exercise the power of judicial review of legislative actions to the exclusion of the High Courts, there is no constitutional prohibition against their performing a supplemental as opposed to a substitutional role....’ “so long as the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Articles 226/227 and that of this court under Article 32 is retained, there is no reason  why  the  power  to  test  the  validity  of legislation against the provisions of the Constitution cannot be conferred upon the Administrative Tribunals created under the Act or upon Tribunals created under Article 323B of the Constitution “This power is available to Parliament under Entries 77, 78, 79 and 95 of List LI and to the state legislature under Entry 65 of List II; Entry 46 of List III can also be availed  of  both  by  Parliament  and  the  State Legislatures for this purpose”.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>    As per the jurisdiction given to Indian Central Administrative Tribunal, in relation to all service matters covering All-India service or a person not being a member of All-India service or a person appointed to any civil service of the Union or a post connected with the defence service.  Thereafter, by an amendment, the Central Administrative Tribunal has been given power to have the jurisdiction of the officers of all the civil courts other than Supreme Court. The Administrative Tribunals in India are competent to exercise all powers which the respective courts could have exercised. Our Administrative Tribunal is not invested with the power of judicial review of legislative actions even if there  is violation of any of the provisions of the fundamental rights.  It  is  because  of  Article  44(1).  Indian Tribunals have been given the power of judicial review in respect of legislative action by judicial pronouncement in Minerva Mills case, AIR 1980 SC 1789. Bhagwati, J. observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The  judiciary  is  the  interpreter  of  the constitution and to the judiciary is assigned the delicate task to determine what is the conferred  on  each  branch  of  government, whether it is limited, and if so, what are the limits and whether any action of that branch transgresses such limits. It is for the judiciary to uphold the constitutional values and to enforce the constitutional limitations. That is the essence of the rule of law, which inter  alia  requires  that  the  exercise  of powers by the Government whether it be the legislature or the executive or any other authority be conditioned by the constitution and the law.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>29.</strong>    This  enlargement  of  power  may  be  termed  as judicial legislation signifies new legal rules made by Judges. In ‘Introduction of jurisprudence’ by Mr. Lloyd, it is pointed out that how there remains a consensus of opinion that, within certain narrow and clearly defined limits, new law is created by the judiciary. On reading great deal in theoretical text- books on Politics and Government about that Trinity, which exists in all free governments, the Executive, the Legislative and the Judiciary, as to how these departments  should  be  entirely  distinct  and  each adhere strictly to its own duties and limits. These duties are so internally connected, so closely interwoven, so act and re-act upon each other, that it is often difficult, sometimes impossible to decide where the jurisdiction of one department ends and that of another begins.<br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong>    As  regards  Acts  passed  by  the  legislature, judicial legislation comes in to modify and to re-enforce principally in four ways: (1) by applying to them the rules of statutory construction. Much law is created in this way; or (2) the judiciary may decide that a certain statute is unconstitutional or is not unconstitutional as the case may be, and thus, either destroy it altogether, or in order to save it, may greatly modify its effect and in a large measure thwart the interest of the legislature; (3) or in construing any statute, the Judges may impute a narrow meaning to certain words used or a liberal meaning as the case may be and thus modify and mould the law to their own notions of justice and the public good; (4) A statute may be ignored altogether in some important particulars and new law created by the judiciary. (Judicial Legislation, Frank Bowman).<br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong>    With due respect, we are unable to endorse the said view of Bhagwati,J. ‘Judiciary’ includes all tiers of judiciary including the Supreme Court, High Courts, Tribunals and the District Courts. In both countries, say, India and Bangladesh the power of judicial review in respect of legislative actions has been  assigned  to  the  Supreme  Courts  by  the constitution but it has not given to the District Courts and the Tribunals created by Subordinate legislations.  It  is,  therefore,  not  fair  and permissible to equate the Judges of the Supreme Court with the Judges of the District Courts or Tribunals although all of them are part of judiciary. More so, the power of judicial review is given to the Supreme Court of Bangladesh by the constitution but the said power to the lower judiciary is given by subordinate legislation.<br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong>    There are three organs of the State, of them, the judiciary’ is one but if the higher judiciary is equated with the lower judiciary, there will create chaos and confusion. There is no doubt that the Indian High Courts and Supreme Court have been assigned a delicate task to determine what is the power conferred on each branch of the government but this power has not been assigned to the lower judiciary which is also a part of ‘judiciary’. This anomaly has been reflected in a later decision in L. Chandra Kumar V. Union of India, AIR 1997 S.C. 1125. In this case, the Supreme Court citing the dictum in Marbury V. Madison, Crauch 137 (1803) observed that Henry, J. Abraham’s definition of judicial review in the American context is subject to a few modification equally applicable to the  concept  as  it  is  understood  in  Indian constitutional law. Broadly speaking, it is observed, judicial review in India comprises three aspect: Judicial review of legislative action, judicial review of judicial decisions and judicial review of administrative action. So far this view is correct but the question is whether the judicial review of legislative  action  is  permissible  by  the  lower judiciary or a Tribunal.<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong>    It has been observed in L.Chandra Kumar (supra) that ‘Indeed, when the Framers of our constitution set about their monumental task, they were well aware that the  principle  that  <u>courts  possess  the  power  to invalidate duly enacted legislations</u> had already acquired a history of nearly a century and a half;’ (emphasis supplied). Here also the powers of the Supreme Court have been equated with those of the Subordinate Courts and Tribunals. It has   concluded its arguments in Para 93 observing that ‘The Tribunals are competent to hear matters where the vires of statutory provisions are questioned.’ This conclusion is  in  direct  conflict  with  its  observation  in paragraph  80  wherein  it  has  been  observed  that ‘However, it is important to emphasise that though the subordinate judiciary or Tribunals created under ordinary legislations cannot exercise the power of judicial review of legislative action to the exclusion of the High Courts and the Supreme Court, there is no Constitutional Prohibition against their performing a supplemental as apposed to a substitutional role in this respect.’<br/> <br/><strong>34.</strong>    In R.K. Jain V. Union of India, AIR 1993 SC 1769, the Supreme Court of India analyzed the theory of alternative institutional mechanisms which have been functioning in practice and recommended that the Law Commission of India or a similar expert body to conduct a survey of the functioning of Tribunals and that such study conducted after gauging the working of the Tribunals over a sizeable period provides an answer to the questions critics of the theory. It was observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The  over  all  picture regarding the tribunalisation of justice in our country is not satisfactory and encouraging. There is a need for a fresh look and review and a serious consideration   before   the   experiment   is extended to new areas of fields, especially if the constitutional jurisdiction of the High Courts is to be simultaneously ousted. Not many tribunals satisfying the aforesaid tests can possibly be established.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>35.</strong>    The constitutional court did not approve all the recommendations submitted by the Malimath Committee constituted for the purpose and it was of the opinion that the Tribunals are competent to hear matters where the vires of statutory provisions are questioned. However, in discharging this duty, it was observed, they should not act as substitutes of the High Courts and Supreme Court which have under constitutional set up, been specifically entrusted with such obligations. It was observed ‘Their function in this respect is only supplementary and all such decisions of the Tribunals  will  be  subject  to  security  before  a Division Bench of the respective High Courts. The Tribunals will consequently have the power to test the vires of subordinate legislations and rules’.<br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong>    Let us consider some provisions of law relating to the phrase ‘judicial review’ other than Bangladesh and India. In the early 1980’s Canada experienced a fundamental change in its political and legal structures. A new Constitution Act, 1982 came into effect declaring itself to be ‘the Supreme law of Canada.” The new Constitution Act further decreed that ‘any law that is inconsistent with (its) provisions..... is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect. (Constitution Act, 1982, Schedule B, Part I, Canadian  Charter  of  Rights  and  Freedoms,  section 52(1)’. Judicial review under the Canadian system ‘refer to any form of judicial assessment of legal validity of government action (typically legislation) under a constitutional Charter of Bill of Rights’. It has been observed by W.J. Waluchow, in his ‘A common Law  Theory  of  Judicial  Review’,  this  judicial assessment is such as one finds in Canada and United States, or under sections of nation’s constitution that outline basic civil rights like equality and freedom of association.<br/> <br/><strong>37.</strong>    In Edwards V. A.G. of Canada, (1930) A.C. 124, it is observed that a constitution is a ‘living tree’ trends, and reliefs and whose current and continued authority rests on its justice or on factors like the consent, commitment, or sovereignty of the people-now, not the framers or the people - now particularly relevant. In viewing a constitution as a living tree, malleable in the hands of contemporary interpreters, consistent with its status as foundational law, and with the entrenchment and stability that may see essentials aspects of the very idea of constitutionalism?<br/> <br/><strong>38.</strong>    All judicial review- all manner of adjudication by courts – is itself an exercise of judicial accountability – accountability to the people who are affected by a judicial pronouncement. That accountability gets evidenced in critical comments, by Fali S. Nariman, on judicial decision when Judges behave as they should as moral custodian of the constitution; the function they perform enhances the spirit of constitutionalism. He observed, ‘My only regret some times is that some of our modern-day Judges – whether in India or elsewhere – do not always realise the solemnity and importance of the functions they are expected to perform. The ideal judge of today, if he is to be a constitutional mentor, must move around, in and outside court, with the constitution in his pocket, like the priest who is never  without  the  Bible  (or  the  Bhagavad  Gita). Because, the more you read the provisions of our Constitution, the more you get to know of how to apply its  provisions  to  present-day  problems.’  (Before Memory Fades...)<br/> <br/><strong>39.</strong>    The main impact of judicial review of legislation, based upon a combination of eighteenth-century natural law principles with the constitution, did not come until the second half of the nineteenth century. The American Constitution regulates the relations between executive, legislature, and judiciary differently from the British. It gives to a law court a supervisory function which, cannot hold having deep political implications and it isolates legislative and executive from each other, instead of the British method of constituting government as an executive committee of the majority in Parliament.<br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong>    Modern democracies also  differ  widely  in  the organisation of the administration of justice. In continental democracies, a Ministry of justice is in administrative  control  of  the  entire  judicial machinery,  and  also  the  central  agency  for  the drafting of legislation. In Britain, these functions are   divided   between   the   Lord   Chancellor’s Secretariate, the Parliamentary draftsman and ad-hoc law revision committees. In 1965, the process of law revision was given institutional continuity, through the creation of Law Commissions for England and Scotland. In the United States, the Attorney General’s Department  exercises  some  of  the  functions  of  a Ministry of justice, together with numerous congressional committees and <em>ad-hoc </em>commissions. Each of these national institutions has certain merits and deficiencies.<br/> <br/><strong>41.</strong>    There is no doubt that the constitution is the supreme law of the country and therefore, any Court or Tribunal can exercise any of the provisions of the constitution but with regard to judicial review in respect of legislative actions, this power has been restricted to the High Court Division in our constitution.  When  the  constitution  itself  has preserved the right of a citizen to move the High Court Division for infringement of fundamental rights against any administrative action, such power cannot be exercised by any Tribunal other than the one established by the constitution i.e. the High Court Division. This power has been assigned to the High Court Division as will be evident from articles 7(2) 26(2),  44(1),  101  and  102(1).  Article  101  which provides that the High Court Division shall have such original, appellate and other jurisdictions and the powers that are conferred on it by the constitution or any other law.<br/> <br/><strong>42.</strong>    To invoke the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the constitution, any person aggrieved by the order, action or direction of any person performing the functions in connection with the affairs of the Republic, the forum is preserved to the High Court Division. The conferment of this power cannot be curtailed by any subordinate legislation - it being the inalienable right of a citizen. This power cannot be conferred upon any Tribunal by the Parliament in exercise of legislative power or by the High Court Division or the Appellate Division in exercise of its power of judicial review. This Court itself noticed in Mujibur Rahman that “The Tribunals are not meant to be like to the High Court Division or subordinate court over which the High Court Division of the Supreme Court exercises both judicial review and superintendence. The Tribunals are not in addition to the court described in Chapters I and III of Part VI. There is no command nor any necessary intendment in the  constitution  that  the  Tribunal  or  Appellate Tribunal is to be construed as a forum substitute, alternate or co-equal to the High Court Division”.<br/> <br/><strong>43.</strong>    Here possibly this Court has overlooked article 44(2) of the constitution. The constitution has conferred  legislative  power  to  promulgate  law empowering a court to exercise all or any of the powers of fundamental rights. Though the Parliament has such power, this clause is to be read not in isolation. Parliament’s power is limited to the extent of giving powers of judicial review of administrative actions only and not more than that. There is no dispute that there is provision in the constitution in article 117(2) conferring upon the Parliament the power to establish Administrative Tribunal to exercise judicial  functions  relating  to  the  terms  and conditions in the service of the Republic, ‘including the matters provided in Part IX’.<br/> <br/><strong>44.</strong>    Chapter-1 of Part IX provides so far as it relates to appointment and conditions of service of persons in the service of Republic, their tenure of office, disciplinary actions and Chapter-II relates to the Public Service Commission. The subordinate judiciary contains in Part-VI. Chapter-II relates to the subordinate judiciary and Chapter III of Part VI relates to Administrative Tribunal. Though this Court in Mujibur Rahman was silent regarding the Administrative Tribunal, clause (2) of article 117 debars  the  High  Court  Division  of  its  power  of judicial review relating to the terms and conditions of the persons in the service of the Republic. For that purpose it has created an appellate forum to be created by law. By Act No. VII of 1981, the government has established the Tribunal with effect from 5th June, 1981, both for exercising the original and appellate jurisdictions. Later on by Act No.XXIII of 1991, another forum for judicial review of the judgment of the  Administrative  Appellate  Tribunal  has  been created. Now the question is whether this creation of the original or appellate forum is to be construed as substitute, alternative or co-equal to the High Court Division.<br/> <br/><strong>45.    </strong>If  we  summarise  the  language  used  in  Indian provision in article 323A, which provides “Parliament may, by law, provide for adjudication or trial by administrative tribunals of disputes.......... with respect to conditions of service of persons..........’. Under   our provision article 117 provides ‘Parliament may by law establish one or more administrative tribunals to exercise jurisdiction in respect of .......... ‘the terms and conditions of persons.....’.  The  language  used  in  both  the enactments  is  almost  identical  only  with  the difference  that  under  the  Indian  provision  the Tribunals have been given the power to make interim orders in appropriate cases subject to fulfillment of certain conditions. It has been observed in L. Chandra Kumar (supra) that the ‘judges of the latter category can never be considered full and effective substitutes for the superior judiciary in discharging function of constitutional interpretation’. We fully endorse the said view, but the question is whether they can be taken as substitutes of High Court Division. There is no doubt that the Tribunals in India cannot act as substitute of the High Courts and Supreme Court which have, it is observed under the constitutional set up been specifically entrusted with such obligation’. Reasons assigned by it is that the ‘constitution confers the power to strike down laws upon the High Courts and Supreme Court it also contains elaborate provisions dealing with......... though the tribunals created by Ordinary legislations cannot exercise the power of judicial review of legislative actions to the exclusion  of  the  High  Courts,  there  is  no constitutional prohibition against their performing a supplemental as apposed to a substitutional role....’<br/> <br/><strong>46.</strong>    Under the Act VII of 1981, there is provision for an appeal to the Administrative Appellate Tribunal with three members, the Chairman shall be a person who is or has been or is qualified to be a Judge of the Supreme Court, and of the two other members, one shall be a person who is or has been an officer in the rank of Joint Secretary and the other person who is or has been a District Judge, from an order or decision of the Tribunal. So practically the power of a Division Bench of the High Court Division has been given to the Administrative Appellate Tribunal. The composition of the appellate authority by including a high level administrative officer with specialised knowledge be better equipped besides the judicial officers to dispense with prompt justice. And it is expected that a judicious mix of judicial members and an experienced grass-root officer will serve the purpose effectively and speedily. On the contrary, there is no provision for appeal under the Indian Act of 1985 and the High Courts power of judicial review was ousted except the Supreme Court’s power under Article 136. So our provision is more comprehensive to some extent so far as it relates to creation of an appellate forum than that of the Indian except the power for issuing interim order by our Tribunal.<br/> <br/><strong>47.</strong>    We have almost four hundred thousand cases pending in the High Court Division. The docket is increasing day by day. If this trend continues one day it will not be exaggerated to say that the number will exceed one million in ten years. If this process is allowed, the administration of justice is bound to collapse and the peoples perception towards the judiciary will erode. This is not healthy for the administration of justice in a democratic country like ours. There may be excesses in the administration and politics and the Tribunal is set up to maintain equilibrium and check the excesses. To meet the above eventuality, it is high time to think over the matter and reduce the docket by decentralizing the power of the High Court Division and Tribunal’s power of alternative dispute resolution should be expanded through subordinate legislations.<br/> <br/><strong>48.</strong>    Part IX of our constitution contains the heading ‘The Services of Bangladesh’ and in proviso to article 133, the President has been given power to make Rules regulating  the  appointment  and  the  conditions  of service of persons in the service of Republic. Chapter II of this Part, there is an enabling provision in article 137 for ‘establishing one or more Public Service  Commissions  for  Bangladesh’.  In  Masder Hossain, this Court directed the government to make recruitment Rules regulating appointment in judicial service. It observed that the Services (Reorganization and Conditions) Act, 1975 have no application to the judicial service. In pursuance of this direction, the President has created the Bangladesh Judicial Service Commission by Promulgating Rules. The subordinate judiciary contains in Part-VI Chapter-II and Chapter III relates to Administrative Tribunal.<br/> <br/><strong>49.</strong>    As regards the powers and jurisdiction of our Administrative Tribunal section 4 says:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“(1) An Administrative Tribunal shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine applications made by any person in the service of the Republic (or of any statutory public authority in respect of the terms and conditions of his service including pension rights, or in respect of any action taken in relation to him as a person in the service of the Republic or of any statutory public authority).<br/>(2) A person in the service of the Republic (or of any statutory public authority) may make an application to an Administrative Tribunal under sub-section (1), if he is aggrieved by any order or decision in respect of the terms and conditions of his service including pension rights or by any action taken in relation to him as a person in the service of the Republic (or of any statutory public authority).<br/>Provided that no application in respect of an order, decision or action which can be set aside, varied or modified by a higher administrative authority under any law for the time being in force relating to the terms and conditions of the service of the Republic (or of any statutory public authority) or the discipline of that service can be made to the Administrative Tribunal until such higher authority has taken a decision on the matter:<br/>Provided further that, where no decision on an appeal or application for review in respect of an order, decision or action referred to in the preceding proviso has been taken by the higher administrative authority within a period of two months from the date on which the appeal or application was preferred or made, it shall, on the expiry of such period, be deemed, for the purpose of making an application to the Administrative Tribunals under this section, that such higher authority has disallowed the appeal or the application).<br/>Provided further that no such application shall be entertained by the Administrative Tribunal unless it is made within six months from the date of making or taking of the order, decision or action concerned or making of the decision on the matter by the higher administrative authority, as the case may be.<br/>(3)  In  this  section  “person  in  the service of the Republic (or of any statutory public authority)” includes a person who is or has retired or is dismissed, removed or discharged from such service but does not include a person in the defence services of Bangladesh (or of the Bangladesh Rifles).”<br/> <br/><strong>50.</strong>    Under our constitutional scheme, there is no doubt that the power of judicial review in respect of legislative action has not been conferred upon the Tribunal  by  subordinate  legislation.  As  observed above, it is the High Court Division which has been given the power under articles 7(2), 26, 44(1), 101 and 102(1) which read as follows:<br/>“7(2) This Constitution is, as the solemn expression of the will of the people, the supreme law of the Republic, and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void”.<br/>26(1) All existing law inconsistent with the provisions of this part shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, become void on commencement of the Constitution.<br/>(2)  The State shall not make any law inconsistent with any provisions of this part, and any law so made shall, to the extent of such inconsistency be void.<br/>(3).........................................” “44(1).The  right  to  move  the  High  Court Division in accordance with clause (1) of article 102, for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed.<br/>“101. The High Court Division shall have such original, appellate and other jurisdictions and powers as are conferred on it by this Constitution or any other law.”<br/>“102(1). The High Court Division on the application of any person aggrieved, may give such directions or orders to any person or authority, including any person performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic, as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of this Constitution.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>51.</strong>    If the right to move the High Court Division is guaranteed and this power having been conferred on the High Court Division by the constitution, it cannot be said that for enforcement of that right and as the right to judicial review under article 102(1) is a guaranteed one, if a citizen’s fundamental rights is infringed, the remedy for enforcement of that right is conferred by the constitution under article 102(1). Therefore, the exercise of this power by the High Court Division cannot be curtailed or taken away by the Parliament.<br/> <br/><strong>52.</strong>    Apparently a Tribunal created by an ordinary legislation or subordinate legislation cannot exercise the power of judicial review of legislative action. It is only the Supreme Court which is the creation of the constitution itself can exercise that power because this power has been given by constitution itself. If the entire scheme of the constitution is looked into, it will appear that the three organs of the State have been  created  by  the  constitution  of  which  the judiciary is headed by the Supreme Court, and the other  two  organs  are  the  Legislature  and  the Executive. These three organs are independent and not dependent on any other organ but in a unitary form of government, these three organs must work harmoniously with a view to avoiding any conflict in the administration of justice. Each organ, is therefore, supplementary to the other. Our Fore Fathers were conscious about the independence of judiciary and realizing any future encroachment over judiciary, they gave full independence to the Supreme Court in the administration of justice. This will be borne out from the following discussions.<br/> <br/><strong>53.</strong>    Clause (4) of article 94 says, the Chief Justice and other Judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. They cannot be removed by any provisions of subordinate legislation. The Supreme Court is a court of record. A law declared by the Appellate Division is binding on all courts and the decisions of the High Court Division are binding on all  courts  subordinate  to  it.  All  authorities, executive and judicial in the Republic shall act in aid of the Supreme Court. All staff of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the Chief Justice. The remuneration payable to the Judges of the Supreme Court shall be charged upon the Consolidated Fund and the remuneration, privileges and other terms and conditions  of  service  of  the  Judges  shall  be determined by Act of Parliament. These are the safeguards of the Judges of the Supreme Court for discharging  their duties  and responsibilities independently.<br/> <br/><strong>54.</strong>    The Judges are under obligation to subscribe an oath as per provisions of article 148 in accordance with the ‘Third Schedule’. Article 148 speaks of subscribing  an  oath  by  all  constitutional  office holders as soon as he enters upon the office. In accordance with this provision the President, the Prime  Minister,  the  Speaker,  the  members  of Parliament, the Election Commissioners and other constitutional holders of office have to subscribe oaths. But the oath of a Judge is some what different from other constitutional office holders. Judges have to subscribe an oath to “Preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the laws of Bangladesh”. In respect of other holders of constitutional posts they are not required to subscribe an oath to defend ‘the laws’. They have to subscribe oath to ‘preserve, protect and defend the constitution’. So, the Judges of the highest Court are defenders of the ‘law’ and the ‘constitution’.   ‘Law’   according   to   the constitution means ‘any Act, Ordinance, Order, Rule, Regulation, Bye law, Notification or other legal instruments, and any customs or usage, having the force of law’.<br/> <br/><strong>55.</strong>    Therefore, it is the Supreme Court alone which is empowered to examine whether or not any law is inconsistent with the constitution. The Parliament has given the legislative power under article 65 to promulgate law but this power is circumscribed by limitations and if it exercises any power which is inconsistent with the constitution, it is the Supreme Court which being the custodian of the constitution and is manned by the Judges who are oath bound to protect the law to examine in this regards. The Supreme Court is the only organ of the State to see that any law is in consonance with the constitution. So, where the constitution confers the power upon the Supreme Court to strike down laws, if found inconsistent, such power cannot be delegated to a Tribunal created under subordinate legislation. In the alternative, the Supreme Court cannot delegate its power of judicial review of legislative action to a Tribunal. It is only on the principle that the donee of a limited power cannot, by the exercise of that very  power,  convert  the  limited  power  into  an unlimited one or in the alternative a delegatee cannot exercise same or more power than the delegator.<br/> <br/><strong>56.</strong>    Let us look at the powers that can be conferred upon the Supreme Court. Article 101 states that the High Court Division shall have the original, appellate and other jurisdictions and powers as are conferred on it by the constitution or any other law. So, apart from the constitution, the Parliament can confer any other power upon the High  Court  Division  by subordinate legislation. There is no doubt about it. Similarly as to the powers of the Appellate Division, sub-clause (c) of clause (2) of article 103 provides that if  the  High  Court  Division  “has  imposed punishment of a person for contempt of that Division; and in such other cases as may be provided by Act of Parliament” an appeal shall lie as of right. I am of the view that the Framers ought to have included the latter part of sub-clause (c), such as, “and in such other  cases  as  may  be  provided  for  by  Act  of Parliament” by a separate sub-clause because the empowerment of these two powers conflict each other. This will be evident if we consider the Bengali version in sub-clause (N) which says “উক্ত বিভাগের অবমাননার জন্য কোন ব্যক্তিকে দন্ডদান করিয়াছেন’’; and in the next sentence it is said “এবং সংসদে আইন-দ্বারা যেরূপ বিধান করা হইবে সেরূপ অন্যান্য একত্রে” This Bengali version is more clear and accurate than the English version and this version will prevail over the English version. The first part of the clause says about the power of contempt and the other part relates to the conferment of powers by Parliament upon this Court. So, there is no nexus between these two.<br/> <br/><strong>57.</strong>    If we compare the constitutional provisions between ours and the Indian, the Indian one is more comprehensive than ours so far as it relates to making of interim orders in urgent cases with a view to preserving the subject matter of the litigation in <em>status-quo </em>for the time being. Such order is necessary for   equitable considerations and it is an extraordinary relief, which is normally granted in accordance with reasons and sound judicial principles. It is not a grace or on default of any person. It is passed in the interest of justice and it is necessary in order to prevent the abuse of the process of law, or to prevent wastage or to maintain the situation as on date or from recurrence of certain incident which were existing as on the date presenting such application.<br/> <br/><strong>58.</strong>    Under the Indian provision as opposed to our provision, article 245 under the heading ‘Distribution of Legislative Powers’ provides extent of laws to be made by Parliament and by Legislatures of the States. Article 246 which contains in the same Chapter relates to ‘Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and by that Legislatures of States.’ Clause (1) is relevant for our consideration which provides “notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3), Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the <u>matters enumerated in List 1 in the Seventh Schedule</u> (in this constitution referred to as “Union list”) (emphasis supplied). In the Seventh Schedule, Entry No.77 under the heading “Constitution and Jurisdiction   of   Courts”-   list   are:   (a)   the jurisdiction and powers of the courts are several entries; Entry No.77, List 1; of the Supreme Court relating to any matter. Entry No.95, List 1, of all courts other than the Supreme Court, relating to any matter in this List 1, Entry 65 List 2; of all courts other than Supreme Court relating to any matter in List 2 have been included. Article 246 deals with legislative powers of the Legislatures of the Union and the States with reference to the different Lists in  the  Seventh  Schedule.  So,  there  is  specific provision in the constitution of India itself enabling the Parliament to add, confer or delete the powers of the Supreme Court as well as of the High Courts.<br/> <br/><strong>59.</strong>    Under our provisions, the President has power to promulgate any Ordinance under Article 93 if the Parliament is dissolved or is not in session. Apart from  this  legislative  power,  the  Parliament  can delegate its power under the proviso to clause (1) of article 65 by Act of Parliament, to make Orders, Rules,  Regulations,  Bye-laws  or  other  instruments having  legislative  effect.  At  any  event,  the Parliament has the power to invest the power from time to time upon both the Divisions of the Supreme Court by subordinate legislation but this conferment of power cannot supersede the constitutional powers conferred upon this Court. Similarly, the Parliament by this legislative powers cannot take away the powers of both the Divisions of the Supreme Court which are invested on it by the constitution. As discussed above, under article 44, the Parliament may empower any court other than the High Court Division within its local limits of jurisdiction “to exercise all or any of those powers” i.e. the powers that are being exercisable by the High Court Division under the fundamental rights Part.<br/> <br/><strong>60.</strong>    As observed above, though the Parliament has been given wide power to invest upon any court of those powers of the High Court Division, it cannot give all powers to any Court or Tribunal similar to those given by the constitution upon the High Court Division over which I have discussed above. It can be done by a constitutional amendment but then also, the question will arise as to whether the right to move the High Court Division being one of the basic feature of the constitution,  the  Parliament  cannot  delegate  such power by setting up a parallel Tribunal with powers equal to those of the High Court Division. This will be hit by ‘basic feature’ doctrine and it will be beyond the amending powers of the Parliament under article 142 of the constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>61.</strong>    In Mujibur Rahman, this Court held that the Administrative Tribunal is not in addition to the courts described in Chapters 1 and III of the Constitution. It, however, observed that the Tribunal or Appellate Tribunal cannot be construed as a forum substitute or co-equal of the High Court Division. Taking the language used in article 44(2), I am of the view that if the original constitution empowers the Parliament to give power to a Court or Tribunal all (of course subject to limitation) or any of the powers of the High Court Division, why not it can empower ‘alternative power’ to the Tribunal as opposed to ‘substitutional’ as observed by the Supreme Court of India. But in no case, it can be treated as co-equal to the High Court Division to deal with all matters in respect of the terms and conditions of persons in the service  of  the  Republic,  including  the  matters provided in Part IX, that is to say, the services of Bangladesh. However, we are unable to endorse the views taken by the Supreme Court of India in L. Chandra  Kumar  (Supra)  that  “The  Tribunals  are competent to hear matters where vires of statutory provisions are questioned’.<br/> <br/><strong>62.</strong>    In India as noticed above, its constitution was amended by inserting articles 323A and 323B providing a  separate  forum  of  creation  of  Administrative Tribunals prohibiting the power of judicial review of its decisions except the Supreme Court under Article 32 in respect of disputes and complaints referred to in clause (a) of article 323A or any of the matters specified in clause (2) in article 323B. The power of judicial review conferred on the High Courts under articles 226/227 of the constitution has been given by the Supreme Court only in respect of matters relating to legislative actions by a Division Bench in L. Chandra Kumar (supra).<br/> <br/><strong>63.</strong>    The Administrative Tribunals of India have been given the power under section 24 to make interim orders but such power cannot be exercised unless “(a) copies of such application and of all documents in support of plea for such interim order are furnished to any party against whom such application is made are proposed to be made and (b) opportunity is given to such party to be heard in the matter. A proviso is added therein empowering the Tribunal to dispense with the above conditions and may make an interim order as exceptional measure if it is satisfied, for reasons to be recorded in writing and that “it is necessary so to do  for  preventing  any  loss  being  caused  to  the applicant which cannot be adequately compensated in money but any such interim order shall, if it is not sooner vacated, cease to have effect on the expiry of a period of fourteen days from the date on which it is made unless the said requirements have been complied with ..........”<br/> <br/><strong>64.</strong>    Under our Administrative Tribunals Act, the powers have been given to the Administrative Tribunal under section 4 to hear and determine applications made by any person in the service of Republic or of any statutory public authority in respect of the terms and  conditions of his service including persons right or in respect of any action taken in relation to him as a person in the service of Republic or of any public authority. So, the Tribunal can adjudicate upon in relation to only terms and conditions of service of any  public  servant  or  of  any  statutory  public authority. Though an exclusive jurisdiction has been invested upon the Tribunal, it has no power to nullifying any law, rules or regulations. The Tribunal has been given limited power in the relation to those mentioned in sub-section (1) of section 4. Therefore, this Court has rightly held in Mujibur Rahman that the Tribunal cannot strike down any law or rule on the ground of its constitutionality.<br/> <br/><strong>65.</strong>    In Mujibur Rahman, it is observed that “the right of judicial review under Article 102(1) is neither a fundamental right nor a guaranteed one. And the right of judicial review is neither an all-remedy nor a remedy falls or wrongs. It is available only when “no other equally efficacious remedy is provided by law”. With due respect, these observations have been made unconsciously and therefore, we are unable to approve the same. The right of judicial review under article 102(1) is a guaranteed one which is embodied in the constitution itself, but if that right is not guaranteed, even if a citizen’s fundamental right is infringed, he will be left with no remedy at all. True, article 102(1) has not been retained in the fundamental rights chapter as has been kept in India but  in  view  of  article  44(1),  it  is  akin  to fundamental right. Similarly the observation that the enforcement of fundamental right is available only when ‘no other equally efficacious remedy is provided by law’ is also not a correct view, inasmuch as, whenever there is infringement of fundamental rights, any person can move the High Court Division for judicial review of the administrative action under Article 102(1). The question of equally efficacious remedy arises only when it will exercise power under article 102(2) i.e. writ of certiorari and other writs mentioned in sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (2). If there is an alternative remedy, the High Court Division’s  power  is  debarred.  It  is  only  in exceptional cases, it can exercise this power.<br/> <br/><strong>66.</strong>    Under clause (2) of article 102, a citizen cannot invoke judicial review of legislative action. Judicial review under this clause is not available if there is ‘any other equally efficacious remedy’ is provided by law. Mostafa Kamal J. rightly observed in the last sentence in paragraph 77 that this power of judicial review of legislative action is exclusively preserved to the High Court Division under article 102(1).<br/> <br/><strong>67.</strong>    In  Anwar  Hossain  Chowdhury  V.  Bangladesh,  41 DLR(AD) 165, this Court by majority held that the power to amend the constitution is there in the constitution itself. An amendment of the constitution is not a grund-norm because it has to be according to the method provided in the constitution. “Total abrogation of the constitution, which is meant by destruction of its basic structure, cannot be comprehended by Constitution”. It observed, ‘call it by any name ‘basic feature’ or whatever but that is the fabric of the constitution which cannot be dismantled by an authority created by the constitution itself-namely   the   Parliament.   Necessarily,   the amendment passed by the Parliament is to be tested as against article 7, because the amending power is but a power given by the constitution to Parliament; it is a higher power than any other given by the Constitution to Parliament but nevertheless it is a power within and not outside the constitution’.<br/> <br/><strong>68.</strong>    In Khondker Delwar Hossain V. Bangladesh Italian Marble Works, 62 DLR(AD) 298, this Court held in paragraph 231 that “the framers of the constitution made the right to move the Supreme Court of Bangladesh for enforcement of fundamental rights itself a fundamental right”. In that case this court approved the views taken in Anwar Hossain (Supra).<br/> <br/><strong>69.</strong>    In Siddique Ahmed V. Bangladesh, 65 DLR(AD)8, this Court held that all laws, Rules, Regulations and Orders in whatever terms those are named must conform to the words of the constitution and any such laws which is inconsistent with the constitution to the extent of the inconsistency is void and non-est in the eye  of  law.  It  was  further  observed  that  the Parliament can make any law but within the bounds of the constitution which is the embodiment of the will of the people and it can also rectify any Ordinance made by a lawfully elected President following a proper and lawful procedure. This case relates to the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1986, which was added in paragraph 19 of the Fourth Schedule of the constitution. This court declared the said Act unconstitutional.<br/> <br/><strong>70.</strong>    There is thus no gainsaying the fact that if the vires of any law is challenged notwithstanding ouster of the jurisdiction of the High Court Division by an Act of Parliament, the High Court Division has power of judicial review to examine the constitutionality of the law. In this connection this Court in Shaheda Khatun V. Administrative Appellate Tribunal, 3 BLC(AD) 155, modified the dictum in Mujibur Rahman observing that “Mujibur Rahman’s case is not only case which defines the writ jurisdiction of the High Court Division. We regret to say that the Appellate Tribunal seems to be totally unaware of settled law that notwithstanding ouster of the jurisdiction of the High Court Division by any legislative provision or even under article 102 itself the High Court Division is yet entitled to exercise its power of judicial review under Article 102 if the action complained of before the High Court Division is found to be <em>coram non judice, </em>without jurisdiction or taken malafide.’ This view has been taken following the cases in Ehtesham Uddin V. Bangladesh, 33 DLR (AD) 154, Ismail Hoque V. Bangladesh, 34 DLR (AD) 125, Mostaque Ahmed V. Bangladesh, 34 DLR (AD) 222 and Helal Uddin Ahmed V. Bangladesh, 45 DLR(AD)1.<br/> <br/><strong>71.    </strong>We are unable to endorse views taken in ShahedaKhatun because hte cases in Ehtesham Uddin, Ismail Hoque, Mostaque Ahmed and Helal Uddin Ahmed were decided  on  different  premises  and  context.  The principle of law propounded in those cases cannot be applicable in respect of service matters. In those cases, the issues were whether despite specific bar to challenge the orders and conviction by the Tribunals created under the Martial Law Proclamations, Martial Law Regulations and Martial Law Orders, the High Court Division can examine the legality of the decisions or in  the  alternative,  judicial  review  is  available against  decisions  of  Tribunals  created  under  the Martial Law Proclamations. The writ petitions were filed in the nature of writ of certiorari to quash the judgments. Even there was specific bar ousting the jurisdiction  of  the  High  Court  Division,  it  was observed in Helaluddin Ahmed that under three eventualities, that is to say, even in the purported exercise of those powers do not have the effect of validating acts done <em>corum non judice </em>or without jurisdiction or malafide, the High Court Division can examine the legality of the judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>72.</strong>    In Ehteshamuddin, the question was in spite of ouster of jurisdiction, in a <em>writ of certiorai, </em>the High Court Division can examine the legality of the order. It was observed that in appropriate cases ‘the court’s power to examine the proceedings has not been taken away. Since it has been conceded by the learned Attorney General that when a proceeding or an action taken under Martial Law Regulation is challenged on the ground of want of jurisdiction or malafide, the superior court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction is competent  to  make  it  necessary  to  discuss  this question at length.’<br/> <br/><strong>73.</strong>    In Jamil Huq, this Court by majority while considering the power of judicial review of the High Court Division observed that ‘The writ jurisdiction will be attracted if the proceedings are <em>coram non judice  </em>or  malafide.  If  the  court  is  constituted properly and the offence is cognizable then the proceedings of such court cannot be interfered, with on the ground of procedural irregularities’. In that case, the writ petitioner was convicted by the Court Martial on the charge of mutiny under the Army Act, 1952. In Mostaque Ahmed, he was convicted by the Special Martial Law Court. He challenged his conviction unsuccessfully in the High Court Division. This Court in the context observed that the earlier views taken in such cases are that ‘the malafide or coram non judice proceedings are not immune from the scrutiny of the Supreme Court notwithstanding any ouster clause by Martial Law Proclamations’.<br/> <br/><strong>74.    </strong>It is apt to observe here that this Court in Shaheda Khatun has unconsciously approved the views taken in those cases while deciding an issue as to whether in presence of an Administrative Tribunal created under article 117(2) read with article 44(2), the decision of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal is amenable to the writ jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of the High Court Division has been ousted by clause (5) of article 102 read with article 117(2) and the Tribunal has been created in exercise of powers under article 117(2) with powers that are exercisable by it in accordance with article 44(2) read with article 117(1) of the constitution. How then the High Court Division can exercise its power of judicial review of the administrative actions. That’s too, in presence of appellate forum and this Court’s power to examine the legality of the Appellate Tribunal’s decision under article 103. These points have not been considered and addressed in Shaheda Khatun (supra) and unconsciously this court made those observations.<br/> <br/><strong>75.</strong>    In  Khalilur  Rahman  V.  Md.  Kamrul  Ahasan,  11 MLR (AD) 5, the question arose as to whether the High Court  Division  is  competent  to  entertain  a  writ petition since the Administrative Tribunal does not possess the power of granting ad-interim relief and since the disposal of the case and the appeal will take long time, by which time, the mischief will be done. This Court taking consideration of sub-section (1) of section 4 of the Administrative Tribunals Act held that the Administrative Tribunals Act does not authorize the Administrative Tribunal or the Administrative Appellate Tribunal to pass any ad- interim order restraining the government or other functionaries from taking any action relating to the terms and conditions of service of the Republic or any statutory authority while the case has been filed by a person. We have held earlier that even without challenging the vires of law, the High Court Division has jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition on limited ground if there is violation of fundamental rights in view of article 44(1) of the constitution. This point has totally been over looked by this Court in Khalilur Rahman.<br/> <br/><strong>76.</strong>    In Khalilur Rahman (Supra), this court observed that a public servant may out of desperation or just for taking a sportive chance in the summary writ jurisdiction alleged contravention of some fundamental  rights which may turn out to be frivolous or vexatious or not even remotely attracted in the case. The court, it is observed, however, is on guard in such attempt that the great value of the rights given under article 102(1)  is  not  frittered  away  or  misused  as  a substitute for more appropriate remedy available for an unlawful action involving no infringement of any fundamental rights. It further observed that a person in the service of the Republic who intends to invoke fundamental rights for challenging the vires of law or a relief by way of striking down of a particular law on the ground of its constitutionality, writ petition under article 102(1) can be maintained. In the alternative, a person in the service of the Republic can file a writ petition on limited grounds. In other cases, he will be required to seek remedy under Article 117(2).   So, this Court did not altogether oust the jurisdiction of the High Court Division, rather  in  appropriate  cases  it  may  exercise  its jurisdiction.<br/> <br/><strong>77.</strong>    However, it took the view that since the Administrative   Tribunal   or   the   Administrative Appellate Tribunal has no power to pass any interim order relating to terms and conditions of a person in the service of the Republic or of any statutory public authority, in the absence of any power to pass any interim order, though the Tribunal refused the prayer for  interim  order,  the  applicant  ought  to  have preferred an appeal, if so advised, but instead, he moved  the  High  Court  Division  in  its  writ jurisdiction, which is not maintainable. What we find from the above observations made in paragraph 13 that the court impliedly said the Tribunal has power to make such order in appropriate cases but the applicant has chosen the wrong forum. So far the observation as to the interference of the judgment of the High Court Division  is  correct  view  but  we  are  unable  to subscribe the view that the Tribunal cannot pass any interim order.<br/> <br/><strong>78.</strong>    We want to make in this connection that except on the limited scope challenging the vires of law or if there is violation of fundamental rights, the power of the High Court Division is totally ousted under clause (5) of article 102 read with article 117(2). If a public servant or an employee of statutory corporation wants to invoke his fundamental rights in connection with his terms and conditions of service, he must lay foundation in the petition of the violation of the fundamental rights by sufficient pleadings in support of the claim. It will not suffice if he makes evasive statement of violation of his fundamental rights or that by making stray statements that the order is discriminatory or malafide. A malafide action or act is a disputed question of fact and law, and the Tribunal is, therefore, competent enough to decide the question of malafide or collusion or arbitrariness in taking the decision. The expression ‘malafide’ has a definite significance in the legal phraseology and the same cannot emanate out of fanciful imagination or even apprehensions but there must be existing definite evidence  of  bias  and  actions  which  cannot  be attributed to be otherwise bonafide, however, by themselves would not amount to be malafide unless the same is accompanied with some other facts which would depict a bad motive or intent on the part of the authority and the same cannot be decided in summarily proceedings in writ jurisdiction.<br/> <br/><strong>79.</strong>    Similarly if an order is said to be without jurisdiction or is contrary to law, the appropriate course open to the applicant is to plead to the Tribunal with such plea and ask for vacating the order or action. It is altogether within the tenor of the Tribunal. <em>Coram non Judice </em>is a Latin phrase which means ‘not in the presence of a judge’. It is a legal term typically used to indicate a legal proceeding held without a judge, with improper venue such as before a court which lacks the authority to hear and decide  a  case  in  question,  or  without  proper Jurisdiction. I find no cogent ground why the Tribunal cannot deal with these issues for the reasons assigned above. Mere superficial pleadings on the point of fundamental rights will not confer any power on the High Court Division in respect of the terms and conditions of service.<br/> <br/><strong>80.</strong>    The observations made in Shaheda Khatun (supra) that if the action complained as is found to be <em>coram non judice, </em>without jurisdiction or malafide, the judicial  review  is  available  are  based  on  the decisions on different premises and the said views cannot be applicable in service matters in presence of an alternative forum, and this forum is created as per provisions of the constitution. It is to be borne in mind that no case can be an authority on facts. The Tribunal is created as an ‘alternative’ forum of the High Court Division in respect of specific purposes. If any administrative action is found without jurisdiction or <em>coram non judice </em>or malafide, the Tribunal is competent to deal with the same and adjudicate these issues satisfactorily. These issues are within its constituents of the Administrative Tribunal. If the order complained of was passed by an officer who is not competent to make such order, the order would be without jurisdiction. If the Rules provide for the constitution of a domestic tribunal with  designated  persons  but  the  tribunal  was constituted by persons not authorized by the Rules, the action would be <em>coram non judice</em>. If the decision is taken malafide out of vengeance or with motive to take revenge, in all those cases the Tribunal can strike down the action taken against the applicant. Article 117(1)(a) specifically provides that the Tribunal  can  exercise  jurisdiction  in  respect  of matters relating to ‘the terms and conditions of persons ......’ Section 4(1) of the Act of 1980 was also couched with the similar language. The language used in those provisions are so wide enough to come to the conclusion that the Tribunal is competent to deal with those issues. The Tribunal has been given all power relating to the terms and conditions of service and therefore, there is no reason to restrict the powers of the Tribunal by judicial pronouncement. These matters are within the powers of the Tribunal and therefore, if a public servant wants to challenge the actions as above under article 102(1), it will be barred under clause (2) of Article 117.<br/> <br/><strong>81.    </strong>Let us now consider the cases referred by the parties. In Junnur Rahman V. BSRS, 51 DLR(AD)166, the writ petitioner, a senior principal officer of Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangsta challenged a circular containing promotion criteria of BSRS and an office order promoting some other persons to the post of Assistant General Manager superseding him. The High Court  Division  found  no  violation  of  fundamental rights of the writ petitioner under articles 27 and 29 of the constitution and rejected the writ petition as was  not  maintainable.  This  Court  maintained  the judgment of the High Court Division on the view that the writ petitioner did not seek to enforce any fundamental rights, and therefore, it was within the competence to the Administrative Tribunal to entertain the  grievance  of  the  writ  petitioner.  In  Delwar Hossain Mia V. Bangladesh, 52 DLR(AD)120, it has been held that a person in the service of the Republic who intends to invoke fundamental rights for challenging the vires of a law will seek his remedy under article 102(1) but in all other cases, he will be required to seek remedy under Article 117.<br/> <br/><strong>82.</strong>    In Government of Bangladesh V. Md. Abdul Halim Mia, 9 MLR(AD)105, it was observed that the right of judicial  review  under  article  102(2)  of  the constitution is neither a fundamental right nor a guaranteed right. It has further observed that the judicial review of an administrative action is neither an all weather remedy nor a remedy for all wrongs but is only available when there is no other equally efficacious remedy. The question of enforcement of fundamental rights is not available in the case as the question   involved   in   the   decision   was   mere clarifications of the Rules for giving effect thereto, and therefore, the assumption of jurisdiction under article 102(2) of the constitution for ventilating certain grievance regarding terms and conditions of service of the writ petitioner has never been contemplated. It, however, found no fundamental rights involved in the case. This case does not help the appellants.<br/> <br/><strong>83.    </strong>In Secretary Ministry of Establishment V. Shafi Uddin Ahmed, 2 MLR(AD) 257, a writ petition was filed challenging  the  promotion  to  the  post  of  Joint Secretary breaking the seniority. The writ petition was moved on the principle of violation of the fundamental rights, inasmuch as, according to him there was discrimination in considering his case. The High Court Division made the rule absolute. This Court did not interfere with the judgment of the High Court Division  on  the  reasonings  that  the  High  Court Division struck down some paragraphs of impugned notifications as ultra vires articles 27 and 29 of the constitution holding that these notifications had the force of law. This Court further held that the writ petitioners invoked article 44(1) of the constitution and the petition was filed for enforcement of fundamental  rights  and  that  the  Administrative Tribunal has no power to strike down an order for infringement of fundamental rights or any other law and that the right to move the High Court Division under article 102(1) for enforcement of fundamental rights is a fundamental right itself and is guaranteed by under Article 44(1) and has been recognized and that the right of judicial review under article 102(2) is neither a fundamental right nor a guaranteed one.<br/> <br/><strong>84.</strong>    In Shamsun Nahar Begum V. Secretary Ministry of Health  and  Family  Welfare,  3  MLR(AD)68,  a  writ petition challenging the order of transfer of the writ petitioner. The High Court Division rejected the writ petition summarily. This Court maintained the judgment holding   that   the   writ   petitioner’s   job   was transferable, and therefore, such action relates to the terms and conditions of service. The writ petition was barred under article 117(2). The views taken by this Court is based on sound principle. No writ petition is maintainable challenging any action of the authority transferring a government servant from one station to other station, inasmuch as, it being an administrative action for the purpose of proper administration of the department-this relates to the terms and conditions of the service and the remedy, if there be any, lies with the Administrative Tribunal.<br/> <br/><strong>85.</strong>    In Bangladesh V. Mahabubuddin Ahmed, 3 MLR(AD) 121, this Court held that the dismissal of service of an employee of the Republic relates to its terms and conditions of his service. In that case the writ petitioner  was  dismissed  from  the  service  under Martial Law Order No.9 of 1982. He challenged the said order  before  the  Administrative  Tribunal  which dismissed the case and an appeal from its decision was also dismissed. He then filed the writ petition and the High Court Division made the rule absolute. It was observed that the matter being one relating to the terms and conditions of service, the jurisdiction of the High Court Division has been excluded and that the grounds taken in the order of dismissal were such as fully cognizable by the Administrative Tribunal.<br/> <br/><strong>86.    </strong>In Government of Bangladesh V.  Member Administrative Tribunal, 6 MLR (AD) 181,  a  police officer  challenged  an  order  of  his  compulsory retirement under section 9(2) of the Public Servants (Retirement) Act, 1974 before the Administrative Tribunal which upon hearing the parties set aside the order and directed for re-instatement of the officer with  benefits  admissible  to  him.  The  government without challenging the said judgment before the Administrative  Appellate  Tribunal,  moved  a  writ petition in the High Court Division. The High Court Division was of the view that writ petition was not maintainable in view of clause (2) of Article 117 of the constitution. This Court maintained the judgment of the High Court Division holding that there was hardly any ground to saying the correctness of the views taken by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/><strong>87.</strong>    In  Bangladesh  V.  A.K.M.  Enayet  Ullah,  11 BLC(AD)2001, the respondent challenged an order of his retirement by a writ petition before the High Court Division. The High Court Division made the rule absolute. This Court interferes with the judgment of the High Court Division holding that the respondent was a government servant and his remedy was available before the Administrative Tribunal. The order of retirement  was  in  violation  of  the  terms  and conditions of the service, and therefore, the writ petition was not maintainable.<br/> <br/><strong>88.</strong>    In  Government  of  Bangladesh  V.  M.  Salauddin Talukder, 15 BLT (AD) 60, the respondent Salauddin Talukder moved the High Court Division by a writ petition challenging his transfer order as Appraiser of Customs and also section 8 of Act XX of 2000 by which the government made different grades equivalent to each other inter- changeable and inter-transferable on the ground that his seniority was affected. The High Court Division made the rule absolute. This Court held that the classification made under section 8 of Act XX of 2000 based on distinctive characteristic of the respective class of officers could not be assailed of on the ground of violation of articles 27 and 31 of the Constitution. The post of Inspector, Appraiser, Preventive Officer and Intelligence Officer were previously third class posts and subsequently they were made second class posts, and therefore, the appointing authority has transferred the respondent as an Inspector. Accordingly, this Court held that the respondent’s fundamental rights have not been violated or  infringed  and  the  writ  petition  was  not maintainable in view of article 117(2) of the constitution. It was further held that the right to move the High Court Division under article 102(1) of the constitution is guaranteed under article 44(1) but a right of judicial review under article 102(2) is  neither a fundamental right nor a guaranteed right one.<br/> <br/><strong>89.</strong>    In Delwar Hossain Mollah V. Bangladesh, 15 BLT(AD) 124, the writ petitioner was appointed as Thana Live Stock Officer on Ad-hoc basis. He along with some other officers of the same department challenged some Rules of Bangladesh Civil Service Examination for Promotion Rules, 1986 on the ground that they were discrimi-natory and  violative  of  their  fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 26, 27, 29(1) and 31 of  the  Constitution.  The  High  Court  Division discharged the rule.<br/> <br/><strong>90.</strong>    In Md. Shamsul Islam Khan V. Secretary,  8 BLT(AD)64, this Court held that a government servant who intends to challenge the vires of law on the ground of violation of fundamental rights may seek remedy under article 102 of the Constitution but in all other cases his remedy lies before the Administrative Tribunal under Article 117(2) thereof. In that case writ petition filed by the appellant was found not maintainable. In TNT Board V. Md. Shafiul Alam,  8  BLT(AD)  225,  this  Court  held  that  the respondent being an employee of the Telegraph and Telephone Department, a government employee, and therefore, the High Court Division lacks its jurisdiction  to  interfere  with  the  action  taken against him removing him from service. This Court rejected the respondent’s prayer for doing complete justice on the reasoning that such prayer cannot be upheld because the High Court Division which lacks jurisdiction  in  the  matter  cannot  give  him  such relief.<br/> <br/><strong>91.</strong>    In Government of Bangladesh V. Abdul Halim, 13 BLT(AD) 120, this Court held that the judicial review under article 102(2) of the constitution is neither a fundamental right nor a guaranteed right. Similarly ‘the judicial review of an administrative action is neither an all weather remedy nor a remedy for all wrongs but is only available when there is no other efficacious remedy’ and that since there was no infringement of fundamental rights guaranteed under articles 27 and 29 of the Constitution, the writ petition was not maintainable.<br/> <br/><strong>92.</strong>    The next question is whether in the absence of power of the Tribunal to pass any interim order, the judicial review of the administrative action is available in the High Court Division if the action complained of is found acted upon during the pendency of the case before the Tribunal. Clause (b) of section 2 of the Act defines “Tribunal” which means ‘the Administrative Tribunal or Administrative Appellate Tribunal established under this Act.’ The constitution of the Tribunal has been provided under section 3 as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Establishment of Administrative Tribunals-(1) The Government may, by notification   in   the   official   Gazette, establish one or more Administrative Tribunals for the purpose of this Act.<br/>(2)  When  more  than  one Administrative Tribunal is established, the Government shall, by notification in the official Gazette, specify the area within which each Tribunal shall exercise jurisdiction.<br/>(3)  An  administrative  Tribunal  shall consist of one member who shall be appointed by the Government from among persons who are or have been District Judges.<br/>(4)  A  member  of  an  Administrative Tribunal shall hold office on such terms and conditions as the Government may determine.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>93.</strong>       In sub-section (3) it is provided that the member of the Tribunal is among persons who are or have been District Judges. The expression ‘District Judge’ has been described in the Civil Courts Act, 1887 as a senior most judicial officer of Civil Courts. In the classification of ‘Courts’ under the Civil Courts Act, clause (a) provides, ‘the Court of District Judge’ i.e. it is a court. Section 18 provides the ordinary jurisdiction of the District Judge which says: save as otherwise provided by an enactment for the time being in force, the jurisdiction of the District Judge..........’ Here also the expression ‘District Judge’ is used. Again under section 21, it has been provided:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(1)        Save as aforesaid, an appeal from a decree or order of a joint District Judge shall lie – (a) to a District Judge where the value of the original suit in which...............’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>94.</strong>       So, according to Civil Courts Act, the office of  the ‘District Judge’ is a Civil Court and not a <em>persona designata</em>. Similar question arose in Ruhul Amin V. District Judge, 38 DLR(AD) 172. In that case the question was whether a revision or a writ petition will lie in the High Court Division against a judgment passed by an Election Tribunal constituted under the Local Government (Union Parishad) Ordinance, 1983. In sub-section (3) of section 29, it is provided “the decision of the Election Tribunal on an election petition shall be final and shall not be called in question in or before any court”. Under the law the Election  Tribunal  was  composed  of  by  a  judicial officer.  By  an  amendment  of  the  Ordinance,  an appellate forum was created by Ordinance XLIV of 1984. By this amendment, there is a provision to prefer an appeal  to  the  ‘District  Judge’  within  whose jurisdiction the election petition in dispute was held and the decision of the ‘District Judge’ on such appeal shall be final.<br/> <br/><strong>95.</strong>       It has been held in Ruhul Amin (supra) that “the conclusion depends upon the decision regarding the nature of District Judge’s function, that is, whether the District Judge, in passing the impugned order, was exercising powers of a Court or acting as <em>persona designata</em>? ........if he was exercising the powers of a Court in deciding a dispute he was found to be subordinate to the High Court but if he was acting in his personal capacity that is, as a <em>persona designata</em>, he was not amenable to the jurisdiction of the High Court. The dispute in civil nature, judicial officers who decide civil disputes have been empowered to decide election disputes. Procedure for holding the trial of such disputes is the same as that of an Ordinary Civil Court being constituted by munsifs and empowered to decide election disputes relating to right to office, after taking evidence and hearing arguments, both on facts and law, are definitely exercising judicial powers, and not administrative powers, though it may be that they are constituted by the Election Commission, an executive authority’.<br/> <br/><strong>96.</strong>       About  the  constitution  of  the  Administrative Tribunal,  section  3(3)  says  ‘An  Administrative Tribunal shall consist of one member who shall be appointed by the Government from among persons who are or have been District Judges’. Section 5 provides the constitution  of  the  Appellate  Tribunal  with  one Chairman and two members and ‘the Chairman shall be a person who is, or has been or is qualified to be a Judge of the Supreme Court, and of two other  members....... the other person who is or has been a District Judges.’ Section 7 provides for the powers and procedure of the Tribunal. Sub-section (1) of section 7 provides that the Tribunal shall have “all powers of a Civil Court, while trying a suit under the Code of Civil Procedure”. Sub-section (2) says “any proceedings before the Tribunal shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 of the Penal Code”.<br/> <br/><strong>97.</strong>       So in all practical purposes the Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal is exercising powers of a civil court and disposing of Civil disputes determining the terms and conditions of service, that is to say, the right to his office, privileges promotion including pension rights. The Tribunal has power to substitute the heirs in case of death of the applicant. The Tribunal has been given the power under section 7B to amend the pleadings. Again in section 8(2), it is provided  that  the  decision  of  the  Administrative Tribunal be binding upon the parties, that is, the government. Again in section 10A, it is provided that the Administrative Appellate Tribunal has power to punish for contempt of its authority or that of the Administrative Tribunal, as if it were the High Court Division of the Supreme Court’. The language used in Section 10A is self explanatory that the Tribunal has been created as an ‘alternative’ forum of the High Court Division in respect of matters mentioned above. It can also initiate execution proceeding for enforcement of the judgment. Therefore, the Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal has all the trappings of a Civil Court.<br/> <br/><strong>98.</strong>          Suppose a gradation list has been published by any department of the government for promotion to the next higher post. The aggrieved employee filed objection to the authority for correction of the gradation list. The  authority  overlooked  the  objection  and  had proceeded with the promotion process of some junior officers and proceeded with filling up all posts supreseding the senior officer. He filed a petition to the Administrative Tribunal after complying with all formalities. Could it be said that the Tribunal will be powerless to pass any interim order even in such blatant violation of the law? In that event, the junior officer would become senior to him and will get all benefits if the promotion is acted upon. The disposal of the case before the Tribunal, the appeal, and then a leave petition will take years together. In the meantime, the aggrieved officer may attain superannuation. He will be deprived of his promotion, financial benefits and status. At the fag end of his career, the authority will say, since he has attained superannuation, the cause of action for filing the case does not exist. Would the Tribunal in such eventuality be a silent spectator for technical reason and avoid its responsibility for doing justice to the aggrieved officer?<br/> <br/><strong>99.</strong>       In some departments of the government, Rules have been framed for promotion, transfer, deputation etc. providing the criteria of transfer of an officer who is technically skilled and fit for promotion to a higher post. If any junior officer without fulfilling the criteria and technical expertise is filled up or promoted to such post, would the Tribunal shirk its responsibility on the plea of having no power. If events change during the pendency of the proceedings, the Tribunal will not be powerless to pass an interim order or an order of status quo-ante under such circumstances in exercise of its inherent powers.<br/> <br/><strong>100.</strong>     Despite the absence of any provision empowering the Tribunal to pass any interim order, the Tribunal is not powerless since it has all the powers of a civil court and in proper cases, it may invoke its inherent power and pass interim order with a view to preventing abuse of the process of court or the mischief being caused to the applicant affecting his right to promotion or other benefit. But the Tribunal shall  not  pass  any  such  interim  order  without affording the opposite party affected by the order an opportunity of being heard. However, in cases of emergency, which requires an interim order in order to prevent the abuse of the process and in the event of not passing such order preventing such loss, which cannot be compensated by money, the Tribunal can pass interim order as an exceptional measure for a limited period not exceeding fifteen days from the date of the order unless the said requirements have been complied with before the expiry of the period, and the Tribunal shall pass any further order upon hearing the parties.<br/> <br/><strong>101.</strong>     As observed above, a Tribunal is constituted with a judicial Officer in the rank of a ‘District Judge’ and therefore, he is a ‘civil court’ and not ‘persona designata’. While prescribing the powers of the Tribunal, it is specifically provided that ‘a Tribunal shall have all the powers of civil court’. Monetary compensation cannot be measured while considering the status of an officer. An officer’s dignity, status, privilege, position in office etc. cannot be measured in terms of money.<br/> <br/><strong>102.</strong>     The inherent powers of a Tribunal reminds the Judges of what they ought to know already, namely that if  the  ordinary  rules  of  procedure  results  in injustice in any case and there is no other remedy it can be broken for the ends of justice. This power furnishes the legislative recognition of the old age and well established principle that every Tribunal has inherent power to act <em>ex debito justitiae </em>i.e. to do that real and substantial justice and administration of which alone it exists to prevent abuse of the process of the court. This power can be exercised when no other power is available under the procedural law. Nothing can limit or affect the inherent power of a Tribunal to meet the ends of justice since it is not possible to foresee all possible circumstances that may arise to provide appropriate procedure to meet all those situation. This inherent power is recognized. All tribunals whether civil or criminal possess this power in the absence of any provision, as inherent in their constitution, all such powers as are necessary to do the right and to undo a wrong in course of administration of justice on the principle “<em>quando lex aliquid alique, concedit, conceditor, it sine quo res ipsa eshe non potest</em>” i.e. when the law gives a person anything it gives him that also without which the thing itself cannot exists.<br/> <br/><strong>103.</strong>     It is a power of a Tribunal in addition to and complementary to the powers expressly conferred under the procedural law but this power should not be exercised if its exercise is inconsistent with, or comes into conflict with, any of the powers expressly or  by  necessary  implication  conferred  by  the procedural law. It cannot be exercised capriciously or arbitrarily. It should be borne in mind that authority of the Tribunal exists for advancement of justice and if any attempt is made to abuse that authority so as to produce injustice the Tribunal has power to prevent such abuse. Therefore, while exercising this power the Tribunal is to consider whether the exercise of such power is ecpressly prohibited by any other provision and if there is no such prohibition, then the Tribunal will consider whether such power should be exercised or not in the facts of a given case. Reference in this connection is the case of Shipping Corporation of India V. Machadeo Brothers, AIR 2004 SC 2093.<br/> <br/><strong>104.</strong>     Similar question arose in a civil review petition filed  by  Abdul  Quader  Mollah  in  Criminal  Review Petition No.17-18 of 2013. Under the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973 there was no provision for review. The condemned prisoner filed a review petition.   Learned   Attorney   General   raised   a preliminary objection about the maintainability of the review petition on the ground that in view of article 47A(2) of the constitution, the review petition is not maintainable,  inasmuch  as,  the  Act  of  1973  is protected  by  article  47A  of  the  constitution. According  to  him,  a  judgment  which  has  attained finality cannot be challenged by resorting to the constitutional  provisions  which  has  been  totally ousted by the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 2011 and the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1972 respectively. This court repelled the objection and held  that  the  review  petition  was  maintainable, inasmuch  as,  apart  from  article  105  of  the constitution, this court can invoke its inherent power if it finds necessary to meet the ends of justice or to prevent the abuse the process of the court. There is  inherent  right  to  a  litigant  to  a  judicial proceeding and it requires no authority of law.<br/> <br/><strong>105.</strong>     This Court held that “We cannot overlook the fact that the primary function of the judiciary is to do justice between the parties who bring their causes before it. If the primary function of the court is to do justice in respect of causes brought before it, then on principle, it is difficult to accede to the proposition that in the absence of specific provision the court will shut its eyes even if a wrong or an error is detected in its judgment. To say otherwise, courts are meant for doing justice and must be deemed to possess as a necessary corollary as inherent in their constitution all the powers to achieve the end and undo the wrong. It does not confer any additional jurisdiction on the court; it only recognizes the inherent  powers  which  it  already  possesses”.  It further held that “If the law contains no specific provisions to meet the necessity of the case the inherent power of a court merely saves by expressly preserving to the court which is both a court of equity and law, to act according to justice, equity and good conscience and make such orders as may be necessary for ends of justice or to prevent the abuse of the process of the court. It is an enabling provision by virtue of which inherent powers have been vested in a court so that it does not find itself helpless for administering justice.<br/> <br/><strong>106.</strong>     The Tribunal can use its inherent powers to fill up the lacuna left by the legislature while enacting law or where the legislature is unable to foresee any circumstance which may arise in a particular case. There is a power to make such order as may be necessary for the ends of justice and to prevent the abuse of the process of the Tribunal. The inherent powers of a Tribunal are in addition to and complem-entary to the powers expressedly conferred upon it by other provisions of the Act of 1973. They are not intended to enable the Tribunal to create rights for the parties, but they are meant to enable the Tribunal to pass such orders for ends of justice as may be necessary. Considering the rights which are conferred upon the parties by substantive law to prevent abuse of the process of law, it is the duty of all Tribunals to correct the decisions which run counter to the law.’<br/> <br/><strong>107.</strong>     The High Court Division’s power of judicial review and its jurisdiction under article 102(1) cannot be overlooked. It has jurisdiction over ordinary as well as extra ordinary matters - it has a special jurisdiction, it has also testamentary, matrimonial and gorgeous jurisdiction. It can exercise original jurisdiction under the Companies Act, Admiralty and several other special statutes. Its extraordinary jurisdiction enabling it to issue prerogative writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition or writ of certiorari. The function of the Administrative Tribunal is a mode of alternative dispute resolution in respect of service matters and the object of creation of this Tribunal is to relieve the High Court Division of its burden in respect of only those matters mentioned in Article 117(1). Similar other alternative  dispute  resolution  forums  have  been created in the Taxes Department, Customs Department, Labour Courts, Press Council etc. and those Tribunals have been adjudicating matters expeditiously and as a result, the High Court Division’s work load is reduced to  some  extent.  Administrative  Tribunal  is  also created keeping the above object in view.<br/> <br/><strong>108.</strong>     Taking into consideration the principles of law discussed above, let us now consider the individual cases on merit as to whether the writ petitions moved in the High Court Division are maintainable.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong><u>Civil Appeal No.159 of 2010</u></strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>109.</strong>     Respondent Sontosh Kumar Shaha claimed that while serving as Senior Assistant Judge, he was served with a notice on 6th September, 2000, with allegations of corruption under Rule 3(b) of the Governments servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1985. He claimed that his suspension order has not been recommended by the General Administration Committee (G.A Committee) of the High Court Division and it was not also approved by the Full Court. He claimed that he did not take any money for his personal purposes. He took leave due to illness of his mother and denied the misappropriation of taka 19,500/-. He claimed that he did not commit any offence of corruption and no charge has been proved against him. The authority having considered the inquiry report and other materials found him not guilty and discharged him of the charges leveled against him on 24th October, 2001. The writ respondent No.1,  the  Ministry  of  Law  decided  to  drop  the suspension order and communicated the Registrar of the Supreme Court, but his name did not appear in the promotion list illegally. Pursuant thereto, he made representation for his posting as Subordinate Judge. Despite that the junior officers had been promoted. The writ respondent No.2 issued the second show cause notice on 20th November, 2003, with a recommendation for his removal from the service under Rule 4(3)(c). Pursuant thereto, he filed a writ petition claiming his seniority on the basis of promotion list dated 14th March, 2000 which was duly approved by the President.<br/> <br/><strong>110.</strong>     The issuance of second show cause notice was without lawful authority and of no legal effect. He further stated that the Chief Justice approved of the proposal for suspension and departmental proceedings without placing the matter before the G.A. Committee. Ultimately, the proposal of the writ respondent No.2 for review of the proposal of the writ petitioner was placed before the G.A. Committee and the committee disapproved the proposal. The G.A. Committee did not approve the proposal of the Chief Justice for withdrawal of the suspension order. There was also violation of rule 3(d) of the High Court Rules, Part 1, Chapter-1, and also rule 16(e) of Chapter 1, Part 1, inasmuch as, in respect of the suspension or removal, the Full Court’s decision was necessary. On perusal of the pleadings, we find that the respondent did not challenge the vires of any law nor did he claim the  violation  of  his  fundamental  rights. Whatever statements in respect of violation of fundamental rights were made are superficial in nature without laying any foundation.<br/> <br/><strong>111.</strong>     The  High  Court  Division  observed  that  a departmental proceedings was initiated against the respondent which has been taken without approval of the G.A. committee, and the same was a mandatory provision of law and that the Chief Justice without taking the matter to the G.A. Committee had accorded the approval. On perusal of the record the High Court Division noticed that there was an endorsement at the bottom of the note-sheet with a note of the Chief Justice ‘yes’ and this proved that the Chief Justice accorded the approval violating rule 3(d) of the High Court Division Rules. This court perused the record and found that this observation was correct but that itself is not a ground for interference. It should be borne in mind that in urgent matters, sometimes the Chief Justice gives approval in respect of some proposals without placing the matter before the G.A. committee, because the calling such meeting takes time and in urgent matters the Chief Justice accords permission subject to the approval of the committee later on. In this case inadvertently the matter has not been placed before the G.A. Committee.<br/> <br/><strong>112.</strong>     In order to avoid more harm to the judiciary, the Chief Justice takes such decision. The Chief Justice being the head of the judiciary is respected by the Judges and his opinion with regard to the superintendence and control over the lower judiciary has primacy and is being honoured by the Judges of the committee. This is a practice being followed by this Court and non-approval of the decision of the Chief Justice  was  merely  an  irregularity  and  not  an illegality and this will not vitiate the decision. Suppose, the Chief Justice noticed that some members of the G.A. Committee are unable to attend the court, but for that reason the Chief Justice cannot sit idle leaving urgent and emergency matters pending. The functions of the Supreme Court should not be kept in abeyance due to this technical ground.<br/> <br/><strong>113.</strong>     The High Court Division held that the Ministry of Law having found the respondent not guilty in respect of the allegations made in Case No.4 of 2000, wrote a letter to the Registrar for exonerating him of the departmental proceedings. It renewed its opinion on two other occasions subsequently but the Supreme Court without consenting to the proposal directed the concerned Ministry to issue second show cause notice on 20th November, 2003 and that the order of suspension of the respondent was made in violation of rule 3(d) of the High Court Division Rules. As observed above, this is a mere irregularity and this cannot be a ground for interference by the High Court Division. The High Court Division further held that as per Rules,  any  decision  relating  to  the  terms  and conditions of service as a judicial officer should be placed before the Full Court but in case of the respondent, this has not been followed; that the Ministry of Law upon perusal of the inquiry reports and other materials was convinced that the respondent should be exonerated from both the charges; that there was total violation of rule 16 of the High Court Division Rules and the respondent was victimized due to unwitting decision of the G.A. committee; that the G.A. Committee illegally considered the circular of the High Court Division under memo dated 13th April, 2003, which has no manner of application in case of the respondent and that any order passed by the Ministry in accordance with Article 116 of the constitution shall have the force of law.<br/> <br/><strong>114.</strong>     The superintendence and control over all courts and tribunals subordinate to it is upon the High Court Division as per article 109 of the constitution. The Supreme Court has its own system and machinery to evaluate the conduct, discipline, performance of all judicial officers working in the subordinate courts and  tribunals.  Firstly,  through  the  judgments pronounced by them which ultimately come to the High Court Division for judicial review. Secondly, from the annual  confidential  reports  being  prepared  in accordance with Rules. Finally, through inspections made from time to time by the Judges of the High Court Division as per direction of the Chief Justice. This system is being followed right from 1861 when the High Courts were established in this sub-continent under the   High   Courts   Act,   1861.   Whenever,   any recommendation,  proposal  or  opinion  regarding  the terms  and  conditions  of  service  of  any  judicial officer is made by the Supreme Court, this recommendation is being honoured by the Executive government  without  further  inquiry  because  the Executive does not have such machinery or system to evaluate the conduct and performance of the judicial officers.<br/> <br/><strong>115.</strong>     If the superintendence and control of the subordinate  judiciary  is  left  in  the  hands  of Executive, the independence of judiciary will be in question. From the time of the separation of the judiciary from the Executive, it is the Supreme Court under whose supervision the subordinate judicial officers are working and it supervises its administration and controls the conduct of judicial officers. There cannot be any doubt about it. The lower judiciary cannot be independent if its superintendence and control over the judicial officers remains with the Executive. The Executive is also conscious about that, and all the time it represents that it does not interfere with the administration of justice.<br/> <br/><strong>116.</strong>     If articles 116, 116A are read along with article 109, it will be manifest that it is the Supreme Court which has the exclusive power to supervise and control the terms and conditions of service of the subordinate judicial  officers.  Article  116  does  not  control article 109, rather if these two provisions are placed in juxtaposition, it will be clear that the superintendence and control of the officers of the lower judiciary remains with the Supreme Court. At any event, in order to remove any doubt this Court in Khandker Delwar Hossain V. Bangladesh Italian Marble works Ltd., BLD 2010(AD) 1 (special Issue) popularly know as ‘Constitution 5th Amendment case’ observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“However we are of the view that the words, ‘but we find no provision in the Constitution which curtails, demolishes or otherwise abridges this independence’ do not depict the actual picture because unless Articles 115 and 116 are restored to their original position, independence of judiciary will not be fully achieved.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>117.</strong>     Despite such observation the government has not restored original article 116. It is hoped that the original article 116 will be restored with a view to avoid any controversy in future. This is healthy for the proper administration of justice. Any opinion given by the Supreme Court regarding the terms and conditions of service of any judicial officer should be respected by the Executive and its opinion cannot be ignored. There cannot be any dual administration in the administration of justice and the same will not be healthy for the administration of justice. If the views taken by the High Court Division is accepted, there   will   be   chaos   and   confusion   in   the administration of justice. If we look at the scheme of the constitution, there will be no doubt that the opinion of the Supreme Court regarding the terms and conditions  of  the  service  of  the  lower  judicial officers would prevail. Thee is no doubt about it.<br/> <br/><strong>118.</strong>     The High Court Division further held that the writ petition is maintainable and in this connection, it has noticed the case of Shahida Khatun V. Bangladesh, 3 BLC (AD) 155 and  Abul  Basher  V.  Bangladesh, 1 BLC (AD) 77. In respect of Shahida Khatun, we have expressed our opinion earlier. In Shahida Khatun the Administrative Appellate Tribunal was not constituted properly when the impugned judgment was delivered, inasmuch as, it was signed by two members, and therefore, a question arose as to whether the decision of the Appellate Tribunal was <em>coram non judice</em>. This Court held that the Tribunal was properly constituted and in the midst of the hearing, one member departs temporarily and in his absence two other members signed the judgment and thereby it has committed no illegality. The High Court Division possibly wants to mean that since the suspension order of the respondent not having been approved by the G.A. Committee, and the decision having not been placed before the Full Court, the suspension order and the initiation of the proceedings is <em>coram non judice</em>. As observed above, in case of emergency the Chief Justice sometimes passes orders relating to the terms and conditions of the service and due to unavoidable situation, the matter had not been placed before the Committee.<br/> <br/><strong>119.</strong>     In this case this court clearly observed that except challenging the vires of law or violation of fundamental rights, judicial review of a decision of authority relating to the terms and conditions of service under article 102(1) is not permissible. None of the above conditions is available in this case and therefore, the writ petition is not maintainable. In respect  of  Abul  Bashar,  the  writ  petition  was summarily  rejected  on  the  ground  that  the  order impugned  in  writ  petition  cannot  be  said  to  be malafide or passed for collateral purpose and that no discrimination has taken place at all. In respect of case no.3 of 2000 since no inquiry report is available with the record, we direct the concerned Ministry to appoint an inquiry officer with the consultation of the  G.A.  Committee  and  complete  the  inquiry proceedings within two months from date, since the case is very old one. So this decision does not have any help for the respondent.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong><u>Civil Appeal No.131 of 2012</u></strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>120.     </strong>This  appeal  arises  out  of  judgment  in  Writ Petition No.6967 of 2009. It was a public interest litigation filed by the Bangladesh Stenographers Association. Its claim is that some Stenographers of the Appellate Tribunal and  the  Labour  Appellate Tribunal have formed the association. By notification dated 17th May, 1978, the government allowed special allowance to the Stenographers of the Secretariate. One Mir Mohammad Moinuddin, a Personal Assistant-cum- Stenographer filed Writ Petition No.1922 of 1990. Similarly one Md. Shamsul Huq, a Personal Assistant- cum-Stenographer of the Supreme Court also filed Writ Petition No.2256 of 2002 for raising their status and the rules were made absolute. The Stenographers who formed the Bangladesh Stenographers Association (BCS) were being discriminated against, inasmuch as, they were not given status equal to those given to the Stenographers of the Secretariate. Therefore, the refusal to treat the members of the writ petitioners Samity is discriminatory. The High Court Division observed that the Stenographers who were initially appointed on the same pay scale and attached to the Secretaries, Joint Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries of different Ministries were redesignated as Personal Officers  and  subsequently  their  posts  have  been upgraded as class-2 Officers; that the P.A.-cum- Stenographers of the Judges of the High Court Division have been accorded to the similar privilege and that the refusal of the members of writ petitioners Samity is discriminatory. The High Court Division made the rule absolute mainly relying upon some decisions of the Indian jurisdiction.<br/> <br/><strong>121.</strong>     The High Court Division has not at all considered about the maintainability of the writ petition. On the principles discussed above, the writ petitioners’ petition was barred under Article 117(2). No question of violation of fundamental rights or any statutory provision was challenged. Discrimination should not be based   on   a   mere   possibility   of   a   better classification. The court should look at whether there is some difference which bears a just reasonably to the object of legislation. Mere differentiation in equality or treatment or inequality or burden does not amount to discrimination within the inhibition of the equal protection clause. Suppose an army personnel who has joined the service knowing that he may sacrifice his life during external interference. An employee on the same scale of different department cannot claim equal opportunity and status with the army officer. Equal opportunity should be given to those who stand on  the  same  footing  in  the  same  department.  An employee of different department cannot be equated with  another  employee  of  another  department  only because his salary is equal with the other department. The High Court Division has totally overlooked this aspect of the matter.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong><u>Civil Appeal No.132 of 2012</u></strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>122.</strong>     This appeal arises out of a judgment in Writ Petition No.1992 of 2010. Two writ petitioners challenged the letter under memo dated 13th September, 1995, issued by the Ministry of Establishment refusing to upgrade their scale and status. They were appointed as Typist and Upper Division in the Ministry of Food Department. Their claim is that the Ministry has upgraded the Personal Officers of Secretariates. The Supreme Court also upgraded its Stenographers, and therefore, they are also entitled to equal protection of law  and   status.   There was, therefore, discrimination regarding their status and pay scale.<br/> <br/><strong>123.</strong>     The writ petitioners did not plead any violation of fundamental rights in their writ petition nor did they challenge vires of any law. The High Court Division made the rule absolute mainly relying upon a decision of this Court in respect of some employees of the  High  Court  Division.  Though  the  High  Court Division observed that there were infringement of writ petitioners’ fundamental rights, it has assigned no reason in respect of infringement of such rights. Secondly, as observed above, there was no sufficient pleadings  on  the  question  of  infringement  of fundamental rights. The High Court Division observed that there was violation of articles 27 and 29 of the constitution but mere observation that there was violation of these provisions will not suffice. In the absence of proper pleadings and laying foundation, the writ petition is barred under clause (2) of Article 117.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br/><span style="font-size:14px"><strong><u>Civil Appeal No.133 of 2012</u></strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>124.</strong>     In these appeals, 57 employees who are Upper Division   Assistants   of   the   Local   Government Engineering Department jointly filed a writ petition seeking a direction to grant second class gazetted status with other benefits. In their petition also they made similar averments made in other writ petitions. They did not make sufficient pleadings as regards violation of fundamental rights except that due to rejection of their prayer, it was claimed, they had been deprived of their rights guaranteed under article 29 of the constitution. The High Court Division in a very concise judgment made the rule absolute relying upon some decisions of this Court in respect of the Personal Assistant-cum- Stenographers of the High Court Division and another writ petition. It has not at all discussed as regards the maintainability  of  the  writ  petition  and  totally ignored the decisions of this court in respect of maintainability of the writ petition.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br/><strong><u>Civil Appeal No.134 of 2012</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>125.</strong>     This appeal arises out of a judgment of the High Court Division made in Writ Petition No.1309 of 2010 in which 93 writ petitioners who were in the police service of different wings such as Special Branch, Upper Division Assistants etc. Their claim is that while the employees of the Secretariate and the Supreme Court of Bangladesh in the same rank have been given status and salary, they have been discriminated under articles 27 and 29 of the constitution. They have not also pleaded anything on the question of alleged violation of their fundamental rights by the administrative action of the authority. The High Court Division in a very precise judgment made the rule absolute mainly relying upon the case of Bangladesh V. Md. Shamsul Huq, 59 DLR (AD)54, in respect of the Personal Officers of the Secretariate. This case is not at all applicable as discussed above.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Civil Appeal No.128 of 2015</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>126.</strong>     In this appeal four writ petitioners who were Lower  Division  Assistants  and  Typists  of  the Directorate of Inspection and Audit Ministry of Education challenged the inaction of the authority by a writ petition. They also made similar averments with other writ petitions as mentioned above. They did not plead the violation of any fundamental rights though they sought for enforcement of fundamental rights guaranteed  under  articles  27  and  29  of  the constitution. The High Court Division in a very slip- shod judgment made the rule absolute mainly on the reasoning that the employees of Directorate of Inspection  of  Audit,  Ministry  of  Education  are regulated by the terms and conditions recruitment Rules, 1984 but they have been deprived of their rights and that the authority have not amended the recruitment Rules illegally. In this case also the High Court Division has not made any finding as regards the maintainability of the writ petition.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Civil Appeal No.119 of 2008</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>127.</strong>     One Ms. Sabiha Ahmed moved the High Court Division challenging an order under memo dated 11th January, 2000 promoting 15 officers junior to her. Her claim is that she worked in the Directorate of Women’s and Children’s Affairs for 23 years and posted with the National Women’s Training and Development Academy as a teacher in non formal education. In 1982 she was transferred to the Women’s Cell in the Ministry of Social Welfare. In due course, she was absorbed as Probation Officer and was posed in the head office of the Directorate of Women’s Affairs. She was not given promotion  to  the  post  of  District  Women  Affairs Officer although she had rendered service for more than 15 years. In the seniority list published on 30th January, 1999, she was shown at serial No.15 below some junior officers. Subsequently, she was promoted to the post of Assistant Director but on the same date by an another notification dated 11th September, 2000, fifteen officers were promoted to the post of District Women Affairs Officers, although they were all working with her in the same rank and status.<br/> <br/><strong>128.</strong>     The High Court Division upon hearing the parties made the rule absolute.  The High Court  Division declared the writ petitioner to be the District Women Affairs Officers on and from 11th September, 2000, with attended salary and benefits. The High Court Division entered into the merit of the case and made the above direction. In the writ petition the writ petitioner did not raise any constitutional point of violation of fundamental   rights   or   on   the   question   of discrimination. It is simply stated in the form of submission in paragraph 16 “two impugned orders are both discriminatory, illegal bad in law, malafide, made for collateral purposes and cannot be sustained in law”. She made statements of the effect that the authority arbitrarily promoted junior officers with malafide motive. No specific pleadings in that regard have been made. Leave was granted to consider whether “the High Court Division failed to appreciate that the matter relates to the terms and condition of service of the writ petitioner who is a person in the service of the Republic” and as such, the writ petition is not maintainable.  We have already  observed  that  a government servant cannot maintain a writ petition in presence of Administrative Tribunal relating to the terms and conditions of service. In the absence of challenging the vires of law, the writ petition is not  maintainable.<br/><strong><u>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.703 of 2014</u></strong><br/> <br/><strong>129.</strong>     17 Upper Division Assistants of the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Barisal sought a direction to upgrade their scale and status similarly with those employees of Bangladesh Secretariate and Supreme Court. They stated that their fundamental rights have been violated by reason of not giving their status and scale. There was not at all pleadings in support of the claim. The High Court Division made the rule absolute considering its other earlier decisions. According to it the writ petitioners, they being employees of public authority are entitled to the same benefit and uniform terms and conditions of the service.

It is further stated that the Supreme Court by notification under memo dated  11th December,  2011,  19th June, 2012,  31st December, 2012 granted selection grade and pay scale in grade No.7 upgrading from grade No.8 instead of grade No.6 in respect of Bench Officers but no such notification was made in respect of the writ petitioners, and thereby, they were discrimi-nated in  granting them selection grade of two tiers from grade No.8 to grade No.6 of the National Pay Scale, 2005.<br/> <br/><strong>144.</strong>     The High Court Division made the rules absolute and directed the writ-respondents to grant them selection grade and pay scale to the writ-petitioners and others standing on the same footing in grade-6, that is, Tk.11000-475x14-17650 as per National Pay Scale, 2005 and Tk.18500-800x14-29700 as per National Pay Scale, 2009 from the date of completion of four years in service as Bench Officers in Class-1 post in the   High Court Division with all arrears upon modification of the orders under notification dated 11th December, 2011 circulated under Memo dated 11th December, 2011, notification   dated 19th June, 2012, 19th June, 2012 and notification dated 31st December, 2012, 31st December, 2012 and other similar notifications circulated in this regard granting selection grade within 30 (thirty days) from the date of receipt of the judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>145.</strong>     In respect of the above petitions Particularly in C.P. Nos.644 and 645 of 2015, the Bench Readers and Bench Officers were upgraded to 1st Class Gazetted Officers (grade No.8) on and from 23rd February, 2000 and 1st December, 2003 respectively, but the writ petitioners’ scale was not upgraded to grade No.6 as selection grade scale, although they have already completed four years service as Bench Readers 1st Class, and therefore, they are entitled to selection grade of two tiers from 8th grade to 6th  grade of the National Pay Scale, 1997 (for writ petitioner No.1) and National Pay Scale, 2005 (for writ petitioner Nos.2-4). They further stated that the Supreme Court by notification dated 10th  October, 2013, granted selection grade to writ petitioner No.1 and others in grade No.7 but after completion of four years in service, the Bench Readers were granted selection grade scale in grade No.7 instead of grade No.6, and thereby, the writ petitioners were denied such benefit, and therefore, there was discrimination in considering the case of the writ petitioners.<br/> <br/><strong>146.</strong>     The High Court Division made the Rule absolute and directed the writ-respondents to grant them selection grade and pay scale in   grade-6, that is, Tk.7200- 260x14-10840 as per National Pay Scale, 1997 and Tk.18500-800x14-29700 as per National Pay Scale, 2009 to writ-petitioner No.1 and Tk.11000-475x14-17650 as per National Pay Scale, 2005 and Tk.18500-800x14-29700 as per National Pay Scale, 2009 to writ-petitioner Nos.2-4 from the date of completion of four years service as Bench Readers of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh with all arrears upon modification of the notification dated 10th October, 2013 within 30 (thirty days) from the date of receipt of this judgment. It was directed that the judgment shall be applicable to other Bench Officers and Bench Readers, if any, who are placed in the same status with those petitioners.<br/> <br/><strong>147.</strong>     These petitions are quite distinguishable from the other cases. The writ petitioners invoked their fundamental rights as they were discriminated by the same authority and they are working in the same court. More so, the works of Bench Readers of the Appellate Division and Assistant Bench officers of the High Court Division are completely different. The Bench Readers are appointed from among the Bench Officers/Assistant Bench Officers of the High Court Division and if the Bench Officers get status higher than them, certainly they will be discriminated. It is to be noted that the working hours of these officers is from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but they used to work till 8/9 p.m. every day. In respect of Assistant Bench Officers, the very nature of their job is painstaking. They work almost 12/14 hours a day and even on holidays because they are attached to the Judges. During the vacation as well, they cannot enjoy the holidays as they remain busy with the finalization of judgments. The High Court Division has rightly exercised its jurisdiction and we find no infirmity to interfere with the judgment.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.1445, 1768, 2133-2134 and 2320 of 2015</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>148.</strong>     Five writ petitioners, the Head Assistants of Public Health and Engineering Department, Lakshmipur sought a direction to refix their pay scale and granting  gazetted  status.  They  did  not  make  any pleading in respect of violation of its fundamental rights.  The  High  Court  Division  in  an  elaborate judgment following the cases of 52 DLR(AD) 120, 1 BLC(AD)44,  44 DLR(AD)111, 9 MLR(AD) 105, 32 DLR(AD) 67 and 46 DLR(AD) 19 discharged the rules on the ground that the writ petitions are not maintainable along with rule issued Writ Petition Nos.8706 of 2009, 8707 of 2009, 7272 of 2009 and 4544 of 2010. This judgment according to us is in conformity of the views taken by this Court.<br/> <br/><strong>149.</strong>     On an overall consideration of the writ petitions, the pleadings, the impugned judgments, we are shocked to note that in none of the petitions except leave petitions  Nos.644  and  645  of  2015,  the  writ petitioners made no sufficient pleadings in support of their alleged violation of fundamental rights which compelled them to seek judicial review of the actions of the authorities. In these petitions they made out a case of discrimination. All these petitions were drawn up in a stereo type manner and except in Writ Petition Nos.6263  of  2014,  6264  of  2014.  The  High  Court Division delivered judgments without looking at the pleadings, the question of law involved in those petitions. We have held earlier that a public servant or  an  employee  of  the  Statutory  Corporation  can maintain a writ petition if he challenges the vires of a statute or if his fundamental rights are violated and not otherwise. There are consistent views in this regard of this Court but the High Court Division has totally ignored the statements of law settled by this Court.<br/> <br/><strong>150.</strong>     In respect of violation of fundamental rights, there must be sufficient pleadings in support of the claim that the applicant’s cherished rights enshrined in the constitution have been denied by the administrative action for which he seeks protection of his rights and that he will not get the remedy in the Tribunal. It will not suffice if he simply makes a superficial   statement   of   discrimination   and/or violation of fundamental rights. A writ petition is decided on the basis of affidavit evidence and in disposing of such petition, the Law of Evidence Act is not applicable. When he will come with a specific case with sufficient pleadings, there will be scope for contravention of those facts by the authority and then the High Court Division can decide whether those rights claimed by the aggrieved persons have been violated. The applicant cannot raise any disputed fact. If on admitted facts the High Court Division can arrive at the conclusion that the fundamental rights of the litigant have been utterly violated, then certainly it cannot sit as a silent spectator to shirk its responsibility but it is only in rarest of the rare cases the High Court Division shall exercise its power.<br/> <br/><strong>151.</strong>     The constitution being the Supreme Law of the country,  if  the  violation  of  fundamental  rights alleged by the claimant is mixed up with disputed facts and law, then certainly the jurisdiction of the High Court Division to entertain such petition will be ousted and the remedy of the applicant is with the Tribunal. It should be borne in mind that the Tribunal has been created as an alternative forum of the adjudication of service matters only with a view to reducing the backlog of the High Court Division and the constitution has also provides such provision authorizing the Parliament to create alternative institutional mechanism. Alternative Tribunals have been set up in almost all over the countries of the globe  and  those  Tribunals  have  been  working effectively and satisfactorily. If the High Court Division  usurps  those  powers  in  every  case,  the provisions contained in article 117(2) will be nugatory. The theory of alternative institutional mechanism has to be recognized and encouraged by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/><strong>152.</strong>     If the High Court Division should not shirk its responsibility of superintendence and control over all Tribunals subordinate to it provided in article 109 of the constitution, it should allow those Tribunals to work in accordance with law otherwise there will create chaos and confusion in the administration of justice. These Tribunals have been created in exercise of the powers provided in the Constitution. It is only constitutional courts alone are competent to exercise power of judicial review to   pronounce the constitutional validity of statutory provisions and rules and not otherwise. Our Fore Fathers had incorporated special provisions to ensure that it would be immune from any pressure from the Executive and such powers have not been invested to the lower Tribunals. This precious power shall not be exploited merely on the asking by a litigant lest ends of justice  will  be  defeated.  The  constitution has provided provisions divesting   powers to the traditional courts of a considerable question of judicial works and this includes tax matters, customs matters, industrial and a labour disputes, service matters, petty civil and criminal matters. The Supreme Court being the guardian of the constitution must safeguard the constitution and its mandate. If the Supreme Court itself violates the mandates of the constitution who else will preserve and protect the constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>153.</strong>     Learned Attorney General has placed some Rules of the respective departments of the writ petitioners and submits that since almost all the writ petitioners’ services  are  being  governed  by  their  respective service   Rules, the writ petitions are not maintainable.<br/> <br/><strong>154.</strong>     We noticed that except  one  department  the government has promulgated Rules in respect of the terms and conditions of the officers and Employees (Directorate of Inspection and Audit, Ministry of Education Recruitment) Rules, 1984. In this Rules, the procedure for appointment by the direct recruitment and promotions has been  provided.  The  police department have also promulgated পুলিশ বিভাগ (নন-পুলিশ কর্মকর্তা কর্মচারী) নিয়োগ বিধিমালা, by  gazette  notification  dated  1<sup>st</sup> January, 1997. In these Rules, the requisite qualification, the mode of appointment of direct recruits, the departmental promotion and the promotion to next higher posts have been elaborately mentioned. In this department the post of Senior Assistant is four steps lower than the Administrative Officer intervened by Accounts Officer, Statistics Officer, Head Assistant, Office Super and Typist. If the Head Assistant is upgraded to the rank of Administrative Officer, there will be chaos and confusion in the administrative set up and the other staff will be prejudiced.<br/> <br/><strong>155.</strong>     In the Department of Special Branch, the post of Administrative Officer is a post on promotion from Accounts Officer and Head Assistant is two step lower. If the Head Assistant is promoted/upgraded to the post of the Accounts Officers and the reporters will be prejudiced.  Similarly,  the  Upper  Assistants  and Accounts Assistants are of the same grade and their status is serial No.7. If these Account Assistants are upgraded to Administrative Officer, then 5 senior posts such as Account Officers, Reporter, Head Assistant, Typist and Librarian will be affected. In Crime Detection Department, the Administrative Officer is at serial No.5 and Office Superintendent/Head Assistant  is  at  serial  No.6  and  Upper  Division Assistant  is  at  serial  No.8.  If  Upper  Division Assistant is upgraded to Administrative Officer, two senior officers to them will be prejudiced. In the office of Divisional Deputy Inspector General, (Inspection), it has separate service Rules. In this Department there is no post of Administrative Officer. Now if a Upper Division Assistant or Account officer or Accountant, who ranks at serial No. 3 is promoted to the post of Administrative Officer in the similar rank to the Special Department, there will create anomaly in this Department.<br/> <br/><strong>156.     </strong>Similarly in the District Superintendent of Police Department, there is no post like Administrative Officer. If the Head Assistant is upgraded to the post of Administrative Officer, there is no clarification whether such Head Assistant will be upgraded above Medical Officer who is at serial No.1. Similarly the Upper Assistant/Head mohorar, a Reader are at serial No.6. If this Upper Assistant is upgraded to Administrative Officer, there will create more anarchy in the administration.<br/> <br/><strong>157.</strong>     In the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, the post of Administrative Officer is at serial No.1, the Upper Assistant   is   at   serial   No.2   and   the   Head Assistant/head mohora/CA are at serial No.4. If the Head Assistant is upgraded to Administrative Officer, certainly the other two employees who are above their rank and status will be prejudiced. There are criteria for promotion to the higher posts of Administrative Officer. If these criteria are not fulfilled and the Upper Division Assistants are upgraded to the rank of Administrative Officer, the service Rules will be violated. In respect of Chittagong Metropolitan Police also similar provisions for the posts and status. In Khulna Metropolitan Police, the post of Upper Assistant/Head mohora/accountant/reader/CA are in the same rank at serial No.5 and above them is the post of Head Assistant and the Administrative Officer is two step higher than Head Assistant. So, the Khulna Metropolitan Police Service Rules are completely different from Chittagong Metropolitan Police.<br/> <br/><strong>158.</strong>     In respect of Rajshahi Metropolitan Police, the post Head Assistant is one step lower than the Khulna Metropolitan  Police.  If  Head  Assistant  post  is upgraded to Administrative Officer, then the Accounts Officer will be prejudiced and then if the Upper Division  Assistant  is  upgraded  to  Administrative Officer, the other Upper Employees holding the higher posts will be prejudiced. In the Transmission Department,  there  is  no  post  like  Administrative Officer and Head Assistant are at serial No.1. The post-Upper  Assistant/Accountant  and  Casher  are  at serial No.3. The post of Head Assistant must have three years experience in the feeder post and Upper Assistant must have five years experience in the feeder post. So, there will create anomaly if this Upper Assistant is upgraded with the Administrative Department. In Railway Police, there is no post like Administrative Officer and Head Assistant is at serial No.1.  Their  rank  and  status  is  similar  to Communication  Department.  In  the  Armed  Police Battalion,  there  is  no  post  like  Administrative Officer and the post of typist is at serial No.1 and Head Assistant is two step lower than typist. There will also create anomaly if this Upper Assistant is upgraded above typist.<br/> <br/><strong>159.</strong>     In respect of Police Academy, Sarada, there is no post of Administrative Officer and Senior Medical Officer is heading the seniority. A Senior Head Assistant is at serial No.7. If he is upgraded in the rank of Administrative Officer, how he will be accommodated  is  not  clear  because  if  he  is accommodated  then  he  will  be  senior  to  Medical Officer. The Head Assistant/Upper Assistant and Accountant are at serial No.9. If they are upgraded then they have to supersede eight senior posts. In Local Police Training School, Head Assistant is at serial  No.3  and  Upper  Assistant/Accountant  is  at serial No.4. If these two groups are upgraded they will be put above the Medical Officer. There is no post of Administrative Officer in this department. In the police hospital, the Superintendent (Medical Officer) is heading the post and Head Assistant-cum- Accountant is at serial No.4 and Office Assistant-cum- Typist is at serial No.6. There is no post like Administrative Officer. If these posts are upgraded as Special  Officer,  then  they  must  be  placed  above Superintendents.<br/> <br/><strong>160.</strong>     In the Food Department, there is separate service Rules under the name the Non Cadre Gazetted Officers and Non-gazetted Employees (Director General of Food) Recruitment  Rules,  1983.  In  these  Rules,  the provisions for recruitment, promotions, scales, everything  have  been  clearly  mentioned  in  the schedule.  Head  Assistant/Head  Assistant-cum- Accountant/ Superintendent are at serial No.9. UDA/LDA cum typist/stenographer/steno typist are at serial No.11. If these two groups are upgraded, since there is no post of Administrative Officer, they must have to be placed at 8 or 9 grade. Certainly they will be placed above the Chemist, which post is senior most and the post has been yearmarked for promotion from Assistant Chemist with five years experience.<br/> <br/><strong>161.</strong>     In the Public administration, there is a service Rules under the name বাংলাদেশ সচিবালয় (ক্যাডার বর্হিভুত গেজেটেড কর্মকর্তা এবং নন গেজেটেড কর্মচারী নিয়োগ বিধিমালা), ২০১৪. Under these Rules, different grades have been amalgamated in rule 6(Gha) and the post of Administrative Officer has been abolished. According to this Rules, the Deputy Secretary (Non- cadre) is at serial No.1, Senior Assistant Secretary (Non-cadre)is  at  serial  No.2,  Assistant  Secretary (non-cadre) is at serial No.3  and there are different criteria for promotion of those posts from the lower post. These Rules have been promulgated by repealing the previous Rules namely বাংলাদেশ সচিবালয় (ক্যাডার বর্হিভুত গেজেটেড কর্মকর্তা এবং নন গেজেটেড কর্মচারী নিয়োগ বিধিমালা), ২০০৬.<br/> <br/><strong>162.     </strong>Similarly in the Supreme Court, there is a service Rules under the name বাংলাদেশ সুপ্রীম কোর্ট হাইকোর্ট বিভাগ (কর্মচারী নিয়োগ বিধিমালা) ১৯৮৭. Except one department there are separate service Rules in respect of the writ petitioners regulating the procedure for recruitment, promotion and other related matters. The recruitment, promotion, status and  other  benefits  are  being  regulated  by  the respective service Rules of the Departments. Thus it will not be fair to equate the Senior Assistants of the Secretariate with those working in the Supreme Court  of  Bangladesh,  Police  Department,  Local Government and Engineering Department, Customs Department,  various  Tribunals,  Appellate  Tribunals etc. In some departments there are posts of Administrative Officers and alike posts, the post of Administrative Officers has been abolished in the Department and new Rules have been framed deleting those posts. Under such circumstances, if Senior Assistants or Upper Division Clerks or Stenographers or typists are equated with those posts giving them similar status and rank, there is no use of framing Rules by different Departments. These Rules have been framed by the concerned Departments for the purpose of recruitment, promotion and administration of their employees. One service Rules can not regulate the employees of other Department. Similarly the criteria for appointment of each Department and promotion are completely different.<br/> <br/><strong>163.</strong>     The expression equal protection of law or equality before law has to be interpreted in its absolute sense. All persons are equal in all respect disregarding different conditions and circumstances in which they are placed. Equal protection of law means all persons are equal in all cases. It means the persons similarly situated should be treated equally. The term equality is a dynamic concept with many aspect and diminution and it cannot be confined within traditional and doctrinaire limits. Indian Supreme Court taking into consideration article 14 of the constitution held that article 14 does not forbid reasonable classification for the purposes of legislation. There can be permissible classification provided two conditions are satisfied namely; (a) the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together for other left out of the group; (b) differentia must have a rational relation to the object  sought  to  be  achieved  by  the  statute  in question.  The  classification  may  be  founded  on different basis. There cannot be any question of discrimination on the ground of some acts providing for different set up and each must be taken to be a class by itself. The legislature has a right to make such provision for its constitution as it thinks fit subject always to the provisions of the constitution. References in this connection are EP Royappa V.

Province of East Pakistan, 9 DLR(SC)21 and Kazi  Mohammad  Akhtaruzzman  V.  Bangladesh,  Writ Petition No.2252 of 2009 disposed of along with three other writ petitions. Sheikh Abdus Sabur V. Returning Officer, 41 DLR (AD) 30 and Bangladesh V. Md. Azizur Rahman, 46 DLR (AD) 19.<br/> <br/><strong>164.</strong>     In Jibendra Kishore (supra), it has been observed, “It is not possible to formulate a comprehensive definition of the clause ‘equal protection of law’; nevertheless some broad propositions as to its meaning have been enunciated. One of these propositions is that equal protection of the laws means that no person or  class  of  persons  shall  be  denied  the  same protection of the laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes, in like circumstances, in their lives, liberty and property and in pursuit of happiness.  Another  generalization  more  frequently stated is that the guarantee of equal protection of the laws requires that all persons shall be treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions, both in the privileges conferred and in the liabilities imposed. In the application of these principles, however, it has always been recognized that classification is not arbitrary or capricious, is natural  and  reasonable  and  bears  a  fair  and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. It is not for the Courts, in such cases, it is said, to demand from the legislature a scientific accuracy in the classification adopted. If the classification is relevant to the object of the Act, it must be upheld unless the relevancy is too remote or fanciful. A classification that proceeds on irrelevant consideration, such as differences in race, colour or religion will certainly be rejected by the Courts. Applying these tests to the present case, it cannot but be held that if, in consequence of abolishing the system of private rent for agricultural land, it also became  necessary  to  make  some  provision  for  the outgoing  landlords,  the  classification  of  the landlords in the basis of their net incomes at the time of their expropriation was a necessary, and not an unreasonable, classification.”<br/> <br/><strong>165.</strong>     In Sheikh Abdus Sabur (supra), this court held: “Equality before law” is not to be interpreted in its absolute sense to hold that all persons are equal in all respects disregarding different conditions and circumstances in which they are placed or special qualities and characteristics which some of them may possess but which are lacking in others. The term ‘protection of equal law’ is used to mean that all persons or things are not equal in all cases and that persons similarl situated should be treated alike. Equal protection is the guarantee that similar people will be dealt with in a similar way and that people of different circumstances will not be treated as if they were the same. A single law therefore cannot he applied uniformly to all persons disrega-rding their basic  differences  with  others;  and  if  these differences are identified, then the persons or things may be classified into different categories according to  those  distinctions; this  is what is called ‘permissible criteria’ or “intelligible differentia”,, The Legislature while proceeding to make law with certain object in view, which is either to remove some evil or to confer some benefit, has power to make classification on reasonable basis. Classification of persons for the purpose of legislation is different from class legisl-ation, which is forbidden. T stand  the test of ‘equality’ a classification, besides being based on intelligent differentia, must have reasonable nexus with the object the legislature intends to achieve by making the classification. A classification is reasonable if it aims at giving special treatment to a backward section of the population; it is also permissible to deal out distributive justice by taxing the privileged class and subsiding the poor section of the people. The above views have been approved in Azizur Rahman (supra).<br/> <br/><strong>166.</strong>     On the above conspectus, we hold the view that almost all the writ petitions except writ petition Nos.  6263 of 2014 and 6264 of 2014 are not maintainable. All judgments except those in writ petition Nos.6263 of 2014 and 6264 of 2014 are set aside. The appeals are, therefore, allowed without any order as to costs with the above observations. C.P. Nos. 1445, 1768, 2133, 2134 and 2320 of 2015 are dismissed. C.P. Nos.1415, 1416, 1417, 1418, 1419, 1420, 1421 of 2015, 703 of 2014, 2026 of 2015, 2295 of 2010, 955 of 2011, 1854 of 2011, 2539 of 2012 and 1782 of 2015 are disposed of with the above observations. Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.644 and 645 of 2015 are dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>167.</strong>     This judgment will have prospective operation so as  not  to  disturb  the  procedure  in  relation  to decisions already rendered.<br/> <br/><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Ed.</strong></span></div></div></div>

One Md. Tayab Ali, the original defendant, on the basis of an agreement for sale obtaining an arbitration award instituted Title Suit No. 166 of 1966 in the First Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka and obtained an <em>ex parte </em>decree. Subsequently, he filed Title Execution Case No. 57 of 1967 procuring a forged Vokalatmana in the name of Pran Bollav Sarker and collusively suppressing all process of this suit   obtained an order of attachment of the suit land on 19.04.1969. Hence, the plaintiff filed the instant suit.<br/> <br/>         Defendant No. 1 filed a written statement denying the statements in the plaint, contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that the plaintiff entered into an agreement with Md. Tayab Ali and a dispute arose whereupon an arbitration was held which ended in an award. The award was placed before the Court in Title Suit No. 166 of 1966. Pran Ballav appeared by filing a Vokalatnama. The case was thereafter transferred to the Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka. During pendency of the suit, by a registered kabala No. 4183 dated 01.03.1971, one Md. Imam Uddin, the predecessor of respondent Nos. 1-8 purchased the entire suit land and got himself impleaded as plaintiff No. 2 in the suit.<br/> <br/>         The suit proceeded and the trial court fixed 20.02.2001 for arguments and, thereafter, decreed the suit in part declaring the <em>ex parte</em> decree dated 13.09.1967 passed in Title Suit No. 166 of 1966 as not binding upon the plaintiff and refused the prayer for declaration of the right, title and interest of plaintiff No. 2 in the suit land on the ground of his failure to produce the deed of purchase dated 01.03.1971.<br/> <br/>         Being aggrieved by the said judgement and decree Md. Imam Uddin filed Title Appeal No. 202 of 2001, renumbered as Title Appeal No. 1 of 2005. Sharafat Ali the defendant No. 9 and Harun-Or-Rashid predecessor of the petitioners herein filed Title Appeal No. 160 of 2001, renumbered as Title Appeal No.1 of 2004 before the District Judge, Dhaka. The learned District Judge transferred both the appeals to the Court of Jananirapatta Bighnakari Oparadh Daman Tribunal for disposal.<br/> <br/>         On 15.05.2007 the said Imam Uddin filed an application in Title Appeal No. 1 of 2005 for producing the aforesaid sale deed dated 01.03.1971 as additional evidence whereupon the defendant raised objection in writing and on hearing both the parties the appellate Court rejected the application for production of additional evidence by order dated 18.01.2010.<br/> <br/>         Being aggrieved by the rejection order passed by the appellate Court on 18.01.2010 the plaintiff filed Civil Revision No.1320 of 2010 before the High Court Division and obtained Rule, which was made absolute by the impugned judgement and order. Hence, the defendant as petitioner has filed the instant civil petition for leave to appeal before this Division.<br/> <br/>         Mr. Shamsul Haque, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that by the impugned judgement the High Court Division has erroneously allowed the opportunity to produce additional evidence by way of a deed of the year 1971, which was not produced within the last 34 years. He further submits that the plaintiff could have produced the deed before the appellate Court or the High Court Division, but did not do so and hence, the High Court Division erroneously allowed extra premium to the plaintiff.<br/> <br/>         Mr. Qamrul Hoque Siddique, learned Advocate appearing for respondent Nos. 1,3-7 &amp; 9-10 made submissions in support of the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division. <br/> <br/>         We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates for the parties concerned, perused the impugned judgement as well as other evidence and materials on record.<br/> <br/>         We find from the judgement of the High Court Division that it was observed that Md. Imam Uddin was added as co-plaintiff by order of the Court on the basis of his being in possession of a deed dated 01.03.1971. This is the very document which was sought to be adduced as additional evidence and the contesting defendant has fought against that order up to this Division and also the addition of the co-plaintiff was opposed on the ground of assignment during pendency of the suit. It was held by the High Court Division that “To arrive at a correct decision and for proper adjudication into the matter in dispute it was necessary to adduce additional evidence so that the learned Court can arrive at a correct decision as to the fate of the suit as well as appeal.” <br/> <br/>         Having perused the evidence and materials on record, we note that the basis of claim of the added plaintiff is the document of the year 1971. Without such evidence the plaintiff will not be able to establish the genealogy and his claim to title in the property.   <br/> <br/>         With regard to production of additional evidence in the appellate Court, Order XLI Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“27 (1) The parties to an appeal shall not be entitled to produce additional evidence, whether oral or documentary, in the Appellate Court. But if-</em><br/><em>(a)the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred has refused to admit evidence which ought to have been admitted, or</em><br/><em>(b) the Appellate Court requires any document to be produced or any witness to be examined to enable it to pronounce judgement, or for any other substantial cause, the Appellate Court may allow such evidence or document to be produced, or witness to be examined.”  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>         Effectively this is an exclusionary provision restricting the production of additional evidence with the exceptions as mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) of rule 27 (1). In the facts of the instant case, in the absence of any order of the appellate Court requiring production of any evidence, any party may, by permission of the appellate Court, produce the deed in question “for any other substantial cause”, as provided in Rule 27 (1) (b).<br/> <br/>         We are of the view that the reasons stated by the High Court Division for allowing the production of the purchase deed dated 01.03.1971 of the added plaintiff is justified. <br/> <br/>         In view of the above discussion, we do not find any reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order. <br/> <br/>         Accordingly, the civil petition for leave to appeal is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

As is appears ex-facie from the records, these evidences include copy of Hotel bills produced by the plaintiff as exhibits 4-4Kha, Copy of Bill of Hotel Tourist Limited produced as Exhibits-5, Copy of Bill of Medical Research Foundation produced as Exhibit-6, Some Envelope and Letters produced as Exhibits 7, 7(ka), 8, 9, 10 etc. among others. And relying upon these evidences by drawing inference from the plaintiff’s conduct subsequent to the granting of divorce, we may safely conclude that the plaintiff’s conduct itself speaks of her intentions to revoke the divorce and continue her marital life with the deceased Manzar Hasan. . . . (25)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (VIII of 1961)</strong><br/><strong>Section 7(3)</strong><br/><strong>By subsequent conduct of any person or party granting the divorce and which subsequent conduct may infer or imply revocation of such a divorce notice, it is to be understood that such subsequent conduct means any act, conduct or even omission to act, passive or impassive, verbal or not verbal etc, which can in all fairness granting the divorce of the person by general standards of behavior of the person either social or personal may be deemed as reasonable under the particular circumstances of the case. Further the insertion of the word “otherwise” in section 7(3) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 has widened the scope and the horizon of a conduct or any number of conduct which might indicate revocation and therefore contemplates   a wide range of conduct by which an act of revocation of divorce may be concluded. . . .(26)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Interpretation of  Statute </strong><br/><strong>As a general principle of rules of interpretation in order to derive the true meaning of any part or portion of a statute, apart from the plain and ordinary meaning of a word the entire statute has to be read in whole and neither in part nor in an isolated manner. One section of a statute cannot be read or understood in isolation of other sections of the particular statute and we do not wish to digress from the settled principles of interpretation. . . . (31)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act (LII of 1974)</strong><br/><strong>Section 6(1)</strong><br/><strong>Upon scrutinizing Section 6, our interpretation</strong><strong> of the law is that Section 6(1) by inserting the word ‘may’ means that a Nikah registrar is empowered to register a divorce only “<u>on</u> application being made to him for such registration”. The word ‘may’ used in Section 6(1) entails that short of an “application” for registration by the “person” or “persons” effecting the divorce, the Nikah Registrar is not empowered to register the divorce, and it has to be only in the event of an application made by the person or persons effecting the divorce that such an application may be entertained. . . .(31)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act (LII of 1974)</strong><br/><strong>Section 6(2)</strong><br/><strong>From the language of sub-section (2) of Section 6, from the use of the word ‘shall’ it is clear that following a divorce or divorce notice and after completion of the statutory 90 days for the divorce to be effective, an application for registration of such divorce is mandatory, and it shall be made orally by the person or persons who has or have affected the divorce. Therefore, as is evident from the language the use of the word ‘shall’ in Section 6(2) expresses the mandatoriness of an application for registration of divorce by the parties effecting the divorce. An application for registration is mandatory and to express the legislative intent, the legislators used the word ‘shall’ to import certainty as to their intent of compulsory registration following a divorce. . . .(32)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act (LII of 1974)</strong><br/><strong>Section 8</strong><br/><strong>Significantly, in Section 8 of the Act, the word ‘shall’ appears twice expressing the intention of the law regarding the mandato-riness of registration and which shall be material proof of divorce. . . . (33)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration Act (LII of 1974)</strong><br/><strong>Section 6(1) and 6(3)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 6(1) and 6(3) of Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974 lead us to draw our conclusion that under the provisions of this section a divorce has to be mandatorily registered before a Nika Registrar just as a marriage has to be compulsorily registered under the provision of the Act.  . . . (35)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, (VIII of 1961)</strong><br/><strong>Section 7</strong><br/><strong>Since the parties, that is the plaintiff and the deceased Manzar Hasan did not appear before the Arbitration Council, they arrived at the conclusion that the divorce was not revoked and they relying upon such presumption proceeded with the Order dated 27.02.2003. In so doing they were performing their official functions as per their procedural Rules, and we do not find any irregularity in their action which led to the Order dated 27.02.2003. . . . (37)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act (LII of 1974) </strong><br/><strong>Section 6(1)</strong><br/><strong>Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (VIII of 1961)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 6(1) and 7(3)</strong><br/><strong>Any divorce under Muslim Law to be effective in the eye of law must be mandatorily registered with in the statutory provisions of section 6(1) of the Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974, but in this case this was not done. Our considered view is that if the plaintiff-respondent had been consistent in her decision and intention to divorce and the consequence of the divorce to be effective, after the completion of ninety days and upon complying with other procedural duties she would have taken steps to register the divorce, but her inaction in this case proves otherwise. Our finding are strengthened  by the material exhibits produced before the Trial Court showing subsistence of the marriage after issuance of the divorce notice, and, therefore, we may safely conclude that in all practicalities she actually by various explicit and implicit conduct revoked the divorce within the provision of section 7(3) of Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961. . . .

In the said Title Suit, plaintiff has prayed for a declaration that the marriage vide registered Nikha Nama No. SL 166 Page-12 dated 18.08.1995 as well as the relationship between the plaintiff and her husband Late Manzar Hasan as husband and wife subsisted till his death on 24.04.2005 including some other reliefs.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>      The plaintiff’s case in a nutshell is that the cause of action for filing the suit by the plaintiff-respondent arose on 29.11.2005 when the defendant–appellants filed a succession case being no.1263 of 2005 in the court of Joint District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka by suppressing actual facts, and subsequently the succession case was allowed and being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the same, the plaintiff filed a Revocation Miscellaneous Case being no. 46 of 2006 for cancellation of succession certificate, and, thereafter, the Title Suit and the Miscellaneous Case were heard analogously and disposed of by a single judgment decreeing the suit and allowing the Revocation Miscellaneous Case.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>      The plaintiff stated in her plaint that she got married to the deceased Manzar Hasan on 18<sup>th</sup> August, 1995 and was leading normal conjugal life. The deceased Manzar Hasan was an executive at DUNCAN BROTHERS LTD, and at the cost of the said company, the plaintiff and deceased Manzar Hasan enjoyed several benefits as a couple including travelling abroad. During his life time Manzar Hasan by swearing an Affidavit adopted the plaintiff’s son, namely Tanzim Hasan through her first husband and even during their travels abroad the plaintiff and the deceased Manzar Hasan were also accompanied by their only son Mr. Tanzim Hasan and the plaintiff states in the plaint that she had continued her marital life and performed her marital obligations and lived together as husband and wife till death of her husband Manzar Hasan. As an adopted son of Manzar Hasan, the plaintiff’s son was also granted the stipend by DUNCAN BROTHERS (BD) LTD. according to their own rules and regulations. The plaintiff lead a happy conjugal life though they had no child was born through her wedlock with Manzar Hasan. The plaintiff states in her plaint that the defendant-appellants on several occasions provoked a discord between her husband and herself to disturb their conjugal life on various pretexts and also tried to influence the deceased to revoke his adoption of the plaintiff’s son and after their return from a pleasure trip abroad, arising out of a certain incident an altercation took place between the deceased and the plaintiff which was personal in nature and which caused the plaintiff agony and following the altercation in her mental agony she went to consult an Advocate namely Mr. Shah Alam on 20.11.2002 and discussed with him about a certain matter and asked the Advocate to send a notice to Manzar Hasan on his behalf. She also states that she never went to any Notary Public for swearing Affidavit on divorce and the signature of the Witness No. 1 in the Affidavit was forged and Witness No.2 is unknown to her and she never instructed the lawyer to draft any Affidavit of divorce and send it to Municipal Corporation and no notice of such Affidavit was ever served to deceased Manzar Hasan or to the Nikah Registrar for registration. She states that following her visit to the Advocate she returned home and resumed her conjugal life normally with her husband. After about 1 and ½ months the deceased husband received a notice under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 from the office of Municipal Corporation. After receiving the same, both the plaintiff and her deceased husband were surprised with the contents of the notice which was regarding a proceeding taken up by the Municipal Corporation. Suspecting a conspiracy to jeopardize their happy, conjugal life and suspecting that the defendant no. 1-6 conspired collusively to start a conciliation proceeding on 24.12.2002   being Arbitration Case  No. 2825 of 2002 but that the order No.1 dated 24.12.2002 does not speak anything upon the basis of which the conciliation proceeding was started, and there is also nothing on record to show that under the provision of Muslim Marriages and Divorce (Registration) Act, 1974 and the rules thereunder framed in 1975 that any registered Talaknama was ever placed before the Chairman of the alleged Conciliation Board. It is also stated in the plaint that the arbitration proceeding is illegal, malafide and without jurisdiction. That pursuant to this notice from the  Municipal Corporation the plaintiff and the deceased husband Manzar Hasan also sought advice from a senior lawyer on the issue who advised them that the conciliation case being initiated without any proper legal document, which is without jurisdiction and has no legal effect and was not binding upon them. Moreover, the alleged proceeding was disposed of with a finding on <strong>27.02.2003</strong> and that finding was not in accordance with law, because <u>registration of “<em>Talaq-i-tafweez</em>” in the office of the Nika Registrar is compulsory</u>, and the alleged Affidavit by way of unilateral declaration has no value in the eye of law. Being so advised and assured by a senior lawyer that it was not necessary to proceed further on the issue, they continued to live together as husband and wife and subsequently after this incident the plaintiff performed her marital duties with all marital obligations including accompanying the deceased to India for the purpose of treatment of her deceased husband Manzar Hasan.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>      Subsequent to these events, the plaintiff and her deceased husband Manzar Hasan decided to purchase an apartment in Dhaka, and executed a loan agreement where the plaintiff was a co-applicant with some necessary registered documents in order to avail the loan facilities to purchase the apartment jointly in their name as husband and wife. It is stated in the plaint that from these facts inter-alia others, it is clearly evident that the plaintiff and the deceased Manzar Hasan lived together as husband and wife till the death of her husband and only after his death following the succession case filed by the defendant-appellants, the plaintiff at one stage communicated with DUNCAN BROTERHS LTD. who ultimately advised her to settle the succession case before she could obtain any of the facilities which may be due to her as wife of the deceased Manzar Hasan. And it is evident from the order sheet that the defendant no.8 started illegal proceedings being Arbitration Case No. 2825 of 2002 on 24.12.2002 without any document of registered Talaknama from the office of Nikah Registrar and according to the provisions contained under Clause 6 of the Muslim Marriages and Divorce (Registration Act.), 1974, the Registration of “<em>Talaq-i-tafweez</em>” either by the husband or wife is compulsory and mandatory. But in the present case this provision was not exhausted and an unilateral declaration only, by way of affidavit does not carry any legal value. The said proceedings being instituted without any proper documents and being an ex-parte decision, thereof, is wholly unauthorized, illegal and void and not binding upon the plaintiff. The defendant No. 1-6 in collusion with the staffs of the Dhaka City Corporation fraudulently started the aforesaid illegal proceedings to deprive the plaintiff form her legal right. The entire proceedings of the Arbitration Case No. 2825 of 2002 are tainted with fraud. The plaintiff prays for calling all papers and documents of the entire proceedings of the Arbitration Case which are in custody of the Defendant nos. 7-8. And under Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 the period of limitation is 90 days for cancellation of the matter and the impugned <strong>Order No. 4 dated 27.02.2003</strong> confirming Talak by the defendant No. 8 without any basis and legal documents is illegal, without jurisdiction and not binding upon the Plaintiff. Furthermore under Section-7(4) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance-1961 that failure of the Arbitration council is inconsequential and under the Registration Act the registration of “<em>Talaq-i-tafweez</em>” is mandatory by the Nikah Registrar and in absence of such registration the initiation of Arbitration proceedings in the absence of both parties who are the interested persons is of no avail. The entire proceedings of the arbitration case initiated by the defendant no. 1-6 was done in a planned way, collusively and as well as the impugned order <strong>dated 27.02.2003</strong> arising out of the Arbitration proceeding so obtained by them is ex-facie illegal, malafide and without jurisdiction.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>      The defendant no. 1, 2 and 6 entered appearance through filing a written statement on their behalf where the said defendants basically denied all the allegations of the plaintiff and stated that Advocate Shah Alam being approached by the defendant confirmed to the defendant that the plaintiff had herself approached for the divorce and duly put her signature on the divorce notice and it was also signed by the plaintiff and the mother of the plaintiff also signed as a witness therein. An Affidavit of divorce was drafted upon her instruction and was filed by the plaintiff herself before the Municipal Corporation, and following the execution of divorce she never lived with Manzar Hasan anymore, and though she was aware of the notice of divorce she did not withdraw the same, and, thereafter, did not take any other steps. The defendant in their written statement denying the plaintiff’s claim in contrary stated that pursuant to the said notice in the year 2002, she never lived with the deceased or otherwise took care of Manzar Hasan during his illness. They stated that after completion of 90 days, on <strong>27.02.2003</strong> the divorce being final, thereafter, she was no longer a legal wife or successor of late Manzar Hasan and that is why she was not impleaded as a party in the Succession Case no. 1263 of 2005 and that the plaintiff has no locus-standi to  challenge the signature of the defendant or to file the instant case and further stated in their written statement that the divorce was executed on <strong>27.02.2003</strong> i.e. before the death of Manzar Hasan on <strong>24.04.2005</strong>, and the plaintiff on 06.06.2005 applied before the Dhaka City Corporation <u>for cancellation and for revocation</u> of her divorce notice i.e. after two years of execution of divorce. As per Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, an application for revocation after the statutory period of 90 days does not lie and is unlawful and after the death of Manzar Hasan the plaintiff is trying to concoct a story to fulfill her ulterior motive of appropriating the property of late Manzar Hasan resorting to fraudulence and illegal means.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>      The defendants no. 1, 2 and 6 in their written statement also stated that  according to Section 7(1) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, there is no scope to cancel the divorce after expiry of stipulated 90days, and, as such, the Dhaka City Corporation did not respond to the same, which is evident by the order dated 28.06.2005 passed in Arbitration Case No. 2825 of 2002 by the concerned authority of DCC. After issuance of divorce notice, the plaintiff lead an immoral life and after the death of Manzar Hasan only she filed the instant case claiming herself as the legal successor of Manzar Hasan with the ulterior motive and intention to grab his property though she was no more a legal successor of Manzar Hasan, and, as such, she is not a necessary party in the Succession Case being no. 1263 of 2005.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>      The defendant nos. 7 and 8 also entered appearance by filing written statement on behalf of DCC represented by its Mayor and the Chairman, Arbitration Board and Law officer, DCC respectively, in which they basically stated that following the divorce notice they had issued notices duly in accordance with law, both to the plaintiff and deceased Manzar Hasan to appear before them for cancellation of the proceedings. But none of the parties appeared before the Arbitration Council even after receiving the notices. Subsequently on <strong>27.02.2003</strong> upon expiry of 90 days none of the parties being present before the Arbitration Council, consequently the Arbitration Council disposed of the proceeding with an order in accordance with the provision of Section 7 (1) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961,and thereupon the parties not responding to the conciliation proceeding automatically the divorce was effective from the date of the order dated 27.02.2003. The plaintiff made an application on 06.06.2005 for reconsideration of the order dated 27.02.2003 passed by the Arbitration Council but according to the rules of the Arbitration Council there was no scope of reviewing the order since the parties were not present before the Arbitration Council at the conciliation proceeding. As per clause 7 (1) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, the divorce become effective after the expiry of 90 days i.e. from 27.02.2003.  <br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>      The Trial Court framed 5 issues in the suit. A single plaintiff witness deposed from the side of the plaintiff while 3 defendant’s witnesses deposed from the side of the defendants. The documents produced by the plaintiff have been exhibited as exhibit 1 to 13 Ka. The defendant produced exhibits which is marked as exhibit -Ka to Ta (<strong>cÖ`k©Yx K-Z</strong>) series. Upon consideration of those materials on record, the Trial Court decreed the suit by the impugned judgment and decree, against which the instant appeal has been brought.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>      Learned Advocate Mr. M. Qumrul Haque Siddique along with Mr. Md. Bazlur Hasan appeared on behalf of the appellants while Learned Advocate Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali along with Mrs. Rubayat Hossain and Mrs. Bilkis Jahan appeared on behalf of the respondent.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    Mr. M. Qumrul Haque Siddique in support of the appellants asserts that after sending the divorce notice, the plaintiff never again lived with deceased Manzar Hasan and further assails that even though the Municipal Corporation sent the notices under the provisions of the relevant laws, neither the plaintiff-respondent nor the deceased Manzar Hasan appeared before the Arbitration Council. Upon this point, that neither parties appeared before the Arbitration Council he stresses that the non-appearance of the parties itself is an evidence that the plaintiff-respondent did not take any steps to revoke the notice at any stage within 90 days. Against the plaintiff’s claim that there was evidence on  record to show that she had continued living together as a married couple with the deceased Manzar Hasan after the said notice, even after the ‘notice’ the Learned Advocate for the Appellant submits that whatever evidence the plaintiff might have produced those are not relevant to prove revocation since she cannot bypass the law. The learned Counsel mainly argues that following the notice the Municipal Corporation had issued, following receipt of the Affidavit of divorce and in due course of law, in accordance with the provision of Section 7 (4) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 the Municipal Corporation had taken necessary steps to bring about a reconciliation between the parties but to which the parties did not respond.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    Following a query from us, the learned Counsel submits that registration of divorce is not compulsory under the Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974. Since following the notice from the Arbitration Council the parties did not take any steps towards reconciliation, it is also evident that the revocation was intended, and, therefore, the divorce became effective after expiry of the statutory 90 days. He drew our attention to the evidence produced by the plaintiff-respondent before the Trial Court showing that they lived together as husband and wife following the notice. The learned counsel contends that the Order of Arbitration Council and proceeding of the Arbitration Council is on record which is a public document. Through his argument he stresses on the point that section 114 (e) of the Evidence Act, provides for <u>presumption of regularity to any judicial act and official act regularly performed, and there arises a presumption  of regularity of official proceeding</u> and which can in no way be over looked. He tries to impress upon us his contention that the arbitration proceeding being a “public record” the regularity of such may be normally presumed under the law. Therefore, whatever documentary evidences the plaintiff might have produced showing subsistence of the marriage, such evidence cannot override a ‘public document’ and under the law a public document prevails over any other evidence.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    He concludes his submissions assailing that the arbitration proceedings and the order arising out of a public document had made the divorce final and effective, and, therefore, no registration being mandatory under the Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974, the divorce was in consequence ‘complete’ on <strong>27.02.2003</strong> and after expiry of 90 days there is no question of subsistence of the marriage, and, therefore, the Judgment and Decree of the Trial Court ought to be set-aside and the appeal may be allowed.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    On the other hand, the Learned Advocate Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali appearing for the plaintiff-respondent opens his submissions by drawing our attention upon several documentary evidences produced as exhibits before the Trial Court which he claims are “proofs” to show that even if the divorce notice was sent and it was genuine one it was only given at the heat of momentary anger. He persuades us that the various exhibits produced as evidences, for example hotel tickets, travel documents etc.  are evidence enough that the marriage was continuing and submits that these documents facilitates to prove that the plaintiff-respondent continued to live together with Manzar Hasan as his lawful  and wife.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    During course of the submissions of the Learned Advocate for the respondent we had pointed out to the learned counsel for the Respondent the submission of the appellants that once the order of the arbitration council is passed, it is treated as a “public record” and presuming regularity of such record it became effective from 27.02.2003. Against such contention the Learned Advocate contrary to the submission of the defendant-appellants submits that the arbitration council can “call upon” for a reconciliation “only” between the parties, but he contends that if the parties are absent, the arbitration council has no authority to decide whether revocation has at all taken place or not. Moreover he persuades that whether revocation has actually taken place or not, it is only the husband and wife who can declare it, and no third party is entitled or competent for such declaration, and in this case neither defendant-appellants nor the arbitration council can be considered to be “competent” parties. He further argues that the defendant-appellants with their ulterior motives whatsoever, executed the Succession Case, and stresses upon the point that the divorce and revocation is eventually a ‘personal matter’ between two persons i.e. husband and wife only. He takes us to the provisions of divorce under the Muslim law where he draws our attention to the different forms of Talak. He takes us through the present form of Talak with reference to the case in hand that is “<em>Talaq-i-tafweez</em>” under the Muslim Laws and which is a delegated power to grant a Talaq or divorce delegated by the husband to the wife. He specially lays emphasis on the term “otherwise” as used in Section 7(3) of Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961, that a revocation may be affected by the conduct of a party, and that in the case before us the plaintiff-respondent wife is the relevant party. He contends that the evidence of the conduct of the wife continuing their married life together is already on record through the production of documents, and, therefore, no further proof is necessary. Against the arguments of the appellants pertaining to a “record” of the arbitration council being a “public record” and that a “presumption of regularity” arises out of such public record, the learned counsel for the respondent argues that, given that, it is true that it is a “public record” yet in this case the connected laws have laid down the conditions of revocation which is provided for under section 7(3)  of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961. Furthermore, he controverts the submissions of the learned Advocate for the Appellants regarding registration of divorce under the Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974, and assails that under Section 6 of the said Act it is mandatory to register the divorce, and since following the notice the plaintiff-respondent’s divorce was not registered, and from the evidences adduced and from the record it shows that there was no registration of the divorce, therefore, it is to be obviously concluded that the marriage was subsisting between the plaintiff-respondent and deceased Manzar Hasan till the death of the Manzar Hasan and the plaintiff-respondent continued to be his lawful wife till the death of the deceased. In pursuance of his arguments the learned counsel stresses that the defendant-appellants filed the succession Case “unlawfully” by excluding the plaintiff-respondent from her rights and benefits as a lawful widow of the deceased.  He lastly asserts that the Judgment and Decree of the Trial Court was correctly given, and, therefore, the instant appeal being not maintainable is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    We have heard the learned Advocates from both sides, perused the materials on record including the deposition made by the witnesses and gone through the exhibits. Upon scrutinizing the deposition made by the witnesses, we have noticed that the deposition of the P.W.-1 which is the plaintiff herself, it is true that we have found some inconsistencies in her statements during the trial and which are inconsistencies mainly appearing from her statements related to the divorce notice. It is stated in the plaint that following an altercation with the deceased Manzar Hasan, the plaintiff had gone to meet the Advocate and he had narrated some facts and events to the Advocate “and asked him to send a notice in her name to Manzar Hasan”. But as we find, there are no clarification or explanation regarding the nature of the Notice. While in her examination in chief she at one point deposes “<strong>njdbvgv Z</strong><strong>Â</strong><strong>Kx I Rvj</strong>” while at the time of cross-examination she at one stage deposes “mB w`‡qwQjvg g‡b nq” The phrase “g‡b nq” however leaves an ample area of uncertainty and makes reliability of her statements questionable.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    On the other hand the defendant no.2 deposed as DW-1 in the suit who is the brother of the defendant no.1 and he stereotypically denied the subsistence of the marriage, and D.W. 2 is the cousin of the defendant no.1 and from his deposition it appears before us that the D.W. 2 was not very knowledgeable and conversant of the facts and circumstances of the marital status or the personal affairs of the deceased. DW.3 appeared on behalf of the defendant no. 7 and 8 and he more or less repeats from the record i.e. the order dated 27.02.2003 and deposes basically echoing whatever there is on record, and it is evident that he has no personal knowledge of the matter.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    But after hearing the learned Advocates and examining the records and documents and taking all aspects including the relevant laws into consideration, we are able to appreciate that in this particular case, the position of the relevant laws regarding registration of divorce and the supporting evidences in the case including that of the plaintiff’s claim to revocation demands our attention.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    The learned Advocate for the appellants had argued that the divorce became effective upon the order dated 27.02.2003 passed by the arbitration council and upon expiry of 90 days, since no “revocation was initiated” by the plaintiff. It is also insisted upon by the Learned Advocate for the Appellants that registration of divorce is not mandatory. Keeping all these aspects in mind including the documents and evidences produced by the parties and the submissions of the  Learned Advocates from both sides, we have  looked into the relevant laws mainly the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 and the Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1974. Section 7(3) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance provides for revocation either ‘expressly’ or ‘otherwise’. Now, the learned Advocate for the appellants had brought up an issue on point of law regarding presumption of regularity of Public documents in accordance with the provisions of Section 114(e) of the Evidence Act, 1872. Section 114(e) of the Evidence Act, 1872, is reproduced below ;<br/>114. The Court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Illustrations</em><br/>The Court may presume-<br/>(e) that judicial and official acts have been regularly performed</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    It is true that according to the provision of Section 114(e) of the Evidence Act, normally a presumption of regularity arises against a public record, and in this case we are not here actually questioning regularity of such record, and the arbitration council though is performing their duty which is basically an attempt to bring about a reconciliation between the parties, but non appearance before the arbitration council is not necessarily a conclusive evidence that the divorce is complete and effective from a given prescribed time.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    There is no reason for us to undermine the presumption of regularity of public record and under Section 114(e) of Evidence Act, regularity in public records is to be presumed, but however we cannot over look the law or bypass the law as it exists and cannot also overlook the evidences placed before the Court.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    Let us take a look into the provision of Section 7(3) of Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 where from we can derive an idea of the preconditions of revocation. Section 7(3) of Muslim Family Laws Ordinance,1961 reads as under;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Save as provided in sub-section (5), a talaq, unless revoked earlier, expressly or otherwise, shall not be effective until the expiration of ninety days from the day on which notice under sub-section (1) is delivered to the Chairman”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    From a perusal of the above, it appears before us that revocation of a divorce is not confined to only “expressly” or directly by revoking the notice of Talaq or divorce following the prescribed procedures. Besides, “express” revocation, the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 has also provided for revocation “otherwise”, The definition of the expression ‘otherwise’ in its ordinary sense and as we also find in Oxford Learner’s Dictionary <u>generally means in circumstances different from those present or considered</u>. Accordingly, perceptibly so, “otherwise” connotes and entails a wide range of circumstances by which divorce may be presumed or understood to have been revoked.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>    Upon our research in to the prescribed pre-conditions of revocation and the position of the existing laws in this context, we have found it pertinent to examine the position of the relevant law as it stood prior to the enactment of Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961. We have perused the provisions of divorce including the pre-conditions provided for revocation of divorce prior to the enactment of Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961, as stated in Mulla’s Principles of Mahomedan Law. For our purposes we are quoting from the provision of Section 312 of Mulla’s Principles of Mahomedan Law Nineteenth Edition which reads thus;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Until a talak becomes irrevocable, the husband has the option to revoke it which may be done either expressly, or implied as by resuming sexual intercourse.<br/>: Hedaya 103-104; Baillie-287-288</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>24.</strong>    From a perusal of the proviso above, as the source of which is Hedaya 103-104 and Baillie 207-208, it is evident that the history of the law of revocation of a divorce or Talak is that previously the position, according to Sharia Law was that a revocation had to be “express” or “implied as by resuming sexual intercourse”. Accordingly it is evident that before Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 came into force, the pre-conditions of revocation was confined within a narrow sphere of “express” revocation or by “resuming sexual intercourse”. No other modes of revocation was contemplated in the Muslim Law as it stood then. But with the enactment of Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961, the position of the law changed and the legislature significantly brought about a much broader perspective to revocation. The word “otherwise” provided for in Section 7(3) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961  clearly comes to our aid in appreciating the intention of the legislators to broaden the scope of revocation and  the other conditions of revocation from the confines of “express” revocation or by resuming sexual intercourse only. The use of word ‘otherwise’ clearly shows that the new law, that is the Muslim Family Law Ordinance, 1961  provided that a revocation of divorce could be presumed or concluded by taking into consideration any other reasonable conduct of the parties subsequent to granting the divorce, either explicit or implicit whatsoever and which is evident and clear by the insertion of the word “otherwise”. For our purpose to determine the primary and substantive issue over which the parties are before us, that is what was the marital status as between the plaintiff and the deceased Manzar Hasan at the time of the death of Manzar Hasan, we have undergone a scrutiny and interpretation of Section 7(3) of the Muslim Family Law Ordinance, 1961 and upon an interpretation of Section 7(3) of Muslim Family Laws Ordinance,1961, and especially upon an analysis of the word ‘otherwise’ as it appears in the statute of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance,1961. Parallelly, for our purposes we have also examined and taken into consideration the documentary evidences produced as exhibits before the Trial Court showing relevant and material proof that actually the plaintiff and the deceased Manzar Hasan lived together as husband and wife following the Divorce Notices issued by the plaintiff.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>    And it is our view, that these documentary evidences provide ample material proof that the Talaq or divorce in the instant case was “otherwise” revoked through the conduct of the parties in accordance with the provisions of the Muslim Family Law Ordinance,1961. As is appears ex-facie from the records, these evidences include copy of Hotel bills produced by the plaintiff as exhibits 4-4Kha, Copy of Bill of Hotel Tourist Limited produced as Exhibits-5, Copy of Bill of Medical Research Foundation produced as Exhibit-6, Some Envelope and Letters produced as Exhibits 7, 7(ka), 8, 9, 10 etc. among others. And relying upon these evidences by drawing inference from the plaintiff’s conduct subsequent to the granting of divorce, we may safely conclude that the plaintiff’s conduct itself speaks of her intentions to revoke the divorce and continue her marital life with the deceased Manzar Hasan.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>    In this context we also feel it necessary to make an observation that by subsequent conduct of any person or party granting the divorce and which subsequent conduct may infer or imply revocation of such a divorce notice, it is to be understood that such subsequent conduct means any act, conduct or even omission to act, passive or impassive, verbal or not verbal etc, which can in all fairness granting the divorce of the person by general standards of behavior of the person either social or personal may be deemed as reasonable under the particular circumstances of the case. Further the insertion of the word “otherwise” in section 7(3) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 has widened the scope and the horizon of a conduct or any number of conduct which might indicate revocation and therefore contemplates   a wide range of conduct by which an act of revocation of divorce may be concluded.<br/> <br/><strong>27.    </strong>The learned Advocate for the plaintiff-respondent in his submissions also raised the issue of compulsory registration of divorce and contended that in this case the divorce was not registered and registration of divorce is “compulsory” in accordance with the provisions of Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>    We have examined the relevant Laws with relation to registration of divorce under the provisions of Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974, where section 6 is the relevant part and applicable to our case, Section 6(1) of the Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974 provides for the necessity of the divorce being registered upon an application by the spouse who is granting the divorce and it can be either the husband or it can be the wife by dint of delegated power under the purview of “<em>Talaq-i-tafweez</em>”.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>    Section 6(1) of the Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974 reads as under;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“A Nikah Registrar may register divorce effected under Muslim Law within his jurisdiction on application being made to him for such registration”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>30.</strong>    Upon queries made by us, the learned Advocate for the plaintiff-respondent persuaded that the word “may” in Section 6(1) actually implies the mandatoriness of registration of divorce. He asserts that from a close reading of Section 6 of the Marriage and Divorce Registration Act,1974, it is to be understood that the statute calls for compulsory registration of divorce.  In pursuance of the submissions made by the learned Advocate we also embark upon an examination of the said Section 6 of the Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974. For our purposes of a proper analysis the whole of Section 6 is quoted below;<br/><br/><strong><u>Registration of divorce</u></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">A Nikah Regsitrar may register divorce effected under Muslim Law within his jurisdiction on application being made to him for such registration.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">An application for registration of a divorce shall be made orally by the person or persons who has or have effected the divorce :Provided that if the woman be a <em>paradanashin, </em>such application may be made by her duly authorized Vakil.   </li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Nikah Registrar shall not register a divorce of the kind known as <em>Talaq-i-tafweez</em> except on the production of a document registered under the Registration Act, 1908, by which the husband delegated the power of divorce to the wife or of an attested copy of any entry in the register of marriages showing that such delegation has been made.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Where the Nikah Regsitrar refuses to register a divorce, the person or persons who applied for such registration may, within thirty days of such refusal, prefer an appeal to the Registrar and the order passed by the Registrar on such appeal shall be final.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>31.</strong>    The learned Advocate for the defendant-appellants took us to Section 6 (1) of the Marriages and Divorces Registration Act, 1974 and drew our attention to the word ‘may’ and tried to impress upon us that by using the word ‘may’ the legislators implied that registration of divorce is not mandatory, and is only a matter of choice of option of the concerned party. But, after examination of the whole statute, our considered view is that the argument of the learned Advocate for the appellants surrounding the interpretation of the word ‘may’ as in Section 6(1) is not correct. As a general principle of rules of interpretation in order to derive the true meaning of any part or portion of a statute, apart from the plain and ordinary meaning of a word the entire statute has to be read in whole and neither in part nor in an isolated manner. One section of a statute cannot be read or understood in isolation of other sections of the particular statute and we do not wish to digress from the settled principles of interpretation. In keeping with such principles and upon scrutinizing Section 6, our interpretation of the law is that Section 6(1) by inserting the word ‘may’ means that a Nikah registrar is empowered to register a divorce only “<u>on</u> application being made to him for such registration” The word ‘may’ used in Section 6(1) entails that short of an “application” for registration by the “person” or “persons” effecting the divorce, the Nikah Registrar is not empowered to register the divorce, and it has to be only in the event of an application made by the person or persons effecting the divorce that such an application may be entertained. We have been able to arrive at this interpretation only after a careful perusal of sub-sections following sub-section 6(1) in particular in pursuance of a careful scrutiny of Section 6(2) of the Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974.<br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong>    From the language of sub-section (2) of Section 6, from the use of the word ‘shall’ it is clear that following a divorce or divorce notice and after completion of the statutory 90 days for the divorce to be effective, an application for registration of such divorce is mandatory, and it shall be made orally by the person or persons who has or have affected the divorce. Therefore, as is evident from the language the use of the word ‘shall’ in Section 6(2) expresses the mandatoriness of an application for registration of divorce by the parties effecting the divorce. An application for registration is mandatory and to express the legislative intent, the legislators used the word ‘shall’ to import certainty as to their intent of compulsory registration following a divorce. And upon perusal and examination of the statute, it is also clear that upon receiving an application under Section 6(2), the Nikah Registrar is legally duty bound to register the same. As to our finding that the Nikah Registrar is to compulsorily register the divorce under Section 6(1) following an application for registration under Section 6(2) made by the parties effecting the divorce, the legislative intent of compulsory registration becomes more transparent upon a perusal of Section 8 of Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1974 which comes to our aid in strengthening our finding and interpretation of the law. Section 8 of Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974, reads as under;<br/><strong>Registers</strong>- Every Nikah Registrar  shall maintain separate registers of marriages and divorces in such forms as may be prescribed and all entries in each such register shall be numbered in a consecutive series, a fresh series being commenced at the beginning of each year.<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong>    Significantly, in Section 8 of the Act, the word ‘shall’ appears twice expressing the intention of the law regarding the mandatoriness of registration and which shall be material proof of divorce.<br/> <br/><strong>34.</strong>    Keeping in mind the facts and circumstances of the case in hand, we also find Section 6(3) relevant for our purpose. Likewise, we opine that the submissions of learned Advocate for the plaintiff-respondent and upon interpretation of the whole of section 6, it is our considered view that registration of divorce with the Nika Registrar is actually mandatory upon an application made to him by a party granting the divorce and without such registration, divorce will not be lawfully effective. In arriving at such a finding we have compared section 6(1) with section 6 (3) of Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974. Section 6(3) of Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974 reads as below;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The Nikah Registrar shall not register a divorce of the kind known as </em>“<em>Talaq-i-tafweez</em>”<em> except on the production of a document registered under the Registration Act, 1908, by which the husband delegated the power of divorce to the wife or of an attested copy of any entry in the register of marriages showing that such delegation has been made.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>35.</strong>    Therefore, Section 6(3) quite expressly states that in the event of  “<em>Talaq-i-tafweez</em>” the divorce shall be registered, The language used in section 6(3) entails that an application for registration may be entertains only upon the production of a document registered under the Registration Act, 1908 by which the wife is empowered to grant divorce by virtue of a delegated power <u>and delegated by the husband</u>. Since in the case in hand the grantor of the divorce is the wife by dint of delegated power, therefore, we found it relevant to discuss the subsection 3 and in this case the Nikah registrar could only register the divorce upon production of the registered document required for the purpose.  <br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong>    It is a general rule of interpretation that the true intent of a statute to be construed is must be read wholly and not in part, and, therefore, we also here do not have any scope to interpret the statute by reading it only in part, and in this case we have read and examined the Sections and sub-sections all together.  Sections 6(1) and 6(3) of Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974 lead us to draw our conclusion that under the provisions of this section a divorce has to be mandatorily registered before a Nika Registrar just as a marriage has to be compulsorily registered under the provision of the Act.  Section 8 of the same Act provides for maintenance of separate registers of marriages and divorces in prescribed forms and procedures. Section 8 reads as under :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>Registers</strong>- Every Nikah Registrar  shall maintain separate registers of marriages and divorces in such forms as may be prescribed and all entries in each such register shall be numbered in a consecutive series, a fresh series being commenced at the beginning of each year.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>37.</strong>    Upon a perusal of Section 8 of the Act, we find that there is a provision for maintaining separate register for marriages and divorce and that every Nikah Registrar ‘shall’ maintain such registers. Upon interpretation of the word ‘shall’ in section 8 of the Act, we may safely come to the finding that no discrimination or difference has been made by the legislators upon the mandatoriness of registration either marriage or divorce, whatsoever, the case may be.<br/> <br/><strong>38.    </strong>As against the appellant’s assertion of presumption of regularity provided under section 114(e) of the Evidence Act, 1872. In the case before us, the issue of presumption as to regularity of a public record arises, primarily inferring to the regularity of the order passed by the Arbitration council dated 27.02.2003 in pursuance of the provisions of Section 7 of Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961. We have examined the records including the order dated 27.02.2003 passed by the concerned authorities and we do not here question the “regularity” of such order, presuming that the Order passed was neither irregular nor debatable. Our considered view is that, since the parties, that is the plaintiff and the deceased Manzar Hasan did not appear before the Arbitration Council, they arrived at the conclusion that the divorce was not revoked and they relying upon such presumption proceeded with the Order dated 27.02.2003. In so doing they were performing their official functions as per their procedural Rules, and we do not find any irregularity in their action which led to the Order dated 27.02.2003. But, whatever procedural Rules they might follow, these cannot circumvent or bypass the law, nor can it circumvent or prevail over the substantive issue, that is whether the divorce was actually revoked or not. Such issue can be addressed only by resorting to the relevant laws especially the Muslim Family Laws and Ordinance, 1961 and the acts of the parties as they appear before us by evidences adduced during Trial. The Trial Court also observed that the concerned Advocate Mr. Shah Alam who had allegedly sent the divorce notice was not even brought in the Court  as a witness and had observed that the onus of bringing the said Advocate as a witness lay upon the defendant- appellants.<br/> <br/><strong>39.    </strong>Besides, as we discussed hereto above, we have taken into consideration the relevant laws and the material evidences produced before the Court as exhibits in proof of revocation and we cannot over look either the law or the documentary evidences. The Trial Court in its Judgment relied primarily upon the evidences placed before it showing material proof of the continuance and subsistence of the marriage between the plaintiff and the deceased till death of the deceased. The Trial Court however, arrived at his finding relying primarily upon the evidences produced before it. But while the case is before us, we first looked into and examined the relevant laws which we have elaborated upon and analyzed elsewhere in this Judgment and to corroborate our findings and conclusion, in support, we have also placed our reliance upon the documentary evidences produced before the Trial Court.<br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong>    However, keeping in mind the evidences also we arrived at our findings from a different point of view from that of the Trial Court. As we discussed earlier above any divorce under Muslim Law to be effective in the eye of law must be mandatorily registered with in the statutory provisions of section 6(1) of the Marriages and Divorce Registration Act, 1974, but in this case this was not done. Our considered view is that if the plaintiff-respondent had been consistent in her decision and intention to divorce and the consequence of the divorce to be effective, after the completion of ninety days and upon complying with other procedural duties she would have taken steps to register the divorce, but her inaction in this case proves otherwise. Our finding are strengthened  by the material exhibits produced before the Trial Court showing subsistence of the marriage after issuance of the divorce notice, and, therefore, we may safely conclude that in all practicalities she actually by various explicit and implicit conduct revoked the divorce within the provision of section 7(3) of Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961.<br/> <br/><strong>41.</strong>    We do not find it necessary to elaborate or analyze the factual submissions or statements made by the parties as to their contention regarding the marital status between the plaintiff and the deceased at the time of the death of the deceased Manzar Hossain. We may draw our conclusion placing reliance on the related and relevant laws and corroborated by the documentary evidences produced by the plaintiff.<br/> <br/><strong>42.</strong>    Therefore, under the facts and circumstances we arrive at our finding that the divorce notice which was allegedly issued by the plaintiff-respondent was ultimately revoked and which is apparent from various subsequent actions and inactions of the plaintiff-respondent. On a perusal of the judgment, we are of the opinion that the Trial Court correctly arrived upon a proper finding upon scrutiny of the records and upon proper examination of the deposition and other materials available before it, in conformity with the provisions of law and under the foregoing facts and circumstances and taking into consideration the records available before us, we find that the impugned judgment and decree dated 09.08.2011 do not call for any interference by this court and hence we do not find any substance in this appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>43.</strong>    As such this appeal is hereby dismissed and the judgment and decree dated 09.08.2011 passed in Title Suit No. 383 of 2006 by the Learned Joint District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup>  Court, Dhaka. is hereby affirmed. <br/> <br/><strong>44.</strong>      However, there will be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/>         Send down the Lower Court’s Record along with a copy of this judgment to the Court concerned immediately for information and necessary action.<br/> <br/><strong>ED.</strong><br/><strong>        </strong></div></div></div>

(15)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adalat Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Section 6(4)</strong><br/><strong>Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003 mandates the Adalat to dispose of an Artharin suit exparte or instantly by simply considering the plaint (prepared under affidavit) or written statement (made with affidavit) and the documents filed therewith, upon treating all of them as substantive evidence and, thus, pleadings with affidavits is the focal-point of this provision and any formal examination of witnesses has got less emphasis in the Ain, 2003. ...(23)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adalat Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Section 6(4)</strong><br/><strong>The expression “</strong><strong>হলফনামাযুক্ত আরজী বা জবাব</strong><strong>” incorporated in Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003 has been used in the context of “</strong><strong>কোন মামলা একতরফাসূত্রে বা তাৎক্ষনিক নিষ্পত্তির ক্ষেত্রে</strong><strong>”...(27)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adalat Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Section 19(6)</strong><br/><strong>For application of the above expression in an exparte disposal situation, when the word “</strong><strong>বা</strong><strong>” (or) would be read as the disjunctive one, an unworkable situation would arise for the Adalat. Because, in that event the Adalat shall have to consider either the plaint only or the written statement only in the backdrop of impossibility of disposal of a suit solely on the basis of written statement. Furthermore, disposal of a suit solely based on the written statement will render the provisions of Section 19(6) of the Ain, 2003 nugatory....(28)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adalat Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 6(4) and 19(1)</strong><br/><strong>If the word “</strong><strong>বা</strong><strong>” (or) employed in Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003 is read as a conjunctive word in an exparte disposal situation, it will mean that even if the defendant is absent, the Adalat must consider both the plaint and written statement making the provisions of Section 19(1) of the Ain 2003 redundant, for, this Section requires exparte disposal (</strong><strong>একতরফাসূত্রে</strong><strong> )</strong><strong> in the absence of defendant. . . . (30)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adalat Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 6(4) and 19(6)</strong><br/><strong>By Section 6(4) and 19(6) of the Ain, 2003 the Legislature has created a device for the Adalat that if the parties to the Artharin suit fail to produce witnesses for the purpose of proving their cases by way of formally stating it on the witness box, as in an ordinary Civil Case, or they do not want to face the hassle of attending the Court premise for giving evidence, they will be allowed to prove their respective cases by way of submitting documents. While Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003 directs that in the event of absence of the defendant, the Adalat would dispose of a suit upon considering the plaint or/and written statement together with documentary evidence, Section 19(6) provides that due to the plaintiff’s absence the Adalat cannot dismiss the suit, for, the law obliges the Adalat to consider the merit of the plaint with affidavit and also the documents filed in the Adalat....(33)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adalat Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 6(4) and 19(1)</strong><br/><strong>The legislative intention behind enactment of this special law is to set up special Courts for recovery of the Banks’/Financial Institutions’ loan from the defaulters. For achieving the target, the Legislature has sought to incorporate a short-cut procedure in disposing of the Artharin Suits and avoid lengthy procedures as being followed in the ordinary civil Courts. With this aim, the Legislature has provided the procedure for the Adalat to be followed in an exparte disposal scenario or instant disposal situation. An exparte disposal may be done, both, before and after receiving the written statement. If the suit is decreed exparte before receiving the written statement, then there is no difficulty in reading and applying the provisions of Sections 6(4) and 19(1) of the Ain, 2003. However, once the Adalat receives the written statement and the defendant’s inaction or failure to pursue the suit compels the Adalat to opt for exparte disposal, then the question comes for consideration as to whether the Adalat should consider the written statement....(34)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adalat Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Section 19(1)</strong><br/><strong>When in an Artharin suit the defendant-side would not participate in the hearing, what would the Adalat do with the written statement? The normal presumption would be that by his non-participation in the hearing he was not placing before the Adalat his claims, which were raised in the written statements. And keeping this scenario in mind, the Legislature made the provision in Section 19(1) of the Ain, 2003 for the Adalat to dispose of the suit exparte (</strong><strong>একতরফাসূত্রে</strong><strong>). The expression “</strong><strong>একতরফাসূত্রে</strong><strong>” in Section 19(1) of the Ain, 2003 has been purposefully employed debarring the Adalat from considering the defendant’s case....(35)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adalat Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Section 6(4)</strong><br/><strong>The meaning of the expression “</strong><strong>হলফনামাযুক্ত আরজী বা জবাব</strong><strong>” employed in Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003 is that the plaint (made with affidavit) is to be considered and where necessary the written statement (made under affidavit) is also to be considered. Hence, in Bangla the following expression “</strong><strong>হলফনামা যুক্ত আরজী এবং যথাযথ ক্ষেত্রে বিবাদীর হলফনামাযুক্ত জবাব</strong><strong>” would sound more appropriate....(36)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adalat Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Section 19(2), 19(3) and 19(4)</strong><br/><strong>The Legislature has eased the task of restoration of an Artharin suit for an alleged </strong><strong>loan-defaulter by incorporating the provisions</strong><strong> of Section 19(2), 19(3) and 19(4). Because of the percentage of deposit being only 10% of the decretal amount, the time-limitation of filing the application being sufficient (30 days from the date of knowledge of passing the exparte decree plus further 15 days for deposit) and the mode of payment being flexible, for, it is permissible to pay in cash or submit bank draft, pay order, cheque and any other negotiable instrument, it would not be irrational to view these conditions as affordable for an aggrieved party....(38)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adalat Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Section 19(2)</strong><br/><strong>It is the clear intention of the Legislature that a party to an Artharin Suit if aggrieved by a decree must prefer an appeal. Since the Ain, 2003 is a special law with an overriding provision over other laws and has prescribed a special procedure; there is no scope to bypass the appellate forum, if the forum under Section 19(2) of the Ain, 2003 against an exparte decree is already not availed of by the party. . . .(41)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adalat Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 19(2) and 41</strong><br/><strong>The only exception is that before passing the decree, if a party to an Artharin Suit feels aggrieved by an order, writ jurisdiction may be invoked as has been held in the case Sonali Bank Ltd Vs Asha Tex International </strong><strong>20 BLC 185. However, after passing a decree,</strong><strong> if the party of an Artharin Suit, becomes aggrieved by any type of order, there is no forum other than preferring an appeal under Section 41 of the Ain, 2003.... (42)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>When an aggrieved party to an Artharin suit, when comes with clean hands and his move is a bonafide one directed at examining a clear-cut factual issue or legal point and not to frustrate the Artharin suit, and files a writ petition by making a 50% down payment of the decretal amount to the lender Bank/financial institution and furnishes detailed reasons for not being able to prefer an appeal within the prescribed time, in the aforesaid  rarest of rare situations, this Court by exercising its ‘special jurisdiction’ under Article 102(2)(a)(ii) of the Constitution may entertain the application, for, being barred by limitation there is no other forum for the aggrieved party. . . . (45)</strong><br/><br/><u><strong>Suggestions for Artharin Adalats of Bangladesh:</strong></u><br/><strong>The overall suggestion for the Adalat is that the Ain, 2003 is aimed at expeditious disposal of the Bank’s/Financial Institution’s claim for recovery of money which is, in fact, the money of the State. If the Adalat, after putting its best effort to serve the notice upon the defendant/s, is satisfied that the notice has been served properly, it should proceed towards the disposal of the suit. The Adalat should bear in mind that while there are unscrupulous defendant/s to delay the disposal of the Artharin suits and thereby frustrate the scheme of the Ain, 2003, however, there are also bonafide defendant/s who might be victimised by the Adalat’s inconsiderate hurriedness. The Adalat being in a better position to assess the above issues/factors from the manner and style of conducting the case by the defendant-side, it should pass appropriate order as per the demand of the circumstances invoking its inherent power under Section 57 of the Ain, 2003. The bottomline for the Adalat is to ensure fair justice for the parties to the suit and, in doing so, when the Adalat shall endeavour to protect the interest of a clean and bonafide defendant, the Adalat shall also not allow the cunning loan-defaulters to abuse the process of the Adalat.  To save a vulnerable defendant from the unreasonable demand of the Banks/Financial Institutions and also to save the defendant’s property from selling at a shockingly low-price, which very often takes place in connivance with the staff of the Bank/Financial Institution and the concerned Court staff, if needed, the Adalat may exercise its inherent power recording the detailed reasons to substantiate its order.    . . .(50)</strong><br/><br/><u><strong>Observations for Law Commissions:</strong></u><br/><strong>The Commission may make the following proposals to the Legislature; </strong><br/><strong>(1)        In order to remove the ambiguity in the phrase “</strong><strong>হলফনামাযুক্ত আরজী বা জবাব</strong><strong>”, the same may be replaced by the following expression “</strong><strong>হলফনামাযুক্ত আরজী এবং যথাযথ ক্ষেত্রে বিবাদীর হলফনামাযুক্ত জবাব</strong><strong>” with an “Explanation” of the word “</strong><strong>যথাযথক্ষেত্রে</strong><strong>” to be incorporated underneath of the Sub-Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003. “</strong><strong>যথাযথক্ষেত্রে</strong><strong>” means when the Adalat is required to dispose of an Artharin Suit under the provisions of Section 19(6) of the Ain, 2003 in the absence of the plaintiff and defendant, it shall consider the case of the defendant as well, if the written statement (made under affidavit) and any other documents have been filed. </strong><br/><strong>(2)        The word ‘</strong><strong>একতরফাসুত্রে</strong><strong>, as occurs in section 19(1) of the Ain, 2003 should be given a definition clarifying that when the defendant upon appearing in the suit files written statement and after framing issue does not attend hearing, the Adalat shall consider only the case of the plaintiff and ignore the written statement and issues framed.</strong><br/><strong>(3)        Section 19 (1) of the Ain, 2003 should prescribe two more reasons for proceeding with exparte disposal. The first reason should be “</strong><strong>ধারা ৭ এর কার্যক্রম সম্পনণ হওয়ার পর যদি পরবর্তী নির্ধারিত তারিখে বিবাদী না আসে</strong><strong>” and, thereafter, the present two reasons would come and, then, the last reason should be incorporated in the following phrase “</strong><strong>মামলার যে কোন পর্যায়ে যদি বিবাদী পরপর তিন বার সময়ের আবেদন করে</strong><strong>”. . . .(51)</strong><br/><br/><u><strong>Observation for JATI </strong></u><br/><strong>The Judicial Administration Training Institute (JATI) should undertake a training program for the learned judges who are presiding over the Artharin Adalats with an aim to familiarize them with the interpretation of the different provisions of the Ain, 2003 so as to ensure that all the Adalats of the land use and take uniform meaning of the provisions of the Ain, 2003 and thereby help minimize preferring appeal or filing writs against the orders passed by them. . . .

The petitioner-defendant, upon receipt of the summons, appeared before the Artharin Adalat (hereinafter referred to as “the Adalat”) on 03.11.2010 and, then, on 09.03.2011 he filed a written statement. Thereafter, a mediator was appointed by the Adalat on 28.03.2011, and 31.05.2011 was fixed for submission of the report by the Mediator. Thereafter, on 24.08.2011 the issues for the suit were framed, fixing 25.09.2011 for peremptory hearing. On 20.03.2012 the P.W.1 Abu Jafar gave his deposition before the Adalat and 10.04.2012 was fixed for further hearing when the petitioner made a prayer for adjournment of the hearing, but the Adalat rejected the prayer and ordered that the exparte judgment and decree shall be pronounced on 22.04.2012. On the said scheduled date for pronouncement of exparte judgment and decree, the petitioner came up with an application for recalling the previous order, by which the date for delivery of exparte judgment and decree was ordered. But the Adalat rejected the petitioner’s application and decreed the suit exparte.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved with the said order of exparte judgment and decree dated 22.04.2012, the petitioner by invoking Article 102 of the Constitution approached this Court and obtained the instant Rule.<br/><br/>The Rule is contested by the Bank (respondent no. 2) through filing an affidavit-in-opposition containing typical general denials to the statements of the writ petition. The Bank’s core contention is that the petitioner’s intention was to protract disposal of the suit by making prayer for adjournments one after another before the Adalat and the suit has rightly been decreed exparte.<br/><br/>Mr. S. N. Goswami, the learned Advocate appearing for the defendant-petitioner, takes us through the impugned judgment and decree dated 22.04.2012 intandem with the plaint, written statement and the application for recalling the order fixing the date of delivery of exparte judgment and submits that the impugned exparte judgment and decree has been passed by the Adalat without applying its judicial mind inasmuch as since on the same day the petitioner filed the application for recalling the previous order with an expectation to enable him deducing his deposition, the Adalat ought to have entertained and allowed the application. He terms the Adalat’s exparte judgment and decree to be an outcome of its whimsical and arbitrary thoughts and actions given that since the said application was filed on the same day with a prayer for cross-examining the D.W.1, the Adalat could have adjudicated upon the suit justly on the basis of the witnesses’ deposition and cross-examination. He refers to the order portion of the impugned exparte decree and submits that the impugned order has been passed by the Adalat mechanically without discussing the averments of the plaint, written statement and the contention of the deposition made by the PW 1. In an effort to substantiate his submissions on this point, he places provision of Section 6(4) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (Ain, 2003) and submits that whenever any Adalat would consider to pass an exparte decree, it is incumbent upon the Adalat that it shall go through the averments made in the plaint and the written statement and also examine the documents submitted by the parties. He alleges that the Adalat, without going through the plaint, the written statement and without looking at the documents and papers submitted before it, hurriedly disposed of the case by pronouncing an exparte decree simply by making a cursory findings that those have been considered. In support of his above submissions, the learned Advocate for the petitioner refers to the cases of Pabna Mental Hospital Vs Tossadek Hosain &amp; others 13 BLC(AD)91, Rupali Bank Ltd and others Vs Tafazal Hossain and others 44 DLR (AD) 260 and Arfanuddin Akand and another Vs Artharin Adalat 15 BLT(HCD) 243.<br/><br/>With regard to the issue of maintainability of this writ petition on the ground of bypassing the appellate forum, Mr. Goswami refers to the case of (i) Collector of Customs, Chittagong Vs M. Hannan 10 BLD (AD) 216, (ii) Tafijul Huq Sarker Vs Bangladesh 4 MLR (AD) 19, (iii) Bangladesh Vs Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku 60 DLR (AD) 147 and (iv) Mayor, Chittagong City Corporation Vs Md. Jahangir Faruk and other 14 BLT (AD) 24 and submits that in spite of the availability of forum of appeal, the present writ petition is to be held maintainable on the strength of the ratio laid down in the afore-referred cases. <br/><br/>By making the aforesaid submissions, the learned Advocate for the defendant-petitioner prays for making the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>Per contra, Mr. Mohammad Saiful Karim, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of respondent no. 2 (plaintiff), at the very outset, places the provisions of Section 19 (2), 19(3) &amp; 19(4) of the Ain, 2003 and submits that the writ petition is not maintainable as the petitioner did not avail himself of an opportunity for restoration of the suit by depositing 10% of the decretal amount within 30(thirty) days before the concerned Adalat No. 4, Dhaka. He next reads Section 41 of the Ain, 2003 and submits that he had also the option to prefer an appeal against the impugned judgment and decree and could have agitated all the issues before the appellate Court. By taking us through the order sheets of the Adalat, he seeks to impress upon this Court that the petitioner was never willing to proceed with the trial of the suit as he persistently tried to prolong the disposal of the suit and finally when the learned Judge of the Adalat came to realise the ill motive of the cunning petitioner as to dillydallying the disposal of the suit, the concerned Adalat has rightly passed the exparte decree and, therefore, he submits that there is no illegality in passing the impugned order.<br/><br/>In support of his submissions as to non-maintainability of this writ petition, he refers to the following cases; (i) Zahirul Islam Vs National Bank 46 DLR (AD) 191, (ii) Gazi M. Towfiq Vs Agrani Bank 54 DLR (AD) 6, (iii) BADC Vs Artharin Adalat 59 DLR (AD) 6, (iv) ACC Vs Enayetur Rahman 64 DLR (AD) 14 and (v) Sonali Bank Ltd Vs Asha Tex International 20 BLC 185.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned Advocates for both the sides at length, perused the writ petition, the affidavit-in-opposition, examined the materials on record as well as the relevant laws and decisions, and considered the same very carefully.<br/><br/>The apparent legal issues require to be considered by this Court are; whether the Adalat’s decision to dispose of the suit exparte is lawful, secondly whether the petitioner’s allegation against the trial Court as to non-consideration of his written statement as well as the issues that were already framed is true, in other words, whether the trial Court has failed to apply the provisions of Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003 in passing the impugned exparte decree and thirdly whether in the backdrop of operation of the provisions of Sections 19(2) and 41 of the Ain, 2003, the present writ petition is maintainable.<br/><br/>Let us first take up the above first issue as to the lawfulness of the order by which the Adalat fixed the suit for exparte hearing. In this case, it is evident from the order-sheets that the very pattern of handling the suit by the defendant compelled the Adalat to record the following order on 10.04.2012;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>২৭---১০/৪/১২ --- অদ্য এফ.এইচ এর জন্য দিন ধার্য্য আছে। বাদীপক্ষ হাজির। বিবাদীপক্ষ এক দরখাস্ত দায়ের করিয়া বর্নিত কারনে সময় প্রার্থনা করিয়াছেন। শুনলাম। নথি পর্য্যালোচনায় দেখা যায় বিবাদীপক্ষ ইতিপূর্বে একাধিকবার সময় নেয়ায়, সময়ের প্রার্থনা নামঞ্জুর। এক্ষনই প্রস্তুতির নির্দেশ (ভি.ও.পি)। পরবর্তীতে বিবাদীপক্ষ কোন পদক্ষেপ নেয় নাই। আগামী ২২/৮/১২ খ্রিঃ তারিখ একতরফা শুনানী। (underlined by us)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The above order shows that the defendant’s application for adjournment was rejected as he was trying to protract the disposal of the suit by seeking repeated adjournments on different occasions and, at the stage of giving oral evidence by the DW, when the Adalat took up the suit but the defendant-side did not participate in the hearing of the case, the matter was fixed for exparte judgment. Given the above scenario, we are to look at Section 19 of the Ain, 2003, which regulates the aspect of exparte disposal of an Artharin Suit.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>ধারা-১৯: একতরফা ডিত্র্রী সম্পর্কিত বিধান-<br/>(১) মামলার শুনানীর জন্য ধার্য কোন তারিখে বিবাদী আদাল¬তে অনুপসিহত থাকিলে, কিংবা মামলা শুনানীর জন্য গৃহীত হইবার পর ডাকিয়া বিবাদীকে উপসিহত পাওয়া না গে¬¬ল, আদালত মামলা একরতফা সূত্রে নিস্পত্তি করিবে.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the language employed in Section 19(1) of the Ain, 2003, the literal meanings of the language gives us two situations, namely; on the date of hearing if the defendant does not register his/her presence before the Adalat by filing Hazira or if after recording his/her presence in paper, s/he is found absent when the case is taken up for hearing to proceed towards disposal of a case exparte. However, the spirit that derives from the provision of Section 19(1) of the Ain, 2003 is that if the Adalat finds that the manner and style of conducting the case by the defendant is to avoid or refrain from hearing , the Adalat should go for exparte disposal of the suit.<br/><br/>Let us now see whether the conduct of the petitioner in dealing with the suit compelled the Adalat to go for exparte disposal. After scrutinizing the order-sheets of the suit, it transpires that the suit was registered on 04.08.2010 and when this petitioner was not appearing before the concerned Adalat, on 04.10.2010 by order no. 4 the Adalat fixed 20.10.2010 for pronouncing exparte decree of the suit. However, on 03.11.2010, the petitioner entered his appearance and filed an application, having prayed for time to submit written statement, which was allowed by the Adalat and, consequently, the suit was withdrawn from the status of exparte disposal. Since then, the petitioner sought for time on this or that plea on 3 (three) occasions (on 28.11.2010, 13.01.2011 &amp; 08.02.2011) for filing written statement. Thereafter, in between the time of filing of the written statement (on 09.03.2011) and the framing of issues (on 24.08.2011), the petitioner applied for time on 15.06.2011 and 19.07.2011 and then the Adalat fixed a date for peremptory hearing on 15.11.2011, on which date the Bank was ready for hearing with its witness, but due to the petitioner’s adjournment application the hearing did not take place. Thereafter, on 26.02.2012, when the petitioner prayed for adjournment, the Adalat allowed it with a cost of Taka 2000/- and on 20.03.2012 the Adalat took deposition of the PW1 fixing 10.04.2012 for further hearing. This time when the petitioner again came up with an application for adjournment, the Adalat listed the suit for exparte disposal. Thus, the Adalat, in fact, showed leniency to the petitioner in the light of the fact that, as per the provisions of Sections 16 &amp; 17 of the Ain, 2003, although it is directory, the suit ought to have been disposed of within 170 days (under Section 16 # 20 days + under Section 17 # 150 days) from the institution of the suit.<br/><br/>Thus, it appears that the petitioner was trying to delay the disposal of the suit from the very beginning and the Adalat decided to go for exparte disposal when the petitioner was coming up with adjournment applications with an intention to refrain from participating in the hearing of the case. It is the legal duty of the trial Court that once deposition of any witness is taken, it shall continue with the hearing of the suit without allowing any adjournment application. Therefore, we do not find any illegality in proceeding with the exparte disposal of the suit by the Adalat and, accordingly, we hold that the Adalat rightly fixed 22.04.2012 for exparte judgement.<br/><br/>After the foregoing conclusion as to the correctness of the Adalat in going for disposing of the suit exparte, we may now undertake the examination of the second issue as to whether the Adalat committed an error in not considering the written statement and in not disposing of the suit on the basis of the issues that had already been framed.<br/><br/>In order to examine the above issue, it would be profitable if we look at the impugned exparte judgement which is reproduced below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>২২/৪/১২--- অদ্য একতরফা শুনানীর জন্য দিন ধার্য্য আছে। বাদী পক্ষ ও বিবাদী পক্ষ হাজির। বিবাদী পক্ষ হলফনামা সহ এক দরখাস্ত দায়ের করিয়া মোকদ্দমা একতরফা হতে উত্তোলন করতঃ সাক্ষীকে জেরা করার অনুমতি প্রার্থনা করিয়াছেন।<br/>বিবাদীপক্ষ অর্থর্ঋণ আদালত আইন ২০০৩ এর ৫৭ তৎসহ ১৫১ ধারার বিধান মতে হলফনামা সহ অপর এক দরখাস্ত দায়ের করিয়া বর্নিত কারনে ইসলামের শরীয়া মোতাবেক (ব্যাংকিং) ঋন আদায় করার জন্য বাদীপক্ষকে নির্দেশ প্রদানের প্রার্থনা করিয়াছেন। নথি পেশ করা হলো। শুনলাম। নথি পর্য্যালোচনায় দেখা যায় যে, ১নং বিবাদী পক্ষ গত ১৫/১১/১১ খ্রি. তারিখ, ১২/১/১২ খ্রি. তারিখ, ২৬/২/১২ খ্রি. তারিখ এবং সর্বশেষ ১০/৪/১২ খ্রি. তারিখ সময় নিয়েছেন। অদ্য দরখাস্ত দায়ের করিয়া এক-তরফা শুনানী হতে উত্তোলনের প্রার্থনা করিয়াছেন। ইতিমধ্যে আইন নির্ধারিত সময় অতিবাহিত হওয়ায় দরখাস্ত নামঞ্জুর করা হলো। বাদী পক্ষ ফিরিস্তি দ্বারা দাগজপত্র দাখিল করিয়াছেন। নথি পেশ করা হলো।<br/>নথি একতরফা শুনানীর জন্য গৃহীত হলো। বাদীপক্ষের বিজ্ঞ আইনজীবীর বক্তব্য শুনলাম। ইহা উলেলখ্য যে, অর্থঋণ আদালত আইন ২০০৩ এর ৬(৪) ধারার বিধানে বাদীপক্ষ মোকদ্দমা দায়েরকালে আরজি ও কাগজাদির সাথে এফিডেবিট দাখিল করলে মোকদ্দমা একতরফা বা তাৎক্ষনিক নিস্পত্তির ক্ষেত্রে কোন সাক্ষীকে পরীক্ষা ব্যতিরেকে হলফনামাযুক্ত আরজি দালিলিক প্রমানাদি বিশেলষন করিয়া রায় বা আদেশ প্রদান করা যায়। বাদীপক্ষ এফিডেবিট সহ আরজি দাখিল করেছেন।<br/>অত্র মোকদ্দমার আরজি, বাদী পক্ষের দাখিলী কাগজপত্র এবং নথি পর্যালোচনা করলাম। বাদী ব্যাংকের দাবী আইনানুগভাবে প্রমানিত হয়। ফলে বাদীপক্ষ প্রার্থীত প্রতিকার পাইতে হকদার।<br/>প্রদত্ত কোর্ট ফি সঠিক।<br/>অতএব,<br/>আদেশ হয় যে,<br/>এ মোকদ্দমাটি বিবাদীগণের বিরুদ্ধে একতরফা সূত্রে খরচা সহ গত ৩০/৬/১০ খ্রি. পর্যন্ত ৮,১০,০৯,৩৭৪/- (আট কোটি দশ লক্ষ নয় হাজার তিনশত চুয়াত্তর) টাকার ডিক্রি হলো। ০১/০৭/১০খ্রি. তারিখ থেকে টাকা আদায় না হওয়া পর্যন্ত বাদীপক্ষ অর্থঋণ আদালত আইন ২০০৩ এর ৫০(২) ধারায় বর্ণিত সুদসহ প্রাপ্ত হবে। বিবাদীপক্ষকে রায় প্রচারের ৬০ (ষাট) দিবসের মধ্যে ডিক্রীকৃত টাকা সুদ সহ বাদীপক্ষের অনুকূলে পরিশোধের নির্দেশ দেয়া হলো। ব্যর্থতায় বাদী পক্ষ আদালত যোগে আইন ও পদ্ধতি মোতাবেক ডিক্রীকৃত টাকা আদায় করে নিতে পারবে।<br/>মোকদ্দমা দায়ের পরবর্তী বিবাদীপক্ষ কোন টাকা জমা প্রদান করলে, বাদীপক্ষকে উক্ত টাকা বাদ দিয়ে পরবর্তী কার্যক্রম গ্রহণ করার নির্দেশ দেয়া হলো।<br/>আমার কথিত মতে মুদ্রিত ও সংশোধিত। (underlined by us)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It is evident from the above-quoted impugned judgement and order that the learned Judge of the Adalat heard the defendant side’s two applications; one is for withdrawing the suit from the list under the heading of “delivery for judgment” and the other application is for realization of loan under the Sharia Law, both of which were filed under Section 57 of the Ain, 2003 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), and the same were rejected by the Adalat on the ground that the applications were filed for delaying the disposal of the suit. Then the Adalat disposed of the case on consideration of the plaint made under affidavit and the documents filed therewith. It is, however, evident that the Adalat did not consider the written statement, nor did it dispose of the suit upon examining the issues which the Adalat had framed upon receiving the written statement. <br/><br/>Now, the pertinent question comes up for examination is whether the Adalat was under a legal duty to consider the written statement of the defendant-petitioner, in a situation, when he failed to participate in the hearing of the case or purposefully refrained from attending the hearing of the case.<br/>To have a resolution of the above query, we need to look at Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003, which is quoted below :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“৬. বিচার পদ্ধতি- (১), (২), (৩) ................................................ <br/>(৪) এই আইনের অধীনে অর্থঋণ আদালতে মামলা নিস্পত্তির ক্ষেত্রে উপ-ধারা (২) ও (৩)-এর বিধান অনুযায়ী সংযুক্ত হলফনামা (Affidavit) মৌখিক সাক্ষ্য (substantive evidence) হিসাবে গন্য হইবে, এবং আদালত কোন মামলার একতরফা বা তাৎক্ষনিক নিস্পত্তির ক্ষেত্রে কোন সাক্ষীকে পরীক্ষা ব্যতিরেকে, কেবল এইর্রপ হলফনামাযুও্র আরজি বা লিখিত জবাব ও সংক্ষিপ্ত দালিলিক প্রমানাদি বিশ্লেষণ করিয়া রায় বা আদেশ প্রদান করিবে”        (underlines added)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Our unambiguous understanding on the above provisions of the law is that Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003 mandates the Adalat to dispose of an Artharin suit exparte or instantly by simply considering the plaint (prepared under affidavit) or written statement (made with affidavit) and the documents filed therewith, upon treating all of them as substantive evidence and, thus, pleadings with affidavits is the focal-point of this provision and any formal examination of witnesses has got less emphasis in the Ain, 2003.<br/><br/>Whether in the expression “” incorporated in Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003, the word “h¡” (or) is to be read as a conjunctive word or as a disjunctive word requires some examination and discussion for effective disposal of not only of this Rule, but also of the other cases with the similar background.<br/><br/>To carry out the above scrutiny, we need to look at the provisions of Sections 6(4), 13 and 19(1) of the Ain, 2003 side-by-side, for, Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003 does not outline the procedure to be followed in a situation requiring exparte disposal or instant disposal and it is Section 13 of the Ain, 2003 which seeks to provide the grounds and procedures for instant (তাৎক্ষনিক/অবিলম্বে) disposal of an Artharin suit and Section 19 of the Ain, 2003 outlines the reasons for taking up an Artharin suit for exparte disposal and also the procedures to be followed.<br/><br/>We would quote only the provisions of Section 13 of the Ain, 2003 herein under, as the other two Sections have already been embodied in this judgment hereinbefore. Section 13 of the Ain, 2003 reads as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>            ১৩। (১) বিবাদী কর্তৃক লিখিত জবাব দাখিল হওয়ার পরবর্তীতে ধার্য একটি নির্ধারিত তারিখে আদালত উভয় পক্ষকে, যদি উপস্থিত থাকে, শুনানী করিয়া এবং আরজি ও লিখিত বর্ণনা পর্যালোচনা করিয়া মামলার বিচার্য বিষয়, যদি থাকে, গঠন করিবে; এবং যদি বিচার্য বিষয় না থাকে, আদালত অবিলমেব রায় বা আদেশ প্রদান করিবে।<br/>(২) উপ-ধারা (১) এ নির্ধারিত তারিখে, কোন বা উভয় পক্ষ যদি অনুপস্থিত থাকে, তাহা হইলে আদালত, আরজি ও লিখিত বর্ণনা পর্যালোচনা করিয়া মামলার বিচার্য বিষয়, যদি থাকে, গঠন করিবে; এবং যদি বিচার্য বিষয় না থাকে, আদালত অবিলমেব রায় বা আদেশ প্রদান করিবে।<br/>(৩) মামলার যে কোন পর্যায়ে, লিখিত বর্ণনায় কিংবা অন্য কোনভাবে বিবাদী কর্তৃক বাদীর আর্জির বক্তব্য স্বীকৃত হইয়া থাকিলে, এবং উক্তরূপ স্বীকৃতির ভিত্তিতে যেরূপ রায় বা আদেশ পাইতে বাদী অধিকারী, সেরূপ রায় বা আদেশ প্রার্থনা করিয়া বাদী আদালতের নিকট দরখাস্ত করিলে, আদালত, বাদী ও বিবাদীর মধ্যে বিদ্যমান অপরাপর বিচার্য বিষয় নিষ্পত্তির জন্য অপেক্ষা না করিয়া, উপযুক্ত রায় বা আদেশ প্রদান করিবে।<br/>(৪) মামলার শুনানীর জন্য ধার্য প্রথম তারিখে অথবা মামলার যে কোন পর্যায়ে যদি আদালতের নিকট প্রতীয়মান হয় যে, পক্ষদ্বয়ের মধ্যে ঘটনা অথবা আইনগত বিষয়ে কোন বিবাদ নাই, তাহা হইলে, আদালত অবিলমেব রায় বা আদেশ প্রদান করিয়া মামলা চুড়ান্তভাবে নিষ্পত্তি করিবে।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(underlined by us)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From a concurrent reading of the aforesaid three Sections, it appears to us that the expression “হলফনামাযুক্ত আরজী বা জবাব” incorporated in Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003 has been used in the context of “কোন মামলা একতরফাসূত্রে বা তাৎক্ষনিক নিষ্পত্তির ক্ষেত্রে” and, accordingly, we are to see whether the expression “হলফনামাযুক্ত আরজী বা জবাব” relates only to a situation of exparte disposal or only to a situation of instant disposal.<br/><br/>For application of the above expression in an exparte disposal situation, when the word “h¡” (or) would be read as the disjunctive one, an unworkable situation would arise for the Adalat. Because, in that event the Adalat shall have to consider either the plaint only or the written statement only in the backdrop of impossibility of disposal of a suit solely on the basis of written statement. Furthermore, disposal of a suit solely based on the written statement will render the provisions of Section 19(6) of the Ain, 2003 nugatory. The said Section 19(6) of the Ain is quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>            ১৯(৬) অর্থ-ঋণ আদালতে বিচারাধীন কোন মামলা, বাদীর অনুপসিহতি বা ব্যর্থতা হেতু খারিজ করা যাইবে না, এবং এইর্রপ ক্ষেত্রে আদালত, নথিতে উপসহাপিত কাগজাদি পরীক্ষা করিয়া গুনাগুন বিশ্লেষণে মামলা নিষ্পত্তি করিবে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From a plain reading of the above law it appears that this provision requires consideration of the plaintiff’s case on merit, irrespective of the fact as to whether the plaintiff is present in the Adalat or not. The provision is about a situation where only the plaintiff is absent as reflected in the words “বাদীর অনুপসিহতি বা ব্যর্থতার হেতু”. It further speaks of “গুনাগুন বিশ্লেষণে মামলা নিষ্পত্তি করিবে”. From the practical view point, when the plaintiff is absent or fails to appear, two situations, namely (i) the plaintiff is absent but defendant is present or (ii) both the parties are absent, would arise. Given that Section 19(6) of the Ain, 2003 is silent about presence or absence of the defendant, an assessment is required to be made to know the real intention of Section 19(6) on the Ain, 2003. The straight-forward reply is that in both the situations, while it is mandatory for the Adalat to consider the plaintiff’s case on merit, for, Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003 dictates the Adalat to consider the plaint (made under affidavit) and the documents, it is discretionary for the Adalat whether to consider the defendant’s case or not. Our view is that in disposing of a suit under Section 19(6) of the Ain, 2003, since there is no prohibition to consider the defendant’s case in the event of the defendant’s absence, the case of the defendant should also be considered, and not of the plaintiff alone. However, when the defendant is present his case is also to be considered either by way of production of formal evidence through witness or without examination of witnesses as stipulated in Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003.<br/><br/>On the contrary, if the word “h¡” (or) employed in Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003 is read as a conjunctive word in an exparte disposal situation, it will mean that even if the defendant is absent, the Adalat must consider both the plaint and written statement making the provisions of Section 19(1) of the Ain 2003 redundant, for, this Section requires exparte disposal (<strong>একতরফাসূত্রে</strong>) in the absence of defendant.<br/><br/>Similarly, when the expression “<strong>হলফনামাযুক্ত আরজী বা জবাব</strong>” in the context of instant disposal situation, as occurs in Sections 6(4) (<strong>তাৎক্ষনিক নিষ্পত্তির ক্ষেত্রে) </strong><strong>and  13(1), 13(2), 13(3) &amp; 13(4)</strong><strong> </strong>of the Ain, 2003, would be applied, the Adalat would face the same dilemma, as discussed above in the event of exparte disposal, if the word “ev” (or) is taken in the conjunctive sense or disjunctive sense.<br/><br/>Thus, apparently there is a bit of lack of clarity in the provisions of Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003 and it has inevitably become a bounden duty for this Court to interpret the provisions of Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003 on the touchstone of the scheme of the Ain, 2003 and, thereby, attribute a cohesive meaning of it.<br/><br/>By Section 6(4) &amp; 19(6) of the Ain, 2003 the Legislature has created a device for the Adalat that if the parties to the Artharin suit fail to produce witnesses for the purpose of proving their cases by way of formally stating it on the witness box, as in an ordinary Civil Case, or they do not want to face the hassle of attending the Court premise for giving evidence, they will be allowed to prove their respective cases by way of submitting documents. While Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003 directs that in the event of absence of the defendant, the Adalat would dispose of a suit upon considering the plaint or/and written statement together with documentary evidence, Section 19(6) provides that due to the plaintiff’s absence the Adalat cannot dismiss the suit, for, the law obliges the Adalat to consider the merit of the plaint with affidavit and also the documents filed in the Adalat.<br/><br/>The legislative intention behind enactment of this special law is to set up special Courts for recovery of the Banks’/Financial Institutions’ loan from the defaulters. For achieving the target, the Legislature has sought to incorporate a short-cut procedure in disposing of the Artharin Suits and avoid lengthy procedures as being followed in the ordinary civil Courts. With this aim, the Legislature has provided the procedure for the Adalat to be followed in an exparte disposal scenario or instant disposal situation. An exparte disposal may be done, both, before and after receiving the written statement. If the suit is decreed exparte before receiving the written statement, then there is no difficulty in reading and applying the provisions of Sections 6(4) &amp; 19(1) of the Ain, 2003. However, once the Adalat receives the written statement and the defendant’s inaction or failure to pursue the suit compels the Adalat to opt for exparte disposal, then the question comes for consideration as to whether the Adalat should consider the written statement.<br/><br/>When in an Artharin suit the defendant-side would not participate in the hearing, what would the Adalat do with the written statement? The normal presumption would be that by his non-participation in the hearing he was not placing before the Adalat his claims, which were raised in the written statements. And keeping this scenario in mind, the Legislature made the provision in Section 19(1) of the Ain, 2003 for the Adalat to dispose of the suit exparte (HLalg¡p§­œ). The expression “HLalg¡p§­œ” in Section 19(1) of the Ain, 2003 has been purposefully employed debarring the Adalat from considering the defendant’s case.<br/><br/>The above analysis on the different provisions of the Ain, 2003, which had been carried out in an effort to lay down a workable statutory interpretation, leads us to take a view that the meaning of the expression “হলফনামাযুত্তু আরজী বা জবাব” employed in Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003 is that the plaint (made with affidavit) is to be considered and where necessary the written statement (made under affidavit) is also to be considered. Hence, in Bangla the following expression “হলফনামা যুক্ত আরজী এবং যথাযথ ক্ষেত্রে বিবাদীর হলফনামাযুক্ত জবাব” would sound more appropriate.<br/><br/>It is a finding of fact, this Court already arrived at hereinbefore by examining the background-events, that the petitioner’s failure to participate in the hearing led the Adalat to proceed towards exparte disposal under Section 19(1) of the Ain, 2003. The facts of the case, thus, show that the Adalat has exercised its jurisdiction as a competent Court, so far the framing of issues and the passing of the exparte decree in the absence of the defendant are concerned and, therefore, we do not find that the Adalat had no jurisdiction to pass the impugned order and, thus, the ratio of the cited case of Pabna Mental Hospital Vs Tossadek Hossain &amp; others 13 BLC (AD) 91, wherein the concerned State-functionary had exceeded its jurisdiction, and  the case of Rupali Bank Ltd Vs Tafazal Hossain 44 DLR (AD) 260, wherein the civil Court had tried the suit without having jurisdiction, has no manner of application in the present case, and the case of Md. Arfanuddin akand &amp; another Vs Artharin Adalat and others 15 BLT 243 is not applicable here in this case, for, the decision arrived at by the High Court Division is per incurium inasmuch the Court missed examination of Section 19 (1) of the Ain, 2003. In the instant case, thus, the Adalat was not under a legal duty to consider the case of the defendants as made out in the written statements or the issues that had been framed earlier.<br/><br/>Let us now deal with the issue of maintainability of this writ petition. In order to examine the said issue, we need to look at the provisions of Section 19(2), 19(3) &amp; 19(4) of the Ain, 2003 which is quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>১৯ (২) কোন মামলা একতরফা সূত্রে ডিত্র্রী হইলে, বিবাদী উক্ত একতরফা ডিত্র্রীর তারিখের অথবা উক্ত একতরফা ডিত্র্রী সম্পর্কে অবগত হইবার ৩০ (ত্রিশ) দিবসের মধ্যে, উপ-ধারা (৩) এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, উক্ত একতরফা ডিত্র্রী রদের জন্য দরখাস্ত করিতে পারিবেন।<br/>১৯ (৩) উপ-ধারা (২) এর বিধান অনুযায়ী দরখাস¹ দাখিলের ক্ষেত্রে বিবাদীকে উক্ত দরখাস¹ দাখিলের তারিখের পরবর্তী ১৫ (পনের) দিবসের মধ্যে ডিত্র্রীকৃত অর্থের ১০% এর সমপরিমাণ টাকা বাদীর দাবীর সেই পরিমাণের জন্য স্বীকৃতিস্বরুপ নগদ সংশ্লিষ্ট আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠানে, অথবা জামানত-স্বরুপ ব্যাংক ড্রাফট, পে-অর্ডার বা অন্য কোন প্রকার নগদায়নযোগ্য বিনিমেয় দলিল (Negotiable Instrument) আকারে জামানত হিসাবে আদালতে জমাদান করিতে হইবে।<br/>১৯ (৪) উপ-ধারা (৩) এর বিধানমতে ডিক্রীকৃত অর্থেও ১০% এর সমপরিমাণ টাকা জমাদানের সংগে সংগে দরখাস্তটি মঞ্জুর হইবে, একতরফা ডিক্রী রদ হইবে এবং মূল মামলা উহার নমবর ও নথিতে পুনরুজ্জীবিত হইবে, এবং আদালত ঐ মর্মে একটি আদেশ লিপিবদ্ধ করিবে; এবং অতঃপর মামলাটি যে পর্যায়ে এক তরফ নিষ্পত্তি হইয়াছিল, ঐ পর্যায়ের অব্যবহিত পূর্ববর্তী পর্যায় পরিচালিত হইবে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It appears that the Legislature has eased the task of restoration of an Artharin suit for an alleged loan-defaulter by incorporating the above provisions. Because of the percentage of deposit being only 10% of the decretal amount, the time-limitation of filing the application being sufficient (30 days from the date of knowledge of passing the exparte decree plus further 15 days for deposit) and the mode of payment being flexible, for, it is permissible to pay in cash or submit bank draft, pay order, cheque and any other negotiable instrument, it would not be irrational to view these conditions as affordable for an aggrieved party.<br/><br/>In the case at hand, the impugned exparte judgment and decree has been passed on 22.04.2012 and the petitioner could have filed an application for restoration of the suit within 22.05.2012 with the opportunity of depositing the 10% of the decretal amount within next 15 (fifteen) days of filing the aforesaid application. The petitioner, instead of availing himself of the above route, opted to file the instant writ petition and that too was done after 1 (one) year of passing the impugned exparte judgment and decree. It is evident from the statement of the Bank that the Execution Case no. 110 of 2012, having been started on 24.09.2012, has its final disposal still awaiting and, in fact, issuance of the instant Rule has halted the further process of the Execution case, albeit there is no direction or injunction restraining its process.<br/><br/>The petitioner could also have sought remedy in the form of preferring an appeal under Section 41 of the Ain, 2003 within the time as prescribed therein. The appellate Court is competent to examine any factual issue and law point, including the issue of passing the impugned judgment and decree exceeding its jurisdiction, and take fresh or further evidence for effective disposal of an appeal. However, the petitioner purposefully refrained from availing himself of the aforesaid remedy. Section 41 runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ধারা-৪১ঃ আপীল দায়ের ও নিষ্পত্তি সম্পর্কিত বিশেষ বিধানz -(১) মামলার কোন পক্ষ, কোন অর্থঋণ আদালতের আদেশ বা ডিত্র্রী দ্বারা সংক্ষুব্ধ হইলে, যদি ডিত্র্রীকৃত টাকার পরিমাণ ৫০ (পঞ্চাশ) লক্ষ টাকা অপেক্ষা অধিক হয়, তাহা হইলে উপ-ধারা (২) এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, পরবর্তী ৩০ (ত্রিশ) দিবসের মধ্য হাইকোর্ট বিভাগে, এবং যদি ডিত্র্রীকৃত টাকার পরিমাণ ৫০ (পঞ্চাশ) লক্ষ টাকা অথবা তদঅপেক্ষা কম হয়, তাহা হইলে জেলা জজ আদালতে আপীল করিতে পারিবেন।<br/>(২) আপীলকারী, ডিত্র্রীকৃত টাকার পরিমাণের ৫০% এর সমপরিমাণ টাকা বাদীর দাবীর আংশিক স্বীকৃতিস্বরুপ নগদ ডিত্র্রীদার আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠানে, অথবা বাদীর দাবী স্বীকার না করিলে, জামানতস্বরুপ ডিত্র্রী প্রদানকারী আদালতে জমা করিয়া উক্তরুপ জমার প্রমাণ দরখাস¹ বা আপীলর মেমোর সহিত আদালতে দাখিল না করিলে, উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন কোন আপীল কার্যার্থে গৃহীত হইবে না।<br/>(৩) উপ-ধারা (২) এর বিধান সত্তেও, বিবাদী-দায়িক ইতিমধ্যে ১৯(৩) ধারার বিধান মতে ১০% (দশ শতাংশ) পরিমাণ টাকা নগদ অথবা জামানত হিসাবে জমা করিয়া থাকিলে, অত্র ধারার অধীনে আপীল দায়েরের ক্ষেত্রে উক্ত ১০% (দশ শতাংশ) টাকা উপরি-উল্লিখিত ৫০% (পঞ্চাশ শতাংশ) টাকা হইতে বাদ হইবে।<br/>(৪), (৫), (৬).....................................................................”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It is the clear intention of the Legislature that a party to an Artharin Suit if aggrieved by a decree, must prefer an appeal. Since the Ain, 2003 is a special law with an overriding provision over other laws and has prescribed a special procedure, there is no scope to bypass the appellate forum, if the forum under Section 19(2) of the Ain, 2003 against an exparte decree is already not availed of by the party.<br/><br/>The only exception is that before passing the decree, if a party to an Artharin Suit feels aggrieved by an order, writ jurisdiction may be invoked as has been held in the case Sonali Bank Ltd Vs Asha Tex International 20 BLC 185. However, after passing a decree, if the party of an Artharin Suit, becomes aggrieved by any type of order, there is no forum other than preferring an appeal under Section 41 of the Ain, 2003.<br/><br/>The cases referred to by the learned Advocate for the petitioner are factually different in nature inasmuch as those did not arise out of any order or decree of an Artharin Suit. In the celebrated case of the Collector of Customs Vs Mr. A. Hannan 10 BLD (AD) 216, the appellate forum was held to be ‘not equally efficacious’ as the provision requires deposit of 50% of the penalty. But in the Artharin suits the required deposit is of the decretal amount and it is the money of the Bank/financial institution, as opposed to levying any duty or penalty. In the case of Tafijul Huq Sarker Vs Bangladesh 4 MLR (AD) 19, the appellate forum for a terminated Mutawalli was held to be not equally efficacious as the precondition for preferring an appeal is to hand over the charge first and, thus, the fact being completely different bypassing the appellate forum was held to be justified in the said case. The ratio laid down in the case of Bangladesh Vs Iqbal Hasan Mahmeed Tuku 60 DLR (AD) 147 has been overruled by the Apex Court by their decision passed in the case of ACC Vs Enayetur Rahman 64 DLR (AD) 14. The case of Mayor, Chittagong City Corporation Vs Md Jahangir Faruk and others 14 BLT (AD) 24 is about dismissal of the writ petitioner who directly had invoked writ jurisdiction without preferring an appeal to the appellate authority and the said appellate authority, being an Administrative higher authority, the forum cannot be termed to be an equally efficacious forum in the backdrop of apparent ex-facie illegality in the dismissal order which was passed without carrying out any departmental proceeding. Thus, none of the said cases’ ratio is applicable in this case.<br/><br/>Therefore, the writ petition is not maintainable, for, there are alternative efficacious remedies available to the petitioner. Our above view gets support from the principles laid down in the cases of (i) Zahirul Islam Vs National Bank 46 DLR (AD) 191, (ii) Gazi M. Towfiq Vs Agrani Bank 54 DLR (AD) 6, (iii) BADC Vs Artharin Adalat 59 DLR (AD) 6, (iv) Oriental Bank Vs AB Siddiq 13 BLC (AD) 144, (v) ACC Vs Enayetur Rahman 64 DLR (AD) 14 and (vi) Sonali Bank Ltd Vs Asha Tex International 20 BLC 185.<br/><br/>The petitioner has resorted to a wrong forum by invoking the writ jurisdiction of this Court. He cannot now avail himself of the remedy under Section 41 of the Ain, 2003, for, evidently he is out of time. Had this writ petition been filed within 30 (thirty) days of the decree, he could have enjoyed the benefit of the provisions of Section 14 read with Section 29 of the Limitation Act as was viewed by  a Division Bench of the High Court Division in the case of Sharifa Begum Vs Bangladesh (Writ Petition no. 15331 of 2012) (unreported). However, it is our view that when an aggrieved party to an Artharin suit, when comes with clean hands and his move is a bonafide one directed at examining a clear-cut factual issue or legal point and not to frustrate the Artharin suit, and files a writ petition by making a 50% down payment of the decretal amount to the lender Bank/financial institution and furnishes detailed reasons for not being able to prefer an appeal within the prescribed time, in the aforesaid  rarest of rare situations, this Court by exercising its ‘special jurisdiction’ under Article 102(2)(a)(ii) of the Constitution may entertain the application, for, being barred by limitation there is no other forum for the aggrieved party.<br/><br/>Before parting with the judgment, we find it proper to have a survey on the manner and style of handling the present case by the learned Advocate for the petitioner and thereby make an assessment as to whether he has performed his professional duty in conformity with the norms and etiquette of the legal profession in the backdrop of the Appellate Division’s following observations made at Para 21 in the case of BADC Vs Artharin Adalat 59 DLR(AD) 6;<br/><br/>Before we part, we would like to put it on record that in spite of the fact that the law in the matter has been settled long back, petitions are unnecessarily filed under Article 102 of the Constitution challenging the judgment of the Artharin Adalat without making any case covered under the aforesaid Article, not to speak of any ground touching fundamental rights of the petitioner. As a result, the superior Courts are wasting public time which should be discouraged by all concerned including the learned members of the Bar, who are as well officers of the Court.<br/><br/>About 10 (ten) years ago, our Apex Court urged the learned Advocates of this Court to be susceptive in filing a writ petition against any decree of the Artharin Adalat. But unfortunately the learned members of the Bar are coming up with the said writ petitions indiscriminately and thereby causing wastage of valuable time of this Court which is overwhelmingly overburdened with huge backlog of cases.<br/><br/>More so, after obtaining the Rule on 29.04.2013 no step was taken by the petitioner to get the matter heard. It is only when the matter was sent to this Bench by the concerned office of this Court (Writ Section) to dispose of the Rule, did the learned Advocate for the petitioner appear on 19.08.2015 before this Court and the matter was fixed for hearing. However, since the date of fixing the matter for hearing, the learned Advocate for the petitioner was not appearing before this Court and, consequently, the matter was placed in the Daily Cause List under the heading ‘For Order’. Thereafter, on the verbal promise of the learned Advocate for the petitioner that he shall assist this Court in disposing of the Rule, the matter was again taken back in the category of the items under the column “For Hearing”. Since then, every day at the ‘Mentioning Hour’ the learned junior Advocate attached to Mr. S.N. Goswami was coming up with a prayer to ‘pass over’ the item on the ground of Mr. Goswami’s engagement in the Appellate Division and eventually the matter was heard-in-part and adjourned to 15.09.2015. Thereafter, the learned Advocate for the petitioner took adjournment on several occasions by sending his junior on his personnel ground. In the meantime, the jurisdiction of this Bench changed from writ matters to criminal cases and the Hon’ble Chief Justice, upon receiving administrative note from this Bench, asked us to continue with the hearing of all the part-heard writ matters in addition to exercising the criminal jurisdiction. Accordingly, for nearly two weeks the matter was appearing in a separate Cause List and when the learned Advocate for the petitioner was not turning up, this Court informed the learned Advocate for the petitioner through the Bank’s lawyer about this Court’s intention to dispose of the Rule, whether or not the learned Advocate for the petitioner attend this Court to make any submissions. On 08.12.2015, Ms. Afsana Begum, the associate Advocate of the learned Advocate for the petitioner, prayed for time on the plea that Mr. Goswami wants to make some submissions on the issue of maintainability of the writ petition and on 09.12.2015 when the matter was taken up for hearing, neither the learned Advocate Mr. Goswami nor his junior Ms. Afsana Begum complied with their promise to attend the hearing and, under the circumstance, this Court fixed the next day for delivery of judgment and on 10.12.2015 when this Court took up the case for pronouncement of  the judgment, unfortunately, no one was present, not even his junior, to receive the judgment. However, on 10.12.2015 pronouncement of the judgment could not be finished due to ending the working hour of the day and this Court had to adjourn the pronouncement of the rest of the judgment. Today, (27.01.2016) when this Court is about to accomplish the unfinished judgment, Ms. Afsana Begum, the learned junior to Mr. Goswami, appeared and placed some decisions in support of their argument on the issue of maintainability of this writ petition. The above pattern of handling the case by the learned Advocate for the petitioner amply suggests that the petitioner filed the instant writ petition for delaying the execution process through abusing the process of this Court and the above style of dealing with this case leads us to hold that the petitioner managed to resort to this extreme extent of abuse of the process of the highest Court with the assistance of the learned Advocate for the petitioner for which both of them deserve to be penalised by slapping exemplary costs to be paid from the pocket of the learned Advocate for the petitioner in addition to ordinary statutory costs to be paid by the petitioner, as was ordered in the case of Bandar Nagari Bahumukhi Samabay Samity Ltd Vs Bangladesh 5 ALR-2015 (1) 194. However, Given the fact that Mr. Goswami has showed this attitude for the first time before this Bench, we refrain from passing any order of payment of costs from his pocket, as was done in the case of AKM Asaduzzaman Vs Public Service Commission 4 ALR-2014(2)278. Accordingly, the petitioner shall pay the costs to be imposed upon him hereinafter.<br/><br/>There is something more to pen through before we quit this judgment. This is for the Artharin Adalats who are everyday dealing with the Ain, 2003 and, as a part of our obligation under Article 109 of the Constitution, it would be an incomplete job for this Court if we do not prescribe their tasks in clearer terms after making the above lengthy discussions and analysis, which may seem to be cumbersome to the readers, on the provisions of Sections 6(4), 13 and 19 of the Ain, 2003.<br/><br/>In disposing of the exparte disposal of the Artharin suits, the Adalat must record its reasonings in detail. If the exparte disposal is required for the defendant’s non-appearance after complying with the provisions of Section 7 of the Ain, 2003, the Adalat should give at least one chance to the defendant to enable the latter to register its presence in the suit and contest it.<br/><br/>Upon receiving the summons, when the defendant appears and seeks adjournment for filing written statement, the Adalat should not allow more than two adjournments and, accordingly, the Adalat should go for exparte disposal if the defendant approaches for third adjournment without submitting the written statement.<br/><br/>After filing the written statement and framing issues, when the date is fixed for peremptory hearing, the Adalat should not allow more than two adjournments and on the prayer for third-time adjournment for attending hearing, the Adalat should dispose of the suit exparte.<br/><br/>The overall suggestion for the Adalat is that the Ain, 2003 is aimed at expeditious disposal of the Bank’s/Financial Institution’s claim for recovery of money which is, in fact, the money of the State. If the Adalat, after putting its best effort to serve the notice upon the defendant/s, is satisfied that the notice has been served properly, it should proceed towards the disposal of the suit. The Adalat should bear in mind that while there are unscrupulous defendant/s to delay the disposal of the Artharin suits and thereby frustrate the scheme of the Ain, 2003, however, there are also bonafide defendant/s who might be victimised by the Adalat’s inconsiderate hurriedness. The Adalat being in a better position to assess the above issues/factors from the manner and style of conducting the case by the defendant-side, it should pass appropriate order as per the demand of the circumstances invoking its inherent power under Section 57 of the Ain, 2003. The bottomline for the Adalat is to ensure fair justice for the parties to the suit and, in doing so, when the Adalat shall endeavour to protect the interest of a clean and bonafide defendant, the Adalat shall also not allow the cunning loan-defaulters to abuse the process of the Adalat.  To save a vulnerable defendant from the unreasonable demand of the Banks/Financial Institutions and also to save the defendant’s property from selling at a shockingly low-price, which very often takes place in connivance with the staff of the Bank/Financial Institution and the concerned Court staff, if needed, the Adalat may exercise its inherent power recording the detailed reasons to substantiate its order.<br/><br/>We feel it pertinent to opine that the Law Commission of Bangladesh should look into our observations as to the ambiguities of some phraseology used in Sections 6 (4), 13 of 19(1) of the Ain, 2003 and take necessary steps for incorporation of appropriate expressions or deletion thereto. The Commission may make the following proposals to the Legislature;<br/><br/>In order to remove the ambiguity in the phrase “হলফনামাযুক্ত আরজী বা জবাব”, the same may be replaced by the following expression “হলফনামাযুক্ত আরজী এবং যথাযথ ক্ষেত্রে বিবাদীর হলফনামাযুক্ত জবাব” with an “Explanation” of the word “যথাযথক্ষেত্রে” to be incorporated underneath of the Sub-Section 6(4) of the Ain, 2003. “যথাযথক্ষেত্রে” means when the Adalat is required to dispose of an Artharin Suit under the provisions of Section 19(6) of the Ain, 2003 in the absence of the plaintiff and defendant, it shall consider the case of the defendant as well, if the written statement (made under affidavit) and any other documents have been filed.<br/><br/>The word ‘একতরফাসুত্রে, as occurs in section 19(1) of the Ain, 2003 should be given a definition clarifying that when the defendant upon appearing in the suit files written statement and after framing issue does not attend hearing, the Adalat shall consider only the case of the plaintiff and ignore the written statement and issues framed.<br/><br/>Section 19 (1) of the Ain, 2003 should prescribe two more reasons for proceeding with exparte disposal. The first reason should be “ধারা ৭ এর কার্যক্রম সম্পন্ন হওয়ার পর যদি পরবর্তী নির্ধারিত তারিখে বিবাদী না আসে” and, thereafter, the present two reasons would come and, then, the last reason should be incorporated in the following phrase “মামলার যে কোন পর্যায়ে যদি বিবাদী পরপর তিন বার সময়ের আবেদন করে”.<br/><br/>We further feel that the Judicial Administration Training Institute (JATI) should undertake a training program for the learned judges who are presiding over the Artharin Adalats with an aim to familiarize them with the interpretation of the different provisions of the Ain, 2003 so as to ensure that all the Adalats of the land use and take uniform meaning of the provisions of the Ain, 2003 and thereby help minimize preferring appeal or filing writs against the orders passed by them. <br/><br/>With the above observations and direction, the Rule is discharged with a cost of Tk. 20,000/- (twenty thousand) to be paid by the petitioner in the national exchequer by way of submitting Treasury Challan within 30 (thirty) days from the date of receiving this judgment. <br/><br/>Office is directed to communicate this order to the learned presiding judges of all the Artharin Adalats functioning all over the Bangladesh so as to let them be acquainted with the above analysis on the Ain, 2003 and the ratio derived therefrom.<br/><br/>The Artharin Adalat, Court No. 4, Dhaka is directed to complete the execution process without any further delay.<br/><br/>Office is further directed to send a copy of this judgement to the Bangladesh Law Commission and the Director General, JATI for their perusal and necessary action. <br/><br/><strong>            Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
