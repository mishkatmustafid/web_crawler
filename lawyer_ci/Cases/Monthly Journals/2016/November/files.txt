A confessional statement of a co-accused is a matter for consideration against another accused if tried jointly with him.      . . . (19)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 3 and 30</strong><br/><strong>Section 30 of the Evidence Act simply makes </strong><strong>the confession of a co-accused a relevant fact.</strong><strong> In other words, the confessional statement of a co-accused is admissible against other persons in the sense that it may be taken into consideration against them along with other </strong><strong>evidence. But for this section 30, the confessional</strong> <strong>statement of one accused will be inadmissible</strong><strong> in evidence against another accused in view of section 3 of the Evidence Act. The statement of a co-accused does not fall within the definition of evidence as given in section 3 of the Evidence Act. The simple reason is that it is not made on oath; that it is not made in presence of the accused and that its veracity is not tested by cross-examination. It is, therefore, a very weak evidence against co-accused if it is regarded as evidence under section 30. The High Court Division erred in </strong><strong>taking the confessional statements of co-accused</strong><strong> Ratan Miah and Edu Miah as substantive evidence and maintained the conviction of the appellants without corroboration by any independent evidence.          . . . (20 and 25)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 8</strong><br/><strong>Absconsion by itself is not conclusive evidence</strong><strong> to infer either of guilt or guilty conscience. The fact that the appellants absconded soon after the crime was committed is no evidence by itself. It may only lend weight to other evidence. Abscondence cannot be treated to </strong><strong>be corroboration of the confessional statement</strong><strong> of other co-accused so as to base thereon the conviction of the absconding accused. Even an innocent man may feel panicky and to evade arrest and trial may abscond when suspected of grave crime like murder. Abscondence by itself was not conclusive proof of guilt or guilty conscience of an accused but it might lend support to other evidence on record.     . . .

No.653/1998 of the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Comilla.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Both the criminal appeals involving similar questions of laws and facts have been heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The relevant facts for the purpose of disposal of these criminal appeals are:</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Informant, Nurul Amin lodged a First Information Report (FIR) on 13.11.1998 with Comilla Kotawali P.S. alleging that on 12.11.1998 his son, victim Jamal Hossain, who was a rickshaw puller, deposited his rickshaw in the garage of its owner and went to the Doulatpur Majarsharif to attend its weekly gathering. The people present there saw him upto 00.30 hours (13.11.1998), but his son did not return home. On the following morning his dead body was recovered from the Mahogany garden belonging to Yasin Miah located towards the north-east of the Neku Brick field, Doulatpur. The informant and his relatives found a dead body with innumerable marks of injury caused by knife on various parts of his body and the tendon of his left heel was cut-off, unknown person or persons had murdered his son between 00.30–06.00 hours of 13.11.1998 and left his dead body inside the said garden. The information gave rise to Kotwali Police Station Case No.20 dated 13.11.1998.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">During investigation, Edu Miah, Ratan Miah, Monjil Hossain and Ramija Khatun were arrested on suspicion and forwarded to the Court of the Magistrate. Accused Edu Miah and Ratan Miah were taken on remand and thereafter, their confessional statements were recorded under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by a Magistrate, First Class, Comilla. After investigation, police submitted charge sheet No.148 dated 31.03.1999 in respect of 8(eight) accused persons, including the appellants alleging offences under sections 302/201/34 of the Penal Code. On 13.01.2002, charge was framed under sections 302/201/34 of the Penal Code against the appellants and 2 (two) others, who were present in the Court and also against the absconding accused persons, namely, Monjil Hossain, Ramija Khatun, Morshed Alam and Johara Bibi. The accused persons present in the dock pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In order to substantiate the prosecution case, prosecution examined 16(sixteen) witnesses, who were cross-examined on behalf of the accused persons present in the dock and also cross-examined by the State defence lawyer appointed on behalf of the absconding accused. From the trend of the cross-examination of the witnesses by the defence, the defence case appears to be one of innocence.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Upon consideration of the evidence and materials or record, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fourth Court, Comilla, convicted absconding accused Morshed Alam under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to death. The accused, namely, Edu Mia, Ratan Mia, Alamgir Hossain (appellant) and Babul Mia (appellant), who faced the trial were convicted under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life and also ordered to pay a fine of Tk.20,000/- each, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 6(six) months more. Three other accused persons, namely, Ramiza Khatun, Johura Khatun and Monjil Hossain were acquitted of the charge leveled against them.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A reference under section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was sent by the learned Sessions Judge, Comilla to the High Court Division for confirmation of the sentence of death of the above named condemned-prisoner which was registered as Death Reference No.39 of 2005.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Convict-appellant Alamgir Hossain preferred Criminal Appeal No.1509 of 2005 and convict-appellant Babul Mia preferred Criminal Appeal No.1556 of 2005 which were heard along with Death Reference No.39 of 2005. The learned Judges of the High Court Division upon hearing both the sides by the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 20.01.2009 accepted the death reference and dismissed both the criminal appeals with connected jail appeal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the High Court Division, the accused Alamgir Hossain filed Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.248 of 2009 and accused Babul Mia filed Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.249 of 2009 before this Division. In both the lave-petitions, leave was granted on 12.02.2012, resulting in Criminal Appeal Nos.15-16 of 2012.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Khorshid Alam Khan, learned Advocate, appearing on behalf of the appellants of both the criminal appeals, submits that the confessional statement of a co-accused is only evidence against the maker but the same has no evidentiary value against other co-accused except only to lend assurance to other evidence and as such, the affirmation of conviction and sentence by the High Court Division based on confessional statements having not been corroborated by evidence either oral or circumstantial is not tenable in law. He further submits that none of the witnesses examined by the prosecution disclosed anything in Court implicating the accused-appellants, but they have been implicated only by the confessional statements of the co-accused Edu Mia and Ratan Mia, which were not corroborated by any independent witness and as such, the order of conviction and sentence relying on such confessional statements is not tenable in law. He also submits that mere absconsion of the appellants for a long time cannot by itself sufficient to prove the guilt of the appellants and as such, relying on their mere abscondence of the appellants cannot be found guilty in the absence of other corroborating evidence.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Basir Ahmed, learned Assistant Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the State-respondent of both the criminal appeals, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division. He further submits that the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and as such, no interference is called for.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocate for the appellants of both the appeals and learned Assistant Attorney General for the State-respondent of both the appeals, perused the impugned judgment and the materials on record.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Before entering into the merit of the appeals, it would be pertinent to go through the grounds, for which, leave was granted. The grounds are quoted below:  </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“I.  Because a confessional statement of a co-accused is only evidence against the maker but the same has no evidentiary value against other co-accused except only to lend assurance to other evidence, and further the same is never evidence as contemplated in the definition of “evidence” contained in section 3 of the Evidence Act, and the affirmation of conviction and sentence by the High Court Division, based upon confessional statements having not corroborated by circumstances, is not tenable in law.<br/>II.   Because none of the witnesses led by the prosecution disclosed anything in Court implicating the accused-petitioners, but they have been implicated only by the confessional statements of the co-accused Edu Mia and Ratan Mia, which were not corroborated by any independent witnesses, the confirmation of conviction and sentence relying on such confessional statements is not tenable in law.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly, there is no direct evidence against the appellants except the confessional statements of accused Ratan Mia and Edu Mia. Relying on the long abscondence of the appellants and the confessional statements of co-accused persons, namely, Ratan Mia and Edu Mia, the High Court Division came to a finding that the prosecution had been able to bring home the charge against the appellants under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W.1, Nurul Amin, father of the deceased Jamal Hossain, is the informant of the case. In his evidence, he stated that his son Jamal Hossain, a rickshaw puller, went out of the house with a rickshaw on 12.11.1998. He came home at noon and took his lunch and went away with his rickshaw in the afternoon. He plied the rickshaw till 11 p.m. and after that he went to a Mahfil at Fakirbari. He did not return home at night. On the following morning the informant got news that the dead body of his son had been lying in the Mehagani garden located on east of Fakirbari. He rushed to the place of occurrence and found innumerable marks of injuries on the body of his son. Local Union Parishad Member and the Chairman and others came to the place of occurrence. Police prepared the inquest report of the dead body and took the signature of the informant on it. Subsequently, he lodged the FIR which was marked as exhibit-2 and his signature as exhibits-2/1. After about 2 hours police arrested accused Ratan Mia, who on interrogation admitted that Edu, Babul, Morshed, Alamgir, Monjil, Johora Bibi, Ramiza Bibi murdered Jamal at the house of Morshed and kept the body in the Mehagani garden. The police recovered the knife and blood stained cloth from the house of Ramiza Bibi. Accused, namely, Ramiza Bib, Monzil Hossain, Ratan Miah and Edu Miah made confessional statements under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The informant identified the accused persons present in the dock. In cross-examination, he stated that the FIR was written by the police at the Police Station. On the night following 13.11.1998, the police arrested accused Ratan of Balutupa. He could come to know that Ratan and others murdered his son.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Prosecution also examined P.W.2, Md. Shafiqul Islam, P.W.3, Abul Miah, P.W.4, Joynul Abedin Bahani, P.W.5, Abul Hossain, P.W.6, Ali Ahmed, P.W.7, Mostafa Sarwar, P.W.8, Abdur Razzak, P.W.9, Kala Mia, P.W.10, Shahjahan, P.W.11, Md. Bachchu Mia, P.W.12, Md. Mazibur Rahman, P.W.13, Md. Faruque, P.W.14, Dr. Md. Golam Mostafa, P.W.15, Md. Mostafa Kamal, Sub-Inspector and P.W.16, Md. Mozakker Ali, Magistrate First Class.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It has been already stated that there is no eye-witness to the occurrence. The trial Court convicted the appellants solely relying on the confessional statements of accused-Ratan Miah and Edu Miah and also on consideration of their long abscondence immediately after the occurrence. Having gone through the confessional statements of accused-Ratan Miah and Edu Miah, we find that they implicated the appellants in the occurrence.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A confessional statement of a co-accused is only evidence against the maker but the same has no evidentiary value against other co-accused except only to lend assurance to other evidence. A confessional  statement of a co-accused is a matter for consideration against another accused if tried jointly with him. It has been stated in section 30 of the Evidence Act as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“30. When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the Court may take into consideration such confession as against such other of such persons as well as against the person who makes such confession.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">This section simply makes the confession of a co-accused a relevant fact. In other words, the confessional statement of a co-accused is admissible against other persons in the sense that it may be taken into consideration against them along with other evidence. But for this section 30, the confessional statement of one accused will be inadmissible in evidence against another accused in view of section 3 of the Evidence Act. The statement of a co-accused does not fall within the definition of evidence as given in section 3 of the Evidence Act. The simple reason is that it is not made on oath; that it is not made in presence of the accused and that its veracity is not tested by cross-examination. It is, therefore, a very weak evidence against co-accused if it is regarded as evidence under section 30.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of <strong><em>Bhuboni Sahu vs. The King, 2 DLR, Privy Council,39,</em></strong> it has been held as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“Section 30 seems to be based on the view that an admission by an accused-person of his own guilt affords some sort of sanction in support of the truth of his confession against others as well as himself. But a confession of a co-accused is obviously evidence of a very weak type. It does not indeed, come within the definition of “evidence” contained in section 3, Evidence Act. It is not required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the accused, and it cannot be tested by cross-examination. It is a much weaker type of evidence than the evidence of an approver which is not subject to any of these infirmities. Section 30, however, provides that the Court may take the confession into consideration and thereby, no doubt, make it evidence on which the Court may act; but the section does not say that confession is to amount to proof. Clearly there must be other evidence. The confession is only one element in the consideration of all the facts proved in the case; it can be put into the scale and weighed with the other evidence. There Lordships think that the view which has prevailed in most Courts in India, namely, that the confession of a co-accused can be used only in support of other evidence and cannot be made the foundation of conviction, is correct.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of <strong><em>Maqbool Hussain vs. State 12 DLR (SC)217,</em></strong> it has been held as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“We next take up consideration of the question whether section 30 of the Evidence Act could not be called in aid of the prosecution in support of the appellant’s conviction. Assuming that statements of a confessional nature were made by the co-accused of the appellant, to the Tahsildar, affecting themselves and the appellant, section 30 of the Evidence Act merely provides that the Court “may take into consideration” such confessions as against the appellant, as well as against their makers. The language of the section is very guarded and lends no warrant to the inference that such a statement made by a co-accused could be treated as substantive evidence against the other person, sufficient to sustain his conviction. It is well settled that there ought to be other evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, linking such a person with the crime, before a confession made by a co-accused could be adverted to, in adjudging the guilt of that person.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Reliance may be placed on the case of <strong><em>State and another vs. Abdul Kader @ Mobile Kader and others (2015) 67 DLR (AD)06.</em></strong> It has been held as under:  </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“The Court cannot proceed with the case relying on the confession of co-accused; it must begin with other evidence and after it has formed its opinion with regard to the quality and effect of the said evidence, then it is permissible to turn to the confession in order to receive assurance to the conclusion of guilt which the judicial mind is about of reach. If there is no other evidence against co-accused except the confession, then, the confession by itself being merely a matter to be taken into consideration, and not being an evidence under section 3, no conviction of the co-accused could be given relying on such confession.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Reliance can be placed in this connection on the cases of <strong><em>State vs. Fazu Kazi, 29 DLR (SC)271, Haroon Haji vs. Maharashtra, AIR 1968 SC 832, Kashmira Singh vs. Modhya Pradesh, AIR 1952 SC 159, Jayendara Saraswami Swamigal vs. State of TN (2005)2 SCC 13 (para 10) and Sidharth vs. State of Bihar,(2005)12 SCC 454</em></strong>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of the principle expounded in cases referred to above, we are of the view that the High Court Division erred in taking the confessional statements of co-accused Ratan Miah and Edu Miah as substantive evidence and maintained the conviction of the appellants without corroboration by any independent evidence.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly, both the appellants had been absconding soon after the occurrence and the police could arrest them after submission of the charge sheet. Absconsion by itself is not conclusive evidence to infer either of guilt or guilty conscience. The fact that the appellants absconded soon after the crime was committed is no evidence by itself. It may only lend weight to other evidence. Abscondence cannot be treated to be corroboration of the confessional statement of other co-accused so as to base thereon the conviction of the absconding accused. In this connection reliance may be placed on the case of <strong><em>Amir Hossain Howlader vs. The State (1984)BLD (AD)193,</em></strong> in which, it has been held that absconsion of an accused is corroboration of the direct evidence of eye-witnesses connecting the accused with the crime but absconsion of an accused cannot be treated to be corroboration of the confessional statement of another accused so as to base thereon conviction of the absconding accused. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Even an innocent man may feel panicky and to evade arrest and trial may abscond when suspected of grave crime like murder. Abscondence by itself was not conclusive proof of guilt or guilty conscience of an accused but it might lend support to other evidence on record. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">In this connection, we may consider the case of <strong><em>State vs. Siraj Mondal @ Siraj (2008)8 BLC 52,</em></strong> in which, it has been held as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“Section 8 of the Evidence Act lays emphasis upon the conduct of an accused as one of the influencing factors in resolving his guilt. But this could not be treated as an unfailing evidence against him unless other evidence on record was sufficient enough to hold him guilty. Abscondence by itself was not thus conclusive proof of guilt or guilty conscience of an accused but it might lend support to other evidence on record.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Reliance may also be placed on the case of <strong><em>State vs. Sree Ranjit Kumar Pramanik 45 DLR 660, Ashraf Ali Munshi vs. State 48 DLR 590</em></strong>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Having gone through the evidence on record, we find that such other evidence as required for corroboration of abscondence was lacking in the case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the light of the findings made before, we find substance in these appeals. Accordingly both the criminal appeals are allowed and the order of conviction and sentence passed against both the appellants of two appeals are set aside. They be set at liberty if not wanted in any other connection.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed. </strong></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><hr/><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><strong><u>C</u></strong></a><strong><u>riminal Appeal Nos. 15-16 of 2012. </u></strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 20.01.2009 passed by the High Court Division in Death Reference No.39 of 2005, Criminal Appeal Nos.1509 and 1956 of 2005 and Jail Appeal No.370 of 2005).</div></div></div></div>

For the purpose of ascertaining as to employment of a person in a marine vessel, two documents are vital, one being (1) the Agreement for the employment with the owner of the vessel, either directly or through their agent and the other being (2) the continuous discharge certificate (CDC), so far the ‘Seaman’ not the ‘master’ is concerned.            . . .

All the plaintiffs are Bangladeshi national, who were engaged in the service of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL under the contract executed by and between the plaintiffs and the owners of the owing company of the defendant No. 1 vessel. The defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL was lying at the outer anchorage at Chittagong Port, Chittagong in distressed condition also at the time of filing the suit.</li><li style="text-align:justify">There are only 4 (four) principal defendants in the suit and 5 (five) proforma defendants. The identity of the 4 (four) principal defendants have been described as the defendant No. 2, Merchant House in IMC, represented by its agent in Bangladesh Sigma Shipping Lines, having its office at Panama and owned by one Mr. Atul Jain.

The defendant No. 4 is Sigma Shipping Lines, having its office at 91 Agrabad Commercial Area, Chittagong, being the local agent of the defendant No. 2. All the plaintiffs signed the employment contract with the owner of the defendant No. 1 vessel through their representative in Bangladesh, the defendant No. 4, Sigma Shipping Lines. The plaintiffs performed their respective duties in the defendant No. 1, vessel from the date of joining. The plaintiff Nos. 1, 5-8 are on board for nineteen months and the plaintiff Nos. 2-4 have signed off after serving nine months and all of them have not been paid salary for the period of service. The plaintiffs and their family members have been living in miserable condition for long, due to monetary constraint. The plaintiffs sent repeated reminders to the owner and the agent of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL, but they did not pay any heed to it and did not pay the outstanding salaries as per the contract of the plaintiffs. Hence the Suit.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The total claim of the plaintiffs against the defendants, up to 30.4.2012, were narrated in paragraph No. 6 of the plaint with a grand total of US$ 180903.00 which was later amended, on 13.2.2013, enhancing the same to the total claim up to 31.1.2013, to a grand total of US$ 403088.00 equivalent to BD Tk. 3,30,53,216.00 @ taka 82 per US$.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Subsequently the plaintiffs again amended the plaint on 23.10.2014, whereupon the paragraph No. 6 was deleted and the new facts as to the enhanced claim of the plaintiffs have been incorporated to the extent that the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL while discharging its 12,200 MTs. of Fertilizer at the port of Chittagong, suddenly run aground on 8.10.2010 and to avoid a total loss of the said cargo, the said vessel was beached on 14.10.2010 near Patenga, Chittagong Port and the Indian origin master and crew members of the said vessel abandoned the vessel, keeping the vessel in a distressed condition. Thereafter, the plaintiffs were employed as master and crew members respectively, of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL by its owners manager, the defendant No. 3, through their agent defendant No. 4, under different written contracts of service on terms and conditions as mentioned in their respective contract of employment.

OCEAN PEARL in order to keep it in safe condition and to protect the vessel from pilferage and looting by the pirates and local hoodlums at the outer anchorage of Chittagong Port.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It has been further stated that the plaintiffs, being the crew members of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL, had salvaged, during the period 23.2.2011 to July 2011, a total of 1906 M.Ts. cargo from the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V.

OCEAN PEARL. The plaintiffs have accordingly claimed reward and risk bonuses in their portage bill earlier submitted.  The defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL was severely damaged resulting in its split up in almost two parts, due to the devastating cyclonic storm and tidal boar, which occurred on 12.6.2011. Thereafter, the owner of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL, with a view to settle the employment of the plaintiffs, requested the master to send the portage bill up to 14<sup>th</sup> of June, 2011, showing signed off and serving seaman, so as to enable the owner of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL to settle the outstanding salary and wages and dues of the plaintiffs till 14<sup>th</sup> June, 2011 and as such the plaintiffs were accordingly shown in the portage bill up to 14<sup>th</sup> June, 2011. But thereafter the plaintiffs were neither paid the outstanding wages, as per the said portage bill of June 2011, nor they were arranged for officially signing off till the dates as mentioned in the Schedule of Claim, as evidenced by their respective CDC. As per the terms of contract of their respective services, the plaintiffs were to be paid their respective monthly wages and all other dues after all necessary deduction therefrom as per the monthly portage bill, prepared and maintained by the concerned official of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL in the normal course of the affairs. The plaintiffs are entitled in law and equity to claim and recover their monthly outstanding wages and other dues till the date they have signed off from their respective services and the principle defendants are jointly and severely liable in law and equity to pay the same. A total sum of US$ 6,17,118.00 equivalent to Bd. Tk. 5,12,20,794.00 become due to the plaintiffs as their accumulated outstanding wages and other dues from the principle defendants for their services rendered as seamen on board the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The particulars of each of the plaintiff Nos. 1-8 in regard to their respective name, rank and dates of joining, signing off, monthly salary, other dues, interest and total outstanding dues due to each of the plaintiffs from the principle defendants are given in the Schedule appended to the plaint, wherein it has been stated that by the terms of the employment contracts the plaintiff’s were entitled to salary in US dollar, payment to be made in equivalent Bangladesh currency. The plaintiff No. 1 is entitled to a total amount of Tk. 2,97,48,196.00 equivalent to US$ 358412.00; the plaintiff No. 2 is entitled to a total amount of Tk. 40,48,325.00, equivalent to US$ 48775.00; the plaintiff No. 3 is entitled to a total amount of Tk. 75,95,662.00, equivalent to US$ 91514.00;  the plaintiff No. 4 is entitled to a total amount of Tk. 29,92,482.00 equivalent to US$ 36054.00.

Tk. 5,12,20,794.00 @ Tk. 83 per dollar. The plaintiffs are entitled to receive the aforesaid amount from the defendants, who are legally liable to pay the same. But although the plaintiffs repeatedly requested the defendants to settle the outstanding dues of the plaintiffs, but till date the defendants have not settled the legitimate claim of the plaintiffs and it is apparent that the defendants are acting in negligence and unwilling to settle the legitimate claim of the plaintiffs for which the plaintiffs were constrained to file the instant suit.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It has been further stated that the plaintiff No. 1, the Bangladeshi Master of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL always worried for the safety of life of his crews and watchmen, who are guarding the vessel against pirates and robbers, as the vessel is in distressed condition. If the Master would abandoned the vessel for the safety of their life, the vessel would have been looted by pirates and robbers by cutting the valuable steel plates of the vessel, by which the environmental pollution may take place.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff Nos. 2-4 are entitled to get their continuation of salary as they were not paid their balance as per maritime law during verbal signing off, which is not acted upon in the eye of law. The claim made by the plaintiffs in the instant suit is enforceable under the Admiralty Court Act 2000, since the cause of action of the suit arose lastly on 26.4.2012 and 27.4.2012 when the defendants have failed to abide by their commitment to make payment of the salary of the plaintiffs within due time.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff Nos. 2-8 have executed a power of attorney giving authority to the plaintiff No. 1 to sign the plaint verification and swearing affidavit for any application in connection with the instant Admiralty Suit.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>         Prayer of the plaintiffs.</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Although the other paragraphs of the plaint has been amended but the paragraph No. 12 contained the earlier claim of US$ 1,80,903.00 equivalent to Tk. 1,50,14,949.00 inadvertently.

Tk. 5,12,20,794.00 against the principle defendants jointly and severally and in favour of the plaintiffs jointly and severally, to be distributed among the plaintiffs in the manner of their respective claim amount, as mentioned in the Schedule of plaint.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>         Step taken by the defendants.</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Although the suit has been filed against the principle defendant Nos. 1-4 and the said defendants appeared through the learned Advocate Mr. Muhammad Ohiullah and others, through the warrant of attorney dated 18<sup>th</sup> July, 2012, signed by Sheikh Md.

OCEAN PEARL during the tenure from the year 2010 up to the whole year 2013, as an when the plaintiffs were employed in the vessel and signed off from the employment. But as the defendants, being the owner of the vessel, have failed to pay the salary and other benefits to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs were constrained to institute the instant suit, in order to realize the legitimate dues of the plaintiffs.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Abdul Khaleque next argued that during the pendency of the suit the defendant No. 4 entered appearance and did not deny the legitimate claim of the plaintiffs and upon an order passed by this court, paid the partial lodging and fooding expenses of the plaintiffs, at the rate of Tk. 1,40,000.00 per month, up to July, 2013. But thereafter the defendants stopped paying even the fooding and lodging expenses which thrown the plaintiffs into financial distress condition till they have signed off from the employment of the defendants.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Abdul Khaleque next argued that actually the plaintiffs were employed by the defendants by way of written employment contract on different date and at that time, the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL was abandoned by the Indian origin crew members as the vessel was aground near the Chittagong Port with the cargo of the BCIC and the same was at distressed condition due to not only it’s aground condition, but also against the threatening of being looted by the pirates and other local hoodlums and looters who were roaming around the Chittagong Port hunting prey. The plaintiff upon getting their employment by the defendants, boarded the vessel and served in it in a very distressed condition, in order to save the vessel not only from its distressed condition but also from looting by the pirates. Moreover, the plaintiffs have salvaged the cargo for which the cargo claimant BCIC got the cargo due to the salvage operation operated by the plaintiff at their risks of life.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Abdul Khaleque drawn the attention of this court to the fact that the plaintiffs employment in the vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL have been started by way of employment contract, executed by the defendant No. 4 as the local agent of the defendant Nos. 1,2 and 3 and there being urgency to man the vessel by new crews, as the earlier Indian origin crew members left the vessel leaving it in distressed condition, the plaintiffs were hurriedly pushed to board the vessel by the employer, without observing the required legal formalities i.e. to endorse their employment in their service identity book, excepting few of the plaintiffs. The said failure on the part of the plaintiffs not being their willful act and being a technical question, is not required to be taken into notice by this court seriously, since the defendants have admitted the employment of the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs have served the vessel during the full tenure with their all ability against every risk and opposition not only from the circumstances, but also from the weather and environment, which will reveal from the e-mails that have been exchanged in between the Master and the owner of the vessel, which have been exhibited in this suit, being exhibit No. 18 (series) and exhibit No. 20 and also from the letter exhibit No.-22 and all other documents that have been exhibited in this suit.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Abdul Kahleque next argued that the plaintiffs claim have been admitted by the defendants, since the defendant No. 4 entered appearance in this suit and filed the written objection against the prayer for auction sell of the vessel, whereupon the defendants pay the lodging and fooding charge to the plaintiffs, pursuant to the order passed by this court and therefore the service tenure of the plaintiffs not being denied by the defendants, the plaintiffs are entitled to the decree as prayed for.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Abdul Khaleque finally argued that on the instance of the plaintiffs the vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL was sold on auction and the same was purchased by local party who took the possession of the vessel long back. Because of the service rendered by the plaintiffs, during their service tenure, by protecting the same from all environmental condition, the plaintiffs are required to be paid by way of decree of this court else, the plaintiffs will faced with an in justice that they are not being paid of their legitimate salary, wages and other dues.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Deliberation of the Court.</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">This court has heard the evidence adduced by the witnesses and also heard the learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Abdul Khaleque appearing on behalf of the plaintiffs. This court perused the exhibits meticulously and considered the submissions as advanced by the learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Abdul Khaleque.</li><li style="text-align:justify">From the trends of the evidence, it appears that issues of the suit are required to be recast and accordingly the issues of this suit are recast as follows;	<ol><li>Is the suit is maintainable in its present form and manner in this Admiralty Court?</li><li>Are the plaintiffs were lawfully employed in the defendant No. 1 vessel and discharged their duties on board the defendant No. 1 vessel for certain tenure?</li><li>Is there any dues in respect of salary and wages of the plaintiff against the defendants remain unpaid?</li><li>Are the plaintiff are entitled to reliefs or relieves as prayed for?</li><li>Is there any other or further relief or relieves the plaintiff are entitled to?</li></ol></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Now this court will dispose off the issues in seriatim.<br/><strong><em>Issue no. 1</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiffs have initiated this Admiralty proceedings against the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL and against its owners and interested parties for realization of their unpaid due salary and wages. Therefore this claim of the plaintiffs, subject to prove of their employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel as Master and crew members, comes under the purview of the provision of section 3(2)(h) of the Admiralty court Act 2000. Accordingly this court finds that the instant suit is maintainable in its present form and manner. Therefore the issue No. 1 is resolved in favour of the plaintiff’s.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Issue No. 2, 3 and 4.</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">All these issues are interlinked and as such those are taken together for disposal for the sake of brevity and convenience. </li><li style="text-align:justify">This suit although heard <em>exparte, </em>since the defendant No. 4, upon entering into the suit filed written objection against the sell of the vessel, did not further appear and contest the suit, nevertheless the plaintiffs have to prove their own case in order to obtain a decree in this suit in respect of their (1) date of appointment (2) discharging duty on board the vessel, (3) non-payment of salary &amp; wages, (4) actual date of their signing off and (5) amount of unpaid salary &amp; wages and their entitlement to reward for salvage etc.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Prior to entering into the factual aspect as to the employment of the plaintiff in the defendant No. 1 vessel, an appraisal is required to be made as to the law regarding employment of persons in the marine vessel which is governed by the provision of Bangladesh Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1983, since admittedly the plaintiffs were employed to a vessel which was stationed within the territorial water of Bangladesh, albeit the same was a vessel not of Bangladesh Registration but of alien country i.e. the Federation of St. Kittisd and Neves of the Caribbean.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff No. 1 Captain Md. Abdul Hyee Mia is a ‘master by profession’ and employed as such in the defendant No. 1 vessel. Being a master, the plaintiff No. 1 has special status in the marine employment, since he does not come within the purview of the definition of ‘seaman’. The provision of section 2(45) of the Provision of Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1983 made all the person employed in a vessel to discharge marine job as ‘Seaman’ excepting the ‘master’, ‘pilot’, apprentice employed in the vessel. Section 89 of the Bangladesh Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1983 requires that any person employed or engaged in any job on board a ship must conclude an employment agreement and that all ‘Seaman’ upon such employment will be issued with a document known as “Continuous Discharge Certificate” (CDC) by the Shipping Master, appointed under section 8 of the said act by the government. The provision of sub section (2) of section 8 of the said Act further requires that the details of the service of a seaman be recorded in the CDC book from time to time specially the discharge of the seaman, as requires under the provision of section 131. Such recording of discharge has to be made by the master of the vessel but discharge must be effected in ‘presence’ of the ‘Shipping Master’ of the port.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Therefore it appears that for the purpose of ascertaining as to employment of a person in a marine vessel, two documents are vital, one being (1) the Agreement for the employment with the owner of the vessel, either directly or through their agent and the other being (2) the continuous discharge certificate (CDC), so far the ‘Seaman’ not the ‘master’ is concerned.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It further appears from section 89 of the Bangladesh Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1983 that in lieu of CDC book any similar document may be issued by the Shipping Master to the seaman and further the ‘provision of section 106 of the said acts provides for holding by every seaman’s identity card issued by the government with prescribed particulars to be noted in it. These documents shall prove the lawful employment and discharge of seaman in a marine vessel and through which a liability will be imposed upon the owner of the vessel to pay the wages.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the light of the aforesaid legal position, we will now examine the claim of the plaintiff in the instant suit as to their employment and entitlements of wages and other monetary benefits. </li><li style="text-align:justify">The claim of the plaintiffs are for the realization of salary, wages  and other monetary claim due to them, as they have been employed in the vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL. The circumstances under which the plaintiff were employed in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL have been stated by the P.Ws that while at the Chittagong port, the defendant No. 1 vessel became aground and failing to release the vessel from the aground position, the then master and crew members of the defendant vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL, who were of Indian origin, left and abandoned the vessel in distressed condition. Thereafter, the defendant No. 4, Sigma Shipping Lines, being the local agent of the owner of the vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL and authorized to appoint Master and crew members appointed the plaintiffs on different dates in the employments of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL in different capacity, in its distressed condition. The plaintiffs executed employment agreements with the owner of the vessel through the agent and boarded the vessel from their respective date of employment agreement and served the vessel.</li><li style="text-align:justify">This assertions have not only been well proved by the corroborative evidence/documents filed by the P.Ws as mark exhibit 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 17 which were the employment contract but also admitted in the written objection filed by the defendant No. 4 in the instant suit. Although the relevant portion of the written objection was not made exhibit, yet that being the courts document, there is no legal impediment to consider the same for relying upon any admission of the defendant No. 4.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It has been asserted in the plaint and also the PW’s claimed, that the plaintiffs have received the fooding and lodging expenses during the pendency of the instant suit for the period from 1.7.2012 upto 31.07.2012 from the defendant No. 4 on behalf of the owner of the vessel, who paid the said fooding and lodging charge to the plaintiffs at the rate of Tk. 1,40,000.00 per month, as ordered by this court.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Upon perusing the record it appears that the said factual aspect is correct, as appears from the order of this court, dated 5.8.2012 and it further appears from the order dated 5.8.2012 that this court directed the defendant No. 4 to pay Tk. 1,40,000.00 as food and lodging charge for the month of August 2012. Thereafter this court again directed, through the order dated 13.2.2013, defendant No. 4 to pay Tk. 1,40,000.00 per month to the plaintiff till their actual sign off from the employment. These orders were complied off duly by the defendant No. 4 as admitted by the P.W., which indicate that unless the plaintiff’s were in the employment under the owner of the defendant No. 1 vessel, the agent of the owner of the vessel, the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Line would not have pay the fooding and lodging charge. Therefore the service of the plaintiff’s in the defendant No. 1 vessel has been well proved and established. </li><li style="text-align:justify">The PWs have stated that they have been employed in the defendant No. 1 vessel but at no point of time the plaintiffs received their salary and upon several request the defendants failed to pay the salary and wages to the plaintiffs, for which the plaintiffs are constrained to institute the instant Admiralty Suit in order to realize their legitimate claim of wages and salary along with other monetary claim.</li><li style="text-align:justify">This assertion has compelled the plaintiffs to prove their tenure of employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel, especially the date of joining and the date of signing off from their employment, by way of cogent evidence, since the statement made in the written objection as aforesaid, filed by the defendant No. 4, not being evidence, cannot be taken into consideration for the purpose of proving such facts.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It appears that the plaintiffs have submitted photocopies of their all documents relating to their appointment and discharge at the time of filling the suit on 9.5.2012 and later submitted the same documents at the time of deposition adduced by the PW 1 SK. Rafiqul Islam and marked the same as exhibit. But there appears serious discrepancies in this two sets of documents as to the endorsement and attestation of the appointment and discharge from the employment, which cannot be overlooked by this court. Moreover the PW. 1, exhibited the photocopies of the employment contracts of the plaintiffs, which have been marked as exhibit Nos. 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 17. These exhibits being the secondary evidence, the filling PW was liable to explain as to his inability to exhibit the original copy of the documents. But the PW 1 who exhibited these documents did not state anything about the status of the original copies of the employment contracts, although those original copies of the employment contracts must be with the plaintiffs at all point of time.  However this lacuna of non-explaining the reason making the photocopies as exhibit may be leniently viewed in view of the fact that the appointment of the plaintiff have been admitted by the defendant No. 4.</li><li style="text-align:justify">But the mischievous Act done with the exhibited photocopies cannot be ignored these photocopies were attested through seal and signature of the Master of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL, the plaintiff No. 1, Captain Md. Abdul Hayee Miah, which has been claimed as true attestation of the said documents in order to file the same in the court to be marked as exhibit in order to prove their employment in the vessel through the said photocopies. But such attestation for some of the plaintiffs, were made not on the original but on the photocopies even much later than the filing of the suit which has been revealed from the meticulous examination of the sets of photocopies filed at the time of filing the suits and the same photocopies made exhibit.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Be that as it may, upon meticulous examinations of these photocopy exhibits, it appears that the plaintiff No. 1 Captain Md. Abdul Hayee Miah was genuinely initially employed on 2.11.2010 in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL as Master of the vessel by the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Lines, on behalf of its foreign principle M/S. Prayati Shipping (Pvt.) Limited, the defendant No. 3. Later, by another independent employment contract dated 28<sup>th</sup> February, 2011 the plaintiff No. 1 Captain Md. Abdul Hayee Miah was re-employed in the service of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL as Master of the vessel. In support of the claim such employment of the plaintiff No. 1 as Master of the vessel, the photocopies of the Continuous Discharge Certificate (CDC), being No. C/0/0239 has been filed at the time of filing of the suit on 9.5.2015, but the same did not contain the endorsement of the employment in defendant No. 1 vessel verified by the Govt. Shipping Master at Chittagong, although the said CDC book was issued on 18.04.2012 to be valid up to 17.4.2017, wherein all the previous entries in the earlier CDC book were entered and verified by the Govt. Shipping Master at Chittagong. Such issuance and endorsement of the CDC Book to the master of a vessel although not a requirement of section 89 of the Bangladesh Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1983, yet the masters of the vessel as a practice obtains CDC book in their name. This revealed the fact that the appointment in the employment and discharge of the plaintiff No. 1, captain Abdul Hyee Mia was not endorsed in the CDC Book at the or just after his employment, rather during the pendency of the instant suit. This although indicates that the plaintiff No. 1 had joined the defendant No. 1 vessel on urgent and emergency basis when the Indian origin master and the crew members abandoned and left the vessel, compelling the plaintiff No. 1 to join the duty leaving aside his liability to attend the government shipping office at Chittagong for endorsement in the CDC Book nevertheless such failure shall not make him liable to face the consequence.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Further it appears from the CDC Book, exhibit 5, that the plaintiff No. 1 procured the said CDC Book, being No. 07105, anew on 18.4.2012 when he was unemployed, having left his last job as Master in MV. B Gourab (Banglar Gourab) on 6.10.2010. Later when the photocopy of the said CDC Book has been made exhibit, as exhibit No. 5, the same contained a new page wherefrom it appears that the employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL has been endorsed by the common seal of the Government shipping office at Chittagong. Moreover, the said Continuous Discharge Certificate (CDC) also contained the endorsement that the Master of the vessel, the plaintiff No. 1 was discharged on 30.09.2012 and the same was endorsed by the signature of the shipping master on 30.9.2013. Therefore, the employment of the Master, the plaintiff No. 1 in the defendant No. 1 vessel is required to be taken to have come to an end on and from 30.09.2012 and not from 30.09.2013. Accordingly the only outcome comes from the scenario that, this court finds that the plaintiff No. 1 was employed in the defendant No. 1 vessel as Master and served the vessel for the tenure commencing from 2.11.2010 upto the period 30.09.2012 for which he was entitled to salary and wages as per the employment contract for these total 330 days i.e. about 11 months. </li><li style="text-align:justify">It has been further asserted and claimed by the P.W. 1 Sk. Rafiqul Islam that he himself being the plaintiff No. 2 was employed through the employment contract dated 28. 10. 2010 as second officer in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL by the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Lines, on behalf of its foreign principle, the defendant No. 5 M/S. Prayati Shipping Lines (Pvt.) Limited and he signed off from the service on 21.07.2012. In order to prove this factual aspect the P.W. 1, on behalf of plaintiff No. 2, exhibited the photocopies of his Continuous Discharge Certificate (CDC), issued by the Shipping master in his name, since he is seaman, wherefrom it appears that the Government Shipping Master at Chittagong endorsed the employment of the defendant No. 2 in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL on an from the date 28.10.2010 and therefore the plaintiff No. 2 successfully proved his engagement in employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel on and from 28.10.2010.</li><li style="text-align:justify">But the Column for discharge of the plaintiff No. 2 from the said employment although has been written as 21.7.2012, but the same has been endorsed not on the original copy of the CDC book but on the photocopy of the same. The said endorsement was made by the master of the defendant No. 1 vessel, the plaintiff No. 1 Mr. Md. Abdul Hayee Miah, pursuant to the provision of section 131 of the Bangladesh Shipping Merchant Ordinance 1983, but not on the original CDC book, but on the photocopy of the 2<sup>nd</sup> sets of photocopies filed for the purpose of making the same exhibit. The said photocopy has been marked as exhibit No. 7. Therefore it appears that the plaintiff No. 2 failed to prove the date of his actual sign off from of the service and accordingly the same is required to be ascertained from other exhibited document.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff No. 3, Karimul Hoq claimed that he was employed through exhibit No. 8 dated 21.10.2010 as 2/E (2<sup>nd</sup> Engineer) in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL and he has also exhibited the photocopy of the ‘Sea Farers Identity documents’ (SFI), exhibit No. 9, wherefrom it appears that the plaintiff No. 3 was previously employed in the defendant No. 1 vessel on 21.05.2010 and quitted the job on 03.09.2010 which was duly endorsed in the original copy of the document by the earlier master of the vessel. Thereafter the plaintiff No. 3 again joined the defendant No. 1 vessel on 21.10.2010, wherein the date of his new joining in the employment of the defendant No. 1 vessel was endorsed as 21.10.2010 and the date of quitting the job was endorsed as 14.6.2011. But, although the endorsement of joining the new employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel was made in the original SFI document, as appears from the photocopy, but the endorsement for the quitting the said job in the defendant No. 1 vessel has been made by the Master of the vessel i.e, plaintiff No. 1, not on the original, SFI document but on the photocopy of the same, the 2<sup>nd</sup> set filed for the purpose of making the same exhibit. Therefore it appears that this plaintiff No. 3 also failed to prove his date of sign off from the employment.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The exhibit No. 10 is the photocopy of the employment contract of the plaintiff No. 4, Md. Kamal Uddin, which shows that the plaintiff No. 4 was employed in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL on 1.11.2010 as an Electrician by the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Lines on behalf of the principal defendant No. 3, the owner of the defendant No. 1 vessel, who later as P.W. also exhibited the photocopy of the ‘Sea Farers Identity documents’ (SFI) standing in his name, wherein the date of joining has been endorsed as 1.11.2010 and the date of quitting the job also endorsed as 14.6.2011. But although the date of joining was endorsed in the original copy of the SFI document, but the endorsement as to the quitting the job was made by the plaintiff No. 1 as the Master of the vessel, not on the original document, but on the photocopy, which has been made exhibit No. 10. Therefore it appears that this plaintiff No. 4 has failed to prove his tenure of service.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Exhibit No. 12 being photocopy of the employment contract, shows that the plaintiff No. 5, Shah Makhlisur Rahman was employed on 26. 10. 2010 in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL by the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Lines Limited on behalf of the foreign principle M/S. Prayati Shipping (Pvt.) Limited, the defendant No. 3, who has also exhibited the photocopies of ‘Sea Farers Identity document (SFI) being exhibit No. 13, which does not shows any endorsement as to his employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL or his quitting the employment at any point of time. Therefore the plaintiff no. 5 also failed to prove his appointment in the employment at any point of time or his tenure of service in the defendant No. 1 vessel.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff No. 6 Mohsin Mollah claimed that he was employed in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL by the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Lines on behalf of its principle M/S. Prayati Shipping Lines (Pvt.) Limited the defendant No. 3 on 24.10. 2010 as a GP, who has only exhibited the photo copy of his employment contract as exhibit No. 14, but he did not exhibit ‘sea fareres Identity document or any such document, to show his joining the employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel and the date of his quitting the employment. Therefore this plaintiff No. 6 also failed to have proved his tenure of service in the defendant No. 1 vessel.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff No. 7 Md. Ali Osman also claimed that he was employed in the defendant No. 1 vessel on 16.12.2010, through the employment contract, by the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Lines on behalf of the owner of the defendant No. 1 vessel, the defendant No. 03, photocopy of which has been exhibited as exhibit No. 15. This plaintiff although exhibited the photocopy of ‘Sea Fares identity documents’ (SFI) as exhibit No. 16, but the endorsement made in the Column of date of joining and date of quitting the job contained the endorsement as made on16.12.2010 and 30.9.2013 respectively, which having been made by the plaintiff No. 1 as Master of the vessel, not on the original document but on the photocopy, as exhibited herein. More over a further endorsement in exhibit 16 shows that the validity of the said document expired on 14.12.2011. Therefore this plaintiff No. 7 also failed to prove his employment and service tenure in the defendant No. 1 vessel.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff No. 8 Shamsuddin made his employment contract as exhibit No. 17, which has been allegedly executed by the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Lines on behalf of his foreign principle M/S. Prayati Shipping (Pvt.) Limited, defendant No. 03, which shows that the plaintiff No. 8 was employed as M-Man in the defendant No. 1 vessel. But neither any CDC or ‘Sea Farers identity documents’ (SFI) nor any other documents showing his date of joining and the quitting the job in defendant No. 1 vessel have been submitted or exhibited by the plaintiff No. 8. Therefore the alleged employment and the service tenure of this plaintiff No. 8 in the defendant No. 1 vessel has not been proved.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The employment of any Bangladeshi Seaman in any ship or vessel, either Bangladeshi or foreign, is regulated by the provision of Bangladesh Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1983. The persons employed as such are known as ‘Sea man’ which has been defined in section 2(45) of the said ordinance which excluded the ‘Master’ of the vessel.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The employment of the seamen in a foreign vessel within Bangladesh is regulated by the provision Chapter 10 of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1983 and the provision of section 107 of the said ordinance deals with the matter of documents regarding the employment of seaman, which reads as follows;</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1983</em></strong><br/><strong><em>Section 107(1)</em></strong><em>.<strong> Seaman to be in possession of Continuous Discharge Certificate.</strong>- (1) No person shall engage any Bangladesh seaman at any port or place in Bangladesh, nor carry to sea from any such port or place any such seaman in any ship, except a coasting ship of less than two hundred tons gross so long as such coasting ship is employed on voyages confined to ports or places within Bangladesh, unless the seamen is in possession of a Continuous Discharge Certificate issued in Bangladesh by a Shipping Master in a form approved by the Director-General of Shipping or such other document as may be prescribed, </em><br/><em>(2) if a person engages or carries to see any seaman in contravention of sub-section (1), he shall, for each offence, be punishable with fine which may extend to ten thousand Taka.</em></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The simple meaning of the aforesaid provision is that no person shall be employed or engaged on board a ship, unless the seamen be issued with a ‘Continuous discharge certificate’ (CDC) book or other similar document by the Government Shipping Master for recording details of his service. The sub section (2) of the said section further provides that if any person engages any sea man in any vessel without the seaman having in possession of identity document, he shall be liable to punishment.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The provision of section 131 of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1983 deals with the issue of entries to be made in ‘continuous discharge certificate’ when the seaman is discharged from the job. The provision of the said section runs as follows;</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1983</em></strong><br/><strong><em>         Section 131.Entries to be made in Continuous Discharge Certificate and return of Certificates of Competency to officers on discharge.-</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify"><em>If a seaman is discharged from a ship in Bangladesh, either on his discharge or on payment of his wages, the master shall enter in the Continuous Discharge Certificate of the seaman, under his signature particulars specifying the period of the seaman’s service and the date and place of this discharge.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>The master shall, upon the discharge of every Certificated Officer whose Certificate of Competency has been delivered to and retained by him, return the certificate to the officer.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>If a master acts in contravention of sub section (1), or fails, without reasonable cause, to return the Certificate of Competency to the officer concerned as required by sub-section (2), he shall, for each offence, be punishable with fine which may, in the former case, extend to one thousand taka and in the latter to five hundred Taka. </em></li></ol><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The aforesaid provision mandates that the discharge of the seaman from the service has to be endorsed in the Continuous Discharge Certificate book by the ‘Master of the vessel’ in order to make the discharge from the job a lawful one.</li><li style="text-align:justify">From the aforesaid provisions its appears that every Bangladesh seaman is liable to hold a ‘continuous discharge certificate’ (CDC) book issued by the Government shipping master in the prescribed format, wherein their engagement in any employment in any vessel and his discharge from such vessel must be endorsed by the Master of the vessel. The authority known as ‘Shipping Master’ is engaged by the government under the provision of section 8 of the Bangladesh merchant shipping ordinance 1983.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the instant case it appears that only the plaintiff No. 1 has been able to prove that his employment has been properly endorsed in the CDC book and although the plaintiff No. 2 proved his endorsement as to the date of joining in the service as has been properly endorsed, but his quitting the employment has not been properly endorsed in his CDC book, meaning thereby that the plaintiff No. 2 failed to prove his date of singing off from the employment.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the case of other plaintiffs the original ‘Sea Farers identity documents’ did not contain the endorsement as required by law, rather the plaintiff No. 1 unlawfully incorporate the same in the photocopy, in order to enable them to claim so called salary and wages for certain fictitious period in the instant suit.</li><li style="text-align:justify">These admitted unscrupulous acts have been attempted to be justified by the learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Abdul Khaleque that the vessel being in distressed condition and the situation was a urgent one, the employer Sigma Shipping Lines Limited hurriedly employed and placed the plaintiff on board the vessel, without having endorsed the employment in the CDC book or in the Sea Farers Identity documents, which is nothing but a lacuna not tentamounts to forgery and accordingly the same may be taken through lenient view.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In order to consider this submission we have meticulously examined the entire record of this suit wherefrom it appears that the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL was aground and the same was ultimately sold by this court at the instance of the plaintiffs in the said aground condition. It has been asserted that the Indian origin Master and the crew members of the said vessel left the vessel in distressed condition, whereupon in order to save the vessel, the owners were required to immediately manned the vessel by any means. This factual situation of the defendant No. 1 vessel has been established by different documents available in the record, especially from the report of the Marshal, who sold the vessel under the order of this court, in it’s aground position. Therefore this court finds that the defendant No. 4 actually hurriedly employed the plaintiffs in the defendant No. 1, vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL and the plaintiffs practically boarded the vessel in an urgent situation when the vessel was in distressed condition.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In this respect the content of the exhibit No. 18, may be taken into consideration, which reveals that the plaintiff could prove the distressed condition of the vessel at the relevant period, since the captain of the vessel, the plaintiff No. 1, sent the e-mail, exhibit No. 18, to one Mr. Biswash/Mr. Atul Jain wherein he has stated the following state of the vessel;</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">From: md miah <a href="mailto:capthai_1971@yahoo.com">capthai_1971@yahoo.com</a><br/>Date: Wed, 29 Feb 2012 19:13:53-0800(PST)<br/>To: &lt;biswas @marineindia.net&gt;<br/>Cc: &lt;attaritd @gmail.com&gt;<br/>Subject: 010312 payment of master and crew salary.<br/>Ka: Mr. biswas/Mr. Atul Jain.<br/>Fm: Master mv.

Ocean pearl on 2/11/10 during distress conditions of the vessel (vessel was made to aground before my joining to avoid total loss). Former staff in normal conditions from 14/09/10 to 8/10/10 discharged only 3473.45 mtns of cargo including hiring floating crane where spent about usd 100000/= for floating crane. Present master after joining, he managed to discharge 1906 mtns of cargo whose price is about usd 600000/= in distress conditions with great risk of mine and my crew. This is due to my courageous activities, we arranged to discharge without using any floating crane in distress conditions. We managed to save owner usd 600000/- from discharge of 1906 mtns of cargo where nobody should have any doubt. June, 2011 vessel was broken into two pieces due to uneven stress for which we could not discharge any more cargo. </em><br/><em>At present vessel has becom</em>e <em>wreck. It is very easy to take this wreck by port because as per maritime law it is in favour of port. Port can take verdict from Admiralty court after only one day work of admiralty court as maritime law is in favour of port. In this situations you may loss your ownership. Port wanted to take the vessel. This is me who used personal influence over port for which port did not take this valuable wreck. I have good personal influence over port for which port did not</em> <em>take the wreck. I hope so long I am here port will not take this wreck where you will not loss your ownership. So you cannot deny that due to my activities you have saved used 600000/= in addition to valuable wreck from where still you can get good money from the sell of wreck. I am working for the interest of owner and  owner should look after me and my crew where owner should pay our salary. My 17 months running where I received only usd 30441/= which is very less in compare with my balance wages. You have committed for several times to pay our full salary after receiving Hull and machinery insurance is finalized. </em><br/><em>Now I request your good self to pay our salary before 15.03.2012 . I may not with your vessel after 15/03/12 may not stay with your vessel after 15.03.12. I may take all salaries from port after handing over my command along with wreck to harbor master of the port where you may loss your ownership for which you may have no right to claim nay money from the port for the wreck. Pls note I am at sea for last 37 years including 25 years command with the owner I never betrayed with any of my owners and hope in future  also shall never betray with my owner if owner look after our interest.</em><br/><em>Vdrgrds/master mv. Ocean pearl.</em></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">From the aforementioned very circumstances of the defendant No. 1 vessel, M.V. OCEAN PEARL, this court is inclined to believe that the plaintiff’s employment were made hurriedly in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL by the defendant No. 4 upon which the plaintiffs boarded the vessel from their respective dates of their employment and as such it may be taken that the plaintiffs could prove their employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel to have been commenced from the date as mentioned in their employment contract being exhibit Nos. 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 17.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Now the question comes as to how this court should ascertain the tenure of service of the plaintiffs in the distressed defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL, when their joining the duty on board the vessel was proved?</li><li style="text-align:justify">In order to meet the ends of justice this court has to ascertain such date by any lawful means and accordingly has to travel through the other exhibits as has been made by the plaintiff Nos. 2-8 to find actual date of signing off of these plaintiffs.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff No. 1, by the documentary evidence, y proved that he has signed off from the job on 30.09.2012 as was endorsed by the Shipping Master in his CDC book on 30.9.2013. Therefore, the tenure of employment of the plaintiff No. 1 in the defendant No. 1 vessel as a Master of the vessel has been proved as from the date of 2.11.2010 up to 30.9.2012. All the plaintiff in corroborative manner proved the fact that the plaintiff No. 1 is now suffering from paralysis and as such completing bed ridden, for which the plaintiff No. 1 could not depose before this court, although he held a Power of Attorney on behalf of the other plaintiffs. Later, all the plaintiffs including the plaintiff No. 1 executed a Power of Attorney in favour of the plaintiff No. 2 S.K. Rafiqul Alam to depose in the instant suit. Accordingly the plaintiff No. 2 gave evidence in the instant suit, not only on his behalf, but also on behalf of other plaintiff’s, including the plaintiff No. 1, the testimony of which has been further corroborated by other plaintiffs, who also deposed as Pw’s.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It appears that the plaintiff No. 1 being the Master of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL was liable under the provision of section 141 of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1983 to deliver an account of the wages and salary of the crew members and upon collecting the same from the owners of the vessel to disburse the same among the seamen’s under him. In such order to collect the seamen’s wages and salary, the provision of section 141 of the merchant shipping ordinance 1983 requires the Master of the defendant No. 1 vessel to prepare a role i.e. portage bill of the seaman under him and one copy of the said role is to be submitted <em>inter alia</em>, to the shipping office at Chittagong, since the vessel was at Chittagong. Although the P.W. 1, submitted 17 copies of such portage Bill, starting from the month of November 2010, up to February 2012, which were marked as Exhibit No. 24 (series), but nowhere of these copies contain any mark that the copy of the same were also submitted to the shipping office, Chittagong.</li><li style="text-align:justify">However, from the content of exhibit No. 24 (series) seventeen pages, it appears that the Master of the vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL, the plaintiff No. 1 captain Md. Abdul Hayee Mia prepared and submitted the seaman’s role and portage bill to the owner of the vessel through the defendant No. 4, from the month of November, 2010, wherefrom the exhibit No. 24(1), which is the seaman’s role for the month of November 2010, shows that there was as many as 16 (sixteen) Seaman working on board the defendant No. 1, vessel out of which 5 (five) Seaman were shown as signed off on different dates including the plaintiff No. 5 Shah Makhlisur Rahman, who has been mentioned as signed off on an from 20.11.2010. Similarly the plaintiff No. 6 Mohsin Mollah was shown as has been signed off on 20.11.2010. The sea man’s role and portage bill for the total month of June, 2011, made in two part, Exhibit No. 24(7) and 24(8) show that all the 10 Seaman of the vessel signed off on 14.06.2011, which also erroneously included, the name of earlier signed off Seaman the plaintiff No. 5, Shah Makhlesur Rahman and plaintiff No. 6 Mohsin Mollah as signing off from 14.06.2011. This exhibit No. 24(1), 24(7) and 24(8) appear to be issued in regular manner and therefore reliance may be imposed upon it for the purpose of ascertaining the correct date of signing off the plaintiff Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Therefore, it appears that this plaintiff Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 served the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL till they signed off on the respective dates, as mentioned in the said portage bills, being exhibit No. 24(1) and 24(7) and 24(8) and during that period these plaintiffs were not paid the following amount shown against their name therein up to point of time, in respect of the due salary and wages which are shown in the following table.</li></ol><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td style="width:109px"><strong>plaintiff name</strong></td><td style="width:84px"><strong>sign off date</strong></td><td style="width:89px"><strong>Due upto sign US$</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="width:109px">Sk.

A. No.249 of 2005 dismissing the appeal and affirming the judgment and decree dated 28.08.2005 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, Second Court, Chittagong in Other Suit No.104 of 2002 decreeing the suit. </div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The facts, leading to the filing of this appeal, are précised below:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         Respondent No.1 as the plaintiff instituted Other Suit No.104 of 2002 in the Second Court of Joint District Judge, Chittagong, seeking specific performance of contract and also for declaration of title. The plaintiff stated in his plaint that the suit land was owned and possessed by defendant No.1 by way of deeds of sale dated 30.06.1992, 31.03.1999 and 10.01.1983. Defendant No.1 being in need of money declared his intention to sell the land in first and second schedules. The plaintiff agreed to purchase the land of the first schedule for a consideration of Tk.8,80,000 and the land of the second schedule for a consideration of Tk.9,50,000/-, a total of Tk.18,30,000/-. Accordingly, defendant No.1, upon receipt of Tk.12,00,000/-, by way of cheque dated 14/02/1999 executed a deed of agreement (bainapatra) for the undisputed land of the first schedule as well as the disputed land of second schedule and handed over possession of the same to the plaintiff. According to the condition of the deed of agreement, the plaintiff was to pay Tk.4,00,000/- within 3(three) months from the deed of agreement and the remaining amount of Tk.2,30,000/- within 3(three) months in respect of the second schedule land. In addition, defendant No.1 would construct a boundary wall around the second schedule land at his own cost. On 10.03.1999, defendant No.1 registered a deed in respect of first schedule land showing consideration amount of Tk.6,00,000/-. On 10.04.1999, Tk.50,000/- was paid for the purpose of constructing the boundary wall but after a while the construction work was stopped. On 19.05.1999, defendant No.1 received further payment of Tk.1,00,000/- by way of cheque. Thus defendant No.1 received total amount of Tk.13,00,000/- and was legally bound to register the deed for the second schedule land upon payment of Tk.5,30,000/-. However, subsequently, defendant No.1 demanded further amount of Tk.2,00,000/-, as a result of which, a legal notice dated 10.12.2000 was sent to defendant No.1. But he declined to receive the same. When the Attorney (<strong>Bj­j¡J²¡l</strong>) of the plaintiff went to the house of defendant No.1 on 01.06.2002 and asked him to register the deed upon accepting the remaining money, defendant No.1 demanded further amount of Tk.2,00,000/-. Finally, on 09.06.2002 when defendant No.1 refused to execute the deed, the plaintiff instituted the instant suit for specific performance of contract.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing written statement denying all the materials statements made in the plaint. His case, in short, is that that the deed would be executed and registered upon payment of Tk.4,00,000 within 3(three) months of the deed of agreement and Tk.2,30,000 within further 3(three) months, failing which, defendant No.1 could sell the land elsewhere and the money paid would be forfeited. His further case is that since the plaintiff did not pay any money for the construction of the boundary wall, he himself partly constructed the same at his own expense. The plaintiff did not pay Tk.4,00,000/- within the stipulated period and instead paid Tk.1,00,000/- on 18.05.1999. Although the defendant repeatedly requested the plaintiff to pay the remaining money and to have the deed registered, the plaintiff did not pay the rest of the money. As the plaintiff was causing delay, defendant No.1 by way of legal notice to the plaintiff dated 01.06.2002 and also by way of publication of the notice in the daily newspaper on 13.06.2002 rescinded the deed of agreement. Defendant No.1 claimed that the plaintiff was in breach of condition of the deed of agreement and he denied the allegations made in the plaint including the plaintiff’s claim that he had offered the remaining money to defendant No.1.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The trial Court, upon consideration of the materials on record and the evidence of witnesses adduced by both the sides, by the judgment and order dated 28.08.2005 decreed the suit. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and decree dated 28.08.2005 passed by the trial Court, defendant No.1 preferred First Appeal No.249 of 2005 before the High Court Division. The learned Judges of the High Court Division by the judgment and order dated 17.05.2009 dismissed the appeal affirming the judgment and decreed passed by the trial Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, defendant No.1 as the leave-petitioner filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1832 of 2009 before this Division, in which, leave was granted on 20.09.2011 resulting in Civil Appeal No.12 of 2012.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Abdul Momen Chowdhury, learned Advocate, appearing on behalf of the appellant, submits that the plaintiff did not pay the balance of the agreed consideration money for the land of the 2<sup>nd</sup> schedule within the time stipulated in the deed of agreement and that the defendants sent a legal notice dated 11.06.2002 repudiating the contract and by publication of the notice in the daily newspaper on 13.06.2002 and that time being essence of the contract and the plaintiff not having fulfilled his part of the contract within the time stipulated, the contract became voidable, Accordingly, defendant No.1 rescinded the contract by sending legal notice to the plaintiff and also by publishing the same in the daily newspaper and that the High Court Division without considering those aspects dismissed the appeal and as such, interference is called for by this Division.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Probir Neogi, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the respondents, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocate for the appellant and the learned Senior Advocate for the respondents, perused the impugned judgment and the materials on record.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Before entering into the merit of the appeal, it is pertinent to go through the grounds, for which, leave was granted. The grounds are quoted below:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“I.</strong>  Whether the trial Court failed to frame proper issues including the issue as to whether the contract subsisted or was terminated and whether such failure of the trial Court is violative of Order XIV Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/><strong>II.</strong>  Whether the trial Court and the High Court Division failed to notice that time was of the essence of the contract and that the plaintiff-respondent had failed to comply with the contractual stipulation within the given time, rendering the contract terminable and that by giving notice, the defendant-petitioner rescinded the contract; and<br/><strong>III.</strong> Whether after the rescission of the contract, a suit for Specific Performance of Contract lies since the contract itself was terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions of the deed of agreement (bainapatra).”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly, the plaintiff entered into a contract with defendant No.1 to purchase the land of first schedule for a consideration of Tk.8,80,000/- and the land of second schedule for a consideration of Tk.9,50,000/-, in total, Tk.18,30,000/-. On receipt of Tk.1,20,000/- by way of cheque dated 14.02.1999, defendant No.1 executed a deed of agreement for undisputed land of first schedule as well as the disputed second schedule land. As per terms of the deed of agreement, the plaintiff was required to pay Tk.400,000/- within 3 (three) months of the date of the agreement and the remaining Tk.2,30,000/- within the next following 3 (three) months in respect of the second schedule land. It was also stipulated that defendant No.1 would construct a boundary wall around the second schedule land at his own cost.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On 10.03.1999, defendant No.1 registered a deed in respect of first schedule land showing the consideration of Tk.600,000/-. The plaintiff contended that on 10.04.1999 Tk.50,000/- was paid to defendant No.1 for the purpose of constructing the boundary wall. On 19.05.1999, defendant No.1 received a further payment of Tk.100,000/- by way of cheque. Therefore, it appears that defendant No.1 received Tk.1300,000/- and was legally bound to register the deed for the second schedule land upon payment of Tk.5,30,000/-. It is alleged that on 09.06.2002 when defendant No.1 refused to execute the deed, the plaintiff instructed his attorney to file the instant suit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is of course true that the plaintiff did not pay the balance consideration of Tk. 400,000/- within the time stipulated in the deed of agreement. But it is admitted by both the parties that defendant No.1 received a cheque of Tk.100,000/- from the plaintiff on 19.05.1999. D.W.1 in his cross-examination admitted that he received a cheque dated 18.05.1999 for an amount of Tk.100,000/- from the plaintiff. Defendant No.1 also admitted that on the date of receiving of Tk.100,000/-, the contract was in existence. There is no gainsaying the fact that defendant No.1 received Tk.100,000/- from the plaintiff beyond the stipulated three months’ time fixed for payment of Tk.400,000/-. Therefore, it could not be said that the terms of the agreement were seriously breached otherwise there could not be any ground on the part of defendant No.1 to receive Tk.100,000/-.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Defendant No.1 sent a legal notice upon the plaintiff by registered post. Having considered the envelop of the registered notice (exhibit-Ka), the trial Court found that the serving peon in his report stated that the letter could not be served because of incomplete address. Therefore, it appears that in fact, no legal notice was served upon the plaintiff. Defendant No.1 knowing full well about staying of the plaintiff in the USA issued the notice at his address at Sandnip. Though the legal notice was not served upon the plaintiff, defendant No.1 by publishing notification in the ‘Daily Purbakon’ on 13.06.2002 repudiated the deed of agreement and forfeited the money paid on account of the agreement. Therefore, it appears that within 2(two) days of issuance of legal notice upon the plaintiff, defendant No.1 repudiated the deed of agreement by publishing a notification in the newspaper.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Having considered the evidence of P.W.1, the trial Court came to a finding that the plaintiff approached defendant No.1 on many occasions to execute and register the deed of sale in respect of the second schedule land on receipt of the balance consideration money. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Considering the evidence-on-record, the trial Court found that the plaintiff had been in possession of both the undisputed first schedule land and the disputed second schedule land.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mere fixation of the period in the contract even when coupled with a power to treat the contract as cancelled in the event of default in performance of contract within the stipulated time is not sufficient to make the time fixed of the essence of contract. Something more is necessary to have this effect and where the determination of this question depends only on the language of the stipulations as in the present case, the language must be such as would un-mistakenly excluded the notion that the time limit is merely a secondary importance. The language of the agreement before us does not exclude such notion nor is there anything in the conduct of parties prior to the agreement which would induce us to infer the said intention.            </li><li style="text-align: justify;">In this connection reliance may be placed on the case of <em>Hajee Saru Meah Sowdagar and another vs. Musammat Al-Haj Jahanara Begum and others,(1956)8 DLR 616</em>. In this case, it has been held as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“........the tenancy of the Courts in cases of such contracts relating to real property is to lean against a construction which would make time of the essence of the contract unless it can be held to be the unmistakenable intention of the parties. As an extreme instance of such a tendency, we might refer to a recent decision of the Calcutta High Court in the case of <strong><em>Kalidas Ghosh vs. Mungeeram Bangur and Co, AIR 1955 Cal.298 where R.P. Mookerjee and Renupada Mukherjee,JJ.,</em></strong> went to the extent of holding that even the mentioning of the fact that time should be deemed to be of the essence of the contract is not conclusive if it can be inferred even from the subsequent conduct of the parties that that was not the real intention of the parties.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Reliance may also be placed on the case of <em>Amir Hossain Sowdagar vs. Md. Harunur Rashid and others (2013)65 DLR (AD)130,</em> in which, it has been held as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“In contracts for sale of immovable property, the fact that a specific time is fixed for payment or for conveyance does not normally make time of the essence. Failure to pay at a fixed time is not per se sufficient to terminate the seller’s duty to convey; and failure to convey on the exact date does not per se discharge the buyer. In such agreements, usually time is not the essence of contract, the reason being that the law of equity which governs rights of the parties in cases of specific performance of contracts of sale of immovable property, looks not at the letter but at the substance of the agreement. The intention to treat time as the essence of the contract may be evidenced by circumstances which are sufficiently strong to displace the normal presumption that in a contract for sale of real estate, stipulation as to time is not the essence of the contract.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">On consideration the cases referred to above, we find that the agreement between the parties is still subsisting despite its rescission by the defendant and the defendant was in error in treating the agreement rescinded.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">What is remarkable to note here is that the High Court Division directed the appellant to execute and register the deed of sale in respect of the land of second schedule on receipt of Tk.10,70,000/- of which Tk.500000/- is the solatium.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The facts and circumstances and the evidence on record of the case are such that the plaintiff is willing and ready to perform his part of contract and therefore, he is legally entitled to a decree for specific performance of contract. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the light of the findings made before we do not find any substance in this appeal. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div></div></div>

Farid Ahmed Shibli, J:</u></strong><br/>         On an application filed under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, this Rule has been issued calling upon the Opposite-Party to show cause as to why the proceedings of Sessions Case No. 765 of 2014 under section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 (shortly “ the Act”) arising out of C.R Case 104 of 2014 now pending in the Court of Additional Session Judge of the 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Gazipur should not be quashed and/or pass such other order or orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The facts relevant for disposal of this case run as follows:- Some Md. Salim Reza figuring himself as a complainant filed the petition of complaint against one Md. Golam Faruque (i.e. the accused-petitioner) under section 138 of the Act alleging inter alia that the accused-petitioner after receiving Taka 48 lacs as loan from him (Md. Salim Reza i.e. the complainant-Opposite Party) drew a cheque bearing no. <sup>CAF</sup>/<sub>M</sub> 2143184 on 05.03.2014 for that amount against his account maintained with Uttara Bank Limited, Gulshan Branch, Dhaka and on 11.03.2014 it was presented to the BRAC Bank of Motijheel Branch, Dhaka for encashment. On 12.03.2014 the concerned bank authority returned the cheque unpaid showing the reason of insufficient fund. The complainant-opposite party issued a legal notice on 24.03.2014 upon the accused-petitioner demanding the cheque-money, but the latter failed to make any payment owing to which the petition of complainant was filed within the statutory period before the Court of learned Senior Judicial Magistrate, Gazipur, who after complying with all legal requirements took cognizance of the offence under section 138 of the Act against the accused-petitioner.</li></ol><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Learned Session Judge of Gazipur after receiving the record transferred the same to the Court of learned Additional Session Judge of the 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Gazipur, who framed charge against the accused-petitioner under section 138 of the Act refusing the prayer filed for discharging the accused-petitioner under section 265C of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (shortly “the Code”).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the proceedings of Sessions Case no. 765 of 2014 arising out of C.R. case 140 of 2014 and framing of the charge under section 138 of the Act, the accused-petitioner has filed the instant application under section 561A of the Code and obtained a Rule in terms as stated hereinbefore.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Learned Advocate Mr. Moinuddin for the accused-petitioner and learned Advocate Mr. Muntasir Uddin Ahmed appearing with learned Advocate Mr. Ajit Sil for the complainant-opposite party have participated in the hearing of the Case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On the threshold amplifying entire gamut facts and different aspects of the disputes as cropped-up between the parties, learned Advocate for the accused-petitioner Mr. Moinuddin makes the submission focusing mainly the following 3 (three) points:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>firstly</em>- the complainant-opposite party has made Md. Golam Faruque an accused on his personal capacity without making the company or its Managing Director a party thereto; <em>secondly</em>- complainant-opposite party’s failure to file the original cheque in question has made the complaint disqualified to be accepted by the Court and <em>thirdly</em>- non-mentioning of the manner of service or the date of receipt of legal notice as envisaged in section 138(1A) of the Act has made the entire proceedings liable to be quashed.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In response to the <em>first-point</em> Mr. Muntasir Uddin Ahmed, learned Advocate for the complainant-opposite Party has referred to an unreported decision of the Appellate Division given in Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal no. 485 of 2010 and contended that the person issued the cheque whether on his own behalf or on behalf of a company of which he is the Managing Director or otherwise responsible cannot escape his alleged criminal liability, which is nothing but a matter of fact to be decided upon the trial and that cannot be the basis for quashing the proceedings in its entirety under the Act. In response to the above contention, Mr. Moinuddin has failed to give any satisfactory reply and that is why this point so far as raised by him does not deserve any consideration.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In reply to the <em>second-point</em> Mr. Ahmed has drawn our attention to order 07 dated 12.11.2014 passed in Sessions Case no. 765 of 2014, which clearly unfolds the fact that on the date of charge hearing the complainant-opposite party produced the original copy of the cheque and that was seen by the learned Additional Judge himself. Mr. Ahmed submits that the allegation made by the accused-petitioner on this point was nothing but an abortive attempt to frustrate a genuine claim of the complainant. In the sequel of the facts, as pointed out, it becomes difficult for Mr. Moinuddin to controvert or say anything more in that score. We, therefore, do not find any substance or truth in the allegation of non-filing the original cheque in the Court below.</li></ol><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In support of the <em>third-point</em> Mr. Moinuddin contends that the manner of service of the legal notice demanding the cheque money has not been mentioned specifically in the complaint and due to non-mentioning of that fact no Court can take cognizance of the offence on the basis of such a complaint. He further contends that non-disclosure of exact date of service of the notice in the complaint has also made the entire proceeding initiated on that complaint liable to be quashed in its entirety. In this context Mr. Moinuddin relies upon the decision in the case of Nizam Uddin Mahmood-Vs-Abdul Hamid reported in 9BLC(AD)2004 177, where their Lordships observed the following:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">   “In the instant case, in view of the non-disclosure of the date as to receipt of notice by the accused and failure to mention any legal cause of action in the petition of complaint, the proceeding cannot be allowed to continue and as such it is liable to be quashed”.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In reply, making reference to the latest decision on the said case reported in 60DLR(AD)(2008) 195, Mr. Muntasir Uddin Ahmed informs us that the earlier decision of Nizam Uddin Mahmood-Vs- Abdul Hamid, 9BLC(AD)2004 177, as cited by Mr. Moinuddin, has subsequently been reviewed and overruled by their Lordships in the Appellate Division in Criminal Appeal No. 04 of 2007 and that has been decided in following terms:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">   “Since the date of receipt is a question of fact to be ascertained at the time of the trial, non-disclosure of such fact in the complaint petition cannot render the proceeding liable to be quashed to the great prejudice of the complainant, who is entitled to prove his case on evidence.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Due to the subsequent decision given on a Review Petition by the apex Court, the learned Advocate for the accused-petitioner has vitually lost all force of his contention, which is based on the decision of 9 BLC (AD)(2004)177. On the other hand referring to another case of Iddris Sheikh (Md.)-Vs- State, 13BLC 423 the learned Advocate for the complainant-opposite party Mr. Ahmed asserts his view that on a plea of non-mentioning the date of receipt or the manner of service of the legal notice, the normal course of justice should not be intervened in any way, because those are nothing but some questions of facts to be determined in trial. Obviously we find a strong bearing and legal force in the view above as expressed by Mr. Ahmed.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is stated that on 24.03.2014 the legal notice was given (<em>cÖ`vb</em>) to the accused, but on which date that notice was received by the accused that has not been exactly mentioned in the complaint. In most of the cases, it becomes impossible to know the exact date of receipt of the notice and generally the fact of receipt of the notice is denied by the accused on one side and asserted by the complainant on other side and that is why such questions of facts can be neither resolved not decided before concluding the trial. <em>All particulars relating to the date of</em> <em>receipt or the manner of service of the legal notice including other relevant parenthetical information are bundle of facts and any discourse on those facts or their unerring decision requires in-depth scrutiny and threshing of the evidence to be produced in trial. So, mere non-disclosure of those facts in the petition of complaint cannot be a valid cause to make the entire proceedings liable to be quashed, which in true sense will deprive the complainant to prove his case on evidence.</em></li></ol><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">At the fag-end of the hearing Mr. Moinuddin has alleged inter alia that the cheque in question was not at all signed by the accused-petitioner and it was fraudulently created by the complainant hatching a conspiracy with an ulterior motive. He appraises this Court that the accused-petitioner stating those allegations filed a Criminal Petition Case (having no. 372/2014) on 31.03.2014 under section 98 of the Code against the complainant-opposite party, who subsequently filed this complaint under section 138 of the Act abusing the process of law narrating some concocted facts and for those reasons the instant criminal miscellaneous case is liable to be quashed under section 561A of the Code.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In reply Mr. Ahmed retorts amplifying chronological saga of the events including institution of several criminal litigations between the parties. He has clarified the facts that the legal notice under section 138 of the Act had been sent on 24.03.2014 to the accused-petitioner, who after receiving the said notice on 31.03.2014 filed the Petition Case under section 98 of the Code and also filed a complaint before the Anticorruption Commission, Dhaka under section 406/419/467/468/471/511 of the Panel Code against the complainant-opposite party narrating some got-up cases just to avoid his responsibility of paying the cheque money.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is noted that both the parties are fighting against each other making allegations and counter-allegations, which are pure factual disputes to be looked into by the Court of Session during the trial. In as much as both the parties would get sufficient opportunity to prove their allegations and claims in the trial court and as this Court has no legal scope to examine or verify them at this trice, so any decision of quashing the proceeding as prayed for would frustrate the complainant’s right to establish his claim and prove the allegations against the accused. Ergo, it seems expedient for us to refrain from giving any decision on the allegations and facts stated hereinbefore.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Having regard to what we have discussed above and attending facts and circumstances to the case, we are, therefore, inclined to hold that no satisfactory ground or legal substance is found in this case to quash the proceedings in question presently pending in the Court of learned Additional Session Judge of the 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Gazipur. Accordingly, the application under section 561A of the Code is decided in negative. Consequently, the Rule is discharged and the order of stay granted earlier by this Court stands vacated.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Communicate this judgment to all concerned.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed. </strong></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><hr/><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><strong>Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. </strong></a><strong>42518 of 2014</strong></div></div></div></div>

At the instance of the petitioner, an order of injunction restraining the respondents from dispossessing the petitioner from his homestead was passed for a period of 2(two) months subject to payment of Taka 2 lacs within 10 (ten) days with a default order that if the petitioner fails to pay the money within the said period, the Rule would stand discharged. Pursuant to the order, the petitioner had deposited the sum through a pay order and filed an affidavit-in-compliance. This Court having received the affidavit-in-compliance extended the order of stay for a further period of 6(six) months from date i.e. 14.02.2016.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The short facts, as disclosed in the averments of the writ petition, are that the petitioner being Proprietor of M/S Welcome International availed of certain credit facilities from the Bank Asia Limited, Dania Branch, Shyampur, Dhaka for the purpose of business. At one stage, when the petitioner became defaulter in repayment of the loan in terms of sanction letter, the creditor Bank wrote a letter on 05.02.2015 requesting the petitioner to repay the loan. Having received the letter, the petitioner rushed to the respondents Bank on 24.05.2015 and promised to pay the dues as early as possible. Apart from verbal assurance, the petitioner also sent a letter to the Managing Director, Bank Asia limited (respondent no. 3) requesting to exempt the interest accrued on the principal amount on the plea of loss of business caused due to unrest political situation of the country. It is also stated that while the discussion was going on between the petitioner and the creditor Bank, he became surprised to see a tender notice published in daily Sakaler Khabar dated 06.7.2015 for sale of the mortgaged property for recovery of the outstanding amount of Taka 12,20,733.74 invited by the respondent Bank. Pursuant to the tender invitation, the property was sold on 30.07.2015 to the respondent no. 7, Md. Rafiqul Islam at a consideration of Taka 21,96,000/-. The deed of sale was executed on 22.09.2015 in favour of the auction purchaser (respondent no. 7) by the Bank. At that stage, the petitioner moved in this Court, obtained the Rule and the order of stay with injunction as stated above.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Rule is contested by the respondent no. 4-creditor Bank through Mr. Abdul Matin Khasru, learned advocate who filed an exhaustive application for vacating the order of injunction. The case of the respondent-Bank, as disclosed in the said application is that the Bank before publication of the tender notice for auction sale of the mortgaged property had on several occasions requested the petitioner to regularize the installments in terms of sanction letter and when the petitioner failed to adjust the liability, the mortgaged property was sold through auction under the provisions of section 12 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (“the Ain”). Prior to sell of the mortgaged property, the respondent no. 4 Bank rescheduled the classified loan of the petitioner on 30.06.2014 as per BRPD (Banking Regulations and Policy Department) Circular No. 15 dated 23.09.2012 and allowed him to repay the liability by 12 (twelve) equal monthly installments, but the petitioner did not deposit any amount in order to adjust the liabilities. On prayer of the petitioner, the respondent-Bank gave adequate opportunities to him to repay the loan money but in vain. The respondent Bank tried its best to accommodate the petitioner so that he could pay the loan money but he failed every time to keep his commitment. At one stage, the petitioner wrote a letter to the Bank on 30.07.2015 to give the property to respondent no. 7 through an auction (Annexure-2). In the auction process, the respondent no. 7, Rafiqul Islam also became the highest bidder and purchased the mortgaged property through a valid auction. Thereafter a registered sale deed dated 22.09.2015 was executed and registered in favour of the respondent no. 7 by the respondent-Bank.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Syed Mamun Mahbub, learned advocate appearing for the petitioner, submit that due to political turmoil over the country, the petitioner could not run his business properly and became defaulter without any fault of his own. The learned advocate submits further that the mortgaged property was the homestead of the petitioner and therefore selling of the same through auction tantamount to infringement of right to property as enunciated in the Constitution of Bangladesh.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Abdul Matin Matin Khasru, learned advocate appearing for the respondent-Bank submits that when the petitioner failed to make payment of the loan in spite of giving adequate opportunities to regularize the loan, the Bank sold the mortgaged property through auction under section 12 of the Ain and as such no illegality has been committed in selling the mortgaged property. The learned advocate submits further that the respondent-Bank realized the outstanding amount by selling in the mortgaged property to the respondent no. 7 and a registered deed of sale pursuant to the auction process was made and therefore there is no scope to set aside the sale as the right of a third party has already accrued. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have heard the submissions of the learned advocates of both the sides and perused the materials on record.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The admitted position is that the petitioner defaulted in payment of loan in spite of providing adequate opportunity to him to repay the same and therefore the Bank in order to realize its outstanding loan was compelled to publish auction notice for sale of the mortgaged property under the provision of section 12 of the Ain. It is also not disputed that the mortgaged property was sold to the respondent no. 7 in a competitive auction. Pursuant to sale of the mortgaged property, a deed of sale was also executed and registered in favour of the respondent no. 7 and thus the right, title and interest of the sold property accrued on the purchaser.  <strong><u>From a simple reading of sub-section (3) of section 12 of the Ain, it appears that the Artha Rin Suit cannot be filed by a creditor Bank or financial institution without taking step for selling of the mortgaged property. In case of sale of the mortgaged property through auction under section 12 of the Ain, the sale would be a valid sale in the eye of law and thus the question of right of redemption of the property will not arise.</u></strong> In other words, after sale of the mortgaged property through a lawful auction there shall be no scope of redemption of the property by the mortgagor. Therefore, by depositing a part of the defaulted amount, the petitioner cannot claim to buy back the sold property inasmuch as the right, title and interest of the third party in the meantime has been established over the property. In the instant case, no allegation of fraud or material irregularity in publishing or conducting the auction sale has been raised by the petitioner and therefore after sale of the mortgaged property finally at the instance of the creditor Bank through a lawful auction there would be no scope to allow the petitioner to deposit the part amount in order to set aside the sale. However, the petitioner may proceed against the mortgagee Bank for any compensation if it is proved that there was illegality in the auction process. The petitioner can take back the rest of the amount after satisfaction of the mortgagee Bank procured through the auction sale.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of what have been stated above, we do not find any merit in the Rule<em>.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, the Rule is discharged. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Communicate a copy of this judgment.<br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><hr/><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><strong>Writ Petition No. </strong></a><strong>10297 of 2015</strong></div></div></div></div>

Not only that, the said suit has to be filed in accordance with the provisions under the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. Upon mere reading of the plaint as well as the deposition of the sole witness as examined by the plaintiff and the specific prayers made by the plaintiff in the plaint, it is crystal clear that this is a case for realization of loan amount against the defendant Nos. 1-6. In view of specific provisions, namely Section 5 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003, this Court does not have any jurisdiction to entertain this suit at all, though, very peculiarly, this suit has proceeded up to the stage of even delivery of judgment. This suit is not maintainable before this Admiralty Court and is liable to be dismissed. However, if the plaintiff desires, and if the law permits, it is at liberty to approach the appropriate forum for seeking redress as sought in the instant suit. . . .

For the plaintiff</em></strong><br/>Mr. Muhammad Mijanur Rahman, Advocate<br/><strong><em>… For the defendant No. 1-6.</em></strong><br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></div><br/><strong><u>Sheikh Hassan Arif, J: </u></strong><div style="text-align: justify;">The plaintiff, Premier Bank Ltd. Khatungonj Branch, Chittagong, has filed this Suit against F.V. Rainbow-1 (Reg. No. F-8021), a fishing vessel, the Master of the said vessel and the owners of the vessel with the following prayers:</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">a decree be passed for an amount of Tk. 8,91,71,046.76 against the defendants jointly and severely with interest @ 18% per annum till the date of realization of the said amount. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">a warrant of arrest be issued against the vessel F.V. Rainbow-1 (Reg. No. F-8021) and served on her master or any one in charge of the said vessel and to be taken and held in custody of the Marshal of the Admiralty Court, as security for payment of the decretal amount.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">cancelation of the sailing permission of fishing in the exclusive economic zone of Bangladesh be ordered.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">release of the defendant no.1 vessel F.V. Rainbow-1 (Reg. No. F-8021) from attachment/warrant and detention in the event of defendants furnishing sufficient and proper security to the satisfaction of this Hon’ble Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">in the event of defendants failing to pay the decretal amount of the plaintiff an order be passed condemning the said vessel F.V. Rainbow-1 (Reg. No. F-8021) to be sold by order of this Hon’ble Court and the proceed be applied towards the payment of the decretal amount. And</li><li style="text-align: justify;">for such other or further order or orders as your Lordships seem fit and proper. </li></ol><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The case of the plaintiff, in short, is that in the course of its banking business, it entered into a loan agreement with defendant No. 4, the owner of the said defendant No. 1-vessel-F.B Rainbow-1, vide sanction advice dated 13.07.2010 enabling the defendant No. 4 to purchase the defendant No. 1-vessel. The said credit facility was subsequently amended and rescheduled on various dates vide letters including, No. Premier/Ktg/Cr./579/2010 dated July13, 2010, Premier /Ktg/Cr./623/2010 dated July 26, 2010, Premier/ Ktg/Cr./2011/ 1429 dated August 14, 2011 and Premier/Ktg/ Cr./2012/173 dated March 11, 2012.  Accordingly, the said vessel was purchased by defendant No. 4 and it got sailing permission on 24.10.2011 from the proforma defendant No. 11, Director (Marine), Marine Fishing Department, Chittagong. Subsequently, on 28.06.2012, upon executing Form 9-B of the Mercantile Marine Department, the defendant No. 1-vessel was mortgaged in favour of the plaintiff as against the said loan, thereby, the owners of the defendant No. 1-vessel assigned all the owner’s title, right and interests in the said vessel in favour of the plaintiff as security for the loan amount and interests. That the total outstanding loan together with the interests stood at Tk. 8,91,71,046.76 as on 30.12.2012. That the plaintiff tried in every possible way to recover the said outstanding loan, but it did not get any positive response from the defendants. Thereafter, the plaintiff, on 17.12.2012, also approached the Mercantile Marine Department seeking permission to sell the said mortgaged vessel (defendant No. 1), whereupon the defendant No.10 (the Principal Officer, Mercantile Marine Department, Chittagong), vide letter dated 31.12.2012, asked the plaintiff to take initiatives before the Hon’ble High Court Division for sale of the said mortgaged vessel under Section 43(1) of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1983. In view of above, the plaintiff filed this suit before the Admiralty Bench of the High Court Division praying for a decree of Tk. 8,91,71,046.76 along with interests at the rate of 18% per annum till realization of the said amount providing break-down of the said claim under paragraph 7 of the plaint.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The suit is contested by defendant Nos. 1-6, the said vessel and the owners of the said vessel, by filing written statements. The case of the defendants, in short, is that the suit is not maintainable under Admiralty jurisdiction in its present form. The further case of the defendants is that they never refused to settle the outstanding loan of the plaintiff and that subsequent to the filing of the said suit, the dispute between the plaintiff and the defendants was settled on 13.10.2013 extending the tenure of payment of outstanding loan by the defendants up to 31.05.2016. It is further stated in the written statement that the said vessel is now fishing in the Bay of Bengal pursuant to an ad-interim order passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 7977 of 2011 filed by the defendants and the said writ petition is still pending.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Upon such contesting versions of the case, this Court, vide order dated 29.04.2014, framed following issues for adjudication:</li></ol><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Is the suit maintainable under the Admiralty Jurisdiction?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Does the plaintiff any cause of action against Defendant nos. 1-6?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Is the suit bad for mis-joinder and non-joinder of parties?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Is the Suit barred under the principles of estoppels, waive and acquiescence?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Has the plaintiff suffered any loss and damages?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Is the Plaintiff have any claim against Defendant nos. 1-6?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Is the plaintiff entitled to recover their claim from the defendants by selling the defendant no.1 vessel FV Rainbow-1 (Reg. No. F-8021)?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">What relief, if any, the plaintiff is entitled under the law and equity? If so, to what extent?</li></ol><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Since no initiative was taken by the parties to resolve the issue of maintainability of the suit at first in view of the provisions under Order-14, Rule-2 of the Court of Civil Procedure, the suit proceeded up to the stage of argument hearing and then delivery of judgment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">At the time of argument, learned Advocate for the defendants has vehemently argued the issue of maintainability of this suit before this Court mainly on the ground that in view of the provisions of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 making it mandatory for the financial institutions and banks to file cases for realization of loan before the Artha Rin Adalat constituted under the said Ain, the very suit filed by the plaintiff-bank before this Court mainly for realization of loan is not maintainable.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Issues No. 1:</u></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">As regards the maintainability of the instant suit, Mr. Moksedul Islam, learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff, submits that in view of the letter issued by the Marine Department (defendant No.10) to approach the High Court Division for realization of loan granted as against the mortgage of the said vessel, the plaintiff has filed the instant suit. When the attention of the learned advocate was drawn to the specific provisions of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (“the said Ain”), in particular the provisions under Sections 3, 4 and 5, learned Advocate has referred to the provisions under Section 12 of the said Ain. According to him, since in view of the provisions under Section 12 of the said Ain the plaintiff was not in a position to approach the Artha Rin Adalat for realization of loan without first selling the mortgaged property or hypothecated property, the plaintiff was not entitled to avail the jurisdiction of the  Artha Rin Adalat. According to him, since the defendant No. 1 is an Ocean going vessel and it has to be sold in accordance with the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1983, which provides for an appropriate proceeding in the High Court Division under Section 43, the plaintiff has rightly approached the Admiralty Bench of the High Court Division for realization of the loan amount upon selling the said mortgaged vessel. In this regard, learned Advocate refers to Exhibit-15, which is letter dated 31.12.2012, issued by the Mercantile Marine Department asking the plaintiff to take appropriate steps under Section 43 of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1983 and to file suit for a money decree before the Admiralty Bench of the High Court Division. Mr. Islam further argues that since in view of Section 12 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, the bank cannot sell the said vessel in auction without first taking the said vessel into possession, it did not take any steps to sell the said vessel under Section 12 of the said Ain.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It appears from the specific provisions of the said Ain, in particular Section 3, that the provisions of the said Ain have been given overriding effect over any other provisions of law under any other Act. Under Section 4 of the said Ain, some Courts, being Artha Rin Adalats, were established and, by virtue of Section 5, the exclusive jurisdiction has been given to the said Adalats for adjudication of cases to be filed by the financial institutions relating to realization of loan. Since, admittedly, the plaintiff bank is a bank established under the Bank Company Act, 1991 and by virtue of Clause (Ka) of Section 2 of the said Ain it is included in the definition of ‘financial institution’, the natural conclusion is that if it wants to realize any loan amount by filing any suit, it must go before the Artha Rin Adalat established under the said Ain. Not only that, the said suit has to be filed in accordance with the provisions under the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. Upon mere reading of the plaint as well as the deposition of the sole witness as examined by the plaintiff and the specific prayers made by the plaintiff in the plaint, it is crystal clear that this is a case for realization of loan amount against the defendant Nos. 1-6.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">This being so, this Admiralty Suit is nothing but a Money Suit filed by a financial institution and, therefore, in view of specific provisions, namely Section 5 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003, this Court does not have any jurisdiction to entertain this suit at all, though, very peculiarly, this suit has proceeded up to the stage of even delivery of judgment whereas the plaint of the suit should have been returned or rejected at the very initial stage upon appropriate applications by the defendants. Though this suit was not maintainable from the very first day, it was allowed to be continued to the stage of delivery of the judgment at the cost of the litigants and valuable time of the Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of above, this Court is of the view that the issue No. 1 should be determined against the plaintiff. This means, this Suit is not maintainable before this Admiralty Court and is liable to be dismissed. However, if the plaintiff desires, and if the law permits, it is at liberty to approach the appropriate forum for seeking redress as sought in the instant suit.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Issue Nos. 2-8:</u></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Though in respect of issue no.1 this Court has decided that the instant suit is not maintainable before this Court, it is obliged to state its findings or decision with the reasons there for on issue Nos.2-8 in view of the amended provisions of Order 20 Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the ratio in <strong>Md. Sultan Miah Vs. Sree Haradhan Shah and others, 40 DLR-236</strong> and <strong>Inspector, Railway Nirapatta Bahini Vs. Sohrab Ali, 43 DLR-79</strong>,though the decisions on the above issues will not change the ultimate result of the suit which is liable to be dismissed as being not maintainable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">To prove the case, the plaintiff examined one Md. Abdul Kaium, Executive Officer, Recovery Division of the Premier Bank Ltd. as P.W.1, who has deposed on behalf of the plaintiff on the basis of the authority given in his favour by the plaintiff-bank vide Exhibit-A. The said witness (P.W.1) proved certain documents including the Sanction Advice dated 13.07.2010 as Exhibit-B. According to the said sanction advice, the plaintiff-bank granted three categories of loans, namely: i) Specific Foreign LC (sight) for USD 12.00 Lac equivalent to Tk. 840 lac. ii) Term Loan for Tk. 756.00 Lac (As inner of L/C) and iii) Over Draft for Tk. 100 lac, in favour of M/s. Rainbow Sea Foods Limited (defendant no.4). The said witness (P.W.1) also deposed that the said credit facilities were granted in favour of the defendant No. 4 to purchase defendant no.1-vessel, F.V. Rainbow-1, a Hull Material-Steel vessel. L.O.A: 40 Meter, Breadth: 08 Meter, Depth: 4.40 Meter, Build in 2009, Country of Origin: Thailand with capacity of 300 MT, Number of Engine-1, Engine Serial No.33155198, Port of Registry: Chittagong, Registered in the year 2011. In order to secure the said loan, he deposed, the Managing Director of the defendant no.4-Company executed several charge documents, namely the Deed of Agreement of Charge by way of hypothecation (Exhibit-C), Irrevocable General Power of Attorney (Exhibit-D), Form No. 9B with the Registrar of Bangladesh Ships, Mercantile Marine Department, Chittagong (Exhibit-E). P W-1, accordingly, proved the said documents. He deposed that the borrower had mortgaged the said vessel in favour of the plaintiff-bank by executing the aforesaid Form No. 9B (Exhibit-E) with the Registrar of the Bangladesh Ships, Mercantile Marine Department, Chittagong. In support of the said mortgage, he deposed, the borrower also filed application to the Registrar of Bangladesh Ships, Mercantile Marine Department, Chittagong (Exhibit-F) and, accordingly, a confirmation of mortgage of defendant no.1 vessel was issued by the Principal Officer, Mercantile Marine Department, Chittagong (Exhibit-G). He also deposed that the said charges were also registered with the Registrar, Joint Stock Company (RJSC), Chittagong on 30.06.2011 (Exhibit-H). This witness further deposed that the said loan was rescheduled on several occasions and he, accordingly, proved the amended Sanction Advices bearing memo No. Premier/Ktg/Cr./ 623/2010, Premier/Ktg /Cr ./2011/1429, Premier/Ktg/Cr./2012/173 as Exhibit-I, J and K respectively. According to this witness, though the plaintiff issued demand notice dated 09.05.2011 (Exhibit-L), 27.06.2012 (Exhibit L1) and Legal Notice dated 12.12.2012 (Exhibit-M) for repayment of the said loan, the defendant borrowers failed to repay the said loan. According to the plaintiff-bank, vide Exhibit-M dated 17.12.2012, it wrote to the Bangladesh Ships, Mercantile Marine Department, Chittagong seeking  permission to sell the said mortgaged vessel, however, the shipping department, vide Exhibit-O, asked them to file appropriate suit before the High Court Division. Hence, the plaintiff has filed the instant suit. He also deposed that though the initial claim was for Tk. 8,91,71,046.76, the present claim against the defendants as on 16.11.2014 stands Tk. 8,63,51,981.56. In support of such claim, the plaintiff also proved the bank statement in respect of the borrower as Exhibit-P. This witness was extensively cross-examined by the borrower-defendant nos.1-6.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Upon consideration of above deposition and exhibits, it appears that apart from suggesting that the suit is not maintainable and that a compromise has been reached between the parties for rescheduling the loan liability, the defendants did not examine any witness or prove any documents by such witness indicating that the said loan liability was subsequently rescheduled during pendency of the suit. Therefore, this Court cannot take into account such suggestion of the learned advocate for the defendants to the said witness, which was denied by the witness. Since the suggestions as regards subsequent compromise and re-schedulement of loan between the parties were specifically denied by P.W.1 and since no such document has been proved by the defendants before this Court to prove any such compromise between the parties, this Court cannot reach any decisions in favour of the defendants merely relying on oral submissions in the absence of any documentary evidence being presented before this Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It appears from the above deposition of P.W.1 as well as cross-examination of the said witness and the documents as proved by the same witness that the obtaining of loan by defendant No. 4 for the purchase of the said defendant no.1 vessel is an admitted position. It is also an admitted position that at certain stage the defendants failed to repay the said loan which prompted the plaintiff to issue demand notice, legal notice etc. and finally to file this suit. Though there is a specific averment in the written statement that due to a compromise on 13.10.2013, the parties rescheduled the loan by approval dated 13.10.2013 extending the tenure for payment up to 31.05.2016, no such evidence has been adduced by the defendants to prove their such case, particularly when such a suggestion of compromise was denied by the PW-1 during cross- Examination. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of above deposition of the witness and upon consideration of the documents proved by the plaintiff, this Court has no option but to hold that in so far as the loan facilities as well as failure of the defendants to repay the same are concerned, the plaintiff has succeeded in proving its case, though it has chosen a wrong forum. Accordingly, the above issue No. 2-8 are decided in favour of the plaintiff.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Though the issue Nos.2-8 have been decided in favour of the plaintiff, this Court does not have jurisdiction to pass any decree or even to entertain this suit in view of the legal position as discussed under issue no.1, which was decided against the plaintiff. Since the suit itself is not maintainable before this Court, the decision of this Court on issue no. 2-8 will be of no help to the plaintiff.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Regard being had to the above facts and circumstances of the case and discussions of law, the instant suit is liable to be dismissed as  the same is not maintainable.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         Accordingly, the suit is dismissed. Plaintiff is allowed to take back the original exhibits and documents upon furnishing photocopies thereof duly attested by the learned advocate for the plaintiff.<br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><hr/><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><strong>Ad</strong></a><strong>miralty Suit No.  06  of 2013</strong></div></div></div></div>

The Assessee-Applicant is engaged in charity activity as mentioned in the bi-laws and derives its income from various sources, including from the foreign donation of various country, namely the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the Department For International Development (DFID), the European Commission    (EC), NOVIV, the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA). The assessee-applicant also derives income from the business activity of its different project. All these income are wholly applied to charitable purpose.</li><li>The Assessee-applicant being a charitable and income generating organization, is an assessee of income tax under the TIN 191-100-5800, the exempted under the provision of section 44(1) read with 6<sup>th</sup> Schedule, Part-A, Paragraph-1(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and accordingly the Assessee-applicant was allowed the said exemption on its income for every assessment years from its establishment up to the assessment year 1998-1999 and the DCT concern disposes the tax return, under the provision of section 83(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, as filed by the Assessee-applicant holding that the Assessee-applicant’s income is not taxable under the said provision, the income being used wholly for the charitable purpose.</li><li>But later, dispute arises when the Assessee-applicant submitted its income tax return for the assessment year 2001-2002 on 23.9.2001, showing a total loss of Tk. 49,04,52,476.00 and pursuant to the notice under section 83(1) and 79 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, the authorized representative of the Assessee-applicant, conducted the hearing before the Assessing Officer, IACT, who did not consider that the Assessee-applicant is entitled to the exemption of the provision of section 44(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, rather assessed the income of the Assessee-applicant at an amount of Tk. 11,43,28,606.00, turning the loss of Tk. 49,04,52,476.00 into income and made its assessment order under the provision of section 83(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, imposing tax liability upon the Assessee-applicant, treating the income of the Assessee-applicant as derived from project activities as taxable business income and also the bank interest accruing from foreign donation, as received by the Assessee-applicant, is a taxable income.</li><li>Being aggrieved with and highly dissatisfied by the said assessment order, the Assessee-applicant preferred appeal before the first appellate authority, being <strong>আয়কর আপীলপত্র নং- ৪০১/সা-৫১/কঃঅঃ-৫/২০০৩-২০০৪</strong>, with six grounds of objection. But since the same failed, the Assessee-applicant preferred further appeal before the Taxes Appellate Tribunal, being ITA No. 3162 of 2003-2004, which also having been failed against its nine grounds, the Assessee-applicant preferred the instant Income Tax Reference Application with the formulated questions as aforementioned.</li><li>During the pendency of the instant Income Tax Reference Application the Assessee-applicant obtained a permission from this court on 4.6.2014, in respect of availing ‘Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure’, as provided under section 152I of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and also an order of stay of the proceeding of the instant Income Tax Reference application till disposal of the ADR proceeding. Thereafter, the Assessee-applicant, by filing a supplementary-affidavit on 8.1.2015, informed this court that pursuant to the ADR procedure, the parties agreed on the factual issues, but failed to reach an agreement on the issues involving question of law, and thereby disagreement followed on the question of law which has been mentioned in the certificate issued by the facilitator. Accordingly, the Assessee-applicant reformulated the question raised for determination in the instant Income Tax Reference Application, by way of supplementary affidavit, dated 8.01.2015, as aforementioned.</li></ol><strong><em>         Claim of the Taxes department:</em></strong><ol><li>Upon service of the notice, the Taxes Department appeared through the then learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. Kazi Waliul Islam, who submitted the affidavit-in-reply, wherein it has been asserted that the IACT lawfully excluded the Assessee-applicant’s income from exemption, as provided under section 44(1) read with 6<sup>th</sup> Schedule, Part-A, Paragraph-1(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, since the said provision was limited to <em>inter-alia </em>income from house property and not extended to the business income. Since the Assessee-applicant’s runs business under the name and style of its subsidiary project Proshika Fabrics, Sericulture project, demonstration project, Integrated agriculture firm, Proshika Computer system and general business and deals in disaster management fund commercially, all of these activities are commercial in nature and do not run for the purpose of religious and charitable purpose and hence exemption cannot be allowed as per Paragraph-1 and 2 of the Sixth Schedule, as claimed by the Assessee-applicant since the said exemption can only be extended to any income derives from property under trust or other legal obligation, applied wholly for religious or charitable purpose. The IACT computed lawfully the taxable income of the Assessee-applicant as per amendment of the Finance Act 1999 upon which the ‘explanation’ remaining in the paragraph No. 1(1) of the Part A of the Schedule was omitted.</li><li>It has been further asserted that the IACT’s further decision not to extend the exemption to such income shown under the head of bank interest was correct. Because, the claim of the Assessee-applicant  that the tax deducted at source, under section 53F of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 from interest of saving deposit and fixed deposit is to be the final settlement under section 82C of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 is not correct. The assessment order was confirmed by the two appellate authorities, since the IACT’s assessment order excluding the Assessee-applicant from the exemption under section 44(1), read with Sixth Schedule, Part-A, Paragraph-1(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 was correct and lawful. The IACT made the assessment and computed taxable income and issued demand notice of Challan, imposing simple interest as per amendment made by the Finance Act 1999 and assessed the income of the Assessee-applicant under section 83(2)/44(1)/94A/10 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 being lawful and correct, the same was correctly confirmed by the Taxes Appellate Tribunal. Therefore, the question as has been formulated in the instant Income Tax Reference Application, not being proper questions and lawful is not required to be answered in negative and in favour of the Assessee-applicant.</li><li>By a supplementary-affidavit-in-reply the respondent asserted that on 14.7.2014 the Assessee-applicant itself resorted to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as per the provision of section 152I of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and <strong>বিকল্প বিরোধ নিস্পত্তি (পদ্ধতি) বিধিমালা ২০১২,</strong> which was concluded on several points, save &amp; accept one, involving issue of law and the facilitator has issued the certificate to that extent. Therefore, since the Assessee-applicant itself voluntarily resorted to ADR, it is devoured from raising the same before this court under the provision of section 152P of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 on the reasoning that one cannot aprobate and reprobate at the same time. </li><li>The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali along with the learned Advocate Mr. Ashraful Hadi, represented the Assessee-applicant, while the learned current Deputy Attorney General Ms. Kazi Zinat Haque, argued on behalf of the Taxes Department at the time of hearing of the instant Income Tax Reference Application.</li></ol><strong><em>Argument of the Assessee-applicant:</em></strong><ol><li>The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali, appearing on behalf of the Assessee-applicant, while taken this court to the fact that an attempt was made by the Assessee-applicant to avail the opportunity of ADR, as provided under section 152I of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and the same having been successful on some points based on factual aspects, but let the issues unresolved so far the question of law is concerned, as certified by the facilitator, which has been submitted before this court as Annexure-D, wherefrom it appears that the issue involve in this reference case centers round the question of law, whether the Taxes Appellate Tribunal correctly and lawfully interpreted the meaning of section 44(1) read with Sixth Schedule, Part-A Paragraph-1(i) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, since the Taxes Appellate Tribunal expressed an opinion that by virtue of amendment made by the Finance Act 1999, by way of omitting the word “explanation” from the provision of paragraph No. 1(1) of the 6<sup>th</sup> Schedule, Part-A, the income of the Assessee-applicant, a charitable organization, became taxable income.</li><li>The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali strenuously argued that the IACT while acting under the empowerment of section 10 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 as assessing officer, committed error in interpreting the omission of ‘explanation’ from the provision of paragraph No. 1(1) of Pat A of Sixth Schedule as has made the income of the assessee applicant as taxable, in as much as, the IACT did not notice that by its constitution the assessee applicant is a ‘charitable organization’ whose all sorts of income, derived either from donation or from its business activities are applied wholly and actually for the charitable purpose and as such, despite such omission of the provision ‘Explanation’ cannot be treated as changed the constitutional status of the Assessee Applicant. The assessee applicant although further registered under the NGO Bureau affairs, nevertheless its primary registration as charitable organization under the Societies Registration Act 1860 shall not be change, which will make the assessee applicant as entitled to the provision of exemption, even after its amendment through the Finance Act 1999, by omission of the ‘Explanation’.</li><li>The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali finally argued that such a serious question of law was negligently and mechanically considered by the two lower appellate authorities and as such the question formulated herein is required to be answered in negative and in favour of the Assessee applicant.</li><li>The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali in support of his argument relied on the case of S. Sundaram Pillai –vs- V.R. Patabiraman, reported in AIR (1985) SCJ 82 and the case reported in 36DLR(AD) 166 and 51 DLR 152.</li><li>On the other hand the learned Deputy Attorney General Kazi Zinat Hoque while taken this court through the 6<sup>th</sup> Schedule Part A of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 argued that earlier the income of the assessee applicant, derived from the business activity, was not taxable, but so far the amendment of the said provision is concerned, the IACT correctly treated the same and found that the income derived from the business activity are no move remaining within the purview of exemption and as such correctly assessed the return of the Assessee applicant.</li><li>The learned Deputy Attorney General further argued that the instant Income Tax Reference case become infractuous in as much as the matter was referred to the ADR procedure and upon such procedure the parties have come to agreement on the subject matter of the ADR and accordingly the facilitator issued the certificate and as such the provision of section 152P of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 came into play making the assessee applicant liable for preferring Appeal, under the provision of section 152Q of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, against the  issues which were left unresolved. The Assessee applicant, therefore not entitled to resumption of the proceeding of this income tax reference application and bound to prefer Appeal to get decision upon the issues which were left unresolved.</li></ol><strong><em>         Deliberation of the court:</em></strong><ol><li>In the instant Income Tax Reference Application the Assessee-applicant earlier formulated as many as four questions out of which question Nos. (a) &amp; (b) were related to the issue of denial of the IACT concern, as well as the two appellate authorities for taking into consideration as to the legal provision, that the Assessee-applicant, being a charitable organization, is exempted from the liability of income tax, under the provision of section 44(1) read with Sixth Schedule, Part-A, Paragraph-1(i) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984.</li><li>During the pendency of the instant Income Tax Reference Application the Assessee-applicant obtained a permission from this court on 04.6.2014, to avail the ‘Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Procedure’ as provided under the provision of chapter XVIIIB of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and accordingly this court not only accorded the permission but also stayed the instant proceeding invoking the power available under section 152II of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. Thereafter the ADR was held in the presence of the facilitator Md. Tariq Haider. Later, the Assessee-applicant submitted a supplementary-affidavit before this court, on 8.1.2015 praying for resumption of the instant proceeding informing this court that the facilitator has issued a certificate along with the written agreement of the parties, arrived at in the ADR proceeding, for the assessment year 2001-2002, wherein the Issue No. 2.1, 2.3 &amp; 2.5 were left un-resolved, since the said issues involved the question of law as to the applicability of the provision of section 44(1) read with Sixth Schedule, Part-A, Paragraph-1(i) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, in the case of the Assessee-applicant. The assessee-applicant upon such filing of the agreement along with the certificate of the facilitator, reformulated its question of law, directing the same only to the issue as to the applicability of the provision of section 44(1) read with Sixth Schedule, Part-A, Paragraph-1(i) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 in its case.</li><li>As against the supplementary-affidavit the Taxes department submitted supplementary-affidavit-in-reply, wherein it has been seriously asserted that since the Assessee-applicant voluntarily resorted to the ADR proceeding, as provided under section 152I of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, the Assesssee-applicant is debarred from the resumption of this proceeding and raising any further question before this court, as the provision of section 152P of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 barred the same and liable the assessee-applicant to prefer Appeal for obtaining decision on the unresolved issue and as such the instant proceeding became infractuous.</li><li>Upon such contentious approach it has now become imperative upon this court to decide the question, at the very outset, as to revival of the instant Income Tax Reference Application, after the conclusion of the ADR proceeding, upon examining the newly inserted provision of ‘Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Procedure’ as has been inserted by the Finance Act 2011, since the same has gone to the root of the instant proceeding.</li><li>It appears that the newly inserted Chapter-XVIIIB of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 provides the recently innovated noble idea of ‘Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Procedure’ within the provision of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, containing section 152F up to Section 152S of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, out of which section 152I of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 provides for the substantive provision of ‘Alternative Dispute (ADR) Resolution’ procedure in the following language;</li></ol><strong><em>Income Tax Ordinance 1984</em></strong><br/><strong><em>Section 152F. Alternative Dispute Resolution.-</em></strong><br/><em>Notwithstanding anything contained in Chapter XIX any dispute of any assessee lying with any income tax authority, Taxes Appellate Tribunal or Court may be resolved through Alternative Dispute Resolution (hereinafter referred to as ADR) in the manner described in the following sections of this Chapter and rules made thereunder.</em><ol><li>Section 152I of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 provides, inter alia, that the Assessee-applicant, if already preferred a Income Tax Reference Application before the High Court Division, it shall obtain a permission from this court for proceeding to the Alternative Dispute Resolution and the provision of section 152II of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 (inserted through Finance Act 2012) liable the Assessee-applicant to obtain an order of stay of the pending proceeding from this court and upon such prayer this court will not only allow the application, praying for approaching the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedure, but also stay the proceeding till disposal of the ADR proceeding. The provision of section 152II of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 reads as follows;</li></ol><strong><em>Income Tax Ordinance 1984</em></strong><br/><strong><em>Section 152II. Stay of proceeding in case of pending appeal or reference at Appellate Tribunal or High Court Division.-</em></strong><br/><em>Where an assessee has filed an application for ADR for any income year and for the same income year, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes has filed an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal or the Commissioner has made a reference before the High Court Division and no decision has been made in that respect by the Appellate Tribunal or High Court Division as the case may be, the proceeding of such appeal or reference shall remain stayed till disposal of the application for ADR.</em><ol><li>The aforesaid provision indicates that the Income Tax Reference proceeding shall be kept stayed  in this court till a report from the facilitator as to the conclusion of the ADR proceeding is being filed by the facilitator pursuant to the provision of section 1520(6) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, so far the dispute resolution is a unsuccessful one. The said provision of section 1520(6) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 reads as follows;</li></ol><strong><em>Income Tax Ordinance 1984</em></strong><br/><strong><em>Section 1250(6). Decision of the ADR.-</em></strong><br/><em>Where no agreement, whether wholly or in part, is reached or the dispute resolution is ended in disagreement between the applicant-assessee and the concerned Commissioner’s Representative for non-cooperation of either of the parties, the Facilitator shall communicate it, in writing recording reasons thereof, within fifteen days from the date of disagreement, to the applicant and the Board, the concerned court, Tribunal, appellate authority and income tax authority, as the case may be, about such unsuccessful dispute resolution.</em><ol><li>In the instant case it appears that the Assessee-applicant obtained the permission from this court to proceed to ADR on 04.6.2014 and the facilitator issued the certificate along with the agreement of the parties, which has been submitted before this court as Annexure-D to the supplementary-affidavit, dated 8.1.2015, whereupon the Assessee-applicant prayed for resumption of the instant Income Tax Reference Application and to answer the question which has been left un-resolved in the ADR Proceeding regarding the applicability of section 44(1) read with Sixth Schedule, Part-A, Paragraph-1(i) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984.</li><li>It appears the issues left out to be resolved in ADR, clearly involves the issue of laws. An issue of law is the subject of court or the tribunal to be resolved in accordance with the provision of law. No agreement <em>inter vivos</em> can be made on the issue of law and even it is done the same will be a nullity. The proceeding of ADR only allow the parties to come to an agreement in the presence of facilitator, who must be present in the proceeding of negotiation of the parties, but has nothing to do and to remain present as on looker, only to issue a certificate whether the ADR is a success or failure. In the ADR procedure the parties may only come to an agreement so far the factual aspects are concerned and the law has not allowed the parties to make an agreement, derogatory to the provision of law. </li><li>The argument advance by the learned Deputy Attorney General Ms. Kazi Zinat Haque that the instant Income Tax Reference Application cannot be revived as the facilitator has issued the certificate on the basis of the agreements of the parties, has got no merit to be considered by this court. Because, the parties did not resolve the issue of law and left the same unresolved to be decided by this court. Any question involving legal issue cannot be resolved in Alternative Dispute Resolution procedure. The entire Income Tax Reference jurisdiction requires the expression of opinion by the court on legal issue as has been provided in section 160 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. Therefore, the question which was un-resolved in the Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure can well be taken into consideration by this court for expressing opinion on the same.</li><li>But it appears that section 152Q of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 provided for an appeal which “may” be preferred by the Assessee-applicant on the failure of the parties to reach into an agreement in the Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure. The said provision runs as follows;</li></ol><strong><em>Income Tax Ordinance 1984</em></strong><br/><strong><em>Section 152Q: Limitation for appeal where agreement is not concluded.-</em></strong><br/><em>(1)     Notwithstanding anything contained in any provision of this Ordinance, where an agreement is not reached under this Chapter, wholly or in part, the assessee may prefer an appeal-</em><br/><em>(a) To the Appellate Joint Commissioner of Taxes or </em><em>appellate Additional Commissioner</em> <em>of Taxes or Commissioner of Taxes (Appeals), s the case may be, where the dispute arises out of an order of a Deputy commissioner of Taxes;</em><br/><em>(b)  To the Taxes Appellate Tribunal where the dispute arises out of an order of the Appellate Joint Commissioner of Taxes or </em><em>Appellate Additional commissioner</em> <em>of Taxes or Commissioner of Taxes (Appeals), as the case may be; and </em><br/><em>(c)  To the respective appellate authority or court from where the assessee applicant has got permission to apply for ADR.</em><br/><em>(2)     In computing the period of limitations for filing appeal, the time elapsed between the filing of the application and the decision or order of the ADR shall be excluded</em>.<ol><li>In this respect the learned Advocate Mr. Ashraful Hadi, appearing along with the learned Advcoate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali, drawn the attention of this court, that the word “appeal” used in the provision of section 152Q of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 has to be interpreted in a harmonious way pursuant to the established principle of interpretation of legal provision, upon taking all the relevant provision into consideration. In such interpretation of the provision of section 152Q of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, this court finds that although the procedure of appeal has been provided in section 152Q of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, but the word “may” as used in the said provision makes it an optional provision for the Assessee-applicant to prefer the appeal before appellate authorities of this court, meaning thereby that any issue upon which the parties fail to come to an agreement, shall be the subject of Appeal before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh as of right, without resorting to the provision of Article 103(3) of the Constitution, if the party aggrieved intends to opt for the Appeal.</li><li>However, in the instant case the provision of section 152Q of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 has no application, in as much as the parties have not failed on any factual issue, rather the parties left the legal issue unresolved. Failing to resolve on any point and leaving aside any point unresolve, are not the same and as such the assessee applicant is not liable to opt for preferring Appeal in the instant case against the unresolved issues.</li><li>Now turning to the question as has been raised in this income tax reference application, it appears that the parties to the ADR left unresolved the question as to the applicability of the provision of section 44(1), read with Sixth Schedule, Part-A, Paragraph-1(i) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 as to the tax liability of a charitable organization, like the Assessee-applicant and accordingly this court is now duty bound to answer the question as has been reformulated in the supplementary-affidavit.</li><li>The provision of paragraph No. 1(1) of part A of sixth Schedule of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 was in the form as reproduced below, at the relevant period, before it was amended by the Finance Act 1999;</li></ol><em>“Any income derived from property held under trust or other legal obligation wholly for religious or charitable purpose, and in the case of property so held in part only for such purposes, the income applied, or finally set apart for application, thereto.</em><br/><em>.......................................</em><br/><em>Explanation.- For the purposes of this paragraph, “property held under trust or other legal obligation” includes a business undertaking so held and where a claim is made that the income of any such undertaking shall not be included in the total income of the person in receipt thereof the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes shall have the power to determine the income of such undertaking in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance relating to assessment; and where any income so determined is in excess of the income as shown in the accounts of the undertaking such excess shall be deemed to be applied to purposes other than charitable or religious purposes.”</em><ol><li>By the Finance Act 1999 the ‘Explanation’ portion of the provision was omitted, upon which not only in the instant case but on the other cases as well, the assessing officers started to treat the income derived from the business activity by the charitable organization as not entitled to the exemption, as provided under section 44(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. This being a wrong interpretation of such omission this court has already decided that such decisions of the assessing officers were wrong in some other cases.</li><li>In this respect the referred case of Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC)-Vs-The Commissioner of Taxes in Income Tax Reference Application No. 279 of 2003, may be profitably examined, wherein a Division Bench of this court, upon considering a series of previous decisions from the Privy Council and up to the Appellate Division of Bangladesh Supreme Court has come to the decisive holding that despite the fact of deletion of ‘Explanation’ from the provision of paragraph 1(1) of the Sixth Schedule, Part-A, of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, the non taxability of the income of the charitable organization shall continue to be applicable. The relevant portion of the decision is reproduced below for better appreciation;</li></ol><em>“The word ‘property’ has been used but in the proviso the word ‘business’ has been used, Nevertheless, there is no difficulty to hold that ‘business’ is also a property. The business is a property is an established fact; it was held so as far back as in the case of the Trustees of Bombay Tribune, by the Privy Council, reported in 7 ITR 415. In the Bangladesh Statue, after the amendment brought about in 1973, it has been specifically laid down that for the purpose of this clause (i) property held under trust “includes a business undertaking so held”. The property in this case, consisting, as stated above, of the running business of launch-plying is held under trust, and income derived therefrom has been applied wholly for a religious or charitable purpose. But the proviso is to the effect that in the case of income from business this clause shall not apply, even if the income has been applied wholly for religious or charitable purpose, unless the business has been run in the course of the carrying out of a religious or charitable purpose of the trust. It should be noted that the proviso contains two other conditions (1) one is that the business is carried on “on behalf of a religious or charitable institution”, and the (2) other is that ‘the work in connection with the business is carried on by the beneficiaries” of the trust or institution.</em><ol><li>It appears that the similar question has arisen in the issue in front of this court as to the applicability of the provision of Paragraph-1(i) of the Sixth Schedule, Part-A, of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, as it was prevailing at the relevant period, since admittedly the Assessee-applicant is a charitable organization having no dividend to be paid to its sponsor directors and the whole income is being applied for the charitable purpose. Therefore, the issue appears to have been wrongly considered by the IACT concern, who found that due to the deletion of the ‘Explanation’ from the provision of Sixth Schedule, Part-A, Paragraph-1(i) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, the charitable organization became taxable under the said provision. The said issue was not meticulously or independently considered by the two appellate authorities which practically mechanically affirmed the assessment order, on the basis that the IACT concern has shown a cogent reason. But this court finds that the reason, as has been shown by the IACT concern, not being lawful, the question which has been formulated in the supplementary-affidavit, is required to be answered in negative and in favour of the Assessee-applicant.</li><li>Under the reasoning and discussion as above, this court finds merit in the instant Income Tax Reference Applications and the question, as has been formulated in the supplementary-affidavit dated 8.1.2015, is required to be answered in negative and in favour of the Assessee-applicant.</li></ol><strong><em>Result of the cases:</em></strong><ol><li>In the result, the instant Income Tax Reference Application is allowed.</li><li>The question as has been formulated by the Assessee-applicant in the instant Income Tax Reference Application is hereby answered in negative and in favour of the Assessee-applicant.</li></ol>However, there shall be no order as to costs.<br/><strong>Ed. </strong> </div></div>

Anwarul Islam, with<br/>Mrs. Farjana Sharmin, Advocates<br/><strong><em>. . . For Opposite Party no.1</em></strong><br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>JUDGMENT</u></strong></div><br/><strong><u>Borhanuddin, J:</u></strong><div style="text-align: justify;">This Rule has been issued calling upon opposite party no. 1 to show cause as to why judgment and decree dated 16.03.2002 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Khulna, in Title Appeal No. 121 of 2000 allowing the appeal in part by way of modifying the judgment and decree dated 13.03.2000 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Khulna, in Title Suit No. 17 of 1998 dismissing the suit, should not be set aside and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this court may seem fit and proper.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Facts relevant for disposal of the rule are that opposite party no.1 herein as plaintiff instituted Title Suit No. 17 of 1998 in the 3<sup>rd</sup> Court of learned Subordinate Judge, Khulna, for declaration of Title in respect of .47 <sup>rd</sup> acres land out of 1.43 acres as <sup>rd</sup> share by way of inheritance described in schedule “Ka” of the plaint and for further declaration that the deed of gift no.3315 dated 14.12.1997 registered at Batiagata Sub registry office is forged, fraudulent, inoperative, void and not binding upon the plaintiff.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Plaintiff’s case in short is that suit land belonged to Bhabesh Mondol who married Purnima Rani, daughter of Pulin Bairagee; Out of the wedlock, plaintiff was born who was brought up in the house of his maternal uncle; Since Purnima lost her procreation capacity, Bhabesh Mondol married Renuka and out of that wedlock two sons namely, Bhudeb and Bidhu were born; In the year 1997, Bhabesh was admitted in Khulna Seba Clinic for treatment; Bhabesh was a heart patient; At critical stage of his ailment, Bhabesh again admitted at Batiaghata Health Complex and remained there till 18.12.1997; Plaintiff was residing at Chittagong for the purpose of his service; His mother was at his maternal uncle’s house; Bhudeb, Bidhu and their mother Renuka looked after Bhabesh at the clinic; Taking advantage of the situation, on 14.12.1997 defendant no.1 and her two sons took Bhabesh out of the clinic for 2(two) hours by executing a bond and within this time incollusion with the subregistrar created a forged deed of gift dated 14.12.1997 in respect of the suit land; Said deed of gift was not executed voluntarily by Bhabesh; Bhabesh died on 19.04.1998 without any treatment; After the cremation ceremony, defendant no.1 disclosed about the deed of gift; Then the plaintiff procured certified copy of the deed on 17.05.1998 and constrained to file the suit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Defendant no.1 contested the suit by filing written statement denying material allegations made in the plaint and contending interalia that there is no cause of action, suit is not maintainable, bad for defect of parties and barred by limitation. Further contending that Bhabesh Mondol willingly and voluntarily executed and registered the deed of gift in favour of his wife; She is in possession of the land;  Plaintiff is not son of Bhabesh Mondol; All the rituals after expiry of Bhabesh Mondol performed by the defendant and her two sons; Suit is liable to be dismissed.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">After hearing the parties and assessing evidenced on record, learned Subordinate Judge dismissed the suit on contest against defendant no.1 and exparte against the rest holding that plaintiff did not pray for cancellation of the deed and the suit is bad for defect of parties and also held that suit for declaration on an undemarcated and unspecified land is not maintainable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Being aggrieved, plaintiff as appellant filed Title Appeal No. 121 of 2000 in the Court of learned District Judge, Khulna. On transfer, the appeal was heard and disposed of by the learned Additional District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Khulna, who after hearing the parties and reassessing evidence on record allowed the appeal in part upholding portion of the judgment and decree passed by the trial court so far as it relates to declaration of title but decreed that the deed of gift dated 14.12.1997 is forged, inoperative and not binding upon the plaintiff.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Having aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree, defendant-respondent as petitioner preferred this revisional application under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the present rule with an order of stay.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Zainul Abedin with Mr. M. Mahbubur Rahman, learned advocates appearing for the petitioner submits that appellate court below committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in passing the impugned judgment and decree without adverting findings of the trial court and thus violated provisions of 0rder XLI rule 31 of the Code of Civil Procedure as such, impugned judgment and decree is liable to be set aside. He also submits that appellate court below committed an illegality in not considering that plaintiff filed the suit praying for declaration that the deed of gift dated 14.12.1997 is forged and fraudulent as such, burden of proof lies upon the plaintiff under Section 103 of the Evidence Act to prove that the registered deed of gift is executed and registered fraudulently. He next submits that since the deed of gift is duly registered it has presumption of genuineness and correctness under section 114(e) of the Evidence Act and the appellate court below committed an illegality without considering this legal aspect. He again submits that appellate court below allowed the appeal with extraneous finding that the deed of gift was not acted upon without looking into the provisions of Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act inasmuch as amongst Hindus gift make subsequent to the Act does not require delivery of possession if there is registration. He lastly submits that the impugned judgment and decree passed by the appellate court below is based on misreading and non appreciation of evidence on record and as such liable to be set aside. In support of his submissions, learned advocate referred to the case of Abani Mohan Saha-Vs- Assistant Custodian (S.D.O) Vested Property, Chandpur and others, reported in 39 DLR(AD)323 and the case of Abul Kashem Howlader-Vs- Sultan Ahmed and others, reported in 9 BLC 333.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand Mr. Anwarul Islam Shahin with Ms. Farjana Sharmin, learned advocates for the opposite party submits that since the defendant no.1 claims title in the suit land by dint of deed of gift dated 14.12.1997, duty cast upon her under the provisions of Sections 101 and 103 of the Evidence Act to prove that the deed was acted upon. He also submits that it is apparent from evidence on record that at the time of execution and registration of the deed of gift, the donor was critically ill and admitted in the hospital so, it can be easily presumed that the deed of gift was not executed and registered voluntarily. He next submits that from the circumstances which is proved by the witnesses, it is evident that at the time of execution and registration of the deed of gift, the donor was not physically and mentally sound and the same is also proved from the testimony of PW.5 i.e. doctor of the clinic. He next submits that the very circumstances of the clinic wherein plaintiff and his mother were absent proves that the deed of gift executed under undue influence by defendant no.1 and her two sons to deprive the plaintiff from his due share. In support of his submissions, learned advocate referred to the case of Official Assignee of Bengal -Vs- Bidyasundari Dasi and others, reported in The Calcutta Weekly Notes, Vol-XXIV, P.145.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Heard the learned advocates. Perused revisional application, judgment of the courts below alongwith lower courts record and the decisions cited by the learned advocates.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly plaintiff instituted the suit for declaration of title in respect of “Ka” scheudle land and for further declaration that the deed of gift dated 14.12.1997 registered at Bhatiagata sub register office is forged, fraudulent, void, inoperative and not binding upon the plaintiff. Deed of gift dated 14.12.1997 which is under challenge is a registered instrument. It is not a case of the plaintiff that said deed was not executed and registered by Bhabesh Mondol rather plaintiff’s case is that the donor did not execute and register the deed voluntarily and willingly but under undue influence of defendant no.1 and her sons.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">I have gone through the judgments passed by the trial court as well as appellate court below. Plaintiff filed the suit under Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act. By now it is settled that a suit for mere declaration without seeking cancellation of the document is not maintainable. Further that the impugned deed of gift which is duly registered has a presumption of correctness as provided under Section 114 (e) of the Evidence Act as such onus lies upon the plaintiff to prove that the deed is forged and fabricated. On perusal of the record, it is evident that plaintiff failed to prove that the deed of gift is forged and fabricated by adducing credible oral and documentary evidence. From deposition of PW.5, it appears that the donor was permitted by the doctor to go out of the clinic for two hours, when the deed was executed and registered. Appellate court below allowed the appeal in part holding that the deed was not acted upon since there is no evidence that possession was delivered to the defendant no.1. This finding is not correct. Where the instrument of gift has been registered, delivery of possession is not essential for the validity of a gift by a Hindu. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act. runs as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“<strong>123. Transfer how effected- </strong>For the purpose of making a gift of immovable property, the transfer must be effected by a registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor, and attested by at least two witnesses. </em><br/><em>[Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, a heba under Muhammadan law shall be deemed to be a gift of immovable property for the aforesaid purpose.] </em><br/><em>For the purpose of making a gift of movable property, the transfer may be effected either by registered instrument signed as aforesaid or by delivery. </em><br/><em>Such delivery may be made in the same way as goods sold may be delivered.”</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">On plain reading of Section 123, it is clear that delivery of possession is essential to the validity of a gift is abrogated by section 123 of the Act. A gift under the Act can only be effected in a manner provided by Section 123.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On perusal of the testimony of DWs it appears that DW.4 is a attesting witness of the deed of Gift and DW.5 is scribe of the deed but the appellate court below on the basis of testimony of DWs.2 and 3 arrived at a finding that DWs.2-4 did not heard about the deed of Gift when Bhabesh was alive. But on perusal of the testimony of DWs.2, 3 and 4, it is apparent that the appellate court below arrived</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">at such a finding on misreading of evidence. In such view of the matter, I am of the opinion that the appellate court below committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in passing the impugned judgment and decree.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Facts and circumstances of the case cited by the learned advocate for the opposite party is quite distinguishable from the facts and circumstances of the case in hand.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the result, the rule is made absolute without any order as to cost.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Judgment and decree dated 16.03.2002 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Khulna, in Title Appeal No. 121 of 2000 is set aside and the judgment and decree dated 13.03.2000 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Khulna, in Title Suit No. 17 of 1998 is hereby restored.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Order of stay granted at the time of issuance of the rule is vacated.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Send down lower courts record alongwith a copy of this judgment to the court concern at once. <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><hr/><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><strong>Civil Revision No. 2691 of 2002</strong></a></div></div></div></div>

Respondents </strong></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><strong>Bankruptcy Act (X of 1997)</strong><br/><strong>Section 28</strong><br/><strong>Bankruptcy Rules, 1997</strong><br/><strong>Rule 11</strong><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A reading of section 28 of the Ain and bidhi 11 of the Bidhimala clearly show that the Adalat can reject a plaint of a </strong><strong>‡`Dwjqv</strong> <strong>suit if the</strong><strong> conditions mentioned therein are present.       . . (20)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Bankruptcy Act (X of 1997)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 5(1), 28 </strong><strong>and</strong><strong> 110</strong><br/><strong>Bankruptcy Rules, 1997</strong><br/><strong>Rule 11 </strong><br/><strong>A reading of section 110 shows that it has empowered the Adalat to exercise inherent power when an application is made by a debtor or creditor of receiver for securing ends of justice or to prevent the abuse of the process of the Adalat subject to the condition that the Adalat shall not exercise the power of inherent jurisdiction if there is a specific provision for remedy in the Act. So there being specific provision in section 28 of the Ain and in bidhi 11 of the Bidhimala for rejection of the plaint, the Adalat could not reject the plaint invoking its power under sections 5(1) and 110 of the Ain.                   . . . (23)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Bankruptcy Act (X of 1997)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 5(1), 28, 96 and 110</strong><br/><strong>From a reading of sections 5 and 110 of the Ain, we find no difficulty to come to the conclusion that the plaint could not be rejected under the said sections and, in fact, the plaint was rejected under section 28 of the Ain. But the Adalat wrongly invoked sections 5(1) and 110 of the Ain in rejecting the plaint. Mere mentioning of wrong sections of the Ain or invoking of the wrong sections of the Ain shall not, in any way, change the colour and complexion of the order and in determining the nature of the order, its contents have to be looked into. Since the Adalat rejected the plaint and section 28 of the Ain is the only section under which it could reject the plaint, it must be presumed that the plaint was rejected under section 28 of the Ain. Therefore, the order of rejection of the plaint was appealable under section 96(5) of the Ain.         … (24)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>Bankruptcy Act (X of 1997)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 96(5)</strong><br/><strong>Bankruptcy Rules, 1997</strong><br/><strong>Rule 26(3)</strong><br/><strong>As the order passed under section 28 of the Ain is appealable under section 96(5) thereof, that was an equally efficacious remedy. It may also be stated that besides filing the appeal under section 96(5) of the Ain, the plaintiff had other remedies under bidhi 26(3) of the Bidhimala, i.e. he could file a fresh suit within 30 days from the date of the order or could file an application for setting aside the order rejecting the plaint. So, the plaintiff in any view of the matter could not invoke the jurisdiction of judicial review of the High Court Division under article 102 of the Constitution, the writ petition was not maintainable.            . . . (25)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 104</strong><br/><strong>Now a very pertinent question arises and the question is–since the writ petition was not maintainable, whether the finding of the High Court Division that the Adalat acted illegally and without lawful authority in rejecting the plaint, can be maintained. We have given our anxious thought over the matter. As found earlier that the Adalat acted illegally in rejecting the plaint and if the order impugned in the writ petition is not set aside on the ground of non-maintainability of the writ petition, the order shall remain and in that case, the plaintiff has to take recourse to other forum and that shall surely cause serious prejudice to him for wrong exercise of power by the Adalat. Moreso, this wrong order passed by the Adalat may be used as precedence in a case like the instant one. It is also a fact that the plaint in question was presented before the Adalat as back as on 25.04.2000, i.e. a few days less than 16 years before. In view of these, we consider it a fit case to invoke the power vested in this Court under article 104 of the Constitution and accordingly in exercise of that power, we are inclined to interfere with the order passed by the Dewlia Adalat in Dewlia Suit No.27 of 2000 for doing complete justice.  (27)</strong></div><strong>Civil Appeal No. 83 of 2007.<br/>For the Appellant:</strong> Mr.   Shah   Md.  Monjurul Hoque, Advocate, instructed by Mr. Md. Wahidullah, Advocate-on-Record.  <br/><strong>For the Respondents :</strong> Mrs. Sufia Khatun, Advocate-on-Record.<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong><u>Md. Abdul Wahhab Miah, J:</u></strong> This appeal, by leave, is from the judgment and order dated the 20<sup>th</sup> day of October, 2003 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.838 of 2001 making the Rule absolute.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Facts necessary to dispose this appeal are that on 25.04.2000, respondent No.1 as the plaintiff presented a plaint before the <strong>®cE¢mu¡ ¢houL Bc¡ma</strong> at Motijheel, Dhaka (hereinafter referred to as the Adalat) against the appellant and respondent No.3 for a decree, amongst others, declaring the said defendants Bankrupt for non-payment of a matured debt of taka 3,33,00,000˙00 on the averment that defendant No.1, Shinepukur Holding Limited, appellant herein and defendant No.2 Mahmudur Rahman, respondent No.3 herein (hereinafter referred to as the defendants) as the property developers entered into an agreement with the plaintiff and his brother Abdul Hamid Chowdhury on 30.10.1985 for purchase of more or less 1.5 acres land comprising of Holding No.43, New Eskaton Road, Dhaka at a consideration of taka 11,00,00,000˙00 (eleven crore) including liabilities of taka 2,34,00,000˙00 clearly promising to pay taka 8,66,00,000˙00 equally to the plaintiff and his brother within 15 days of the expiry of a period of eighteen months from the date of commencement of the construction. The defendants got possession of the land with the execution of the agreement, constructed multi-storied buildings and sold them away. After a considerable delay, the defendants paid the plaintiff taka 1,00,00,000˙00 only out of this share of taka 4,33,00,000˙00. In spite of repeated demands the defendants did not pay the plaintiff any more money. So, the defendants owed to the plaintiff a matured debt of taka 3,33,00,000˙00. The plaintiff served a legal notice for money but without any result, Then, on 12.08.1999 the plaintiff served a formal notice making a formal demand for repayment of the debt under section 9(1)(T) of the<strong> ®cE¢mu¡ ¢houL BCe, 1997</strong>, (the Ain). The defendants though received the notice, failed to make any payment within 90 days and thereby committed an act of bankruptcy within the meaning of section 9(1) of the Ain, which made the defendants liable to be declared bankrupt; hence the suit for declaring the defendants bankrupt.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The  plaint  was  registered  as  <strong>®cE¢mu¡  ¢houL  </strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>j¡LŸj¡</strong>  No.27  of  2000 (hereinafter referred as the suit). The Adalat fixed 07.05.2000 for hearing on the question of maintainability, which was adjourned ultimately to 28.05.2000. On 28.05.2000 the plaintiff filed notice/summons for issuance upon the said defendants. The learned Judge of the Adalat rejected the prayer of the plaintiff for issue of summons/notice upon the defendants and rejected the plaint under sections 5(1) and 110 of the Ain by his order dated 28.05.2000 on the finding, <em>inter alia</em>, that the plaint was not filed by any Bank or financial institution within the meaning of section 2(j) of The Financial Institutions Act, 1993; that no natural individual person is entitled to present a plaint under section 10 of the Ain; that the defendants had no matured debt to the plaintiff within the meaning of <strong>¢h¢d 2(Y) </strong><strong>of</strong><strong> ®cE¢mu¡ ¢houL ¢h¢dj¡m¡, 1997</strong> (hereinafter referred to as the Bidhimala) as the claim of debt is not a bank-debt; the money claimed by the plaintiff could not be considered as a matured debt within the meaning of section 9(1)(T) of the Ain and the allegations made in the plaint do not constitute an act of bankruptcy; the Adalat had no jurisdiction to pass a decree for recovery of money.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Challenging the said order of the Adalat, the plaintiff, respondent No.1 herein filed the above mentioned writ petition before the High Court Division and obtained the Rule Nisi.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Rule Nisi was contested by respondent No.2, appellant herein by filing an affidavit-in-opposition contending, inter alia, that the writ petition as framed was not maintainable as the impugned order was appealable under section 96 of the Ain, the remedy by way of a statutory appeal was efficacious enough to disentitle the writ-petitioner to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court Division under article 102 of the Constitution; even after the impugned order, the writ-petitioner was entitled to bring a fresh suit or to make an application for setting aside the said order under bidhi 26(3) of the Bidhimala; as the claim of the writ-petitioner was based upon an agreement containing an arbitration clause and in view of such arbitration clause, the suit was barred under the Arbitration Act, 2001; the writ petition must be held to be bad for delay and latches as the impugned order was passed on 28.05.2000 and the writ petition was moved on 18.03.2001.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A Division Bench hearing the parties by the impugned judgment and order made the Rule absolute declaring the order of the Adalat dated 28.04.2000(it was wrongly typed as 25.04.2000 in place of 28.04.2000) to have been “made and/or passed” without any lawful authority and was of no legal effect and directed the Adalat to proceed with “the suit by issue of the summons/notice in accordance with law, expeditiously.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Against the judgment and order of the High Court Division the appellant filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.205 of 2004 before this Court and leave was granted to consider the submissions made on its behalf as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">   Mr. Rafique-ul-Huq, the learned counsel, appearing for the petitioner submits that the High Court Division acted illegally in holding that the Bankruptcy Court vide order dated 28.05.2001 having dismissed the plaint under Sections 591) (sic, it would be 5(1)) and 110 instead of Section 28 of the Bankruptcy Act, acted without lawful jurisdiction, when admittedly the Bankruptcy court had source of power to dismiss the plaint under Section 28 of the said Act and passed the impugned order with lawful jurisdiction and the same being an appealable order as provided under Section 96(5) (gha) of the said Act, writ petition was not maintainable without availing the said alternative remedy.<br/>   Mr. Huq further submits that the order dated 28.05.2000 passed by the Bankruptcy Court being an appealable order as provided under Section 96(5) (gha) of the Bankruptcy Act, and the writ petition having efficacious alternative remedy by way of statutory appeal/review, the petition was not maintainable and thus the judgment dated 20.10.2003 passed by the High Court Division is liable to be set aside.<br/>   Mr. Huq also submits that the High Court Division acted illegally in treating the Bankruptcy Court as a Tribunal holding the impugned order being ‘wrong’ in law, the Writ Court has jurisdiction to interfere with when Bankruptcy Court being established under Bankruptcy Act, 1997 which is a special law and any order even if passed perversely or wrong in law passed by the Bankruptcy Court, the remedies as provided in the said Act should be followed and therefore, the High Court Division in the presence of statutory remedy by way of appeal/review had no jurisdiction to interfere with the impugned order unless the said statutory remedy was availed and exhausted.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Shah Md. Monjurul Hoque, learned Advocate appearing for the appellant, has reiterated the submissions on which leave was granted, so we do not feel it necessary to record his submission.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mrs. Sufia Khatun, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing for the writ-petitioner-respondent, on the other hand, has supported the impugned judgment and order.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">From the impugned judgment and order, it appears that the High Court  Division  considering  the  definition of  <strong>"‡gqv`  DË©xY  ‡`bv</strong>" as  given in bidhi 2(dha) of the Bidhimala held that:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“Definition is simple; straight and unambiguous. In Case of Bank or any other financial institution the matured debt means matured loan or debt as defined time to time by the Bangladesh Bank. And in other cases, matured debt means unliquidated loan or debt after the expiry of the time for payment of the loan, debt or instalment as fixed in a written deed advancing loan or debt.<br/>   Such definition covers both the words loan and debt and makes no difference between them. Nor it excluded any loan or debt given by an individual person from being matured debt. Only condition imposed is that such loan or debt must be based on a written document. If the conditions are fulfilled, an unliquidated loan or debt given by even an individual natural person will become matured loan or debt after the expiry of the time or period fixed in the written deed giving such loan or debt.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The  High  Court  Division  considering  the  definition  of  <strong>"h_v‡hvM¨ †`bv`vi",  </strong><strong>“</strong><strong>GKK e¨w³Ó </strong><strong>and “</strong><strong>GKK †`bv`vi” </strong><strong>“</strong><strong>h_v‡hvM¨ cvIbv`vi</strong>” and <strong>“</strong><strong>†`Dwjqv Kg©</strong>” as given in section 2(38), 2(8), 2(39) and 2(19) respectively read with clause (i)(jha) of section 9 of the Ain and the statements made in the plaint that the plaintiff got a matured debt against the defendants of taka 3,33,00,000.00 and that he sent a formal demand for payment of the debt in the prescribed manner and that the defendants having not complied with the demand within the period of ninety days committed an act of bankruptcy and upon such claim, the plaintiff presented the plaint before the Court held that:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“The question whether or not the plaintiff had any valid and matured debt against the defendants within the meaning of section 9(1) of the Act could only be decided at the trial of the suit.<br/>   But the Court fell in serious error in holding that no individual natural person as creditor is entitled to present a plaint, that no debt of such individual natural person even matured could be a matured debt and that the Court has no jurisdiction to recover money from a bankrupt under the Act.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The High Court Division also held that section 28(1) of the Ain empowers the Adalat to dismiss the plaint presented by a creditor if the Adalat is not satisfied with the proof of:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“(i) such creditor’s right to present the plaint;<br/>(ii)  service on the debtor of a notice of the order fixing a date of hearing the plaint in accordance with section 22(2); and<br/>(iii) the alleged act of bankruptcy.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The High Court Division considering section 10 of the Ain held that the section clearly empowers one or more creditors; or a debtor to present a plaint when a debtor commits an act of bankruptcy for an order of adjudication declaring such debtor as bankrupt. And on these findings concluded that the presentation of the plaint by the plaintiff, an individual creditor was maintainable and that the Adalat was not correct in rejecting the same and the impugned order rejecting the plaint could not be sustained and accordingly set aside the same.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The High Court Division rejected the argument of the writ respondent that there being specific provision for appeal under section 96 of the Ain against the order of the Adalat, the writ petition was not maintainable on the finding that since the order of the Adalat was passed under sections 5(1) and 110 of the Ain and not under section 28 of the Ain or bidhi 11 of the Bidhimala, such order was not appealable under section 96 of the Ain.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have considered the relevant provisions of the Ain and the bidhi of the Bidhimala framed under the Ain considered by the High Court Division in the impugned judgment and order as mentioned and referred to hereinbefore, we find no reason to differ with the view taken by the High Court Division as quoted and stated hereinbefore. In the plaint of the instant case, the plaintiff clearly stated the facts to attract the provisions of section 2(19) read with section 9 of the Ain, so the plaint was not liable to be rejected and the Adalat was obliged to proceed with the suit in accordance with the provisions of section 21 of the Ain read with bidhi 8 of the Bidhimala and section 22 of the Ain read with bidhi 13 of the Bidhmala, the High Court Division rightly set aside the order rejecting the plaint and directed the Adalat to proceed with the suit issuing the summons/notice upon the defendants in accordance with the law.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">So far as the finding of the maintainability of the writ petition is concerned, we find it difficult to accept the view of the High Court Division.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">From the order of the Adalat, it appears that in the body of the order, it did not mention or refer to section 5(1) or section 110 of the Ain and only in the ordering portion, it mentioned the said sections. The penultimate part of the ordering portion of the order reads as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“</strong><strong> ýL¥j qu ®k,</strong><br/><strong>Aœ jLcj¡l c¡¢M¢mL«a Bl¢S lre£u e</strong><strong>−</strong><strong>q j</strong><strong>−</strong><strong>jÑ M¡¢lS qu Hhw h¡c£ f¡Je¡c¡l fr LaÑªL pje/®e¡¢Vn Cp¤ L¢lh¡l fË¡bÑe¡u AcÉL¡l clM¡Ù¹ e¡ j”¤l quz ®cE¢mu¡</strong><br/><strong>¢houe BCe 1997 Hl 5(1) Hhw 110 d¡l¡ fËcš rja¡ h</strong><strong>−</strong><strong>m Aœ B</strong><strong>−</strong><strong>cn fËc¡e Ll¡ qCmz”</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">So, from the penultimate ordering portion of the order, it is absolutely clear that the plaint was rejected.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Let us see whether there is any provision in the Ain for rejection of the plaint of a <strong>‡</strong><strong>cE¢mu¡ ¢houL</strong> suit.

The sections read as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“</strong><strong>5| †`Dwjqv welqK mKj cÖ‡kœ wm×všÍ MÖn‡Y Av`vj‡Z ÿgZv|</strong><br/><strong>GB AvB‡bi weavbejx mv‡c‡ÿ, †`Dwjqv welqK †Kvb Kvh©avivq DÌ¨vwcZ †h</strong><br/><strong>†Kvb cÖkœ, ¯^Z¡ ev AMÖvwaKvi msµvšÍB nDK A_ev AvBbMZ ev NUbvMZ ev Ab¨ †h †Kvb ai‡bi nDK bv †Kb, hv Av`vj‡Zi †MvPixf‚Z nq ev hvnv D³ gvgjvi c~Y©vsM b¨vq wePvi ev mswkøó  m¤úwËi c~Y©vsk b¨vq wePvi ev  mswkøó  m¤úwËi c~bvsM e›U‡bi D‡Ïk¨  wb®úwË Kiv mgxwPb I cÖ‡qvRbxq ewjqv Av`vjZ g‡b K‡i ‡mB iæc mKj cÖ‡kœ wm×všÍ MÖn‡Yi c~Y© ÿgZv Av`vj‡Zi _vwK‡e|</strong><br/><strong>110| Av`vj‡Zi Abywbwn©Z ÿgZv|--</strong><br/><strong>‡`bv`vi, †Kvb cvIbv`vi ev wiwmfv‡ii Av‡e`bµ‡g, Av`vjZ Dnvi we‡ePbvg‡Z h_vh_  Ggb  ‡h  †Kvb  Av‡`k  w`‡Z  cvwi‡e,  hvnv  b¨vq  wePv‡ii  ¯^v‡_©  ev  Av`vj‡Zi Kvh©µ‡gi (</strong><strong>process of court</strong><strong>) Ace¨envi †ivaK‡í cÖ‡qvRbxq ewjqv g‡b K‡ib|</strong><br/><strong>Z‡e kZ© _v‡K †h, G avivq cÖ`Ë ÿgZv Ggb †Kvb †ÿ‡Î cÖ‡qvM Kiv hvB‡ebv, †h, †ÿ‡Î GB AvB‡bi Aax‡bi Aax‡b Ab¨ †Kvb cÖwZKv‡ii e¨e¯’v Av‡Q|Ó</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">A mere reading of these two sections shows that the legislature did not cloth these sections with the power to reject the plaint. Section 5(1) has empowered the Adalat to decide the questions of title or priority or of any other nature either legal or factual or of any other nature which may come to the knowledge of the Adalat or of any other nature which may arise in a <strong>®cE¢mu¡ </strong>suit or which the Adalat may deem fit and expedient or necessary for doing complete justice or for making a complete distribution of the property and the power given under the section is to be exercised in aid of the <strong>®cE¢mu¡ </strong>suit and not otherwise. In the four corners of the section, nothing has been said about the rejection of the plaint.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A reading of section 110 shows that it has empowered the Adalat to exercise inherent power when an application is made by a debtor or creditor of receiver for securing ends of justice or to prevent the abuse of the process of the Adalat subject to the condition that the Adalat shall not exercise the power of inherent jurisdiction if there is a specific provision for remedy in the Act. So there being specific provision in section 28 of the Ain and in bidhi 11 of the Bidhimala for rejection of the plaint, the Adalat could not reject the plaint invoking its power under sections 5(1) and 110 of the Ain.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">From a reading of sections 5 and 110 of the Ain, we find no difficulty to come to the conclusion that the plaint could not be rejected under the said sections and, in fact, the plaint was rejected under section 28 of the Ain. But the Adalat wrongly invoked sections 5(1) and 110 of the Ain in rejecting the plaint. Mere mentioning of wrong sections of the Ain or invoking of the wrong sections of the Ain shall not, in any way, change the colour and complexion of the order and in determining the nature of the order, its contents have to be looked into. Since the Adalat rejected the plaint and section 28 of the Ain is the only section under which it could reject the plaint, it must be presumed that the plaint was rejected under section 28 of the Ain. Therefore, the order of rejection of the plaint was appealable under section 96(5) of the Ain. This will be clear if we have a look at section 96(5) of the Ain. Section 96 of the Ain reads as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“</strong><strong>96- </strong><strong>Bf£m</strong><strong>–</strong><strong>(</strong><strong>1)  GB  AvB‡bi  Ab¨vb¨  weavbvejx  mv‡c‡ÿ  †`bv`vi,  †h  †Kvb cvIbv`vi,  wiwmfvi  ev  Ab¨  †h  †Kvb  e¨w³,  †`Dwjqv  welqK  Kvh©avivq  GLwZqvim¤úbœ †Kvb AwZwi³ †Rjv RR ev †Rjv RR cÖ`Ë wm×všÍ ev Av‡`k Øviv msÿzÜ nB‡j  Bnvi weiæ× nvB‡KvU© wefv‡Mi wbKU Avcxj Kwi‡Z cvwi‡eb|</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>p¤fË£j  ®L¡VÑ  pju  pju  q¡C</strong><strong>−</strong><strong>L¡VÑ  ¢hi¡</strong><strong>−</strong><strong>Nl HCl©f  HL¢V </strong><strong>−</strong><strong>h’ NWe L¢l</strong><strong>−</strong><strong>h k¡q¡l c¡¢uaÄ qC</strong><strong>−</strong><strong>h öd¤j¡œ HC BC</strong><strong>−</strong><strong>el Ad£</strong><strong>−</strong><strong>e c¡</strong><strong>−</strong><strong>ulL«a Bf£m pj§q ¢eÖf¢š Ll¡z</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>.................................................. </strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>..................................................</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>wbb¥ewY©Z †h †Kvb Av‡`k ev wm×v‡šÍi weiæ× GB AvB‡bi Aax‡b Avcxj Kiv hvB‡e, h_vt-</strong></li></ol><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>¯^Z¡ wba©vi‡Yi wm×všÍ;</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>†`Dwjqv Kg© wba©vi‡Yi wm×všÍ;</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>e›Ub‡hvM¨  m¤ú`  nB‡Z  ew›UZ  Ask  cÖ`v‡bi  †ÿ‡Î  AMÖvwaKvi  wba©vi‡Yi wm×všÍ;</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>aviv 28 Gi weavb †gvZv‡eK †Kvb AvwR© Lvwi‡Ri Av‡`k;</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>aviv 29 Gi weavb †gvZv‡eK ÿwZc~iY cÖ`v‡bi Av‡`k;</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>aviv 30 Gi weavb †gvZv‡eK cÖ`Ë †`Dwjqv †NvlYv‡`k;</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>aviv  33  Gi  weavb  †gvZv‡eK  ¯’vbvšÍwiZ  Ggb  †Kvb  gvgjv  ev  Kvh©aviv wb®úwËKvix wWwµ (cÖv_wgK wWwµmn) wm×všÍ ev Av‡`k hvnvi weiæ‡×, gvgjv ev Kvh©avivwU hw` ¯’vbvšÍiKvix Av`vjZ KZ©„K cÖ`Ë nBZ, Avcxj Kiv hvBZ;</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>aviv 38 Gi weavb †gvZv‡eK Zdwm‡j †Kvb †gŠwjK Z_¨ AšÍf‚©³ msµvšÍ Av‡`k;</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>aviv 40 Gi weavb †gvZv‡eK cÖ`Ë †`Dwjqv †NvlYv‡`k i`Kvix Av‡`k;</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>aviv  42  Gi  weavb  †gvZv‡eK  cÖ`Ë  Av‡`k,  hvnv  Øviv  wbiæwcZ  kZ©vax‡b †`bv`v‡ii wbKU †Kvb m¤úwË wdwiqv hvq; </strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>aviv 46 Gi weavb †gvZv‡eK cÖ`Ë †Kvb c~Y©MVb cwiKíbvi Av‡`k ev Dnv Aby‡gv`bKvix Av‡`k;</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>`vqgyw³i Av‡e`‡bi e¨vcv‡i 47 avivi Aaxb cÖ`Ë †Kvb Av‡`k;</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>†Kvb  cvIbv`v‡ii  cvIbv  cÖZ¨vL¨vb  Kwiqv  ev  cvIbvi  cwigvY  KgvBqv  57 avivi Aaxb cÖ`Ë †Kvb Av‡`k;</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>†Kvb m¤úwËi c~e©eZ©x n¯ÍvšÍi i` Kwiqv 52 nB‡Z 60 aviv ch©šÍ avivmg~‡ni Aax‡b cÖ`Ë †Kvb Av‡`k|</strong><ol><li><strong>..................................................</strong></li><li><strong>................................................Ó</strong></li></ol></li></ol><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">As the order passed under section 28 of the Ain is appealable under section 96(5) thereof, that was an equally efficacious remedy. It may also be stated that besides filing the appeal under section 96(5) of the Ain, the plaintiff had other remedies under bidhi 26(3) of the Bidhimala, i.e. he could file a fresh suit within 30 days from the date of the order or could file an application for setting aside the order rejecting the plaint. So, the plaintiff in any view of the matter could not invoke the jurisdiction of judicial review of the High Court Division under article 102 of the Constitution, the writ petition was not maintainable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">For the reasons stated hereinbefore, we have no hesitation to conclude that the High Court Division was wrong in holding that the writ petition was maintainable as “An order made under section 5(1) and/or 110 of the Act is not appealable”. In taking the said view the High Court Division made a mechanical approach and failed to apply its mind to the order passed by the Adalat in its entirety.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Now a very pertinent question arises and the question is–since the writ petition was not maintainable, whether the finding of the High Court Division that the Adalat acted illegally and without lawful authority in rejecting the plaint, can be maintained. We have given our anxious thought over the matter. As found earlier that the Adalat acted illegally in rejecting the plaint and if the order impugned in the writ petition is not set aside on the ground of non-maintainability of the writ petition, the order shall remain and in that case, the plaintiff has to take recourse to other forum and that shall surely cause serious prejudice to him for wrong exercise of power by the Adalat. Moreso, this wrong order passed by the Adalat may be used as precedence in a case like the instant one. It is also a fact that the plaint in question was presented before the Adalat as back as on 25.04.2000, i.e. a few days less than 16 years before. In view of these, we consider it a fit case to invoke the power vested in this Court under article 104 of the Constitution and accordingly in exercise of that power, we are inclined to interfere with the order passed by the Dewlia Adalat in Dewlia Suit No.27 of 2000 for doing complete justice. Accordingly, this appeal is disposed of in the following terms:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The finding of the High Court Division that the writ petition was maintainable is set aside. The order dated 28.04.2000 passed by the Dewlia Adalat in Dewlia Suit No.27 of 2000 rejecting the plaint is set aside. The Dewlia Adalat is directed to proceed with the suit and dispose the same in accordance with law. The question of maintainability of the suit shall be decided along with the other issues at the trial of the suit.<br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

Respondents</em></strong></td></tr></tbody></table> <div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Companies Act (XVIII of 1994) </strong><br/><strong>Sections 228 and 229</strong><br/><strong>There is nothing inherent in the UAPL/ </strong><strong>BPDB Contract that excludes the applicability</strong><strong> of the Section 229 provisions, thereby, paving the way for UAPL to participate in the merger/amalgamation process under the Scheme. Accordingly, BPDB’s construction otherwise of contractual bars operating in the circumstances is, therefore, found to be misconceived and unsubstantiated in law. This Court, accordingly, finds that the Respondent No. 5 BPDB has been unable to make out a definite case for BPDB’s prior approval of the Scheme over and beyond the judicial sanction envisaged under Section 228 and 229 of the Act.        . . . (17)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Companies Act (XVIII of 1994) </strong><br/><strong>Section 229</strong><br/><strong>A clear understanding of the Section 229 transfer and vesting provisions allows for the tax relief pertaining to the power generation undertakings of the Transferor Companies, coupled with other assets and liabilities, to pass on to the Petitioner Transferee Company UPGDCL. For the purpose of BPDB administering its separate contractual relationship with UAPL, and possibly at a later date with SPGCL, it must be borne in mind that the Scheme of Amalgamation based on the tenets of Section 229 shall, necessarily, ensure that the incomes of each of the power generation undertakings shall stand compartmentalized and be maintained separately by the amalgamated entity. This shall enable the allocation of different tax exemptions/ benefits to respective income streams. This Court also finds that the Scheme does not blur the distinction between the separate nature of power generation activities of UAPL vis-à-vis SPGCL and UPGDCL. That is aptly in keeping with the notion that that tax reliefs as at issue in this case attach effectively to the relevant power generation undertakings pursuant to the individual and separate licenses under which each of the three entities operates. Accordingly, the nature of tax exemption is found by this Court to be dependent on the nature of power generation itself and will remain so upon the implementation of the Scheme. Contrary to what BPDB has deduced from the circumstance, this Court finds that tax exemption is dependent not on the nature or identity of the company owning the projects but rather on the process and nature of that </strong><strong>company’s power generation activities. ...(18)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Companies Act (XVIII of 1994) </strong><br/><strong>Section 229</strong><br/><strong>This Court finds that there is nothing in Section 6(b) that detracts in any way from the legal principle of <em>nemo dat quod non habet </em>i.e. one cannot transfer what one does not have. Implicit in Section 6(b), as indeed in Section 229 of the Act, is that while transferring its undertaking UAPL shall be bringing into this Scheme only such of the tax benefit as attaches to its transferred undertaking i.e. the rental power plant. In </strong><strong>no circumstances is it contemplated, therefore,</strong><strong> that the tax benefits accrued and enjoyed by the rental power plant shall permeate all the undertakings of the amalgamated entity in as much as the tax exemption/ relief attach always to specific undertakings as opposed to individual entities. Importantly, and vice versa, there is no implication in the Scheme either of UPGDCL’s tax benefits at any time accruing </strong><strong>or attaching to UAPL’s rental power generating</strong><strong> activity during the validity period of the UAPL/BPDB Contract.           . . . (20)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Companies Act (XVIII of 1994) </strong><br/><strong>Sections 228 and 229</strong><br/><strong>It shall be incumbent upon the parties to spell put further that upon the coming into the effect of the Scheme both SPGCL and UAPL shall automatically stand dissolved without further winding-up and cease to operate and their undertakings shall be amalgamated with that of the UPGDCL which shall continue to operate as a going concern in an amalgamated form and as the Amalgamated Company.         . . .

The issued, subscribed and paid-up capital of the SPGCL is Tk. 3,00,000/- divided into 30,000 ordinary shares of Tk. 10/-  </li><li style="text-align:justify">The origins of the Respondent No. 2 Transferor Company UAPL is traced to the Government of Bangladesh’s (GOB) endeavour to purchase power on a fast-track basis pursuant to the <strong>বিদ্যুৎ ও জ্বালানীর â্রত সরবরাহ বৃদ্ধি (বিশেষ বিধান) আইন, ২০১০</strong> or <em>Increasing Fast Supply of Electricity and other Energies (Special Provision) Act, 2010. UAPL responding to such endeavour submitted its proposal for 53 MW gas- fired power station and at present operates a 53 MW Power Plant at Ashuganj, Brahmanbaria. In terms of the Contract, or power purchase agreement as necessary, for the Installation of the 53 MW Power Plant, its Operation and Maintenance Services and Supply of Electricity on Rental Basis dated 23.12.2010, as amended on 16.9.2014, UAPL supplies power to the BPDB.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify">As of 31.12.2014, UAPL has an authorized share capital of Tk.100,00,00,000/- with a face value of Tk. 10/- per share. The issued, subscribed and paid-up capital of UAPL is Tk. 75,00,00,000/- divided into 7,50,00,000 ordinary shares of Tk. 10/- each.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It is evident at the outset that all three Companies have virtually a co-extensive membership and management. Dwelling on the precise nature of power generation activity that all three entities are engaged in, this Court deduces from materials on record and submission made both on behalf of the Petitioner as well as the Respondent No. 5, BPDB that the Transferee Company UPGDCL and the Transferor Company SPGCL are primarily engaged in the operation of commercial power plants whereas the other transferring entity UAPL is engaged in the supply of power on a rental basis. That distinction in the very nature of the power generation activities of UPGDCL and SPGCL on the one hand and UAPL on the other denotes somewhat distinct statutory, policy, regulatory and contractual régimes governing the activities in general and in particular the financial obligations of these separate sets of entities.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It is evident, therefore, <em>from Policy Guidelines for Enhancement of Private Participation in the Power Sector, 2008, the power plants being operated by the UPGDCL and the SPGL are Commercial Power Plants and are independent in nature, i.e. not established or operated in response to solicitation by the GOB. Since these power plants are of commercial nature, the parties are free to dispose of the ownership of the companies/acquire new companies at their discretion without any contractual restrictions. </em>It is, accordingly, submitted by the learned Advocate for the Petitioner Mr. Tanjib-ul Alam that both these entities may proceed with the proposed merger/ amalgamation upon requisite sanction from this Court and resolutions adopted at their respective general meetings. On the other hand, the Respondent No. 2 Transferor Company UAPL established a power plant by a submission of a proposal against the GOB’s venture of <em>obtaining power on a fast-track basis. Clause 4.2 (h)(ii) of the Contract for Installation of 53 MW Power Plant, its Operation and Maintenance Services and Supply of Electricity on Rental Basis dated 23.12.2010 stipulates that prior written approval of BPDB would be required for the transfer, conveyance, loss or relinquishment to any person or entity of UAPL’s right to own and/or operate the 53 MW power plant or any material part thereof or to occupy the site, to any other person. As noted later, BPDB would have this Court appreciate that since the proposed merger/amalgamation would involve transfer of UAPL’s right to own the 53 MW power plant to UPGDCL, UAPL would be required to obtain permission from BPDB prior to effectiveness of the Scheme of Amalgamation. Noted further is the fact that Clause 22(ii) of the Scheme contemplates the effectiveness of the Scheme to be conditional upon this Court’s judicial sanction under the Act and that from “any other authorities”</em><em>. </em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>It is in the context above that this Court’s attention is drawn to UAPL’s 23.10.2010 Contract or power purchase agreement with BPDB for supplying electricity. That contract is found to contemplate merely this Court’s sanction of the Scheme as per the Act’s prescription obviating the necessity of seeking further approvals or prior consents from any other authority including BPDB. Attention is drawn in this regard to Clause 4.2 (h) and (i) of the UAPL/BPDB Contract as deals with </em><em>Events of Default</em><em> drawing a distinction, however, between simple acts or assignments of transfer and an exceptional instance of amalgamation or reconstruction. Clause 4.2 restricts assignment or transfer generally except upon the BPDB’s prior consent. However, any instance of merger/amalgamation is noted significantly to have been left out of the purview of BPDB’s prior approval under the same Clause. Clause 4.2(h) and (i) read thus: </em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“(h)      The occurrence of any of the following events: </em></div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align:justify"><em>the assignment or transfer of Rental Power Company’s right or obligations in the assets of the Facility without the prior consent of BPDB.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>the transfer, conveyance, loss or relinquishment to any person or entity of Rental Power Company’s right to own and/or operate the Facility or any material part thereof or to occupy the Site to any person without the prior written approval of BPDB.</em></li></ol><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align:justify"><em>except for the purpose of amalgamation or reconstruction (provided, that such amalgamation or reconstruction does not affect the ability of the amalgamated or reconstructed entity, as the case may be, to perform its obligations under this Contrct), the occurrence of any of the following events.</em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>…”    </em></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The fact of co-extensive membership and management as previously noted coupled with a similarity of the broad objectives of the three entities of generating electricity and selling the same are now argued on behalf of UPGDCL to be the crucial determinants of the proposed merger and amalgamation. A consensus in this regard for the convergence of the business interests of all three entities catering for production of electricity on an efficient and effective manner is said to be reflected in the minutes of their respective BOD meetings held on 15.9.2015 approving the draft Scheme and deciding upon filing this Application for this Court’s sanction of the Scheme under Sections 228 and 229 of the Act.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It is in the context above that the learned Advocate for UPGDCL Mr. Tanjib-ul Alam has also highlighted the long-term commercial objectives of the amalgamated entity to be equipped with an enhanced capacity to face an ever increasing competition in electricity generation and to provide the same to customers efficiently. Such a stance, Mr.  Alam submits, gets reiterated in the respective Extra Ordinary General Meetings (EGM) of the three entities held on 29.11.2015 and 30.11.2015 as per this Court’s directions of 18.10.2015 unanimously adopting resolutions approving the Scheme without any modification. Furthermore, reports prepared by the Chairman of each such EGM as well as of the creditors meetings have been brought on record along with the minutes of the EGMs by an Affidavit-in-Compliance of 19.1.2016 by the Petitioner Transferee Company UPGDCL.  </li><li style="text-align:justify">An Affidavit-in-Opposition substantively opposing the Scheme has been filed by the Respondent No. 5, BPDB as represented by the learned Advocate Mr. Md. Nasir Shikder. That opposition is basically predicated on an inherent distinction between the nature of electricity generation undertaken by the Respondent No. 2 Transferor Company UAPL as compared to the other transferring entity SPGCL and indeed the Petitioner Transferee Company UPGDCL. Coming under the purview of a separate statutory, policy, regulatory and contractual régime, as above noted, it is apprehended that the proposed amalgamation may unduly grant UAPL a tax exemption windfall that is legitimately not its due. By that reason BPDB perceives the Scheme to be a device for tax evasion and this Application, resultantly, to be one filed with mala fide intent. Mr. Shikder submits that governed by the Policy Guidelines of 2008 and the Private Sector Power Generation Policy, 1996 (as amended in 2004) both UPGDCL and SPGCL generate electricity through Commercial Power Plants to the benefit of Large Consumers specified in the Policy Guidelines of 2008. These entities are shown to have been established on a permanent basis significantly benefiting from tax exemption for a period of fifteen years. UAPL, on the other hand, established as a Rental Power Company to rent electric capacity and energy output Facility to BPDB only is shown to benefit from comparatively limited tax exemption facilities. </li><li style="text-align:justify">The Scheme is in that context perceived by BPDB to blur that distinction of the scope, nature and purpose of power generation by these three entities with a view specifically to unduly benefit UAPL with tax exemption privileges for a period of fifteen years which is submitted to militate against the very concept of establishing rental- based power generating companies. That concern, arising in the domain of public policy and reflected in the need to protect public interest, is matched by the BPDB’s fear further of a serious complication at an administrative level in enforcing its separate agreements with the two transferring entities post-amalgamation. It is in that context that BPDB questions the feasibility of the Scheme in ushering in an efficient and productive management system conducive to revenue generation and profit augmentation. </li><li style="text-align:justify">Referring to the Affidavit-in-Opposition, Mr. Shikder submits that in addition to the existing electricity supply Contract with UAPL a similar agreement with SPGCL is in the pipeline. The reality of these two agreements once in place, it is feared, will <em>“create huge perplexity in enforcing the agreements”</em> given that the dates of imposing tax and the power purchase rates shall vary in each case. Notably the duration of these contracts shall also vary. Coupled with that concern further is the prospect of UAPL eventually converting itself to a Commercial Power Plant under the Scheme availing of the opportunity, thereby, to sell electricity to large Consumer without BPDB’s prior consent. In other words, the apprehension is of BPDB eventually losing control over UAPL.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It is in that context that BPDB highlights the existence of certain contractual barriers purportedly obstructing UAPL’s participation in the Scheme of Amalgamation. Clause 25.3 of Article 25 of the UAPL/BPDB Contract is relied upon to submit that such contractual arrangement is intended solely for the benefit of the parties thereto i.e. UAPL and BPDB and nothing therein is to be construed as creating any duty, liability, right etc. of whatsoever nature pertaining to or affecting any person or entity not a party to such contract. Stressing that the contracting parties have, thereby, wholly contracted out of the transfer and vesting provisions of Section 229 of the Act in particular, Mr. Shikder submits that there is resultantly no option reserved to the Petitioner UPGDCL to assume all contractual duties and liabilities of UAPL through the device of the Scheme of Amalgamation as the very option of such transferability of duty or liability or rights remains wholly contractually excluded. That apprehension, based on BPDB’s constructions of certain contractual provisions and interpretation of the law, it is noted, gets reflected in its communication of 25.2.2016 addressed to UAPL declining to grant its consent to UAPL’s participation in the Scheme on the ground further that it would otherwise cause serious prejudice to BPDB.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The Petitioner UPGDCL’s response to BPDB’s apprehensions are predicated on the very nature of the transfer and vesting process inherent in the Section 229 provisions and, as Mr. Alam argues, expressly anticipated in the UAPL/BPDB Contract. The Petitioner stresses that Clause 4.2(i) of the Contract, as above referred, clearly exempts any act of amalgamation or reconstruction from operating as an event off default triggering of a possible termination of such agreement. The proviso to Clause 4.2(i), appearing in parenthesis, Mr. Alam aptly submits, encapsulates the very essence of transferability and vesting focal to Section 229 in anticipating the acquisitional capacity of an amalgamated entity and its consequential ability to perform its obligations under this very pre-existing contractual arrangement with BPDB. It is therefore, satisfactorily established that there is nothing inherent in the UAPL/ BPDB Contract that excludes the applicability of the Section 229 provisions, thereby, paving the way for UAPL to participate in the merger/ amalgamation process under the Scheme. Accordingly, BPDB’s construction otherwise of contractual bars operating in the circumstances is, therefore, found to be misconceived and unsubstantiated in law. This Court, accordingly, finds that the Respondent No. 5 BPDB has been unable to make out a definite case for BPDB’s prior approval of the Scheme over and beyond the judicial sanction envisaged under Section 228 and 229 of the Act.</li><li style="text-align:justify">There is also the residual range of concerns expressed by BPDB of the administration of a future contract with SPGCL with regard to power purchase rate and tax exemption issues. This Court finds that a clear understanding of the Section 229 transfer and vesting provisions allows for the tax relief pertaining to the power generation undertakings of the Transferor Companies, coupled with other assets and liabilities, to pass on to the Petitioner Transferee Company UPGDCL. For the purpose of BPDB administering its separate contractual relationship with UAPL, and possibly at a later date with SPGCL, it must be borne in mind that the Scheme of Amalgamation based on the tenets of Section 229 shall, necessarily, ensure that the incomes of each of the power generation undertakings shall stand compartmentalized and be maintained separately by the amalgamated entity. This shall enable the allocation of different tax exemptions/ benefits to respective income streams. This Court also finds that the Scheme does not blur the distinction between the separate nature of power generation activities of UAPL vis-à-vis SPGCL and UPGDCL. That is aptly in keeping with the notion that that tax reliefs as at issue in this case attach effectively to the relevant power generation undertakings pursuant to the individual and separate licenses under which each of the three entities operates. Accordingly, the nature of tax exemption is found by this Court to be dependent on the nature of power generation itself and will remain so upon the implementation of the Scheme. Contrary to what BPDB has deduced from the circumstance, this Court finds that tax exemption is dependent not on the nature or identity of the company owning the projects but rather on the process and nature of that company’s power generation activities. </li><li style="text-align:justify">There is, therefore, found no conflict, or a potential one, in tax treatment in as much as UPGDCL as the Transferee Company will continue to enjoy tax exemption for its Commercial Power Projects for a period of fifteen years and can feasibly and legally enjoy tax benefit for the Rental Power Project of UAPL only during the period of validity of the rental electricity supply Contract or any extension thereof. There is found no scope of availing of tax benefits beyond the validity of such agreement. In that regard the apprehensions of BPDB are found to be misplaced. Indeed a perusal of the Scheme reveals that the obligations and rights under each of the power supply agreements currently enjoyed or to be enjoyed by either or both of the Transferor Companies are expressly declared to be vested in UPGDCL obliging it to duly discharge such the duties vested in it under such agreements. This is encapsulated in clear terms in Section 6(b) of the Scheme as reads thus:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“All benefits and obligations under the Power Purchase Agreement dated 9<sup>th</sup> May, 2013 between SPGCL and Rural Electrification Board and the Power Purchase Agreement dated 23<sup>rd</sup> December, 2010 subsequent renewal on 16<sup>th</sup> September, 2014 being Contract No. 09783 thereafter renewal no. 09966 between UAPL and BPDB shall vest and stand transferred in favour of the Transferee Company without any further act or consent from any other party and the Transferee Company shall be obliged to discharge all obligations towards the customers of the Transferor companies including BPDB and the recipients of electricity under the relevant Power Purchase Agreement shall be obliged to pay for the same to the Transferee Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective Power Purchase Agreement.”  </em></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">This Court finds that there is nothing in Section 6(b) that detracts in any way from the legal principle of <em>nemo dat quod non habet </em>i.e. one cannot transfer what one does not have. Implicit in Section 6(b), as indeed in Section 229 of the Act, is that while transferring its undertaking UAPL shall be bringing into this Scheme only such of the tax benefit as attaches to its transferred undertaking i.e. the rental power plant. In no circumstances is it contemplated, therefore, that the tax benefits accrued and enjoyed by the rental power plant shall permeate all the undertakings of the amalgamated entity in as much as the tax exemption/ relief attach always to specific undertakings as opposed to individual entities. Importantly, and vice versa, there is no implication in the Scheme either of UPGDCL’s tax benefits at any time accruing or attaching to UAPL’s rental power generating activity during the validity period of the UAPL/BPDB Contract. </li><li style="text-align:justify">BPDB’s misgiving so addressed by the Petitioner UPDGCL, in this Court’s view, clears the way for the construction that since the businesses of SPCL and UAPL and their respective undertakings with all the rights and obligations will continue with and against the Transferee Company respectively, in the event of any default by the Rental Power Plant currently owned by UAPL, BPDB will clearly have recourse against the amalgamated entity which shall have a broader asset base to offer greater security of enforcing any remedy in the event of contractual breach. The scenario is, therefore, of BPDB being assured of greater security enuring under the Scheme to its benefit by dint of the amalgamated entity’s asset base being far stronger than that of UAPL.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It is based on the above that Mr. Alam satisfactorily submits  that allegations made in the Affidavit-in-Opposition are misplaced and misconceived and that Section 6(b) of the Scheme properly construed amply addresses BPDB’s concerns in that regard. Satisfied as this Court is of the adequacy in law of the formulation in Section 6(b) as above noted, it is nevertheless felt necessary by way of abundant caution to further enunciate the essential components of that Section in light of issues raised by BPDB in its Affidavit-in-Opposition. It is deemed necessary, therefore, for the avoidance of doubt and to dispel any misgiving about perceived inadequacies otherwise in Section 6(b) to direct that the Scheme expressly spells out that tax benefits attached to the undertakings of SPGCL and UAPL shall indeed be limited to those undertakings. In that regard, this Court directs that the Scheme would be well served by incorporation of additional provisions in keeping with the observations below:	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li>UPGDCL shall continue to discharge the obligations of UAPL under the power purchase agreement dated 23.12.2010 as subsequently renewed between the Respondent No.2 and BPDB as if there had been a novation of the agreement and BPDB shall have the same recourse against UPGDCL as it would have had against UAPL had there not been any merger of the latter company with UPGDCL. In consideration of discharging obligations in favour of BPDB under the said agreement, as subsequently renewed, UPGDCL shall be entitled to all the benefits thereunder including any right to receive consideration for the supply of electricity and benefits as if UAPL is replaced by UPGDCL;     </li><li>for avoidance of doubt, UPGDCL shall be entitled to tax benefit and customs duties under the UAPL/ BPDB power purchase agreement as renewed, and any subsequent renewal thereof, during the validity thereof, as are available under the applicable laws for rental power projects in light of the Private Sector Power Generation Policy and applicable tax legislations; and</li><li>in the event of expiry of the rental power purchase agreement and lack of renewal by BPDB, UPGDCL shall be at liberty to continue to operate the Rental Power Project as a Commercial Power Project by converting the same accordingly with the approval of BERC, and BPDB shall have no objection to such conversion of the Rental Power Project into a Commercial Power Project as long as the regulatory approval is obtained from BERC.</li></ol></li><li style="text-align:justify">It is against that backdrop of the transfer and vesting of rights, benefits and privileges as found upon by this Court, the Scheme is additionally submitted to consequentially ensure that:	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li>any legal of proceedings, claims, demands etc., pending by or against the Transferor Companies shall be continued and be enforced by or against the Transferee Company;</li><li>the employees and personnel of the Transferor Companies in service on the Effective Date shall become the employees of the Transferee Company on such date without any breach or interruption in service and on such terms and conditions that were agreed between the employees and the Transferor Companies;</li><li>the existing provident, gratuity or other employee-related funds created and administered by the Transferor Companies shall duly and expeditiously be transferred to the relevant funds of the Transferee Company;</li><li>the amalgamation shall be effective subject to all permissions, authorization, consents as may otherwise have to be obtained by any or all of the three companies under existing law; and</li><li>the Scheme shall be and deemed to have been effective on the date that a certified copy of this Judgment and Order is filed with the Respondent Registrar, Joint Stock Companies and Firms (“RJSC”).</li></ol></li><li style="text-align:justify">It shall be incumbent upon the parties to spell put further that upon the coming into the effect of the Scheme both SPGCL and UAPL shall automatically stand dissolved without further winding-up and cease to operate and their undertakings shall be amalgamated with that of the UPGDCL which shall continue to operate as a going concern in an amalgamated form and as the Amalgamated Company.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Accordingly, this Court, hereby, sanctions the Scheme of amalgamation (Annexure-‘A’) subject to the findings, observations and directions above and declares that the same shall be binding on all concerned upon a due and proper execution of the Scheme of Amalgamation inclusive of duly formulated provision on the basis of the directives above by and on behalf of all three entities at any date prior to the Effective Date as defined in the Scheme.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Furthermore, it is ordered that the merger of the Transferor and Transferee Companies shall be deemed to be effective on the date that a certified copy of this Judgment and Order, and as decided by the BODs of all three Companies, is delivered to the RJSC for registration, such filing necessarily, however, taking place within 4 (Four) weeks of receipt of a certified copy of this Judgment and Order.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Moreover, the costs, charges and expenses, including any taxes, duties etc., arising in connection with the Scheme and incidental to the completion of the amalgamation as envisaged therein, including those related to this Application, shall be borne and paid for by the Petitioner Transferee Company, UPGDCL.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the result, the Application is allowed, subject to the above observations and directions.</li><li style="text-align:justify">All three entities concerned are further directed to proceed to give effect to the Scheme of Amalgamation pursuant to this Court’s sanction of the Scheme as above upon due notification of such judicial sanction communicated to the said Companies through a Lawyer’s Certificate of today’s date.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The Petitioner No. 1 Transferee Company UPGDCL is, hereby, now directed to donate a sum totalling Tk. 3,00,000/- (Taka Three Lac) only out of which two payments of Tk. 50,000/- (Taka Fifty Thousand) will have to be made to (1) Bangladesh Supreme Court Day Care Centre, (2) Shilpa Aleaka Jame Mashjeed, Village- Charadpakhia, Thana- Muktagacha, District-Mymensingh and individual payments of donations of Tk. 25,000/- (Taka Twenty-five Thousand) each will have to be made in favour of (1) Lalit-Mohan Gono-Gronthagar, Village- Tilakpur, P.O. &amp;
