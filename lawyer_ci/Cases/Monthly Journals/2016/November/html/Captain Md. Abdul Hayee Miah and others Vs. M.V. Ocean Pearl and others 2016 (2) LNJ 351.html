Therefore this claim of the plaintiffs, subject to prove of their employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel as Master and crew members, comes under the purview of the provision of section 3(2)(h) of the Admiralty Court Act 2000. For the purpose of ascertaining as to employment of a person in a marine vessel, two documents are vital, one being (1) the Agreement for the employment with the owner of the vessel, either directly or through their agent and the other being (2) the continuous discharge certificate (CDC), so far the ‘Seaman’ not the ‘master’ is concerned.            . . .

All the plaintiffs are Bangladeshi national, who were engaged in the service of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL under the contract executed by and between the plaintiffs and the owners of the owing company of the defendant No. 1 vessel. The defendant No. 1 vessel M.V.

All the plaintiffs signed the employment contract with the owner of the defendant No. 1 vessel through their representative in Bangladesh, the defendant No. 4, Sigma Shipping Lines. The plaintiffs performed their respective duties in the defendant No. 1, vessel from the date of joining. The plaintiff Nos. 1, 5-8 are on board for nineteen months and the plaintiff Nos. 2-4 have signed off after serving nine months and all of them have not been paid salary for the period of service. The plaintiffs and their family members have been living in miserable condition for long, due to monetary constraint. The plaintiffs sent repeated reminders to the owner and the agent of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL, but they did not pay any heed to it and did not pay the outstanding salaries as per the contract of the plaintiffs. Hence the Suit.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The total claim of the plaintiffs against the defendants, up to 30.4.2012, were narrated in paragraph No. 6 of the plaint with a grand total of US$ 180903.00 which was later amended, on 13.2.2013, enhancing the same to the total claim up to 31.1.2013, to a grand total of US$ 403088.00 equivalent to BD Tk. 3,30,53,216.00 @ taka 82 per US$.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Subsequently the plaintiffs again amended the plaint on 23.10.2014, whereupon the paragraph No. 6 was deleted and the new facts as to the enhanced claim of the plaintiffs have been incorporated to the extent that the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL while discharging its 12,200 MTs. of Fertilizer at the port of Chittagong, suddenly run aground on 8.10.2010 and to avoid a total loss of the said cargo, the said vessel was beached on 14.10.2010 near Patenga, Chittagong Port and the Indian origin master and crew members of the said vessel abandoned the vessel, keeping the vessel in a distressed condition.

OCEAN PEARL in order to keep it in safe condition and to protect the vessel from pilferage and looting by the pirates and local hoodlums at the outer anchorage of Chittagong Port.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It has been further stated that the plaintiffs, being the crew members of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL, had salvaged, during the period 23.2.2011 to July 2011, a total of 1906 M.Ts. cargo from the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V.

OCEAN PEARL was severely damaged resulting in its split up in almost two parts, due to the devastating cyclonic storm and tidal boar, which occurred on 12.6.2011. Thereafter, the owner of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL, with a view to settle the employment of the plaintiffs, requested the master to send the portage bill up to 14<sup>th</sup> of June, 2011, showing signed off and serving seaman, so as to enable the owner of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL to settle the outstanding salary and wages and dues of the plaintiffs till 14<sup>th</sup> June, 2011 and as such the plaintiffs were accordingly shown in the portage bill up to 14<sup>th</sup> June, 2011. But thereafter the plaintiffs were neither paid the outstanding wages, as per the said portage bill of June 2011, nor they were arranged for officially signing off till the dates as mentioned in the Schedule of Claim, as evidenced by their respective CDC. As per the terms of contract of their respective services, the plaintiffs were to be paid their respective monthly wages and all other dues after all necessary deduction therefrom as per the monthly portage bill, prepared and maintained by the concerned official of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL in the normal course of the affairs. The plaintiffs are entitled in law and equity to claim and recover their monthly outstanding wages and other dues till the date they have signed off from their respective services and the principle defendants are jointly and severely liable in law and equity to pay the same. A total sum of US$ 6,17,118.00 equivalent to Bd. Tk. 5,12,20,794.00 become due to the plaintiffs as their accumulated outstanding wages and other dues from the principle defendants for their services rendered as seamen on board the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V.

The plaintiff No. 1 is entitled to a total amount of Tk. 2,97,48,196.00 equivalent to US$ 358412.00; the plaintiff No. 2 is entitled to a total amount of Tk. 40,48,325.00, equivalent to US$ 48775.00; the plaintiff No. 3 is entitled to a total amount of Tk. 75,95,662.00, equivalent to US$ 91514.00;  the plaintiff No. 4 is entitled to a total amount of Tk. 29,92,482.00 equivalent to US$ 36054.00.

But although the plaintiffs repeatedly requested the defendants to settle the outstanding dues of the plaintiffs, but till date the defendants have not settled the legitimate claim of the plaintiffs and it is apparent that the defendants are acting in negligence and unwilling to settle the legitimate claim of the plaintiffs for which the plaintiffs were constrained to file the instant suit.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It has been further stated that the plaintiff No. 1, the Bangladeshi Master of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL always worried for the safety of life of his crews and watchmen, who are guarding the vessel against pirates and robbers, as the vessel is in distressed condition. If the Master would abandoned the vessel for the safety of their life, the vessel would have been looted by pirates and robbers by cutting the valuable steel plates of the vessel, by which the environmental pollution may take place.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff Nos. 2-4 are entitled to get their continuation of salary as they were not paid their balance as per maritime law during verbal signing off, which is not acted upon in the eye of law. The claim made by the plaintiffs in the instant suit is enforceable under the Admiralty Court Act 2000, since the cause of action of the suit arose lastly on 26.4.2012 and 27.4.2012 when the defendants have failed to abide by their commitment to make payment of the salary of the plaintiffs within due time.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff Nos. 2-8 have executed a power of attorney giving authority to the plaintiff No. 1 to sign the plaint verification and swearing affidavit for any application in connection with the instant Admiralty Suit.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>         Prayer of the plaintiffs.</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Although the other paragraphs of the plaint has been amended but the paragraph No. 12 contained the earlier claim of US$ 1,80,903.00 equivalent to Tk. 1,50,14,949.00 inadvertently.

Tk. 5,12,20,794.00 against the principle defendants jointly and severally and in favour of the plaintiffs jointly and severally, to be distributed among the plaintiffs in the manner of their respective claim amount, as mentioned in the Schedule of plaint.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>         Step taken by the defendants.</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Although the suit has been filed against the principle defendant Nos. 1-4 and the said defendants appeared through the learned Advocate Mr. Muhammad Ohiullah and others, through the warrant of attorney dated 18<sup>th</sup> July, 2012, signed by Sheikh Md.

OCEAN PEARL during the tenure from the year 2010 up to the whole year 2013, as an when the plaintiffs were employed in the vessel and signed off from the employment. But as the defendants, being the owner of the vessel, have failed to pay the salary and other benefits to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs were constrained to institute the instant suit, in order to realize the legitimate dues of the plaintiffs.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Abdul Khaleque next argued that during the pendency of the suit the defendant No. 4 entered appearance and did not deny the legitimate claim of the plaintiffs and upon an order passed by this court, paid the partial lodging and fooding expenses of the plaintiffs, at the rate of Tk. 1,40,000.00 per month, up to July, 2013. But thereafter the defendants stopped paying even the fooding and lodging expenses which thrown the plaintiffs into financial distress condition till they have signed off from the employment of the defendants.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Abdul Khaleque next argued that actually the plaintiffs were employed by the defendants by way of written employment contract on different date and at that time, the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL was abandoned by the Indian origin crew members as the vessel was aground near the Chittagong Port with the cargo of the BCIC and the same was at distressed condition due to not only it’s aground condition, but also against the threatening of being looted by the pirates and other local hoodlums and looters who were roaming around the Chittagong Port hunting prey. The plaintiff upon getting their employment by the defendants, boarded the vessel and served in it in a very distressed condition, in order to save the vessel not only from its distressed condition but also from looting by the pirates. Moreover, the plaintiffs have salvaged the cargo for which the cargo claimant BCIC got the cargo due to the salvage operation operated by the plaintiff at their risks of life.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Abdul Khaleque drawn the attention of this court to the fact that the plaintiffs employment in the vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL have been started by way of employment contract, executed by the defendant No. 4 as the local agent of the defendant Nos. 1,2 and 3 and there being urgency to man the vessel by new crews, as the earlier Indian origin crew members left the vessel leaving it in distressed condition, the plaintiffs were hurriedly pushed to board the vessel by the employer, without observing the required legal formalities i.e. to endorse their employment in their service identity book, excepting few of the plaintiffs. The said failure on the part of the plaintiffs not being their willful act and being a technical question, is not required to be taken into notice by this court seriously, since the defendants have admitted the employment of the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs have served the vessel during the full tenure with their all ability against every risk and opposition not only from the circumstances, but also from the weather and environment, which will reveal from the e-mails that have been exchanged in between the Master and the owner of the vessel, which have been exhibited in this suit, being exhibit No. 18 (series) and exhibit No. 20 and also from the letter exhibit No.-22 and all other documents that have been exhibited in this suit.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Abdul Kahleque next argued that the plaintiffs claim have been admitted by the defendants, since the defendant No. 4 entered appearance in this suit and filed the written objection against the prayer for auction sell of the vessel, whereupon the defendants pay the lodging and fooding charge to the plaintiffs, pursuant to the order passed by this court and therefore the service tenure of the plaintiffs not being denied by the defendants, the plaintiffs are entitled to the decree as prayed for.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Abdul Khaleque finally argued that on the instance of the plaintiffs the vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL was sold on auction and the same was purchased by local party who took the possession of the vessel long back. Because of the service rendered by the plaintiffs, during their service tenure, by protecting the same from all environmental condition, the plaintiffs are required to be paid by way of decree of this court else, the plaintiffs will faced with an in justice that they are not being paid of their legitimate salary, wages and other dues.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Deliberation of the Court.</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">This court has heard the evidence adduced by the witnesses and also heard the learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Abdul Khaleque appearing on behalf of the plaintiffs.

Therefore this claim of the plaintiffs, subject to prove of their employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel as Master and crew members, comes under the purview of the provision of section 3(2)(h) of the Admiralty court Act 2000. Accordingly this court finds that the instant suit is maintainable in its present form and manner. Therefore the issue No. 1 is resolved in favour of the plaintiff’s.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Issue No. 2, 3 and 4.</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">All these issues are interlinked and as such those are taken together for disposal for the sake of brevity and convenience. </li><li style="text-align:justify">This suit although heard <em>exparte, </em>since the defendant No. 4, upon entering into the suit filed written objection against the sell of the vessel, did not further appear and contest the suit, nevertheless the plaintiffs have to prove their own case in order to obtain a decree in this suit in respect of their (1) date of appointment (2) discharging duty on board the vessel, (3) non-payment of salary &amp; wages, (4) actual date of their signing off and (5) amount of unpaid salary &amp; wages and their entitlement to reward for salvage etc.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Prior to entering into the factual aspect as to the employment of the plaintiff in the defendant No. 1 vessel, an appraisal is required to be made as to the law regarding employment of persons in the marine vessel which is governed by the provision of Bangladesh Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1983, since admittedly the plaintiffs were employed to a vessel which was stationed within the territorial water of Bangladesh, albeit the same was a vessel not of Bangladesh Registration but of alien country i.e. the Federation of St. Kittisd and Neves of the Caribbean.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff No. 1 Captain Md. Abdul Hyee Mia is a ‘master by profession’ and employed as such in the defendant No. 1 vessel. Being a master, the plaintiff No. 1 has special status in the marine employment, since he does not come within the purview of the definition of ‘seaman’. The provision of section 2(45) of the Provision of Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1983 made all the person employed in a vessel to discharge marine job as ‘Seaman’ excepting the ‘master’, ‘pilot’, apprentice employed in the vessel. Section 89 of the Bangladesh Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1983 requires that any person employed or engaged in any job on board a ship must conclude an employment agreement and that all ‘Seaman’ upon such employment will be issued with a document known as “Continuous Discharge Certificate” (CDC) by the Shipping Master, appointed under section 8 of the said act by the government. The provision of sub section (2) of section 8 of the said Act further requires that the details of the service of a seaman be recorded in the CDC book from time to time specially the discharge of the seaman, as requires under the provision of section 131. Such recording of discharge has to be made by the master of the vessel but discharge must be effected in ‘presence’ of the ‘Shipping Master’ of the port.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Therefore it appears that for the purpose of ascertaining as to employment of a person in a marine vessel, two documents are vital, one being (1) the Agreement for the employment with the owner of the vessel, either directly or through their agent and the other being (2) the continuous discharge certificate (CDC), so far the ‘Seaman’ not the ‘master’ is concerned.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It further appears from section 89 of the Bangladesh Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1983 that in lieu of CDC book any similar document may be issued by the Shipping Master to the seaman and further the ‘provision of section 106 of the said acts provides for holding by every seaman’s identity card issued by the government with prescribed particulars to be noted in it. These documents shall prove the lawful employment and discharge of seaman in a marine vessel and through which a liability will be imposed upon the owner of the vessel to pay the wages.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the light of the aforesaid legal position, we will now examine the claim of the plaintiff in the instant suit as to their employment and entitlements of wages and other monetary benefits. </li><li style="text-align:justify">The claim of the plaintiffs are for the realization of salary, wages  and other monetary claim due to them, as they have been employed in the vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL. The circumstances under which the plaintiff were employed in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL have been stated by the P.Ws that while at the Chittagong port, the defendant No. 1 vessel became aground and failing to release the vessel from the aground position, the then master and crew members of the defendant vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL, who were of Indian origin, left and abandoned the vessel in distressed condition. Thereafter, the defendant No. 4, Sigma Shipping Lines, being the local agent of the owner of the vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL and authorized to appoint Master and crew members appointed the plaintiffs on different dates in the employments of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL in different capacity, in its distressed condition. The plaintiffs executed employment agreements with the owner of the vessel through the agent and boarded the vessel from their respective date of employment agreement and served the vessel.</li><li style="text-align:justify">This assertions have not only been well proved by the corroborative evidence/documents filed by the P.Ws as mark exhibit 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 17 which were the employment contract but also admitted in the written objection filed by the defendant No. 4 in the instant suit. Although the relevant portion of the written objection was not made exhibit, yet that being the courts document, there is no legal impediment to consider the same for relying upon any admission of the defendant No. 4.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It has been asserted in the plaint and also the PW’s claimed, that the plaintiffs have received the fooding and lodging expenses during the pendency of the instant suit for the period from 1.7.2012 upto 31.07.2012 from the defendant No. 4 on behalf of the owner of the vessel, who paid the said fooding and lodging charge to the plaintiffs at the rate of Tk. 1,40,000.00 per month, as ordered by this court.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Upon perusing the record it appears that the said factual aspect is correct, as appears from the order of this court, dated 5.8.2012 and it further appears from the order dated 5.8.2012 that this court directed the defendant No. 4 to pay Tk. 1,40,000.00 as food and lodging charge for the month of August 2012. Thereafter this court again directed, through the order dated 13.2.2013, defendant No. 4 to pay Tk. 1,40,000.00 per month to the plaintiff till their actual sign off from the employment. These orders were complied off duly by the defendant No. 4 as admitted by the P.W., which indicate that unless the plaintiff’s were in the employment under the owner of the defendant No. 1 vessel, the agent of the owner of the vessel, the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Line would not have pay the fooding and lodging charge. Therefore the service of the plaintiff’s in the defendant No. 1 vessel has been well proved and established. </li><li style="text-align:justify">The PWs have stated that they have been employed in the defendant No. 1 vessel but at no point of time the plaintiffs received their salary and upon several request the defendants failed to pay the salary and wages to the plaintiffs, for which the plaintiffs are constrained to institute the instant Admiralty Suit in order to realize their legitimate claim of wages and salary along with other monetary claim.</li><li style="text-align:justify">This assertion has compelled the plaintiffs to prove their tenure of employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel, especially the date of joining and the date of signing off from their employment, by way of cogent evidence, since the statement made in the written objection as aforesaid, filed by the defendant No. 4, not being evidence, cannot be taken into consideration for the purpose of proving such facts.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It appears that the plaintiffs have submitted photocopies of their all documents relating to their appointment and discharge at the time of filling the suit on 9.5.2012 and later submitted the same documents at the time of deposition adduced by the PW 1 SK. Rafiqul Islam and marked the same as exhibit. But there appears serious discrepancies in this two sets of documents as to the endorsement and attestation of the appointment and discharge from the employment, which cannot be overlooked by this court. Moreover the PW. 1, exhibited the photocopies of the employment contracts of the plaintiffs, which have been marked as exhibit Nos. 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 17. These exhibits being the secondary evidence, the filling PW was liable to explain as to his inability to exhibit the original copy of the documents. But the PW 1 who exhibited these documents did not state anything about the status of the original copies of the employment contracts, although those original copies of the employment contracts must be with the plaintiffs at all point of time.  However this lacuna of non-explaining the reason making the photocopies as exhibit may be leniently viewed in view of the fact that the appointment of the plaintiff have been admitted by the defendant No. 4.</li><li style="text-align:justify">But the mischievous Act done with the exhibited photocopies cannot be ignored these photocopies were attested through seal and signature of the Master of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL, the plaintiff No. 1, Captain Md. Abdul Hayee Miah, which has been claimed as true attestation of the said documents in order to file the same in the court to be marked as exhibit in order to prove their employment in the vessel through the said photocopies. But such attestation for some of the plaintiffs, were made not on the original but on the photocopies even much later than the filing of the suit which has been revealed from the meticulous examination of the sets of photocopies filed at the time of filing the suits and the same photocopies made exhibit.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Be that as it may, upon meticulous examinations of these photocopy exhibits, it appears that the plaintiff No. 1 Captain Md. Abdul Hayee Miah was genuinely initially employed on 2.11.2010 in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL as Master of the vessel by the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Lines, on behalf of its foreign principle M/S. Prayati Shipping (Pvt.) Limited, the defendant No. 3. Later, by another independent employment contract dated 28<sup>th</sup> February, 2011 the plaintiff No. 1 Captain Md. Abdul Hayee Miah was re-employed in the service of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL as Master of the vessel. In support of the claim such employment of the plaintiff No. 1 as Master of the vessel, the photocopies of the Continuous Discharge Certificate (CDC), being No. C/0/0239 has been filed at the time of filing of the suit on 9.5.2015, but the same did not contain the endorsement of the employment in defendant No. 1 vessel verified by the Govt. Shipping Master at Chittagong, although the said CDC book was issued on 18.04.2012 to be valid up to 17.4.2017, wherein all the previous entries in the earlier CDC book were entered and verified by the Govt. Shipping Master at Chittagong. Such issuance and endorsement of the CDC Book to the master of a vessel although not a requirement of section 89 of the Bangladesh Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1983, yet the masters of the vessel as a practice obtains CDC book in their name. This revealed the fact that the appointment in the employment and discharge of the plaintiff No. 1, captain Abdul Hyee Mia was not endorsed in the CDC Book at the or just after his employment, rather during the pendency of the instant suit. This although indicates that the plaintiff No. 1 had joined the defendant No. 1 vessel on urgent and emergency basis when the Indian origin master and the crew members abandoned and left the vessel, compelling the plaintiff No. 1 to join the duty leaving aside his liability to attend the government shipping office at Chittagong for endorsement in the CDC Book nevertheless such failure shall not make him liable to face the consequence.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Further it appears from the CDC Book, exhibit 5, that the plaintiff No. 1 procured the said CDC Book, being No. 07105, anew on 18.4.2012 when he was unemployed, having left his last job as Master in MV. B Gourab (Banglar Gourab) on 6.10.2010. Later when the photocopy of the said CDC Book has been made exhibit, as exhibit No. 5, the same contained a new page wherefrom it appears that the employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL has been endorsed by the common seal of the Government shipping office at Chittagong. Moreover, the said Continuous Discharge Certificate (CDC) also contained the endorsement that the Master of the vessel, the plaintiff No. 1 was discharged on 30.09.2012 and the same was endorsed by the signature of the shipping master on 30.9.2013. Therefore, the employment of the Master, the plaintiff No. 1 in the defendant No. 1 vessel is required to be taken to have come to an end on and from 30.09.2012 and not from 30.09.2013. Accordingly the only outcome comes from the scenario that, this court finds that the plaintiff No. 1 was employed in the defendant No. 1 vessel as Master and served the vessel for the tenure commencing from 2.11.2010 upto the period 30.09.2012 for which he was entitled to salary and wages as per the employment contract for these total 330 days i.e. about 11 months. </li><li style="text-align:justify">It has been further asserted and claimed by the P.W. 1 Sk. Rafiqul Islam that he himself being the plaintiff No. 2 was employed through the employment contract dated 28. 10. 2010 as second officer in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL by the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Lines, on behalf of its foreign principle, the defendant No. 5 M/S. Prayati Shipping Lines (Pvt.) Limited and he signed off from the service on 21.07.2012. In order to prove this factual aspect the P.W. 1, on behalf of plaintiff No. 2, exhibited the photocopies of his Continuous Discharge Certificate (CDC), issued by the Shipping master in his name, since he is seaman, wherefrom it appears that the Government Shipping Master at Chittagong endorsed the employment of the defendant No. 2 in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL on an from the date 28.10.2010 and therefore the plaintiff No. 2 successfully proved his engagement in employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel on and from 28.10.2010.</li><li style="text-align:justify">But the Column for discharge of the plaintiff No. 2 from the said employment although has been written as 21.7.2012, but the same has been endorsed not on the original copy of the CDC book but on the photocopy of the same. The said endorsement was made by the master of the defendant No. 1 vessel, the plaintiff No. 1 Mr. Md. Abdul Hayee Miah, pursuant to the provision of section 131 of the Bangladesh Shipping Merchant Ordinance 1983, but not on the original CDC book, but on the photocopy of the 2<sup>nd</sup> sets of photocopies filed for the purpose of making the same exhibit. The said photocopy has been marked as exhibit No. 7. Therefore it appears that the plaintiff No. 2 failed to prove the date of his actual sign off from of the service and accordingly the same is required to be ascertained from other exhibited document.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff No. 3, Karimul Hoq claimed that he was employed through exhibit No. 8 dated 21.10.2010 as 2/E (2<sup>nd</sup> Engineer) in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL and he has also exhibited the photocopy of the ‘Sea Farers Identity documents’ (SFI), exhibit No. 9, wherefrom it appears that the plaintiff No. 3 was previously employed in the defendant No. 1 vessel on 21.05.2010 and quitted the job on 03.09.2010 which was duly endorsed in the original copy of the document by the earlier master of the vessel. Thereafter the plaintiff No. 3 again joined the defendant No. 1 vessel on 21.10.2010, wherein the date of his new joining in the employment of the defendant No. 1 vessel was endorsed as 21.10.2010 and the date of quitting the job was endorsed as 14.6.2011. But, although the endorsement of joining the new employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel was made in the original SFI document, as appears from the photocopy, but the endorsement for the quitting the said job in the defendant No. 1 vessel has been made by the Master of the vessel i.e, plaintiff No. 1, not on the original, SFI document but on the photocopy of the same, the 2<sup>nd</sup> set filed for the purpose of making the same exhibit. Therefore it appears that this plaintiff No. 3 also failed to prove his date of sign off from the employment.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The exhibit No. 10 is the photocopy of the employment contract of the plaintiff No. 4, Md. Kamal Uddin, which shows that the plaintiff No. 4 was employed in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL on 1.11.2010 as an Electrician by the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Lines on behalf of the principal defendant No. 3, the owner of the defendant No. 1 vessel, who later as P.W. also exhibited the photocopy of the ‘Sea Farers Identity documents’ (SFI) standing in his name, wherein the date of joining has been endorsed as 1.11.2010 and the date of quitting the job also endorsed as 14.6.2011. But although the date of joining was endorsed in the original copy of the SFI document, but the endorsement as to the quitting the job was made by the plaintiff No. 1 as the Master of the vessel, not on the original document, but on the photocopy, which has been made exhibit No. 10. Therefore it appears that this plaintiff No. 4 has failed to prove his tenure of service.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Exhibit No. 12 being photocopy of the employment contract, shows that the plaintiff No. 5, Shah Makhlisur Rahman was employed on 26. 10. 2010 in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL by the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Lines Limited on behalf of the foreign principle M/S. Prayati Shipping (Pvt.) Limited, the defendant No. 3, who has also exhibited the photocopies of ‘Sea Farers Identity document (SFI) being exhibit No. 13, which does not shows any endorsement as to his employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL or his quitting the employment at any point of time. Therefore the plaintiff no. 5 also failed to prove his appointment in the employment at any point of time or his tenure of service in the defendant No. 1 vessel.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff No. 6 Mohsin Mollah claimed that he was employed in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL by the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Lines on behalf of its principle M/S. Prayati Shipping Lines (Pvt.) Limited the defendant No. 3 on 24.10. 2010 as a GP, who has only exhibited the photo copy of his employment contract as exhibit No. 14, but he did not exhibit ‘sea fareres Identity document or any such document, to show his joining the employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel and the date of his quitting the employment. Therefore this plaintiff No. 6 also failed to have proved his tenure of service in the defendant No. 1 vessel.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff No. 7 Md. Ali Osman also claimed that he was employed in the defendant No. 1 vessel on 16.12.2010, through the employment contract, by the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Lines on behalf of the owner of the defendant No. 1 vessel, the defendant No. 03, photocopy of which has been exhibited as exhibit No. 15. This plaintiff although exhibited the photocopy of ‘Sea Fares identity documents’ (SFI) as exhibit No. 16, but the endorsement made in the Column of date of joining and date of quitting the job contained the endorsement as made on16.12.2010 and 30.9.2013 respectively, which having been made by the plaintiff No. 1 as Master of the vessel, not on the original document but on the photocopy, as exhibited herein. More over a further endorsement in exhibit 16 shows that the validity of the said document expired on 14.12.2011. Therefore this plaintiff No. 7 also failed to prove his employment and service tenure in the defendant No. 1 vessel.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff No. 8 Shamsuddin made his employment contract as exhibit No. 17, which has been allegedly executed by the defendant No. 4 Sigma Shipping Lines on behalf of his foreign principle M/S. Prayati Shipping (Pvt.) Limited, defendant No. 03, which shows that the plaintiff No. 8 was employed as M-Man in the defendant No. 1 vessel. But neither any CDC or ‘Sea Farers identity documents’ (SFI) nor any other documents showing his date of joining and the quitting the job in defendant No. 1 vessel have been submitted or exhibited by the plaintiff No. 8. Therefore the alleged employment and the service tenure of this plaintiff No. 8 in the defendant No. 1 vessel has not been proved.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The employment of any Bangladeshi Seaman in any ship or vessel, either Bangladeshi or foreign, is regulated by the provision of Bangladesh Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1983. The persons employed as such are known as ‘Sea man’ which has been defined in section 2(45) of the said ordinance which excluded the ‘Master’ of the vessel.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The employment of the seamen in a foreign vessel within Bangladesh is regulated by the provision Chapter 10 of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1983 and the provision of section 107 of the said ordinance deals with the matter of documents regarding the employment of seaman, which reads as follows;</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1983</em></strong><br/><strong><em>Section 107(1)</em></strong><em>.<strong> Seaman to be in possession of Continuous Discharge Certificate.</strong>- (1) No person shall engage any Bangladesh seaman at any port or place in Bangladesh, nor carry to sea from any such port or place any such seaman in any ship, except a coasting ship of less than two hundred tons gross so long as such coasting ship is employed on voyages confined to ports or places within Bangladesh, unless the seamen is in possession of a Continuous Discharge Certificate issued in Bangladesh by a Shipping Master in a form approved by the Director-General of Shipping or such other document as may be prescribed, </em><br/><em>(2) if a person engages or carries to see any seaman in contravention of sub-section (1), he shall, for each offence, be punishable with fine which may extend to ten thousand Taka.</em></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The simple meaning of the aforesaid provision is that no person shall be employed or engaged on board a ship, unless the seamen be issued with a ‘Continuous discharge certificate’ (CDC) book or other similar document by the Government Shipping Master for recording details of his service. The sub section (2) of the said section further provides that if any person engages any sea man in any vessel without the seaman having in possession of identity document, he shall be liable to punishment.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The provision of section 131 of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1983 deals with the issue of entries to be made in ‘continuous discharge certificate’ when the seaman is discharged from the job. The provision of the said section runs as follows;</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1983</em></strong><br/><strong><em>         Section 131.Entries to be made in Continuous Discharge Certificate and return of Certificates of Competency to officers on discharge.-</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify"><em>If a seaman is discharged from a ship in Bangladesh, either on his discharge or on payment of his wages, the master shall enter in the Continuous Discharge Certificate of the seaman, under his signature particulars specifying the period of the seaman’s service and the date and place of this discharge.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>The master shall, upon the discharge of every Certificated Officer whose Certificate of Competency has been delivered to and retained by him, return the certificate to the officer.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>If a master acts in contravention of sub section (1), or fails, without reasonable cause, to return the Certificate of Competency to the officer concerned as required by sub-section (2), he shall, for each offence, be punishable with fine which may, in the former case, extend to one thousand taka and in the latter to five hundred Taka. </em></li></ol><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The aforesaid provision mandates that the discharge of the seaman from the service has to be endorsed in the Continuous Discharge Certificate book by the ‘Master of the vessel’ in order to make the discharge from the job a lawful one.</li><li style="text-align:justify">From the aforesaid provisions its appears that every Bangladesh seaman is liable to hold a ‘continuous discharge certificate’ (CDC) book issued by the Government shipping master in the prescribed format, wherein their engagement in any employment in any vessel and his discharge from such vessel must be endorsed by the Master of the vessel. The authority known as ‘Shipping Master’ is engaged by the government under the provision of section 8 of the Bangladesh merchant shipping ordinance 1983.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the instant case it appears that only the plaintiff No. 1 has been able to prove that his employment has been properly endorsed in the CDC book and although the plaintiff No. 2 proved his endorsement as to the date of joining in the service as has been properly endorsed, but his quitting the employment has not been properly endorsed in his CDC book, meaning thereby that the plaintiff No. 2 failed to prove his date of singing off from the employment.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the case of other plaintiffs the original ‘Sea Farers identity documents’ did not contain the endorsement as required by law, rather the plaintiff No. 1 unlawfully incorporate the same in the photocopy, in order to enable them to claim so called salary and wages for certain fictitious period in the instant suit.</li><li style="text-align:justify">These admitted unscrupulous acts have been attempted to be justified by the learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Abdul Khaleque that the vessel being in distressed condition and the situation was a urgent one, the employer Sigma Shipping Lines Limited hurriedly employed and placed the plaintiff on board the vessel, without having endorsed the employment in the CDC book or in the Sea Farers Identity documents, which is nothing but a lacuna not tentamounts to forgery and accordingly the same may be taken through lenient view.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In order to consider this submission we have meticulously examined the entire record of this suit wherefrom it appears that the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL was aground and the same was ultimately sold by this court at the instance of the plaintiffs in the said aground condition. It has been asserted that the Indian origin Master and the crew members of the said vessel left the vessel in distressed condition, whereupon in order to save the vessel, the owners were required to immediately manned the vessel by any means. This factual situation of the defendant No. 1 vessel has been established by different documents available in the record, especially from the report of the Marshal, who sold the vessel under the order of this court, in it’s aground position. Therefore this court finds that the defendant No. 4 actually hurriedly employed the plaintiffs in the defendant No. 1, vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL and the plaintiffs practically boarded the vessel in an urgent situation when the vessel was in distressed condition.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In this respect the content of the exhibit No. 18, may be taken into consideration, which reveals that the plaintiff could prove the distressed condition of the vessel at the relevant period, since the captain of the vessel, the plaintiff No. 1, sent the e-mail, exhibit No. 18, to one Mr. Biswash/Mr. Atul Jain wherein he has stated the following state of the vessel;</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">From: md miah <a href="mailto:capthai_1971@yahoo.com">capthai_1971@yahoo.com</a><br/>Date: Wed, 29 Feb 2012 19:13:53-0800(PST)<br/>To: &lt;biswas @marineindia.net&gt;<br/>Cc: &lt;attaritd @gmail.com&gt;<br/>Subject: 010312 payment of master and crew salary.<br/>Ka: Mr. biswas/Mr. Atul Jain.<br/>Fm: Master mv.

Former staff in normal conditions from 14/09/10 to 8/10/10 discharged only 3473.45 mtns of cargo including hiring floating crane where spent about usd 100000/= for floating crane. Present master after joining, he managed to discharge 1906 mtns of cargo whose price is about usd 600000/= in distress conditions with great risk of mine and my crew. This is due to my courageous activities, we arranged to discharge without using any floating crane in distress conditions. We managed to save owner usd 600000/- from discharge of 1906 mtns of cargo where nobody should have any doubt. June, 2011 vessel was broken into two pieces due to uneven stress for which we could not discharge any more cargo. </em><br/><em>At present vessel has becom</em>e <em>wreck. It is very easy to take this wreck by port because as per maritime law it is in favour of port. Port can take verdict from Admiralty court after only one day work of admiralty court as maritime law is in favour of port. In this situations you may loss your ownership.

So you cannot deny that due to my activities you have saved used 600000/= in addition to valuable wreck from where still you can get good money from the sell of wreck. I am working for the interest of owner and  owner should look after me and my crew where owner should pay our salary.

Ocean pearl.</em></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">From the aforementioned very circumstances of the defendant No. 1 vessel, M.V. OCEAN PEARL, this court is inclined to believe that the plaintiff’s employment were made hurriedly in the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL by the defendant No. 4 upon which the plaintiffs boarded the vessel from their respective dates of their employment and as such it may be taken that the plaintiffs could prove their employment in the defendant No. 1 vessel to have been commenced from the date as mentioned in their employment contract being exhibit Nos. 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 17.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Now the question comes as to how this court should ascertain the tenure of service of the plaintiffs in the distressed defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL, when their joining the duty on board the vessel was proved?</li><li style="text-align:justify">In order to meet the ends of justice this court has to ascertain such date by any lawful means and accordingly has to travel through the other exhibits as has been made by the plaintiff Nos. 2-8 to find actual date of signing off of these plaintiffs.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff No. 1, by the documentary evidence, y proved that he has signed off from the job on 30.09.2012 as was endorsed by the Shipping Master in his CDC book on 30.9.2013. Therefore, the tenure of employment of the plaintiff No. 1 in the defendant No. 1 vessel as a Master of the vessel has been proved as from the date of 2.11.2010 up to 30.9.2012. All the plaintiff in corroborative manner proved the fact that the plaintiff No. 1 is now suffering from paralysis and as such completing bed ridden, for which the plaintiff No. 1 could not depose before this court, although he held a Power of Attorney on behalf of the other plaintiffs. Later, all the plaintiffs including the plaintiff No. 1 executed a Power of Attorney in favour of the plaintiff No. 2 S.K. Rafiqul Alam to depose in the instant suit. Accordingly the plaintiff No. 2 gave evidence in the instant suit, not only on his behalf, but also on behalf of other plaintiff’s, including the plaintiff No. 1, the testimony of which has been further corroborated by other plaintiffs, who also deposed as Pw’s.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It appears that the plaintiff No. 1 being the Master of the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL was liable under the provision of section 141 of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1983 to deliver an account of the wages and salary of the crew members and upon collecting the same from the owners of the vessel to disburse the same among the seamen’s under him. In such order to collect the seamen’s wages and salary, the provision of section 141 of the merchant shipping ordinance 1983 requires the Master of the defendant No. 1 vessel to prepare a role i.e. portage bill of the seaman under him and one copy of the said role is to be submitted <em>inter alia</em>, to the shipping office at Chittagong, since the vessel was at Chittagong. Although the P.W. 1, submitted 17 copies of such portage Bill, starting from the month of November 2010, up to February 2012, which were marked as Exhibit No. 24 (series), but nowhere of these copies contain any mark that the copy of the same were also submitted to the shipping office, Chittagong.</li><li style="text-align:justify">However, from the content of exhibit No. 24 (series) seventeen pages, it appears that the Master of the vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL, the plaintiff No. 1 captain Md. Abdul Hayee Mia prepared and submitted the seaman’s role and portage bill to the owner of the vessel through the defendant No. 4, from the month of November, 2010, wherefrom the exhibit No. 24(1), which is the seaman’s role for the month of November 2010, shows that there was as many as 16 (sixteen) Seaman working on board the defendant No. 1, vessel out of which 5 (five) Seaman were shown as signed off on different dates including the plaintiff No. 5 Shah Makhlisur Rahman, who has been mentioned as signed off on an from 20.11.2010. Similarly the plaintiff No. 6 Mohsin Mollah was shown as has been signed off on 20.11.2010. The sea man’s role and portage bill for the total month of June, 2011, made in two part, Exhibit No. 24(7) and 24(8) show that all the 10 Seaman of the vessel signed off on 14.06.2011, which also erroneously included, the name of earlier signed off Seaman the plaintiff No. 5, Shah Makhlesur Rahman and plaintiff No. 6 Mohsin Mollah as signing off from 14.06.2011. This exhibit No. 24(1), 24(7) and 24(8) appear to be issued in regular manner and therefore reliance may be imposed upon it for the purpose of ascertaining the correct date of signing off the plaintiff Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Therefore, it appears that this plaintiff Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 served the defendant No. 1 vessel M.V. OCEAN PEARL till they signed off on the respective dates, as mentioned in the said portage bills, being exhibit No. 24(1) and 24(7) and 24(8) and during that period these plaintiffs were not paid the following amount shown against their name therein up to point of time, in respect of the due salary and wages which are shown in the following table.</li></ol><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td style="width:109px"><strong>plaintiff name</strong></td><td style="width:84px"><strong>sign off date</strong></td><td style="width:89px"><strong>Due upto sign US$</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="width:109px">Sk.
