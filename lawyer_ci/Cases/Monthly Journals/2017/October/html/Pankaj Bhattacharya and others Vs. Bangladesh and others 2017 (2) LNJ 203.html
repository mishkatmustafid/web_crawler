During the War of Liberation 1971, he was a member of the Central Committee of the National Awami Party (NAP). After the Independence of Bangladesh, the petitioner No.1 was elected as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the NAP. At present, he is the President, Central Committee of the United National Awami Party. From his student life, the petitioner No.1 took an active role in the student movement of the 1960’s against the Marshal-Law-Regime of Ayub Khan. At that time he was the Executive President of the then East Pakistan Students’ Union, after the independence of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Students’ Union (BSU). For his leading role in the student movements and also in the mass movements, he was imprisoned in jail on several occasions by the then Pakistani Autocratic Regime. From the 1st March 1971, when General Yahia Khan, the then President and Chief Marshal-law-Administrator of Pakistan postponed the Session of the National Assembly <em>sine die</em>, the petitioner No.1 and other leaders of the NAP, the Communist Party of the then East Pakistan, after the independence of Bangladesh, the Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) and the BSU had been taking preparation for armed resistance against the Pakistani Army and for formation of armed forces for the liberation struggle. On the 26<sup>th</sup> March 1971, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman formally declared the Independence of Bangladesh and called upon the peoples of Bangladesh to resist the occupied Pakistani Army through armed struggle and to liberate Bangladesh. </span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">5.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">            </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">The history of our liberation has been a history of prolonged struggles of the people of Bangladesh to achieve the right of their emancipation since before and after the establishment of Pakistan, which culminated into a bloody War of Liberation in 1971. NAP, CPB and BSU had also glorious and  sacrificing history of struggles in the then Pakistan to establish democracy, including right of adult franchise, freedom of press, speech, and formation of organization, and also for economic liberty of the down trodden people  and toiling masses. These organizations visualizing a society free from exploitation organized peasants, workers and made tremendous sacrifice. The ‘Hajong Movement’ in the then Mymensingh, ‘Tebhaga Movement’ in northern Bengal and ‘Nankar Movement’ in the greater Sylhet are few examples of their fights for the common people. In 1947 the Indo-Pak Subcontinent was divided into two States namely India and Pakistan in the name of independence. The State named Pakistan was formed with two territories with a distance of 1000 miles intervened by the territory of India. The western territory of the country was comprised of 4 provinces, namely Punjab, Sind, Baluchistan and North-West Frontiers province, while the eastern territory comprised of the East Bengal. Subsequently, the then rulers of Pakistan designated the two territories as West Pakistan and East Pakistan transforming the western provinces into the West Pakistan and the Eastern Province as the East Pakistan. The Sub-continent was divided on the basis of religious communalism known as two- nation theory, i.e. Pakistan was for the Muslims and India as the State for the believers in the other religions. Thus, the State of Pakistan was an unnatural State from the time of its birth. All India Muslim League and Indian National Congress were the main two players in dividing the subcontinent in this manner. On the 14<sup>th</sup> August, 1947 the two countries, Pakistan and India were established.</span></span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">6.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">            </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">The Communist party of India was established in 1920 by the communists in the Soviet Union, which was a great political event in the History of India and the leaderships of the said party subsequently organized various workers and peasants’ movements in India for which the party became one of the big political party. At the time of the division of the then India, The Communist Party found it difficult to resist the division as the religious sentiment dominated the masses of the country, but they applying the theory of National Emancipation supported the division of India into two countries, which they subsequently found to be a wrong decision and as such just after the partition of India, the Communist Party came to believe that the independence in the name of religion was not an independence within its meaning and they declared ‘Ye Azadi Dhoka Hai, Lakho Insan Bhuka Hai” and to establish a proper liberation, started armed struggles. The ‘Nankar Movement’ in Sylhet District, the ‘Hajong Movement’ in Mymensing and the ‘Tebhaga Movement’ in the northern districts of the country are the instances of the armed struggles of the Communists. After the partition, the Communist Party of India was also divided and Communist Party of Pakistan was established and in the territory now comprising of Bangladesh, the Communist Party was named as the Communist Party of East Pakistan. After the creation of Pakistan, the Muslim League rulers started oppressing on the Communists ruthlessly. Although the student-wing of the Communist Party was very active, they were not allowed to function publicly and as such they had to go into hiding.</span></span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">7.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">            </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">Though the partition already took place, the secular forces of present Bangladesh particularly the youths were not satisfied with the Partition of India on the basis of two-nation theory  and as such, soon after the establishment of Pakistan, the progressive and non-communal youth leaders like Kamaruddin Ahmed, Shamsul Haque, Taj Uddin Ahmed, Moahammad Toaha, Oli Ahad started discussion sitting in Calcutta to start new political movement in the changed situation and to that end they agreed to hold a conference in Dhaka to adopt the manifesto and started visiting various parts of the East Bengal. They held a youth conference on 6-7 September in 1947 and formed a youth organization named Democratic Youth League. In this conference Tasadduque Ahmed was made the president, but because of the rule of oppression this organization could not flourish and in 1948 the organization was abolished. On the other hand, on the 4<sup>th</sup> of January, 1948 the East Pakistan Muslim Chatra League was established in Dhaka. Sheikh Mujubur Rahman, subsequently designated, recognized and honoured as Bangabandhu played a vital role in establishing the said  Muslim Chatra League, which later played very important roles in various struggles and movements in the then Pakistan. But soon after its establishment it was found that the East Pakistan was being deprived of its legitimate shares in power, economy and developments and as such felt necessity for forming a new Political Party and to that end on 23<sup>-24 </sup>January, 1949 East Pakistan Awami Muslim League was established with Moulana Abdul Hamid Khan  Bhasani as its President and Shamsul Haque as its General Secretary. Bangabandhu was elected Joint Secretary although he was in jail for supporting the strike of the Dhaka University workers. However, Awami Muslim League included many popular demands of that time in the manifesto, including the framing of a democratic constitution, granting  the right of all the citizens to get food, shelter, education, clothing and treatment so that they could live with dignity, separation of the Judiciary from Executive and to guarantee the rights of speech and the press etc. The manifesto also included upholding the Islamic education and high moral values etc.</span></span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">8.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">            </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">Before the establishment of Pakistan, the debate on the State Language started growing within the students’ community as because a muslim scholar of Alighar University declared that Pakistan should adopt Bangla as the State Language. The first session of Pakistan Constituent Assembly took place on the 23<sup>rd</sup> February at Karachi when a motion was initiated for making Urdu as the state language from the Treasury Bench against which  Dhirendra Nath Dutta, a Member of the Constituent Assembly from the then East Pakistan moved an amendment to the said motion demanding  inclusion of Bangla as one of the State Languages, which was bitterly opposed by the Ruling Party members including those from this part of the country. Liakat Ali Khan criticized the proposed amendment stating that this was a move to divide and destroy Pakistan. On getting the news the student community of Bengal became furious and on the 26<sup>th</sup> of February the students of Dhaka University, Dhaka Medical and Engineering colleges observed strike in protest of the decision. Subsequently, during the visit of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Governor General of Pakistan in a public meeting at the then Racecourse Maidan on 21<sup>st</sup> March 1948 while delivering a speech again he declared that Urdu to be the State Language of Pakistan and subsequently, he repeated the same in the Special Convocation of Dhaka University on the 24<sup>th</sup> of March 1948 and there was a protest in the meeting from the audience. The Bangalee intellectuals, Dr. Muhammad Shahidullah, Syed Muztaba Ali, Ajit Guha, Ranesh Dasgupta and others started writing in favour of the demand of making Bangla as a State Language of Pakistan as Bangla was the mother tongue of the majority of the citizens of Pakistan, while Urdu was spoken by a very negligent percent of people. Thereafter, following a speech by the then Prime Minister of Pakistan, Khwaja Nazim Uddin reiterating the decision to implement Urdu as the State Language of Pakistan, the students and political leaders separately formed two All Parties Action Committees and the Communist Party involved itself in the movements from behind as the party was not allowed to function publicly.</span></span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">9.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">            </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">On the 21<sup>st</sup> day of February, 1952 the students created a history by sacrificing blood and becoming martyrs for the sake of recognition of Bangla as the mother language and as such this day  became the red letter day in the History. After creation of a State on the basis of religious nationalism, the language movement was the beginning of growing Bangalee Nationalism at the cost of the lives of Rafique, Shafique, Barkat, Salam, and others. In the Language Movement the secular student forces took pivotal role, including the student-supporters of the Communist Party, Awami Muslim League and others. After the 21<sup>st</sup> February, 1952 the students of the country felt necessity for forming a secular students’ organization as they understood that for uniting all the students a secular organization was the demand of the time and accordingly, East Pakistan Students’ Union (now Bangladesh Students’ Union, shortly, the BSU) was formed on the 26<sup>th</sup> of April, 1952. Almost all the veterans of the Language Movement Students’ Action Committee took the initiative to establish this organization. Following its birth, the BSU took part in all the democratic movements individually or with other students’ organizations unitedly. In 1953 the Students Union contested the Dhaka University Central Students’ Union election jointly with the Chatra League and came out with a victory and that gave rise to enthusiasm among the democratic political leaders to form a unity to contest in the 1954 election to the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly. The Communist Party started motivating political parties to form a United Front to contest the election in order to defeat the ruling party and the students played a very important role to compel the political forces to form the United Front on the basis of 21-point program under the leadership of Sher-e-Bangla A.K Fazlul Haque, Moulana Bhasani and Hussain Shahid Suhrawardi, three stalwarts of that time. In order to keep the United Front working smoothly for the greater interest to establish Democracy,  inspite of being the architect  of the unity to  from the Front,  the Communist Party kept itself outside the Front and nominated their own candidates in the name of the party in the election. The United Front defeated Muslim League, which got only 9 seats against 309 seats. In this election 26 members of the Communist Party were elected with the ticket from the Awami Muslim League and 5 others in the name of the party itself and thus, the Communist Party played a glorious role in the election of 1954.</span></span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">10.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">But the political history of Pakistan was a history of conspiracy by the West Pakistani rulers against the people of the then East Pakistan and after a few days of forming the Provincial Government by the United Front, the Central Government dismissed the Provincial Government and declared emergency and many political leaders including, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Communist leaders were arrested and kept in the prisons. Subsequently, a series of conspiracies went on in the political arena of Pakistan and in 1956 a Constitution for Pakistan was adopted. Though the Constitution did not reflect the aspiration of the people of the then East Pakistan, a possibility was there that a democratically elected Government would be formed and minimum democratic rights would be achieved.</span></span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">11.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">During the election of 1954, the United Front obtained the mandate of the people on the 21-Point program which included provincial autonomy and also, to quit SEATO and CENTO- two treaties, which were signed by Pakistan under the influence of the ‘US Imperialism’. But Hussein Shahid Suhrawardi, a prominent Awami League Leader was made Prime Minister of Pakistan on the 12<sup>th</sup> October, 1956 and after becoming the Prime Minister, he gave go bye to those two important programs of the United Front and there arose differences of opinions within the party. Moulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhasani, President of Awami league convened a conference of Awami League at Kagmari, Tangail, where the differences of opinions between the followers of Moulana and Suhrawardi became sharp and as Suhrawardi claimed that with the assumption of power by him the then East Pakistan attained 98 percent of autonomy and he also differed with the demand of quitting SEATO and CENTO on the ground of his 0+0 theory. Ultimately, Awami League was divided into two parties and a new party emerged with the name of National Awami Party (NAP) in a conference of the democratic workers held on the 25<sup>th</sup> and 26<sup>th</sup> July 1957. Thus, the NAP came into being. Most of the members of the Communist Party, who were in the Awami League joined the party.</span></span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%;">12.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%;">Though Hussain Shahid Suhrawardi was expecting a democratic election in Pakistan in 1959, he was dismissed from the office of the Prime Minister in October, 1957 and thereafter, there was political instability in the country and taking advantage of the situation on the 7<sup>th</sup> October, the then President of Pakistan, Iskandar Mirza declared Martial law and abrogated the Constitution and he appointed General Ayub Khan as the Chief Martial Law Administrator. Subsequently, on the 27<sup>th</sup> of October, Ayub Khan declared himself as the President of Pakistan. All political parties were banned and the leaders, including Moulana Bhasani and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were arrested and in this manner the hope for democracy in Pakistan was frustrated. Ayub Khan after four years of rule gave a Constitution, namely, the Basic Democracy and the one man rule of Ayub Khan continued by taking repressive measure. The students’ community again came forward to restore democracy. After the arrest of Hussain Shahid Suhrawardi, the students started continuing strike in Dhaka, which lasted up to 12 days. The Political Leaders also started activities for restoration of democracy. Leaders, including Bangbandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and NAP leader Mahmud Ali signed a statement demanding the lifting of Martial law, which boosted up the political workers to come forward. In this manner the NAP participated in the movement of restoration of Democracy in 1962. In the meantime the students’ organization, namely the then East Pakistan Students’ Union took the lead in this movement and the Students’ League also actively participated in the movement.</span></span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%;">13.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%;">In 1966, Bangabandhu declared the 6-Pint Program for the Bangalee people and the Students’ Union supported the program holding that the program would not fulfill the demands of emancipation of the toiling masses and release from the clutches of the Imperialism. The Students’ Union participated in the movement with that reservation and subsequently, the Students’ Union, along with other students’ organizations formed All Party Students Action Committee, which framed 11-Point Demand and started the movement and the movement culminated to the mass upsurge in 1969. After the declaration of the 6-Point Program, a lot of cases were filed against Bangabandhu and ultimately the Agartala Conspiracy Case was started against him and others. The students’ movement popularly known as the 11-Point Movement was successful to get release of the Bangabandhu and withdrawal of the said cases. In 1966, when the movement of 6-Point Demand was in the peak eight political parties formed Democratic Action Committee shortly, the DAC with Awami League, NAP and others. Though eight parties were there, the political leaders of Awami League and NAP mainly got the peoples’ confidence. Thus, NAP became very much a mass party of the then East Pakistan. Similarly, Students’ Union also became the biggest students’ organization having its participation and pioneering role in all the students and democratic movements. Though the Communist Party though was not allowed to function publicly, they were very active in organizing other political forces to form unity and to accelerate the movements. The upsurge of 1969 compelled Ayub Khan to quit the power. But without handing over the power to the people he handed over the power to Yahiya Khan, Chief of the Army of Pakistan, who on the face of the mass upsurge declared the date of election on the basis of one man one vote and promised to handover the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">power to the elected representatives of the people. After the election of 1970, when Awami</span> League emerged as the absolute majority political party of Pakistan, it was expected that they would be allowed to form the Government. But the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">conspiracy went on. The Army without handing</span> over the power started moving. Though the session of the National Assembly was called on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of March, 1971, Yahiya Khan cancelled it on lame excuse.</span></span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">14.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">When it became clear that Army would not hand over the power to people’s representatives, it became impossible to remain united with Pakistan and the people had no other alternative but to free the country from the Pakistani Rule. The Students’ Union in a farsighted manner realized that armed struggle was indeed needed and as such, motivated its workers to undergo training and the workers of Students’ Union, including lady members started taking training. Similarly, the NAP and CPB also advised theirs workers to be vigilant and prepare for the armed struggle and after the crack down on the 26<sup>th</sup> March, 1971, the workers of the NAP, CPB and Students’ Union started organizing their forces for the Liberation War locally and created resistance to the occupation forces. After the declaration of Independence by Bangabandhu, the workers of these three organizations prepared themselves for the ultimate sacrifice in order to achieve the independence of the country. Thus, these three organizations directed their workers to get themselves recruited in the Liberation Forces as was organized under the leadership of Awami League wherever possible and a good number of workers got themselves recruited in the Freedom Fighters (FF). At the beginning, the Awami League leadership was not organized and as such, the workers of the NAP, CPB and Students’ Union could get entrance in the FF. But subsequently, when the Awami League leaderships were organized one section of them started creating obstruction to the recruitment of the workers of NAP, CPB and Students’ Union as the FF. From the beginning of the War of Liberation, the NAP, CPB and Students’ Union termed the War as the National Liberation War and were trying to convince the Awami League leaderships to form a National Liberation Front and also to form an All Party Government to fight the Pakistani Occupation Force. Though the Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of Bangladesh was convinced to form a United Liberation Force, he could not succeed in convincing his colleagues and as a result, that did not happen. There were many streams within the Awami League leaderships and some were opposing to the entrance of the workers of the NAP, CPB and Students’ Union in the Liberation Forces.</span></span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">15.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">At the atrocities and genocide committed by the Pakistani Occupied Army and their local collaborators, about ten million of people had to leave their residences and took shelter in the liberated areas of Bangladesh and in the neighbouring Country, India.

When it became clear that the Pakistani Junta was being backed by the ‘US Imperialism’, the necessity for the supports of the Soviet Union, Socialist Camp and Non-Allied and Western Countries were felt very much. Accordingly, many leaders of the NAP, CPB and BSU visited the Socialist, Non-allied and Western <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">countries, attended meetings in the international</span> forums, including Afro-Asians People’s Solidarity Organizations, World Peace Council and United Nations Organization. They made an appeal to the Government and peoples of the member countries of those organisations to support the Independence of Bangladesh.To inform the world that the War of Liberation was the peoples’ war, Professor Mujaffar Ahmed, President of NAP was included in the team sent to the UNO under the leadership of <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">Justice Abu Sayeed Choudhury and a delegation</span> of Bangladesh was also sent to the Convention of the World Peace Council and Dewan Mahbub Ali and Dr. Sarwar Ali from the Communist Party were included therein. It may be mentioned that on the way to the returning from the World Peace Council Convention, Dewan Mahbub Ali breathed his last in the Delhi Airport. The communists and secular <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">forces of India were also advocating for the united</span> flight. However, under such circumstances the Indian Government extended its support for creating a combined Guerilla Force of NAP, CPB and BSU and these three organizations apart from inducting their members in regular forces started separate training in separate training camps and formed separate Special Guerilla Force with Comrade Mohammad Farhad as its Commander. The force so formed inducted their fighters inside the country and they fought heroically and many accepted the martyrdom, for instance, a group of valiant fighters laid their lives in Betiyara in the District of Comilla. They also took the initiatives that the NAP would publish a weekly newspaper, namely, the Notun Bangla and CPB would publish the Weekly Muktijudda to organize peoples’ opinion and to inspire the people within the occupied country in favour of the War of Liberation. </span></span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">17.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">The Bangladesh Provisional Government ultimately on 08.09.1971 formed a National Advisory Committee consisting of Mr. Tazuddin Ahmed, the Prime Minister of the Provisional Government, Khandoker Mustaq Ahmed, a Cabinet Minister of the said Government, Moulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhasani of NAP (Bhasani Group), Comrade Moni Singh of the CPB, Professor Muzaffar Ahmed, President, NAP (Muzaffar), Mr. Monoronjan Dhar of Bangladesh National Congress and two representatives of the Cabinet.

Those three organizations were in the hope that the names of the left out Freedom Fighters would be published in the Gazette, but that did not happen. In order to secure the recognition of the Freedom Fighters of these three organizations a committee was formed with the petitioner No.1, Mujahidul Islam Selim, President of CPB, Mrs Amina Ahmed, a Presidium Member of the NAP and 3 others. They submitted a list of the left out Freedom Fighters to the concerned authority to publish the same in the official Gazette, but that was of no result. By a letter dated 3<sup>rd</sup> June 2009 the said six leaders, including the petitioner No.1 approached the State Minister of the Ministry of the Liberation War Affairs and submitted a list of the Freedom Fighters, but that also did not work and again on 14.3.2012 the same leaders made another approach by a letter. Due to the repeated approaches and persuasion the Government was pleased to publish an incomplete list of the said Freedom Fighters vide the Notification issued under Memo. No. 48.00.0000. 004. 37.149.2013-439 dated 22.7.2013 in the official Gazette on 04.08.2013 as contained in Annexure-B. Although the names of 3491 persons were given, the Government published the list of 2367 Freedom Fighters, according to them, after scrutiny. The name of the petitioner No.1 has been published in the said Gazette at Serial No. 112 of District Chittagong at page No.6917, Annexure-‘B’.

But all on a sudden, respondent No.2 published the impugned Notification under Memo No.48.00.0000.004.75.105 (Angsha-2).2012-1488 dated 29.10.2014 in the Bangladesh Gazette on 05.11.2014, Annexure-C cancelling the Gazette Notification issued under Memo No. 48.00.0000.004.37.149.2013-439 dated 22.07.2013 containing the names of 2367 Freedom Fighters of the </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: SutonnyBanglaMJ;">Òb¨vc-KwgDwbó cvwU©-QvÎ BDwbqb we‡kl †Mwijv evwnbxÓ</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">, <span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">including the names of the petitioners, Annexure-B in exercise of his authority conferred at Serial No.6 of list No. 41, Schedule No.1 to the Rules of Business (Allocation of Business), 1996 pursuant to the recommendation purportedly made under section 7(Jha) of Jatiya Muktijhoddah Council Ain, 2002 at the 25<sup>th</sup> meeting of the Jatiya Muktijoddha Council held on 13.10.2014, Annexure-‘C’. By publishing the impugned notification the respondents have denied the status of the said Special Guerrilla Force as one of the National Liberation Forces as was recognized by the Provisional Government of Bangladesh and the subsequent Governments, including the Government headed by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The impugned notification has been published with a <em>mala fide</em> intention to deprive the members of the said Special Guerrilla Force of enjoying the honour, status and privileges as Freedom Fighters. As a recognized Liberation Force by the Government the names of the Freedom Fighters of the said Special Guerrilla Force have been correctly and lawfully published in the official Gazette and the statement made in the impugned notification that the said Gazette was wrongly published is misconceived and erroneous. The impugned Gazette Notification cancelling the earlier Gazette dated 22.07.2013 was published without serving any show cause notice to the petitioners and other members of the said Special Guerrilla Force and without affording them any opportunity of being heard. In the impugned notification, the respondents did not mention as to why the Gazette Notification under Memo No. 48. 00. 0000.004.37.149.2013-439 dated 22.07.2013  was said to have been wrongly published. The provision of section 7 (Jha) of the Jatiya Muktijoddha Council Ain, 2002 is not at all applicable to the enlistment of the Freedom Fighters of the said Special Guerrilla Force and to the cancellation of the official Gazette dated 22.07.2013 containing their names. As per the provision of section 7(Jha) of the Jatiya Muktijhoddah Council Ain 2002, Jatiya Muktijhoddah Council has no authority to make any recommendation for cancelling the official Gazette containing the list of the Freedom Fighters of the said Special Guerrilla Force. On 04.12.2014 the petitioner No.1 through his learned Advocate sent a notice demanding justice upon the respondents requesting them to rescind, cancel or withdraw the notification dated 29.10.2014 immediately, but they did not respond thereto. Accordingly, the petitioners having no other alternative and efficacious remedy filed the instant Writ Petition and obtained the Rule and the order of stay.</span> </span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">Respondent No.1 i.e. the Government of Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Liberation War Affairs contested the Rule by filing an Affidavit-in-Opposition contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the role played by the said Special Guerrilla Force is admitted and recognized historically, but the Gazette Notification dated 22.07.2013 was not published in accordance with the Jatiya Muktijoddha Council Act, 2002 and as such, the defective Gazette Notification was cancelled by another Gazette Notification dated 29.10.2014 while, the active role played and contribution made by and on behalf of the said Special Guerrilla Force as one of the Liberation Forces of Bangladesh was recognized by the Government of Bangladesh. Since the earlier Gazette Notification dated 22.07.2013 was not published in accordance with law, the Minister of the Ministry of Liberation War Affairs requested the members of that organization to apply individually in accordance with Jatiya Muktijoddha Council Ain inasmuch as, no organization can apply for enlistment of its fellow member as the Freedom Fighter as per the provision of law. The Muktijoddha Council found mainly the defects in the earlier Gazette Notification dated 22.07.2013 such as, (i) the Gazette was published under the name of a political organization, (ii) no resolution was taken to include the list, (iii) no individual application was found, (iv) some of them was enlisted earlier vide Gazette Notification in the year 2005 on their respective applications. Then the Jatiya Muktijoddha Council at its 23<sup>rd</sup> meeting held on 06.08.2014 discussed that the Gazette Notification dated 22.07.2013, which included the list of the members of the said Special Guerrilla Force namely, </span><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">Òb¨vc-KwgDwb÷ cvwU© - QvÎ BDwbqb we‡kl †Mwijv evwnbxÓ</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"> was not published in accordance with law and as such, the impugned Gazette Notification was published with a view to enlist the members of the said organization in accordance with law.
