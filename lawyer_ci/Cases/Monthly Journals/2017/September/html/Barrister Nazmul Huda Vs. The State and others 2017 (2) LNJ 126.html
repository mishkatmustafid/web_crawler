The secretary of the Anti Corruption Commission had no authority to issue any such order. Order under section 26(1) can only be exercised by the Commission. Commission means a Commission constituted under section 3 read with section 5 of the Anti Corruption Act. From 07.02.2007 to 25.02.2007 there was no Commission since all the commissioners tendered their resignation simultaneously. He submits that the president of the Republic by way of promulgating an Ordinance on 18.04.2007 inserted a clause being 18(2) after the existing clause 18 providing that any act done by any of the officer of the Commission during 7<sup>th</sup> February, 2007 and 24<sup>th</sup> February, 2007 may be given post facto approval provided however, such act exercised by the officers of the Commission is in consonance with the objective of the Act of 2004 and the functions of the Commission. The evidence of record speaks that the said commission never gave any post facto approval of the notice dated 18.02.2007. Therefore, there was never any post facto approval of the said notice. He further submitted that under section 18(2) of the said Act, only such of the acts of the Anti Corruption Commission could be given post facto approval which acts are consistent with the provision of this Act and are in consonance with the functions of the commission. The power under section 26(1) not being a power subject to delegation, therefore the notice issued by the secretary under section 26(1) of the said Act is not curable. Hence the said notice is <em>void ab initio</em> Mr. Karim submitted that since the order under section 26 is void ab inito, all the proceedings and the conviction are also illegal and void. Mr. Karim in support of his submission referred to the decision of the Appellate Division pronounced in the case of ACC versus Dr. Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir in Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 393 of 2009 Judgment dated 04.07.2010, wherein their lordships of the Appellate Division held that the order dated 18.02.2007 having been issued by the secretary to the Commission, the same is without any lawful authority and as such is void and any proceeding based on the said void order is a nullity in the eye of law. He then submits that the valuation made by the PWD is inconsistent with the then marked rate and they are not the expert and without any supportive evidences the conviction and sentence on the basis of those papers it is a nullity. Therefore the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the Court below is required to be set aside for the ends of justice and equity Mr. Haque further submits that to take the statement of wealth mentioned in the Income Tax Return corresponding to the appellants income in 2005-2006 financial years was outrageously erroneous in assessing the appellants known sources of income without any thorough investigation into the sources of income since a lawyer could still earn legitimately and legally without such income being disclosed to the Income Tax authorities, such non disclosure being culpable under the Income Tax Ordinance but certainly not actionable as and act of corruption. Therefore the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the court below is required to be set aside and the appeal should be allowed.</span></p><p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">11.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Vrinda;">On the other hand the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the Respondent No. 2 Anti-Corruption Commission submits that the notice is illegal as per the decision of the Appellate Division. But the notice as has been issued by the Secretary has got approval by a resolution dated 25.02.2007. He further submits that the Ordinance has given ex-post facto approval on 18.4.2007 under the strength of the section 18(2) of the said Act of 2004. Therefore the notice as has been severed is in accordance with law. Further he submits that only one sanction is sufficient as per decision laid down by the Appellate Division. He then referred a case reported in 2000 A.I.R. (SC) 948 and A.I.R. 1962(SC)495 that repeal of statute or stoppage of operation of stated by efflux of time or expiry of temporary stature of fixed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>period do not automatically revive the repeated statute in the absence of express intention to revive. But in the present case it is altogether different Section 18(2) has not been approved by the Parliament.

Further it appears that there is no commission in existence in between 7.2.2007 to 24.2.2007 as such notice served on 18.2.2007 is not a notice under law. </span></p><p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 120%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">105.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">    </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">From the trend of the examination of the witnesses, it appears that the Secretary of the Anti Corruption Commission issued a notice on 18.2.2007 under purported authority of section 26(1) and 18 of the Anti Corruption Commission Act, 2004 read with Rules 15 Gha(1) and 15(Gha(2) of the Emergency Power Rules, 2007 upon the appellant directing him to submit his statement of assets. The secretary of the Anti Corruption Commission had no authority to issue any such notice. Notice under section 26(1) can only be exercised by the Commission. Commission means Commission constituted under section 3 read with Section 5 of the Anti Corruption Act. From 7.2.2007 to 25.2.2007 there was no Commission since all the Commissioner tendered their resignation simultaneously. The president of the Republic by way of promulgating an Ordinance on 18.4.2007 inserted a clause being 18(2) after the existing clause 18 providing that any Act done by any of the officer of the commission during 7<sup>th</sup> February, 2007 and 24<sup>th</sup> February, 2007 may be given post facto approval provided however, such act exercised by the officers of the commission is in consonance with the objective of the Act and the functions of the Commission. The evidence on record speaks that the said Commission never gave any post facto approval of the order dated 18.2.2007. Therefore, there was never any post facto approval of the said order. Further under section 18(2) of the said Act, only such acts of Anti-Corruption Commission could be given post facto approval which acts are consistent with the provision of this Act and are in consonance with the functions of the Commission. The power under section 26(1) not being a power subject to delegation, therefore the notice issued by the secretary under section 26(1) of the said act is not curable. Hence the said order is void ab initio and the proceeding initiated and the conviction based on such void and illegal order are all illegal and void. In this regard it is profitable to refer the decision of the Appellate Division<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>in Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 398 of 2009 wherein their Lordships of the Appellate Division held as follows:-</span></p><p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: 120%; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">“In the present case, the notice dated 18-2-2007, under section 26 of the Act, was issued by the Secretary of the Commission but he does not represented the Commission, he is only one of its employees, to carry out the decision of the Commission. But at the relevant time there were no Commissioner, as such apparently, the Secretary issued the notice on 18-2-2007, on his own, without any satisfaction and decision of the Commission, in violation of section 26 of the Act. The concerned authority on realizing this error, tried to cover it up by inserting sub section (2) in section 18 on 18-4-2004, by Ordinance No. VII of 2007. Sub-section (2) provides for ex post facto ratification of the acts done by the officers of the Commission during the period from, 7.2.2007 to 24.2.2007, without any authorization from the Commission, but the question of jurisdiction goes to the root of the matter. If any person acts beyond his authority, to the prejudice of any person, such acts cannot be ratified or validated by post facto legislation, his action remains void. </span></p><p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: 120%; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Besides, section 26 envisages that before issuance of the notice, the Commissioner(s) must be satisfied about the allegation. It is their satisfaction and of nobody elses. But by sub-section (2) of section 18, the Commissioners can only ratify the ‘satisfaction’ of the Secretary which is certainly not stipulated in section 26. </span></p><p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: 120%; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">As such, the notice dated 18.2.2007, issued by the Secretary in favour of the respondent No. 1, was not issued on behalf of the Commission as envisaged under section 26, and is without jurisdiction and void abinitio. </span></p><p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: 120%; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Besides, the notice dated 18.2.2007 was not a notice required by law, the notice directed the respondent No. 1, a detenu, to submit return of his assets within a period of 72 hours, is itself a worst example of arbitrary action on the part of the concerned authority. A notice must allow a reasonable time to check-up the details of the assets of a person, if necessary, on examination of his records and after consultation with his lawyers and other concerned persons. Section 26 certainly does not envisage a notice upon a person who is in detention and he is not expected to give any details of his assets within the time specified. The person concerned must be afforded a fair and reasonable opportunity to respond to the notice, otherwise, it is no notice in the eye of law. A notice issued under section 26 of the Act to a detenu, away from his hearth and home cannot be said to be a fair and bonafide exercise of power. </span></p><p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Under the circumstances, we are of the opinion that the notice dated 18.2.2007, issued by Secretary to the Commission, was without any lawful authority, as such, void and any proceeding based on the said void notice is a nullity in the eye of law. </span></p><p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: 120%; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">There is, however, no legal impediment for the Commission to issue fresh notice under section 26 of the Act, if so advised, but not in those cases where the accused has already been acquitted on merit of the case as is in this case. </span></p><p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: 120%; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">With these observations, this petition is dismissed”</span></p><p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 120%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">106.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">    </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Therefore the initiation of the proceeding in the case is not in accordance with law. The statement of wealth mentioned in the Income tax Return corresponding to the appellant’s income in 2005-2006 financial year was outrageously erroneous in assessing be appellant’s known sources of income without any through investigation into the sources of income since a lawyer could still earn legitimately and legally without such income being disclosed to the Income Tax authorities such non disclosure being culpable under the Income Tax Ordinance but certainly not actionable as an act of corruption. The prosecution on a through investigation should have found all the moneys of the accused maintained in several bank accounts as legitimate legal income from his clients and not money disproportionate to his known sources of income as was stated by the appellant in the course of his interrogation at the Jail gate which P.W. 88 deliberately suppressed from the Court as evidenced in his cross examination, and the Court should have believed that if the accused appellant was not in detention, he would have been able to bring more documentary evidence in addition to Exhibit-C series. Further it appears that the accused appellant’s conviction under section 26(2) of the Anti Corruption Commission Act, 2004 is totally unfounded din view of Annexure-C submitted by the appellant’s wife Mrs. Sigma Huda (D.W. 2) to the director of Anti Corruption Commission stating the additional items as part of the appellant’s assets being not accepted and acknowledged by said Mr. Wadud, P.W.3 as being time barred with reference to 72 hours and the subject matter of alleged concealment whereupon the aforesaid conviction was based being the items mentioned in Annexure-C.
