It was alleged in <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">the said complaint-petition that the complainant</span> is a farmer who was accorded permission by the Government for purchasing power tillers at a 25% subsidized rate to sell the same to the real cultivators at the said subsidized price. The accused-petitioners are journalists who demanded extortion of Tk. 1,50,000/- from the complainant threatening him to publish a news regarding the selling of the power tillers to the persons other than cultivators and, out of fear and anxiety, the complainant gave Tk. 20,000/- <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">to the accused-petitioners. However, the accused</span>-petitioners threatened the complainant to publish news if the balance amount is not paid. Later on, when the complainant declined to make any further payment, the accused-petitioners on 02.06.2015 published a false news in the Daily Prothom Alo. To this end, an inquiry was carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture and the inquiry committee of the ministry found the news to be false. Thereafter, when the complainant published a rejoinder in the Daily Somokal on 06.07.2015 against the said false news, the accused-petitioners kept threatening the complainant to publish further false news, which compelled the complainant to lodge this case. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.3pt;">Upon going through the above complaint</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">-petition, the learned Magistrate directed the Officer-in-Charge of Kotchandpur Police Station to treat it as an FIR and to do the needful. Accordingly, the FIR was registered as Kotchandpur Police Station Case No. 08 dated 29.07.2015 and, thereafter, the same was forwarded to the learned Judicial Magistrate, cognizance Court Jhenaidah, where the case was registered as Kot Druto GR Case No. 40 of 2015. On 19.08.2015, the Police submitted charge sheet no. 72 dated 10.08.2015 and on 25.08.2015, the accused-petitioners voluntarily surrendered before the Magistrate and obtained bail and on 14.10.2015, the case was transferred for trial to the Court of Senior Judicial Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Jhenaidah in which the power and jurisdiction of the Druta Bichar Adalat of Jhenaidah has been vested. Thereafter, on 22.11.2015 the trial Court (the Druto Bichar Adalat) framed charge under Section 4 of the Ain Srinkhola Bighnokari Aporadh Damon Ain, 2002 (as amended in 2014) against the accused-petitioners and, by now, 6 (six) witnesses have been examined. It is stated that on 29.05.2017 the case was fixed for examination of witnesses and, on the said day, upon hearing the accused-petitioners’ application for staying all further proceedings of the case when the learned Judge of the Druta Bichar Adalat was passing the stay order, he uttered that “Please </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: SutonnyBanglaMJ; mso-bidi-font-family: SutonnyMJ;">Avcbviv GLvb †_‡K gvgjv mwi‡q wbb</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">”.

He, then, contends that the news which gave rise to the case is against the Ministry of Agriculture and from the subsequent conduct of the concerned Ministry, the accused-petitioners have cogent reason to believe that at the behest of the Minister of the said Ministry the case was initiated and at her direction, the local political leaders are constantly pursuing the case and on each and every date a number of the local political leaders and workers appear in the Court premises and use intangible filthy language to the accused-petitioners and from such activities of the local political leaders and supporters, there has been a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the accused-petitioners that the Government officials at the Ministry of Agriculture are acting against the accused-petitioners and a fair and impartial trial cannot be held in the aforesaid trial Court. Mr. Ariff lastly submits that inordinate delay in disposing of this case indicates that this false case is filed for harassing the accused-petitioners inasmuch as this case is a case of Druto Bichar Ain and the trial of the case was supposed to have been completed within the shortest possible time prescribed in the law.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">By making the above submissions, the learned Advocate for the petitioners prays for making the Rule absolute.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Per contra, Mr. Khurshedul Alam, the learned Deputy Attorney General (DAG) appearing for the State reads over the provisions of Section 526 of the CrPC and submits that the grounds taken by the accused-petitioners do not attract the provisions of Section 526 of the CrPC. He submits that there will be anarchy in the criminal justice administration of our country if trials of criminal cases are halted and transferred on these types of grounds. He contends that all the parties of this case, namely the accused persons and the witnesses, are the inhabitants of Jhenaidah, and submits that it would be harassment for them if the case is transferred to Dhaka or to any other district. He alleges that the attending facts amply suggest that this petition has been filed with an ill motive of delaying completion of the trial of this case. He further alleges that the Daily Prothom Alo, being a highly powerful newspaper of the country, has a tendency of influencing not only the social and political issues of the country, but also the judicial performance of this country and submits that if this case is transferred to Dhaka, a bad message will be passed on to the general litigants. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">By making the above submissions, the learned DAG humbly prays that the Rule should be discharged and, further, there should be a direction upon the trial Court to complete the trial of this case within a specified time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 6pt; text-indent: 0in; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">We have heard the learned Advocate for the petitioners and the learned DAG, perused the application together with its annexures wherefrom it transpires that the core issue for adjudication upon by this Court is whether there exists any reason for transferring this case from the present trial Court to any equivalent Court/Sessions Court in the District of Dhaka which may fall within the ambit of the provisions of Section 526(1) of the CrPC.

The petitioners of this case, however, have not been able to substantiate the above allegations by stating any plausible incident, not to speak of adducing any ocular evidence and, thus, these allegations appear to us to be vague. However, even if the allegations are taken to be true and, as per the prayer of the petitioners, the case is transferred to the District of Dhaka, the petitioners cannot guarantee that the same situation would not be created by the Minister in Dhaka; rather it would be convenient for the Minister to monitor the case and, thereby, influence the same. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">14.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">All that we wish to say that the Courts of Bangladesh are independent in dealing with any case and, if at any point of time, when a Judge is unduly communicated and pressured by the executive or by any person, the concerned trial Court Judge’s duty is either to deal with the matter by her/himself towards punishing the contemnor or to report the same to the Registrar of this Court. In this case, there is nothing in the order sheets (record) to show that the learned Judge of the trial Court has ever been communicated by any one requiring him to deal with the matter by himself or to report this Court about the alleged communication or pressure. With regard to the comments allegedly to have been made by the learned Judge, our observation is that, if the petitioner’s claim as to making the said comments is taken to be true, the learned Judge might have said it due to the non-cooperation of the accused-petitioners in completing the trial in the light of the fact that from the order sheets it is evident that the petitioners, instead of cross-examining the prosecution witnesses, not only have sought adjournments time and again, but also have eventually made prayer for transferring the case from his Court to another Court. Thus, it appears to us that the learned Judge might have said something at the instigation of the accused-petitioners. This Court, thus, does not find any materials/ evidence on record to blame the complainant for making the above comments, if it had at all happened. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">15.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Furthermore, from a perusal of the order sheets of this case, it transpires that the petitioners have sought adjournments on most of the dates and the delay has occurred in completing the trial.

Litigants must approach this Court/Sessions Judge with clean hands in availing the discretionary relief under Section 526 of the CrPC. In a fit and proper case, this Court shall never hesitate to transfer the trial of a case from the concerned Court to any competent Court for the sake of justice. At the same time, this Court owes a constitutional duty of maintaining a discipline in the administration of justice in the subordinate judiciary of this country. The propensity of the litigants to transfer the trial of a case from the concerned trial Court to another Court on omnibus ground requires to be trimmed down for the sake of administration of justice of this land and, which is why, the Legislature has empowered this Court to punish an applicant who intends to waste the invaluable time of this Court by filing trivial or fallacious application for transferring a case from the present Court to another Court.

At that juncture, we were told by the learned Senior Counsel that the learned filing lawyer would inform this Court on the next day about receiving the full fledged judgment or non-prosecuting the Rule after consulting the matter with the petitioners. But unfortunately today, (on the next date of hearing the case) none appeared before this Court and, under the circumstance, this Court does not have any option other than to deliver a full-fledged judgment. Thus, it is a fit case to slap cost upon the petitioners under the provisions of Section 526(6A) of the CrPC.
