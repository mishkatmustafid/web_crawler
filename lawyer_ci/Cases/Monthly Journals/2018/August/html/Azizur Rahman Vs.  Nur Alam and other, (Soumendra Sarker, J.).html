In that suit, the defendants No.2-7 and 9 after filing written statements contested the suit and after trial the learned trial court passed the judgment and decree on 14.01.2009 and 20.01.2009 respectively on contest against the contesting defendants and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ex parte</em> against the rest. Contesting defendant-opposite parties being aggrieved filed Other Appeal NO.32 of 2009 in the court of learned District Judge, Kurigram and the learned appellate court after hearing; affirmed the judgment and decree passed by the trial court by its judgment and decree dated 16.08.2011 and 21.08.2011 respectively. The trial court subsequently after receiving the report of the Advocate Commissioner along with filed book, sketch map, etc. drawn up the final decree on 23.08.2012 and the decree-holder-plaintiff-petitioner filed Execution Case No.12 of 2012 against the defendants to that case. In that execution case the present opposite party No.13 filed an application on 24.01.2013 under Order XLI, rule 29 of the Code of Civil Procedure for staying all further proceedings of Other Execution Case No.12 of 2012 till disposal of an Other Suit No.05 of 2013, pending before the court of learned Assistant Judge, Rajarhat, Kurigram filed by this opposite party No.13. The learned Assistant Judge on hearing the application allowed the same and stayed all further proceedings of the Execution Case No.12 of 2012 till disposal of the Other Suit No.05 of 2013 by his order dated 06.02.2013.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Being aggrieved the decree holder-petitioner preferred a Civil Revision being No.18 of 2013 in the Court of learned District Judge, Kurigram and the learned District Judge, Kurigram by the impugned judgment and order dated 17.06.2014 disallowed the revisional application and affirmed the order of the learned trial court.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order of the learned 1<sup>st</sup> revisional Court the plaintiff-decree holder-petitioner have preferred this 2<sup>nd</sup> revisional application with leave of this Court under section 115(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the Rule with an interim order of stay.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">During hearing of this Rule Mr. Moloy Kumar Roy, the learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the petitioner while Mr. Taj Mohammad Shaikh the learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the opposite party No.13.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the learned trial court as well as the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of revision during passing their judgment and orders committed gross illegality resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in staying further proceedings of the Execution case filed by the plaintiff-decree holder-petitioner. The learned Advocate further submits that the opposite party No.13 is a third party to the original case and he has no <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Mangal;">locus standi</span></em> to file any application for staying further proceedings of the execution case, but the learned trial court as well as the 1<sup>st</sup> revisional court without appreciation of law stayed the further proceedings of the execution case illegally. The learned Advocate also submits that during pendency of Execution Case No.12 of 2012 the present opposite party No.13 filed an application for staying further proceedings of the execution Case under Order XLI, rule 29 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which has no manner of application in that type of relief. The learned Advocate further submits that, admittedly the opposite party No.13 is a third party to the original suit and it’s subsequent execution case and for the said reason there was no scope to stay the proceedings of the execution case under the ambit of Order XLI, rule 29 of Code of Civil Procedure. The learned Advocate in support of his contention referred some decisions of this Court and our Apex Court.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">As against the aforesaid submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite party No.13 opposing the Rule submits that the civil revision under section 115(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure has a very limited scope and only for illegality and non-consideration of material facts and evidence on records resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice, a civil revision can be allowed and in the instant case; there is no such illegality and non-consideration of material facts or evidence resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice by which the impugned judgment and order can be interfered with. The learned Advocate after filing a counter affidavit on behalf of the opposite party No.13 further submits that at this stage inasmuch as a regular suit has been instituted by the opposite party No.13 being Other Suit No.5 of 2013 in respect of some land of the execution case, which is pending for disposal, the opposite party No.13 had locus standi to file the application for stay.

It further appears that the original Partition Suit being No. 51 of 2006 was decreed in favour of the decree holder-petitioner and during pendency of the execution case filed by the decree holder-petitioner, the present opposite party No.13 filed an application stating that he has filed a regular suit being Other Suit No.05 of 2013 in the Court of learned Assistant Judge, Rajarhat, Kurigram against the judgment and decree passed in Other Suit No.51 of 2006. In the pretext of citation of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Order XLI, rule 29 of the Code of Civil Procedure in the instant application for staying further proceedings of the execution case,the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite party during his submission submits that, inadvertently instead of Order XXI, rule 29 of the Code of Civil Procedure wrongly, Order XLI was written in the application and it was a clerical mistake and for such mistake the client should not suffer due to the fault of his lawyer. However, treating the application under the provisions laid down in Order XXI, rule 29 of the Code of Civil Procedure, having gone through the contents of the application along with the judgment and order passed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of revision, I find that the learned District Judge, Kurigram during disposal of the revisional application filed before him under section 115(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure rightly opined that the plaintiff, who has filed the other Suit No.05 of 2013, Md. Moklesur Rahman in fact was not a party to the disposed of Other Suit No.51 of 2006, but obviously; the learned district judge wrongly held that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>inasmuch as there is an apprehension of further complicacy, there is a necessity for staying further proceedings of the Decree Execution Case No.12 of 2012; prior to disposal of Other Suit No. 05 of 2013 which has been instituted against the judgment and final decree passed in Other Suit No.51 of 2006.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">From the plain reading of the provisions laid down in Rule 29 of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure it is crystal much clear to draw such inference that the learned trial court as well as the 1<sup>st</sup> revisional court were totally misconceived in grasping the proposition of the relevant law. The fact remains that, a third party to the original suit/case have no <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">locus standi</em> to prefer such application for staying further proceedings of the Execution Case No.12 of 2012 arising out of the judgment and final decree passed in Other Suit No.51 of 2006. It is also a decided matter in our judicature. Hence, the petitioner being a third party to a decree has no legal character or lawful status to maintain an application for stay of the execution proceedings and pendency of a suit filed by third party is no ground for staying a proceedings of such execution case which has arise out of such a decree in which the applicant was not a party. Rule 29 of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure; empowered only a party to a suit <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">viz.</span> the judgment-debtor and the decree holder for filing such application, and the court may stay execution of a decree until pendency of the suit which has been instituted by the judgment-debtor and not third party.

It had no manner of application in the instant of nature of case, but it appears that the learned court below on a total misconception and misapprehension of law stayed the proceedings of the Execution Case No.12 of 2012.
