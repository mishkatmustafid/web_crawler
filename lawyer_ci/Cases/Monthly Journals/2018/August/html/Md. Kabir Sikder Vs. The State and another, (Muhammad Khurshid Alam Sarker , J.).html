From perusal of all the prosecution materials, it transpires that a payment fell due out of the sale proceeds of a property and the accused issued a blank cheque towards payment of the outstanding money and, when the cheque was dishonoured, the accused denied to pay off the dues. From our way of looking at the facts, we find that, firstly, it was not a normal business transaction and, secondly, there is no civil issue for adjudication; such as, had the dispute been with regard to the amount or about the method of calculation of money, there was a need to adjudicate upon the dispute by the civil Court.

Now-a-days, it has been the matter of normal course for the practitioners of this Court to come up with application for quashment of cases under Sections 406, 417 and 420 of the Penal Code with a rhetoric ground that the allegation having arisen out of business transaction, a criminal case does not lie. In this case, the dispute is not about the amount of money owed - on the plea that the debt fell due out of continued business transaction; rather the dispute is over denial of debt to the complainant by the accused and, thus, the issue not being required to be adjudicated upon by the civil Court, there is no bar to file this criminal case.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                                                   </span>. . .

In our criminal justice administration system, since any person is competent to file a criminal case, there is no need to engage a power of attorney-holder for filing a criminal case. However, where the law requires that a criminal case is to be filed only by the aggrieved person, as provided in Section 198 of the CrPC, or only by the specified person, as provided in Section 199 of the CrPC, the aforesaid aggrieved person/specified person may empower a third person to file criminal case on his/her behalf through executing a deed of power of attorney stating in clearer terms the reasons for not filing the case by him/herself. But, the power of attorney-holder should bear in mind that while s/he can fairly depose before the trial Court as a witness on her/his own standing like any other relevant witnesses, s/he should not endeavour to portray her/himself before the trial Court as the executants of the deed of power of attorney, as if s/he her/himself is the aggrieved person/specified person.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">        </span>. . .(24)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Penal Code (XLV of 1860)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Sections 406, 417 and 506</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">If the cheated-person was truly unable to file the case by himself, the petitioner could have filed the case as a complainant by simply making a statement in the petition of complaint as to the reason for not filing the case by the cheated-person and enlisting both of them as the witnesses and, at the trial, while presence of the cheated-person would help to prove the case, non-availability of his testimony may result in dismissing the case given that in a cheating case, the testimony of the person-cheated is pivotal for proving the charge of cheating, for, only the cheated-person possesses first-hand knowledge about the commission of offence of cheating. . . .

In the next paragraph to the ‘cause title’ of the petition of complaint, where the list of the witnesses is furnished, Md. Al-Mamun Titu is portrayed as the complainant and Md.

By presentation of a complaint before the competent Judicial Magistrate either orally or in writing, a CR case is kicked off and, upon considering the nature and veracity of the allegations, when the Magistrate decides to take cognizance of the alleged offence/s, s/he is duty bound to examine the complainant on oath and reduce the substance of the examination in writing. When the complaint is made in writing and its contents appear to the Magistrate to be ambiguous, the Magistrate either should ask the complainant to come up with a fresh application clearly disclosing the offence or, in the alternative, pass an order for carrying out an inquiry under Section 202 CrPC and, after looking at the fresh petition of complaint or inquiry report, as the case may be, the Magistrate then would be in a better position to decide whether to proceed for taking cognizance. Non-compliance of the above practice, however, would not vitiate the proceedings. The purpose of observance of the above path is to gain <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> satisfaction by the Magistrate as to commission of offence, for, the Magistrate is required to be satisfied either from the petition of complaint or from the statements of the complainant made under Section 200 CrPC or from the inquiry report, as the case may be, that any one of it discloses commission of offence. Despite existence of any inconsistency between the version of the petition of complaint and the statements of the complainant made under Section 200 CrPC, when the Magistrate takes cognizance, the presumption is that the concerned Magistrate has been primarily satisfied about commission of offence. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">18.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">In this case, it is found hereinbefore that there were inconsistencies among the version of the petition of complaint, cheque, power of attorney, registered deed of sale of land and, therefore, it was incumbent upon the Magistrate to decline to examine the complainant under Section 200 CrPC and thereby direct the complainant to come afresh or to straightway reject the application on the ground that he was not satisfied as to commission of the alleged offence/s. But since the learned Magistrate has taken cognizance of the offences punishable under Sections 406, 417 and 506 of the Penal Code, the presumption is that the learned Magistrate, having taken the pain of going through all the papers/documents, was <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> satisfied about the commission of above offences. So, the inaction of the learned Magistrate as to directing the complainant to come up with a fresh petition of complaint containing clear-cut statements or not going for an inquiry under Section 202 CrPC was merely an irregularity; not any fatal illegality. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">19.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It is true that this Court by exercising its inherent power is well competent to set aside the order of taking cognizance and framing charge and thereby direct the complainant to file a fresh complaint, containing clearer statements about his identity and the reason for non-filing the case by the person actually cheated, before the concerned Magistrate so as to enable the concerned Magistrate to clearly understand about the allegation of commission of offence and, then, examine the accused under Section 200 CrPC. However, if the case is sent back now to the concerned Magistrate, the accused petitioner is not going to be benefited; rather he would be loser in the sense that by adducing relevant witnesses at the trial, with the present position of this case, while the complainant would endeavour to prove his case by showing that the alleged inconsistencies are nothing but mere professional immaturity of the engaged Advocate, the accused person shall have the opportunity to discredit the deposition <span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt;">of the witnesses by showing the inconsistencies.</span> Therefore, on the basis of the above inconsistencies, the order of taking cognizance by the Magistrate cannot be quashed at this stage. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The above conclusion leads us to see whether the order of framing charge can be set aside in spite of this Court’s findings that there was no illegality in taking cognizance. In an appropriate and fit case, order of framing charge may be quashed if it appears to the High Court Division that the trial Court failed to notice that the prosecution materials are not sufficient to prosecute the accused or it was not brought to the notice of the trial Court that provision of any particular law does not permit to prosecute the accused. In this case, charges have been framed under Sections 406, 417 &amp; 506 of the Penal Code. While an allegation of cheating is apparent in the complainant’s statements made under Section 200 of the CrPC, the legal notice issued by the complainant to the accused contains some allegations of breach of trust and criminal intimidation under Sections 406 and 506 of the Penal Code, though feebly. Given that under Section 227 of the CrPC, the trial Court is empowered to alter charge at any stage before pronouncement of the Judgment, the charges of breach of trust and criminal intimidation may eventually be dropped by the trial Court following taking deposition of the witnesses, if the said allegations are not corroborated by the evidence. Depending on the weight of the evidence adduced at the trial, while the complainant would have the expectation to prove his case, it might come out to be its reverse as well. Therefore, this is not a fit case to set aside the charges at this stage, let alone <span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt;">the question of quashing the entire proceedings.</span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">21.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Let us now take up the second issue, namely, whether the allegation is of civil nature debarring filing of a criminal case. From perusal of all the prosecution materials, it transpires that a payment fell due out of the sale proceeds of a property and the accused issued a blank cheque towards payment of the outstanding money and, when the cheque was dishonoured, the accused denied to pay off the dues. From our way of looking at the facts, we find that, firstly, it was not a normal business transaction and, secondly, there is no civil issue for adjudication; such as, had the dispute been with regard to the amount or about the method of calculation of money, there was a need to adjudicate upon the dispute by the civil Court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Till now, at any stage of this case, the accused has not come up with a case that while he admits the dues/debt, but he merely raises objection about the amount of demand made by the complainant. In the case of Sayed Ehsan Abdullah Vs The State 9 ALR 2017(1) 80, this Court upon revisiting a score of decisions of both the Divisions of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, including the cases referred to by the learned Advocate for the accused, and that of the Apex Courts of this sub-continent held that offence of cheating may occur even in a long-term business transaction when the accused would deny the claim of outstanding balance having nothing to do with calculation/determination of amount of money/goods. This point is no more <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">res integra </em>in our jurisdiction and filing a case under Section 561A CrPC resorting to the above ground is not a fair practice on the part of the learned Advocates of this Court. We record here our concern that when this Court is struggling to cope with the huge backlog of cases, learned members of the Bar do not consider it as their part of professional duty to discourage their clients not to insist upon filing case/petition having no merit. Now-a-days, it has been the matter of normal course for the practitioners of this Court to come up with application for quashment of cases under Sections 406, 417 and 420 of the Penal Code with a rhetoric ground that the allegation having arisen out of business transaction, a criminal case does not lie. In this case, the dispute is not about the amount of money owed - on the plea that the debt fell due out of continued business transaction; rather the dispute is over denial of debt to the complainant by the accused and, thus, the issue not being required to be adjudicated upon by the civil Court, there is no bar to file this criminal case. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">22.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">We may now embark upon the third issue of this Rule, namely, whether criminal case of cheating can be filed by a person other than who has been actually cheated. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">23.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The criminal justice administration of Bangladesh is regulated by the provisions of the CrPC and in some cases by the provisions of the special laws, if the special law prescribes a different method. While the provisions of the CrPC as well as the special laws allow any person to file a criminal case either in police station or in the competent Court, Sections 195 to 199 of the CrPC incorporates some conditions for filing criminal cases of certain offences specified therein. For example, for filing case of any offence under Sections 172 to 188 of the Penal Code, the concerned public servant is required to lodge a written complaint; for filing case under Sections 193-196, 199-200, 205-211, 228, 463, 471 and 475-476 of the Penal Code, the concerned Court is required to file written complaint; for filing case of offences punishable under chapter VI or IX or under Sections 108A, 120B, 153A, 294A, 295A and 505 of the Penal Code, a sanction from the Government is required upon conducting a preliminary investigation by an Inspector of police by the order of a District Magistrate; for prosecution of Judges and public servants, previous Government sanction is necessary; for prosecuting the offender under chapters XIX and XXI or under Sections 493 to 496 of the penal Code, the aggrieved person is required to file the case and for prosecuting an offender under Sections 497 or 498, the husband is required to file the case. Thus, upon a minute reading of Sections 195 to 199 CrPC, it appears to us that offence of cheating does not come within the purview of the said provisions which are exceptions to the general rule of law of criminal procedure that a criminal case can be filed by any person. Therefore, we hold that any person is competent to file a case of cheating, for, it is not a requirement of law that only the person cheated should file the complaint of commission of offence of cheating. The same view was taken in the case of Jagadish Chandra Vs Joynarayan 14 DLR 198 upon reviewing the case of Surandra Nath Saha Vs The State 12 DLR 178 and the case of Shahibzada Muhammad Hayat Khan Vs Ghulam Muhammad 6 DLR (WPC) 177. It, however, can be comprehended from the common sense that if the cheated-person him/herself files the case, then the Magistrate’s task of taking cognizance becomes easier and, thereafter, at the trial stage the trial Court unhesitatingly may proceed towards prosecuting the accused. That does not necessarily mean that if the person cheated is dead or unable to move/speak before the Magistrate/trial Court, the case would fail inasmuch as success of a criminal case of cheating does not depend only on the oral statements made by the person cheated before the trial Court; the relevant papers and testimonies of third persons with the secondary knowledge of cheating may also enable to prove the case. But despite the cheated-person’s availability to make deposition before the trial Court, if the cheated-person does not stand as a witness and come forward for deposing before the trial Court, the trial Court might take an adverse presumption on the commission of offence of cheating. It follows that the complaint of this case though has not been filed by a person who has been cheated, but the present complainant is competent to file criminal case and, thus, we do not find any illegality in filing this criminal case. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Let us now examine the fourth issue, namely, whether a power of attorney-holder is competent to file complaint regarding commission of offence of cheating. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The position of a power of attorney-holder is as good as the person who by executing a legal instrument, namely, power of attorney, delegates/transfers to or vests in or confers his/her lawful power upon a third person. In our criminal justice administration system, since any person is competent to file a criminal case, there is no need to engage a power of attorney-holder for filing a criminal case. However, where the law requires that a criminal case is to be filed only by the aggrieved person, as provided in Section 198 of the CrPC, or only by the specified person, as provided in Section 199 of the CrPC, the aforesaid aggrieved person/specified person may empower a third person to file criminal case on his/her behalf through executing a deed of power of attorney stating in clearer terms the reasons for not filing the case by him/herself. But, the power of attorney-holder should bear in mind that while s/he can fairly depose before the trial Court as a witness on her/his own standing like any other relevant witnesses, s/he should not endeavour to portray her/himself before the trial Court as the executants of the deed of power of attorney, as if s/he her/himself is the aggrieved person/specified person.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">26.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In this case, the offences are alleged to have been committed under Sections 406, 417 and 506 of the Penal Code and no law requires that criminal case for the above offences are to be filed by an aggrieved person, as has already been held by us hereinbefore. So, there having no legal requirement of making a power of attorney, engaging the present petitioner as a power of attorney-holder for filing this case before the concerned Magistrate was an unnecessary exercise. If the cheated-person was truly unable to file the case by himself, the petitioner could have filed the case as a complainant by simply making a statement in the petition of complaint as to the reason for not filing the case by the cheated-person and enlisting both of them as the witnesses and, at the trial, while presence of the cheated-person would help to prove the case, non-availability of his testimony may result in dismissing the case given that in a cheating case, the testimony of the person-cheated is pivotal for proving the charge of cheating, for, only the cheated-person possesses first-hand knowledge about the commission of offence of cheating.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">27.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">In this case, there was a prayer by the accused person before the trial Court that the cheated-person should be produced before the trial Court at the time of framing charge to ensure that the cheated-person shall remain present as a witness during the trial. Given the peculiarity of the case, the trial Court could have allowed the prayer inasmuch as from the prosecution materials the peculiarity of this case is vividly noticeable. In the midst of the hearing of this Rule, this Court asked the learned Advocate for the complainant to produce the complainant together with the cheated-person. For some unknown reason, the learned Advocate for the complainant was trying to avoid to produce the cheated-person for days together and when we were about to pass a written order upon the police to produce the cheated-person, the learned Advocate, at that juncture, took the responsibility of producing both the cheated-person and the complainant. When they appeared before this Court, this Court directly inquired about the alleged dealings between the accused and the cheated person, the reason for not filing the case by the cheated-person himself, the reason for executing power of attorney, reason behind writing the name of the present complainant on the blank cheque instead of writing the name of the cheated-person etc and we also took the signatures from both of them in order to tally the signatures used in the cheque, power of attorney, petition of complaint and Vokalatnamas. Eventually, the accused admitted that he had issued the blank cheque to pay an amount of Taka three lacs. Then, we asked the learned Advocate for both the sides as to whether they would take an initiative to amicably settle down the matter by withdrawing the case from the trial Court, for, the charges brought against the accused are compoundable and, accordingly, a date was fixed by this Court for pronouncement of the Judgment. On the date of pronouncement of the Judgment of this case, neither the learned Advocate of any side nor the parties of this case was found present in the Court. Under the circumstances, this Court started to deliver the Judgment and when taking dictation of the Judgment by the Bench Officer was complete, the learned Advocates for both the sides having scrambled before this Court informed that the parties, after negotiating for a few days with each other, have come to an amicable settlement to withdraw the case on condition of payment of three lacs Taka in favour of the complainant by the accused and, at the same time, returning the original cheque to the accused person.
