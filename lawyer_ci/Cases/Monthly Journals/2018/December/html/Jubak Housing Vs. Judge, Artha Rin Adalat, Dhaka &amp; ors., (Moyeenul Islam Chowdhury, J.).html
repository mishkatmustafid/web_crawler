In a Writ of Certiorari, the scope of interference of the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution is very limited.

The finding of the Executing Court that the bid money of the petitioner to the tune of Tk. 6,10,00,000/- was very low cannot be found fault with in judicial review for justifiable reasons. In other words, we do not find that the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 was made by the Executing Court without any lawful authority. What we are driving at boils down to this: the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 is a valid and legal order passed under the proviso to Sub-Section (2) of Section 33 of the Ain of 2003. Consequently the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 cannot be dubbed as an unreasonable, arbitrary and whimsical order.

Anyway, the respondent no. 2 Agrani Bank Limited as plaintiff instituted Title Suit No. 217 of 1992 in the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka impleading the respondent nos. 3-10 as defendants for realization of Tk. 7,55,686.61/-. Eventually the suit was decreed on contest by the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka on 07.09.2001. Thereafter the decree-holder respondent-Agrani Bank Limited filed Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 in the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka. During the process of execution of the decree, the respondent no. 1, in compliance with Section 33(1) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the Ain of 2003), invited tender for auction sale of the mortgaged properties as described in the schedules to the Execution Case Petition. The said tender notice was published in “The Daily Manabzamin” on 20.02.2004. On 03.03.2004, only a single bid was submitted and that being so, the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1 by its order dated 03.03.2004 refused to accept the bid and directed the decree-holder bank to take steps according to Section 33(4) of the Ain of 2003. On 28.03.2004, the Artha Rin Adalat, according to the provisions of Section 33(4) of the Ain of 2003, again published an auction notice in two national dailies, namely, “The Daily Inqilab” and “The Daily Jugantor” for auction sale of the scheduled properties. In response to the said auction sale notice, the present petitioner submitted its bid offering in all a sum of Tk. 6,10,00,000/- for the scheduled properties and by this offer, it became the highest bidder. On 11.04.2004, the respondent-bank filed an application before the Artha Rin Adalat to accept the bid of the petitioner as the decree-holder bank was satisfied therewith. But nevertheless the Artha Rin Adalat by its order dated 11.04.2004 refused to accept the bid of the petitioner-company holding, inter alia, that the offer was very low than the market price and fixed 28.04.2004 for taking necessary steps under Section 33(5) of the Ain of 2003. Anyway, the ‘Ka’ scheduled property is situated on Plot No. 354(old), 16 (new), Road No. 28(old), 15(new), Dhanmondi Residential Area, Dhaka (hereinafter mentioned as Dhanmondi property). The other scheduled properties are situated at Kachpur and Bahakoir under Sonargaon Upazilla in the District of Narayanganj. However, the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 refusing to accept the bid of the petitioner is unsustainable in law inasmuch as the decree-holder bank consented to the acceptance of the bid by the Executing Court. Furthermore, the bid of the petitioner-company can not be said to be shockingly low, regard being had to the market price of the properties of similar nature. The impugned order dated 11.04.2004 is, therefore, illegal, arbitrary and unreasonable.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the Supplementary Affidavit dated 18.08.2004 filed on behalf of the petitioner, it has been stated that at the time of preparation of the Writ Petition, the petitioner could not annex the certified copies of the plaint of the Title Suit No. 217 of 1992 and the judgment and decree dated 30.04.2001 passed therein and those documents are necessary for disposal of the instant Writ Petition and accordingly those documents have been annexed to the Supplementary Affidavit and marked as Annexure- ‘G’ series.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The respondent no. 2 Agrani Bank Limited has filed an Affidavit-in-Opposition in this Writ Petition.

The decree-holder bank thought it advisable to accept the bid of the petitioner-company by the Executing Court towards liquidation of the loan in the exigency of the prevailing circumstances. So far as the bank’s interest is concerned, the bank could be benefited in realizing the bid money and thereafter in realizing the balance amount through the process of law by attaching other moveable and immovable properties of the judgment-debtors and also by putting the judgment-debtors in civil prison as provided by Section 34 of the Ain of 2003. The offered price of the highest bidder was brought to the notice of the bank management for their decision regarding recovery of the bad debt. The bank management agreed to the sale of the mortgaged properties for the bid amount of Tk. 6,10,00,000/- for the time being. However, the non-acceptance of the offered price of the highest bidder (petitioner-company) is a matter of discretion of the learned Judge of the Executing Court.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The respondent nos. 3-6 and 8 have filed an Affidavit-in-Opposition in this Writ Petition. Their case, in short, is as follows:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">         </span>The Agrani Bank Limited, Principal Branch, Dhaka as plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 217 of 1992 on 24.10.1992 claiming recovery of Tk. 7,55,22,686.61/- as on 30.09.1992 by enforcing the sale of the mortgaged properties. The said suit was decreed by the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka by its judgment and decree dated 30.04.2001 with a direction to pay the decretal amount of Tk. 7,55,22,686.61/- along with interest at the rate of 20%. On 17.04.2003, the decree-holder bank filed Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 claiming recovery of Tk. 22,35,95,053/-; but no notice of the Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 was served upon the defendant-judgment-debtor-respondents as evidenced by Annexure-‘7’ series. The auction of the mortgaged properties was held and subsequently the sale was confirmed behind the back of the answering respondents. Besides, no Rule Nisi was prayed for upon the judgment-debtor-respondents in this Writ Petition; rather the Rule Nisi was prayed for only upon the respondent nos. 1 and 2 and accordingly the same was issued upon them only and the Rule was not contested by either of them. As there was no opposition of the Rule by the respondent no. 2-bank, the Rule Nisi was made absolute by the High Court Division by its judgment and order dated 23.08.2004 directing the respondent no. 1 to accept the bid of the petitioner-company, that is to say, Jubak Housing and Real Estate Development Limited. Accordingly the respondent no. 1, Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka, accepted the bid of the petitioner-company at Tk. 6,10,00,000/- by its order dated 03.10.2004 and issued a sale certificate by its order dated 20.11.2004 which was registered on 25.11.2004. Thereafter the auction-purchaser petitioner-company suddenly ousted and dispossessed the respondent nos. 3-8 on 28.05.2005. Subsequently these respondents enquired into the matter and came to know about the proceedings of the Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 and the orchestrated auction sale of the mortgaged properties of the judgment-debtors to the petitioner-company. However, during the pendency of the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006 in the Appellate Division, the petitioner transferred the Dhanmondi property of the judgment-debtors to one Md. Aminul Haque and Md. Aminul Haque transferred the same to the added respondent no. 14 Ope Properties Limited by a registered deed dated 20.01.2011. The added respondent no. 14 undertook a project of construction of a high-rise building on the Dhanmondi property to frustrate the purpose of the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006. Eventually on 20.05.2014, the Appellate Division allowed the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006 filed by the judgment-debtor-respondents and set aside the judgment and order dated 23.08.2004 passed by the High Court Division in this Writ Petition (Writ Petition No. 2067 of 2004) and remanded the Writ Petition to this Court for hearing and disposal of the Rule Nisi afresh on merit in accordance with law after issuing a Rule Nisi upon the appellants of the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006. Afterwards the High Court Division, in compliance with the directive of the Appellate Division given in the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006, issued a Rule Nisi upon the respondent nos. 3-8 and the High Court Division also directed the parties concerned to maintain status quo in respect of the possession of the property in question. The Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 is still pending for adjudication and the rest of the claimed amount of the decree-holder bank has remained unsatisfied. But even then, the most valuable properties including the Dhanmondi property of the judgment-debtors valuing more than Tk. 200,00,00,000/- (two hundred crore) were sold out at a throw-away price. The impugned order dated 11.04.2004 passed in the Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 refusing to accept the bid of the petitioner is lawful and as such no exception can be taken thereto.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The respondent no. 7 has filed a separate Affidavit-in-Opposition in this Writ Petition adopting the Affidavit-in-Opposition dated 21.08.2006 filed by the respondent nos. 3-6 and 8.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">The respondent no. 14 has filed an Affidavit-of-Facts in this Writ Petition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It has been stated in the Affidavit-of-Facts that the petitioner filed the Writ Petition challenging the order dated 11.04.2004 passed by the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka in the Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 refusing to accept the bid of the petitioner. However, the background facts are that the respondent no. 2 Agrani Bank Limited as plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 217 of 1992 in the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka against the respondent no. 3 and others for realization of Tk. 7,55,22,686.61/-. The said suit was decreed on contest against the defendant-judgment-debtors for a sum of Tk. 7,55,22,686.61/- with interest at the rate of 20% from 01.10.1992 till realization of the decretal amount within 90(ninety) days. As the defendant-judgment-debtor-respondents failed to pay the decretal amount as ordered, the decree-holder bank put the decree into execution by way of filing the Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 for realization of the decretal dues along with interest and costs. In the Execution Case, an auction notice was published in the newspaper for selling out the mortgaged properties and the petitioner Jubak Housing and Real Estate Development Limited offered the highest bid to the tune of Tk. 6,10,00,000/-. But the Executing Court by the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 refused to accept the bid as it was considered to be very low. Challenging the said order dated 11.04.2004, the petitioner filed the instant Writ Petition and a Division Bench of the High Court Division by its judgment and order dated 23.08.2004 made the Rule Nisi absolute. As against the judgment and order dated 23.08.2004 passed by the High Court Division in this Writ Petition (Writ Petition No. 2067 of 2004), the writ-respondent no. 3 filed Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006 in the Appellate Division. Ultimately after hearing the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006, the Appellate Division by its judgment and order dated 20.05.2014 allowed the appeal by setting aside the judgment and order dated 23.08.2004 passed in this Writ Petition and the Writ Petition was sent back to the High Court Division on remand for fresh adjudication. But before the rendition of the judgment of the Appellate Division in the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006, the Executing Court complied with the judgment and order dated 23.08.2004 passed by the High Court Division in this Writ Petition and accordingly the Executing Court by its order dated 20.11.2004 issued a sale certificate in favour of the auction-purchaser company and subsequently the sale was confirmed and made absolute. On 28.03.2005, the Executing Court made over the possession of the Dhanmondi property in favour of the auction-purchaser (writ-petitioner). At a subsequent stage, the auction-purchaser writ-petitioner sold the Dhanmondi property to one Md. Aminul Haque by a registered deed dated 21.12.2010. Md. Aminul Haque in his turn sold the self-same property (Dhanmondi property) to the respondent no. 14, that is to say, Ope Properties Limited by a registered deed dated 20.01.2011. The respondent no. 14, on obtaining requisite permission from various concerned authorities, constructed a 13-storied high-rise building thereon; but it was not made a party in this Writ Petition.

Admittedly the writ-petitioner was a fugitive from justice on the date he moved the Writ Petition. He was away from the country and craved permission of the Court to affirm affidavit on his behalf by one HBM Shoave Rahman. The permission was given and the learned Judges issued Rule Nisi as above. It is now settled that a fugitive from justice is not entitled to obtain a judicial order defying the process of the Court. Besides, the learned Advocates who move applications for the fugitives shall also have to face the consequence of committing Contempt of Court. This principle is being followed for over 60 years in this Sub-continent. References in this connection are Chand Shah Vs. Crown, 8 DLR (FC) 24, Gul Hassan Vs.

Admittedly, the writ-petitioner was convicted in absentia by the judgment and order dated 13<sup>th</sup> March, 2008 by the Special Judge, First Court, Dhaka. Naturally, the learned Special judge issued warrant for the execution of the sentence under Section 389 of the Code of Criminal Procedure at the time of delivery of judgment, and the writ-petitioner moved the petition on 17<sup>th</sup> September, 2008 when there was warrant for the execution of the sentence. We fail to understand in the backdrop of the case, how the learned Judges of the Division Bench could even entertain the Writ Petition on behalf of a fugitive from justice, ignoring the long-settled principles being followed by the Courts. If this process is allowed, the fugitives from justice, either convicted or not, will be emboldened and despite processes have been issued, they will defy the processes of the Courts and in such cases, the administration of criminal justice will crumple. We can not conceive of a more flagrant violation of this principle that a convict who seeks the interference of the sovereign to obtain revision of a judicial order must submit to the Court instead of engaging himself in setting that judicial order at naught. It is well-settled that when a person seeks remedy from a Court of law, either in writ jurisdiction or criminal appellate, revisional or miscellaneous jurisdiction under Section 516 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, he ought to submit to the due process of justice.

There can not be any iota of doubt thereabout. But none the less, the decision reported in 15 BLC (AD) 44 can not be shrugged off at all. Needless to say, the two convicts, namely, respondent nos. 5 and 8 are, amongst others, judgment-debtor-respondents in this Writ Petition. Admittedly those two respondents (respondent nos. 5 and 8) are yet to submit to the sentence passed against them by the criminal Court in G. R. Case No. 509 of 2008 on 21.05.2017. As things stand now, the respondent nos. 5 and 8 can not oppose or contest the Rule Nisi through their learned Advocate Mr. Khair Ezaz Maswood unless and until they submit to the sentence passed against them in G. R. Case No. 509 of 2008. As absconding convicts, we can not allow them to oppose and contest the Rule Nisi through their learned Advocate. If we do so, that will amount to setting the rule of law at naught. In the cited decision reported in 15 BLC (AD) 44, the convict came up with the Writ Petition seeking some relief; but in the instant case, by reason of their being respondent nos. 5 and 8, they are not seeking any relief, yet the fact remains that they can not derive any benefit or enjoy the fruit of any judgment or judicial order passed in this case so long as they remain fugitives from law. So the natural consequence is that Mr. Khair Ezaz Maswood can not represent the absconding convicts (respondent nos. 5 and 8) in this case. Precisely speaking, the ‘ratio’ of the decision reported in 15 BLC (AD) 44 will conversely apply to the facts and circumstances of the present case, in so far as the respondent nos. 5 and 8 are concerned. Be that as it may, this finding will not preclude Mr. Khair Ezaz Maswood from representing the other judgment-debtor-respondents and accordingly he can very well represent them in this case. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">40.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It is undisputed that initially at the instance of the writ-petitioner, a Rule Nisi was issued upon the respondent nos. 1 and 2 only leaving out the judgment-debtor-respondents. The petitioner-company, by way of a smart trick, made the prayer for issuance of the Rule Nisi on those two respondents only (respondent nos. 1 and 2). It may be noted that the respondent no. 1 is the Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka and the respondent no. 2 is the decree-holder bank. We have already seen that the respondent no. 2 (decree-holder bank) was a consenting party to the bid of the petitioner-company. In this perspective, the bank filed an application before the Executing Court for acceptance of the bid of the petitioner-company. From the conduct of the decree-holder bank, it seems that the bank was in collusion with the auction-purchaser, though the bid amount was less than one-third of the decretal dues. There is no gainsaying the fact that the application of the decree-holder bank for acceptance of the bid of the petitioner was rejected by the self-same impugned order dated 11.04.2004; but curiously enough, the decree-holder bank did not challenge the rejection of its application before the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution. It is only the auction-purchaser (petitioner-company) who has challenged the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 by filing the instant Writ Petition. The non-issuance of any Rule Nisi on the judgment-debtor-respondents at the instance of the petitioner-company, we feel constrained to hold, is a glaring manifestation of fraud. Ultimately the Appellate Division came to the rescue of the judgment-debtor-respondents and as per its directive given in the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006, the High Court Division issued a Rule Nisi upon them. However, this sort of fraud resorted to by the petitioner-company is deprecated. What is more, to our way of thinking, the non-issuance of the Rule Nisi initially upon the judgment-debtor-respondents, at the instance of the petitioner-company, was mala fide as well. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">41.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Admittedly the Rule Nisi initially issued upon the respondent nos. 1 and 2 was made absolute by the High Court Division by its judgment and order dated 23.08.2004.

But we are unable to accept this contention for the simple reason that the entire issue of auction purchase of the mortgaged properties stands re-opened for fresh adjudication by the High Court Division in consequence of the directive given by the Appellate Division in the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006. It is true that the Executing Court had to accept the bid of the petitioner-company, confirm the sale and eventually make over the possession of the mortgaged properties in favour of the petitioner-company by way of compliance with the judgment and order of the High Court Division dated 23.08.2004 passed in this Writ Petition.

The finding of the Executing Court that the bid money of the petitioner to the tune of Tk. 6,10,00,000/- was very low can not be found fault with in judicial review for justifiable reasons. In other words, we do not find that the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 was made by the Executing Court without any lawful authority. What we are driving at boils down to this: the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 is a valid and legal order passed under the proviso to Sub-Section (2) of Section 33 of the Ain of 2003. Consequently the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 can not be dubbed as an unreasonable, arbitrary and whimsical order. Furthermore, the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 does not fall within the ambit of the ‘ratios’ of the decisions reported in 15 BLD (AD) 175 and 58 DLR (AD) 107 (supra).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">47.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">With regard to the submission of Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud that the respondent no. 14 Ope Properties Limited purchased the Dhanmondi property of the judgment-debtors from one Md.
