Court of India has no jurisdiction to entertain this dispute when the dispute has arisen between the same parties out of a series of transaction so interlined that one party may have counter claim and a right to set off (if proved) against the other, then joinder of several causes of action in the same arbitration proceedings is permissible on the same principle as laid down in Rule 3(1) of Order 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Rather is necessary to avoid multiplicity of proceedings, to ensure proper and complete adjudication of the dispute as well as to save time and cost. It shall be held as well, to make the legal position clear, that, misinterpretation of law or non application of mind or misappreciation of any fact or evidence by the arbitrators, if results in any error in their decision occasioning failure of justice and causes prejudice to any party, then that will tantamount to misconduct on their part and the award, if impugned on any of these grounds, is liable to be set aside or modified, as the case may be. As noted earlier, the arbitral tribunal has committed patent illegally in refusing to consider the documents filed before them, on no cogent ground, and in refusing to exercise their jurisdiction on the ground that a civil suit was pending in India and then in refusing to entertain counter claim of the petitioner (the Opposite Party in arbitration). All these jointly and severally constitute misconduct on the part of this arbitral body. Hence, the award, passed in a majority of 2:1, is liable to be interfered with.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">    </span>. . .(15 to 18)</span></strong></span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000;">Mr. Mintu Kumar Mondal with </span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000;">Mr. M.

Meantime, 25 M/Tons of FCMP was sent at Benapole Port by the claimant-respondent as part re-placement of the aforesaid rejected consignment, but said consignment was also rejected due to “the consignment as unacceptable for human consumption”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That on 02.04.2009 the respondent sent letter to the petitioner to appoint Arbitrator to determine and decide their claims in respect of balance 20% payment of three contracts and three Performance Guarantees against shipments of SMP under those three contracts being Nos. 215/798/Milk-2/DGDP/ASC/P-8 dated 13.02.2006, 215/823 /MFS/SMP/DGDP/ASC/P-8 dated 05.03.2006, 215/824/MFS/FCMP/DGDP/ASC/P-8 dated 09.04.2006, respectively, which are withheld by the petitioner.

Zafarullah Chowdhury, one of the Arbitrators of the Arbitral Tribunal, pronounced the majority Award in favour of the claimant as prayed for holding that the claimant has performed his part in those three contracts and also held that the counter claim of the DGDP is not the subject matter of this Tribunal, since there is a suit pending before a Civil Court in India for the fourth contract, thus this Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain the same as the matter is subjudice before the civil court in India. On the other hand, Mr. M. Naser Alam, one of the Arbitrators, of the Arbitral Tribunal, pronounced the Award in favour of the DGDP, as prayed for, holding that the four contracts are interlinked with each others as per provision of clause 8 of D.P.-35 and this arbitration dispute has arisen due to the fourth contract and as such the fourth contract is a subject matter of this arbitration and as per provision of Form d.P.-35 and considering the correspondences made between the parties, the counter claim of the DGDP is maintainable in this arbitration proceedings and the Indian Court proceedings is in no manner is a bar to arbitrate or to adjudicate about the claim under the FCMP contract as per substantive and procedural law in Bangladesh. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">Being aggrieved by the said award, in the premises, the arbitral-respondent has filed this petition. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 109%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 109%;">Learned Advocates Mr. Mintu Kumar Mondal and Mr. M. A. Hannan Swapon, appeared for the petitioner. Having placed the petition and Supplementary Affidavits alongwith the documents annexed therewith, they submit that the dispute is about supply of Full Creamed Milk Powder (FCMP) supplied by the Karnal Milk Foods Limited (respondent in this matter). They contend that the respondent had supplied four consignments of FCMP to the petitioner, under four different letters of credit, as mentioned in the petition. The supplier-respondent has furnished four performance guarantees covering 10% for each LC proceeds. The consignments were shipped from India and were received in Bangladesh. Out of these four consignments, the one, shipped under the agreement dated 05.03.2006 for supply of 225 Metric Tons Full Creamed Milk Power, was received by the petitioner on payment of the duties etc and, thereafter, as par sub-clause 10(d) of the agreement, the goods received at the consignee’s end would be inspected by DADST(BIS)AHQ, ST Dte, Dhaka Cantonment or his authorized representative and the goods that might be found (by the inspectors) as not in accordance with the contracted quality shall be processed as per clause 10(b) of the agreement and that the Inspector’s verdict, regarding rejection and/or acceptance of the stores (goods) supplied, is final and will not be subject to arbitration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The petitioner-importer has arranged inspection of the imported milk powder and the inspectors, after inspection of the said quantity of goods, found the same (fourth consignments) unfit for human consumption, vide their report dated 05.07.2006 and another report dated 17.07.2006 (Annexure-C 1 series). Therefore, the petitioner-importer has refused to pay 20% of the balance payment, against this fourth consignment and have also refused to release the PGs. At this stage, the respondent-supplier has referred the matter to the Arbitration and the Arbitrator Council has passed the impugned Awarded. The learned Advocates have further contented that, the petitioner has supplied four consignments with clear stipulation that the agreement will be governors by D.P. 35, revised in 1960. The supplier has accepted the said terms and conditions in writing, vide their letter dated 30.08.2005, but the learned Arbitration Tribunal passed the awarded by a majority of 2:1, without taking into consideration the provisions contained in D.P. 35, that was part of the contract. Besides, the learned Arbitrator Mr. Zafurullah Chowdhury, although in his opinion recorded to have received inspection report, but he has recorded in another place that such inspection reports dated 05.07.2006 and 17.07.2006 were not submitted before the Tribunal. This shows, the learned Advocates submit, a clear non application mind by the learned Arbitrator Mr. Zafurullah <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Chowdhury and, therefore, he has arrived at a wrong finding. Besides, the majority of the Tribunal held that the arbitration-respondent has not initiated any arbitration proceedings over the matter, but has pressed their case only by way of counter claim, hence the Tribunal cannot give any relief to the respondent by way of counter claim. Besides, the majority view that the claim of the arbitration respondent/importer should not be entertained, since a civil suit over the dispute was pending India, is not proper, learned advocates further submit. Thus, they asserts that, the majority of the learned arbitrators have refused to exercise the jurisdiction vested in them upon misinterpretation of law and that the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>majority view was improper and the award passed in this circumstances is liable to be set aside. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">Learned Advocate Mr. Mehran Morshed appeared for the respondent (exporter), who was the supplier and had resorted to the arbitration proceeding. The learned Advocate first of all submits that, the Court may not sit in appeal over the impugned award, nor should modify the award simply because a different conclusion is possible. The learned Advocate next submits that this Court has ample jurisdiction to adjudicate upon their claim and the entire dispute, including the issue regarding D.P. 35. He also strenuously argues that the D.P.35 is not applicable to these contracts and that the learned Arbitration Tribunal has correctly passed the impugned award by a majority of 2:1, since the petitioner was not entitled to get any relief<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>on the basis of the counter claim made by them or on any other ground. He, therefore, concludes that the award impugned before this Court does not call for any interference and that the petition may be rejected and the order of stay passed at the time of admission may be vacated. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">I have heard the learned Advocates, perused the petition and the Affidavit-in-Opposition, the documents submitted before this Court vis-à-vis the impugned award. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">This is admitted that the petitioner and the respondent before this court had entered into four contracts, as described the paragraph 4 of the substantive petition.

It is also not disputed that the goods imported under the contracts were subject to post shipment inspections to be carried out as per sub-clause (d) of the clause 10 of agreement dated 05.03.2006. It is also not disputed that the inspection, in respect of the goods received under the fourth consignments, was held on 05.07.2006 and 17.07.2006. The said two reports have been annexed to the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioner, marked as Annexures- C series and C1. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">I find that the learned Arbitrator Mr. Zafarullah Chowdhury has recorded, in paragraph number 9 of his opinion that, “ in paragraph J of the statement of defense (of DGDP) it was stated that, an inspection was carried out on 05.07.2006 (Inspection report No.6007/05/AFFDL/24) and another inspection was carried out on 17.07.2006 (6007/5/ AFFDL/25). On the basis of these two inspection report request for replacement of consignment was made to the claimant on 19.07.2006 (Annexure 08) of statement of (their) defence on the allegation that the milk powder supplied under the contract is not fit for their purpose and as such they have rejected the goods with a request for replacement. It may me mentioned here that, though the basis of rejection of goods was inspection reports dated 05.07.2006 and 17.07.2006, but no such inspection reports were submitted before the Tribunal. Nor such reports were ever supplied to the claimant.” With reference to what has been quoted here, I find that the learned Arbitrator Mr. Zafarullah Chowdhury simply noted that, no inspection report, referred in the statement of defense (find by on behalf of DGDP), was not submitted before the Arbitrational Tribunal. This situation is quite different from the argument advanced, on this issue, by the learned advocates on the petitioner.

This is, in my opinion, a clear case of refusal of the tribunal to exercise a jurisdiction vested in them by law, while clause 14 of the agreement between the parties stipulates, amongst other, that, the court of arbitration “shall grant both the parties full opportunity to present their case and their proofs in writing and by word of mouth in the course of the proceedings.” Even in the absence of such a stipulation, the Arbitral Tribunal was and is always competent, rather is duty bound by the very nature of its jurisdiction, to allow adequate opportunities to the parties in dispute to place their respective cases and evidences in a fashion less formal than is required to be followed in the law courts. The arbitrators should resort to the inquisitorial system of adjudication, alongside the adversial system. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">13.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The finding of the learned Chairman to the effect that, since a Civil Court in India is in seisen of the same dispute, therefore, the Tribunal cannot give any relief to the respondent (petitioner before this court) and that the respondent was not entitled to any relief claimed by way of counter claim is another reason that has shaped the majority view in passing the impugned award.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-outline-level: 1; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">14.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt;">On this issue, Tribunal has utterly failed to take into notice that the contract was signed between two foreign parties and the law applicable as well as the forum to decide the disputes have already been decided by and between the contracting parties.
