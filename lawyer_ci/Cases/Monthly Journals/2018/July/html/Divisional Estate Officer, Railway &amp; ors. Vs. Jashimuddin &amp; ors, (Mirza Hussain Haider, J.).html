But the defendants having not challenged either of those documents, their plea that the deed dated 17.12.1955 (Exhibit-1) is hit by section 75A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act is not at all tenable. Thus the finding of all the courts that âsection 75A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act is not at all attracted in the present suitâ, is thus correct finding of fact and law.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">Â Â  </span>. . .(19)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman Bold',serif; letter-spacing: -.4pt; mso-font-width: 90%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">State Acquisition and Tenancy Act (XXVIII of 1951)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Section 144A</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Evidence Act (I of 1872)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Section 101</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: right 210.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-fareast-font-family: BatangChe; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">The S.A. record was prepared in the name of Khodeza Begum who paid rents to the government and thereafter on transfer Zumuruddin, the predecessor of the plaintiffs, got his name mutated in place of Khodeza Begum in the government record and lastly, the plaintiffs got their names mutated in place<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Â  </span>of their predecessors Zumuruddin in 1993 it is not understood as to how the R.S. record could be prepared in the name of the defendants after more than one hundred years of alleged acquisition in 1882 about which the plaintiffs came to know much later in 2002. In this respect, the High Court Division while reversing the finding of the courts below considered section 144A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act as well as several decisions of this Division and came to the conclusion that âthe burden of proof, in civil litigations initially is upon the plaintiff, but depending on the circumstances, it also shifts upon the defendantâ. In the present case since the defendants did not deny the title of the plaintiffs, specifically, in their pleadings or in their evidences and since the defendants totally failed to prove acquisition of the suit land by LA Declaration of 1882 by adducing sufficient evidence, the burden of proof is thus shifted upon the defendants to prove their foundation of recording their names in the R.S. record.

Khatian No. 70(Umo) originally belonged to Yeasin Hazi who after transferring some part of it, owned and possessed 0.29 acre of land. Thereafter he died leaving behind Duburunnesa(Saburun Nessa) as his heir. Duburunnesa owned and possessed the said quantum of land till she transferred the same in favour of Khodeza Begum by a registered deed of lease bearing No. 7752 on 15.12.1955 and delivered possession thereof to her and thereafter on 24.01.1956, Duburunnesa transferred her rent receiving interest to Khodeza Begum by registered deed of sale No. 1142 dated 24.01.1956. Consequently S.A. record was prepared in the name of Khodeza Begum and she used to pay rents to the Government regularly. Khodeza Begum died leaving behind two sons and a daughter and they also used to own and possess the same like their predecessor. On 31.03.1969, the said heirs of Khodeza Begum transferred their entire share in the said 0.29 acre of land by registered deed of sale No. 2269 dated 31.3.1969 in favour of Zumur Uddin. Thereafter Zummuddin got his name mutated in place of his predecessor and enjoyed the same till his death. At the time of his death he left behind two sons, four daughters and one wife, (plaintiffs No. 1 to 7) who have been possessing the entire suit land for more than 60 years, continuously, within the knowledge of the defendants and others. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: BatangChe; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">On 19.09.2002, when the plaintiff No. 1 went to the Tahsil Office to pay rent, the Tahsilder informed him that the suit land was recorded in the name of Bangladesh Railway and the Ministry of Defence.

The plaintiffs have no right, title and possession in the suit land.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-fareast-font-family: BatangChe; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">The written statement of defendant No. 4 supported the case of defendant Nos. 1-3. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-pagination: widow-orphan lines-together; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 2.7pt 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-fareast-font-family: BatangChe; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">The trial Court dismissed the suit by judgment and decree dated 29.03.2007 upon hearing the parties on contest against which the plaintiffs preferred<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">Â Â Â Â  </span> Title<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Â  </span>Appeal No. 63 of 2007 before the learned District Judge, Narayangonj, who transferred the same to the 2nd Court of Additional District Judge, Narayangonj, for disposal.

He submits that the High Court Division erroneously made the Rule absolute without reversing the concurrent findings of the courts below. He further submits that the R.S Khatian was prepared upon holding physical survey in the field and the plaintiffs having not been found in physical possession in the suit plot and the same being situated at the heart of Narayanganj town/city and no objection having been filed under Rules 30 and 31 of the Tenancy Rules 1954 the plaintiffsâ claim of title and possession, since purchase in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Â  </span>1969, is nothing but a got up story rather a cock and bull story which both the Courts below categorically found to be without any legal basis.

In the absence of such specific denial the assertion made by the plaintiffs is to be deemed as admission under Order VIII Rules 3 and 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. He further submits that the plaintiffs produced all original deeds of 1955, 1956 and of 1969 and those being more than 30 years old documents those are very much genuine and admissible under section 90 of the Evidence Act. Moreover these documents having not been challenged by the defendants those are admitted as genuine. He further submits that mere recording of any oneâs name in the R.S. record of right is not an evidence of title and as such the defendants having not proved the foundation of RS record of right, title does not vest in them and both the courts below having concurrently found that the defendants failed to prove the foundation of the R.S. record the High Court Division rightly made the Rule absolute and decreed the suit. It is also submitted that the plaintiffs and defendants examined 2 witnesses each and the plaintiffs produced large number of documents but the courts below without discussing a single evidence dismissed the suit in violation of the mandatory provision of law. He further submits that the defendants never challenged the title of Dubirunnessa Begum. Their only grievance is that the lease deed dated 15.12.1955 is hit by section 75A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act but the Courts below upon dismissing the facts and circumstances of the case and the law concurrently found that the said provision is not attracted in the present suit and as such the dismissal of the suit by the courts below was illegal. Mr. Bhuiyan also submits that the court of appeal below misread and misconstrued the material evidence on record and without proper application of the same in its true perspective, made out a third case that âthe plaintiffs by making some documents have been trying to validate their title through the intervention of the Court as the Railway and the Defence Ministry had an indifferent attitudeâ. Thus it committed serious error of law, resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. But the High Court Division upon considering the law and the fact in its true perspective rightly found title and possession of the plaintiffs in the suit land and accordingly made the Rule absolute upon setting aside the judgment and decree of both the Courts below.

The law of pleadings is very clear in this respect. It is said that the defendant is found to deal specifically each allegation of fact, the truth of which is not admitted. The written statement must not only deal with specifically, the defendants must also answer the point of substance. If the denial of fact is not specific but evasive, the said fact shall be taken to be admitted. In such event, the admission itself being the proof, no other proof is necessary. This view, is supported by a decision of this Division in the case of <strong><em>Zafela Begum Vs. Akitulla (16 BLC(AD)46).</em> </strong>The High Court Division, it further appears, took into consideration Exhibits 1, 1(Ka) and 1(Ga) the Original deeds of transfer dated 17.12.1955, 24.1.1956 and 31.3.1969 which are all more than 30 years old documents, and as such are very much admissible in evidence under Section 90 of the Evidence Act and those documents have strong presumption of genuineness. But the defendants having not challenged either of those documents, their plea that the deed dated 17.12.1955(Exhiit-1) is hit by section 75A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act is not at all tenable. Thus the finding of all the courts that âsection 75A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act is not at all attracted in the present suitâ, is thus correct finding of fact and law.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 102%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 102%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 102%; mso-fareast-font-family: BatangChe; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">It further appears that the S.A. record was prepared in the name of Khodeza Begum <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">who paid rents to the government and thereafter</span> on transfer Zumuruddin, the predecessor of the plaintiffs, got his name mutated in place of Khodeza Begum in the government record and lastly, the plaintiffs got their names mutated in place<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Â  </span>of their predecessors Zumuruddin in 1993 it is not understood as to how the R.S. record could be prepared in the name of the defendants after more than one hundred years of alleged acquisition in 1882 about which the plaintiffs came to know much later in 2002. In this respect, the High Court Division while reversing the finding of the courts below considered section 144A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act as well as several decisions of this Division and came to the conclusion that âthe burden of proof, in civil litigations initially is upon the plaintiff, but depending on the circumstances, it also shifts upon the defendantâ. In the present case since the defendants did not deny the title of the plaintiffs, specifically, in their pleadings or in their evidences and since the defendants totally failed to prove acquisition of the suit land by LA Declaration of 1882 by adducing sufficient evidence, the burden of proof is thus shifted upon the defendants to prove their foundation of recording their names in the R.S. record. Having failed to do so the High Court Division, relying on the case of <strong><em>Cinmoy Chowdhury and another Vs. Sree Mridul Chowdhury and others(23 BLD(AD)83) and Jonab Ali Mondal and others Vs. Md. Anowar Hossain and others (24 BLD 243),</em></strong> rightly came to the <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">conclusion that the RS record has been prepared</span> wrongly in the name of the defendants. Moreover, the defendants neither in their pleading nor in their depositions specifically denied publication of C.S. and S.A. record in the name of Yasin Hazi and his subsequent transferees through his daughter Duburunnessa. Apart from the above all the subsequent transferees got their names recorded and mutated in the government record and accordingly they had been paying rents to the government in respect of the suit land. A question may arise what is the presumptive value of final publication of record of rights. In the case of <strong><em>Akbor Ali Vs. Zahiruddin (30 DLR (SC) 81)</em></strong> it has been observed âEven final publication of record of rights showing one in occupation of the suit land would not ifsofacto rebut the presumption raised by entries in the earlier record of rights. According to law both the records of rights shall be presumed to be correct at the respective dates of their final publication. Whether the presumption of correctness of the entries in the particular record of right has been rebutted or not shall have to be decided with reference to the facts and circumstances in each caseâ. Thus the question as to whether the presumption of correctness of either of the record of right rebuttable on the other will depend upon the evidence adduced by the parties in the case.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">21.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-fareast-font-family: BatangChe; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">In the present case it is claimed by the defendants that the suit land along with other lands was acquired by LA declaration of 1882 but no evidence to that effect has been led by the defendants. On the other hand the plaintiffs claim that the Yasin Haji, the original owner is a C.S. recorded tenant, which is generally known to have been prepared in 1920, i.e. much after the alleged acquisition of the suit land in 1882. Thereafter all the subsequent transferees, through Yasin Hajiâs daughter, Duburunnessa, which is not challenged by the defendants in their pleading or in the evidence, got their names recorded in SA record as well as got the same mutated in the government record. In the absence of specific assertions being not denied by the defendants specifically either in their written statement or in their evidence the court is not inclined to permit the defendants to raise such a question at a belated stage nor the court should consider such plea. Now question is on the face of all these records how the R.S. record could be prepared in the name of the defendants after more than one hundred years of so called acquisition. The evidence on records shows that the defendants miserably failed to prove such recording on any legal basis. Thus in the present case the plaintiffs having proved their better title, if not to the hilt, than that of the defendants it is enough to decide the case in their favours. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">22.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-fareast-font-family: BatangChe; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">From the discussions made herein above since the plaintiffs have been successful in proving their genealogy of title and possession in the suit land and since the defendants failed to challenge the documents relied upon by the plaintiffs and also failed to prove their case of title and possession, it can clearly be held that the defendants have no title and possession in the suit land. On the other hand the plaintiffs could prove the title of Yeasin Hazi, the C.S. recorded tenant and thereafter devolution of title and possession upon his daughter Duburunnessa who in her turn transferred the same to Khodeza Begum by two<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Â  </span>registered documents in 1955 and 1956 which are more than 30 years old documents and relying on such registered documents Khodeza Begumâs name being recorded in the S.A. record and thereafter Zumuruddin, the predecessor of the plaintiffs having purchased the same got his name mutated in place of Khodeza Begum in the office of the Government, and after his death his heirs, the plaintiffs having got their names mutated, the title and possession of the plaintiffs are found to be proved.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 26.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">23.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-fareast-font-family: BatangChe; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Thus the High Court Division, in my considerate view, did not commit any illegality in passing the impugned judgment upon setting aside the findings of the courts below and decreeing the suit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 26.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-fareast-font-family: BatangChe; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Accordingly we do not find any merit in this appeal.
