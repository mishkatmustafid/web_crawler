The Investigating Officer, after investigation, submitted supplementary police report no. 149 dated 10.06.2013 in which the petitioner and other 9 accused persons were not sent up. The informant again submitted a Naraji application on 25.08.2013 with a prayer to take cognizance against all the accused persons stating that the Investigating Officer without examining eye witnesses filed the investigation report. The learned Magistrate again examined the informant under Section 200 of the CrPC and, after hearing both the parties, by his order dated 30.06.2014, was pleased to accept the supplementary police report no. 149 dated 10.06.2013 and cleared the not-sent-up accused persons, including Dr. Akhtaruzzaman, off the accusation brought against them in the FIR. The informant being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the order dated 30.06.2014 preferred Criminal Revision No. 686 of 2014 before the learned Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Rajshahi who upon hearing the informant and the State was pleased to allow the revision directing the learned Magistrate to conduct judicial inquiry of this case by his Judgment and Order dated 28.10.2014 and, accordingly, the learned Magistrate upon carrying out judicial inquiry of the occurrence submitted a report on 12.01.2015 and, thereafter, on 21.04.2015 the learned Magistrate of cognizance Court for “Ka-Anchal” took cognizance against the petitioner and other 15 persons.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Mrs. Tania Amir, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner, takes us through the police reports and contends that this case was investigated three times by three different Investigating Officers, who all, after examining the neutral and relevant witnesses, found that the petitioner and some other accused persons have been falsely implicated in the case out of grudge for protesting the illegal drug trafficking of the informant and the victim and submits that, in passing the impugned order for judicial inquiry of the case, the learned Sessions Judge acted whimsically causing unnecessary harassments to the accused-petitioner who is known as a philanthropist in the locality.

To this end, we may look at the chronology of events that took place during the investigation of this case. After receiving the first police report dated 25.11.2010 and upon going through the Naraji petition of the informant, the learned Magistrate found it to be an improper police report and by his order dated 31.05.2011 directed further investigation by the CID having made an observation that IO having been seriously influenced by the FIR-named accused persons, abstained from recording the statements of the relevant witnesses under Section 161 and 164 of the CrPC with a motive to save some FIR-named accused and made a recommendation to the higher authority of police to take disciplinary action against the said IO. Unfortunately, the supplementary police report dated 15.06.2012 was also found by the learned Magistrate to have been prepared by the IO without recording the statements of the vital witnesses of this case. Looking at the contents of the said police report on top of the informant’s Naraji petition, the learned Magistrate again ordered for further investigation upon making some specific recommendations as to recording of statements of some specific witnesses under Section 161 and 164 of the CrPC. The IO, then, submitted his police report on 10.06.2013. When the informant again filed Naraji petition, the learned Magistrate upon examining the informant on 01.10.2013 under Section 200 of the CrPC adjourned the matter for hearing the Naraji petition and thereby passing necessary order. Ultimately, on 30.06.2014 the learned Magistrate accepted the police report and rejected the Naraji petition, against which criminal revision was filed and the learned Sessions Judge ordered judicial inquiry.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">15.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">From a minute perusal of the entire order-sheets, and side-by-side the order dated 30.06.2014 by which the police report was accepted and informant’s Naraji Petition was rejected, it appears to us that the learned Magistrate did not consider the observations and recommendations made by his two predecessors as to flouting the orders of recording the statements of the relevant witnesses. Had he minutely gone through the previous orders, he would have either ordered for further investigation or judicial inquiry of the case. The best course of action could have been for him to proceed with judicial inquiry given that the police department has demonstrated unprofessionalism in carrying out the investigation of this case. In the case of Shah Kutubuddin Talukder @ Ruyel Vs.

In fact, after examining the informant under Section 200 of the CrPC, the learned Magistrate was duty bound to examine the other witnesses listed in the Naraji application and, thereafter, the learned Magistrate either could have taken cognizance directly under Section 190(1)(a) of the CrPC, if satisfied, or could have proceeded towards judicial inquiry.

The same errors were committed by the learned Magistrates when they passed the subsequent orders on 15.06.2012 and 01.10.2013. The learned Magistrates appeared to be oblivious of the fact that they were passing orders for further investigation under Section 173(3B) of the CrPC and, for that purpose, they are not required to consider the Naraji application as complaint petition leading to examination of the complainant. In this sort of situations, the learned Magistrate should treat the Naraji application as an ‘Objection’, as was observed in paragraph 24 of the case of Md. Kamruzzaman Vs The State 2017(2) LNJ 19. All that we wish to record that whenever a Magistrate examines a complainant under Section 200 of the CrPC, the former is required to take recourse to the provisions of either Section 190(1)(a) of the CrPC or proceed towards the provisions of Sections 202, 203 &amp; 204 of the CrPC, as the case may appear to the Magistrate, but the Magistrate cannot resort to the provisions of Sections 156(3) or 173(3B) of the CrPC once the complainant is examined under Section 200 of the CrPC. The above discussions lead us to hold that the order dated 30.06.2014 passed by the Magistrate and, also, the previous orders dated 15.06.2012 and 01.10.2013 were illegal and, therefore, the learned Metropolitan Sessions Judge of Rajshahi has rightly set aside the order dated 30.06.2014 in exercising his revisional power under Sections 435 read with 439 of the CrPC.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Now, we may take up the question no. 2 as to whether the learned Sessions Judge has committed illegality by not hearing the petitioner before us.

The trial of a criminal case in our system starts from the stage of placing the case by the Public Prosecutor before the trial Court towards framing charge against an accused and if an accused is discharged at the stage of commencement of trial under Sections 241A/265C of the CrPC and, against the said order of discharge, if the informant/ complainant/State seeks revision under Sections 435 read with Section 439 of the CrPC, in that event, the revisional Court in absence of the accused cannot pass any order, for, the said accused having been discharged by the trial Court becomes entitled to a hearing. We, therefore, hold that when any Court passes an order against a person, who has been discharged under Section 241A/265C of the CrPC, terming and treating him as an accused and thereby to commence investigation/further investigation/inquiry against the said discharged person, it would be an ‘order made to the prejudice of the accused’, as enunciated in Section 439(2) of the CrPC. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">28.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In this case, the accused was not discharged by the trial Court and, thus, the petitioner’s situation does not come within the purview of sub-Section (2) of Section 439 of the CrPC and therefore there was no illegality in not hearing the accused-petitioner when the revision petition was heard and order for judicial inquiry was passed.

It transpires from the order sheets that the impugned order was passed on 28.10.2014 by the learned Metropolitan Sessions Judge of Rajshahi and, pursuant to the said order, upon carrying out judicial inquiry, cognizance was taken against the accused-petitioner on 21.04.2015 and, then, on 06.08.2015 the affidavit of this petition was sworn in and, thereafter, this petition was moved before this Court on 19.08.2015.

The learned Advocate for the accused-petitioner puts her best effort to make out<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>a case of quashment of proceedings by submitting that the accused-petitioner filed this application under Section 561A of the CrPC with an expectation to have the above case quashed on the grounds that while at the 3 <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">(three) separate investigations (after submissions</span> of the police report by the first Investigating Officer, there were another two further investigations) made by the three different Investigating Officers (IO) no primary evidence of commission of offence under Sections 302/114/34 of the Penal Code was found against him, taking cognizance against him by the learned Judicial Magistrate, pursuant to the learned Sessions Judge’s Order (which is primarily challenged in this Court) passed in the revision filed by the informant is illegal and, thus, continuation of the proceedings of the case against the petitioner is an abuse of the process of the Court. It is her submission that the petitioner, in fact, has challenged the proceedings against him under Section 561A of the CrPC and the technical issues as to proper formation of ‘cause title’ or ‘prayer’ in this petition are to be ignored. If this Court, upon conceding the above argument, converts this application from ‘an application for setting aside the impugned order’ into ‘an application for quashment of the proceeding against the petitioner’, it would go against the interest of the accused-petitioner inasmuch as in course of examining these issues, this Court might find that there are sufficient materials for prosecuting the accused-petitioner as, on top of disclosing the offence against the accused-petitioner in the FIR, the judicial inquiry substantiates the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima-facie</em> case against him, then he shall be deprived of filing an application under Section 265C of the CrPC when the case would be transferred to the trial Court. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">32.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The net result of the above question-wise discussions is that the learned Sessions Judge has not committed any illegality in directing judicial inquiry of the case, for, firstly, the learned Sessions Judge was not legally bound to dispose of the revision application in presence of the accused-petitioner and the accused-petitioner was not prejudiced by the impugned order and, secondly, after taking cognizance of the offence against the petitioner by the Magistrate, the best course of action for the accused petitioner is to seek discharge at the commencement of the trial and, if the same is not allowed, then, assist the trial Court to complete the trial quickly. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">33.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In the result, the Rule is discharged.
