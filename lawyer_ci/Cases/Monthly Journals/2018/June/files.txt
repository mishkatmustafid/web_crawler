Subsequently, the suits were renumbered as Other Class Suit Nos.36, 37 and 38 of 1984. Their case, in short, is that the suit property described in ‘Ka’ schedule to the plaint originally belonged to Banomadhab Saha, while ‘Kha’ schedule land to Banomadhab Saha and one Jatish Chandra Saha in equal 8 annas share. Banomadhab Saha had no son but had a daughter Panchanani Saha. He orally gifted his entire property to his daughter Panchanani Saha as ‘Yautaka’, during her marriage with Sarart Chandra, who began to live in the house of Banomadhab as domesticated son-in-law and possessed the gifted property. Jotish Chandra Saha gifted his 8 annas share to his mother Dharijyamoyee Saha and delivered possession to her, who in course of her owning and possessing in her absolute right, gifted the same to her brother-in-law’s daughter Panchanani by a registered deed of gift dated 07.10.1941. Said Panchanani thereby became owner of 16 annas share of the entire suit property described in ‘Ka’ and ‘Kha’ schedules to the plaint. While owning and possessing the same through her bargadars, she died on 05.12.1967 childless but her husband Sarat Chandra while owning and possessing the same died on 16.03.1972 leaving behind 3 grand sons, namely, Prosanjit, Nitai and Amarendra, all son’s sons of Sarashibala, the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>predeceased first wife Banamadhab. The aforesaid grandsons of of Banamadhab are the plaintiffs in the instant suit and they became owners of 16 annas share of the suit property. Defendant No.1, Abul Hossain Khan, a desperate person, disclosed in the month of July,1976 that he has purchased the suit property in the month of Joistha,1383 B.S. from defendant No.2, Rashik Lal but as a matter of fact, he had no interest whatsoever in the property inasmuch as his father Tustalal, full sister’s son of Banomadhab had died before Panchanani on 30.03.1965 Thus the plaintiffs’ title became clouded and hence the suit was filed. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New';">Defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing written statement, denying all the material statements made in the plaint.

The appellate Court found that even if it is found that Joytish Chandra did not make oral gift to Dharijyamoyee, Dharijyamoyee got half of ‘Kha’ schedule land after death of his son Joytish Chandra Shaha as life estate. The appellate Court rightly found that Dharijyamoyee could legally transfer the property which she got in life interest to Panchanani for legal necessity. The appellate Court noted that Dharijyamoyee became blind and Panchanani used to look after her and that prompted Dharijyamoyee to make gift of half of ‘Kha’ schedule land to Panchanani.

The facts which have been narrated in the plaint proved that it is an after thought concocted story has only been created for the purpose to sought a prayer for recovery of the possession of the suit property wherein he had never in possession.

Case No. 102 of 2000 on 13.3.2000 by the order of the Court. So it is crystal clear that the averment of the plaint were totally false. He has further pointed that before dispossession of the defendant Respondents from the suit property by the order of the Court on 13.3.2000 there was a dacoity in the house of the defendant-respondents with the help of the unscrupulous police force of the Dhanmondi Police Station. Though at the time of dacoity the defendants sought help of the police of Dhanmondi Police Station but the police<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>was not<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>active<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>or diligent helping the defendants-respondents though dacoity was committed by the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>miscreants not less than two hours. The news of the dacoity was published in the Daily Ittefaque, Daily Inqilab and other daily news papers by giving specific caption on 14.03.2000. At the time of dacoity the valuable papers of the defendants were looted by the looters. It is curious enough that the plaintiff after events of dacoity and lootings all the papers of the defendants stand as swindler Md. Masudur Rahman and started to claim the suit property as Md. Masudur Rahman however, before that none including the plaintiff claimed that they are the sole proprietor of the suit property. The learned Advocate for the respondents in support of his submissions refers the following exhibits on behalf of the defendants which were marked as Ext. Gha’ and ‘Umo to Uma-2.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">35.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Mr. Biswas referring exhibits Gha and Uma series the newspapers pointed that the appellant only after occurring the events of dacoity in the suit property came to the scene claiming that he is Md. Azahar Hossain @ Masudur Rahman. However, considering the documentary evidence i.e. Ext.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>13 deed No. 1558 dated 20.6.1991 in the name of Md. Masudur Rahman and seller Haji Helal Uddin Dhali and his wife it is crystal clear that purchaser Masudur Rahman is the son of Ahmed Hossain of 95/C New Elephant Road, Dhanmondi. However, from the plaint it reveals that the plaintiff never used to reside specifically in the suit property or 95/C New Elephant Road at the time of purchase or later on as Masudur Rahman. He did not<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>reside in the address of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>deed. More-over, it further appears from the documentary evidence and plaint and deposition of the P.W. 1 i.e. the plaintiff is/was resident of 6 Waiseghat and an employee of the office of the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka. However, he never, used or resides on the address of the deed. In the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Ext. 13 deed No. 1558 dated 20.06.1991 purchaser profession was business and father’s name was Ahmed Hossain. But according to school certificate and his official record of the plaintiff it is clearly evident that he is not business man and his father name is/was not Ahmed Hossain rather, his father’s name is Shahjahan Bhuyain and his profession was service. It appears from the deposition and cross-examination of P.W.-1 he has admitted that neither in the school certificate of his children nor his office<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Masudur Rahman is his name. Rather, in his school certificate according to his admission his name is Azaher Hossasin. He has also admitted in cross-examination that he did not take any permission from his superior authority to purchase the property in benami. He has further admitted in his cross-examination that he did not reside in the suit property but allegedly claimed that rented the property to the tenants. He also admitted that defendant-respondents are in possession but claimed as tenant. He has also admitted that in the Birth Registration Certificates of his children the name of the father has not been written Masudur Rahman Bhuiyan. He has also admitted that before the year of 2000 he had purchased some lands, however, in those deeds he did not mention his name as Masudur Rahman Bhuiyan. He has further admitted in his cross-examination that the possession of the suit property was taken by the Officer-in-Charge, Dhanmondi Police Station through non-F.I.R. Case No. 102 of 2000 as receiver from the defendant Nos. 1-4. However, later on he claimed that they were tenants. So, from the above reply in cross it is crystal clear that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>this P.W. 1 i.e. the plaintiff has failed to prove his possession by<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>giving credible<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>testimony and reply in cross. Rather, the testimonies of the plaintiff as PW. 1 is not only inconsistent but full of contradiction and concocted story. Learned Advocate for the respondents has further very candidly argued that the plaintiff to prove his case examined 3 witnesses i.e. (1) the plaintiff himself as PW. No.1 ( 2) Lutfor Rahman as PW. No.2 and (3) Md. Monirul Islam as PW. No. 3. From the testimony of P.W. 1 it appears that in his deposition<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>he has<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>stated<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>his wife is the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>owner of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>shop which is situated 95C New Elephant Road. But in his deposition he did not state that he submitted the deed of that shop showing the title of his wife nor he exhibited the said deed in the Court. Moreover, in his deposition he stated that he had married with one Sabina Yeasmin (Rakiba) on 7.3.1980 at the time of marriage he mentioned his name in kabinnama Md. Azaher Hossain (Masud) and father’s name Ahmed Hossain (Shahjahan). The learned Advocate referred the kabinnama Ext. 2 and pointed that the copy of the kabinnama neither certified nor original one. More-so, the plaintiff to prove the Kabinnama did not call for any attesting witness nor he produced his wife as a witness to prove the Ext. 2. So, this exhibit is nothing but a concocted and manufactured one, hence, the same has been created purposely only to use in the case. He has further argued that some certificates were produced which were marked as exhibit 3 and 4 to prove those certificate the plaintiff neither adduced any attesting witness or call for issuing authority. More-so he argued that the issuance authority as has been shown in those 2 exhibits i.e. 3 and 4 they have no legal and lawful authority to issue any such certificates without verification the actual name in violation of the law of the Birth Registration, school certificate and the official record of his public service and, as such, those certificates are nothing but manipulated and concocted piece of papers, however, have been created only for the purpose of the case. He has further argued that the plaintiff rather by giving those created and anti-dated papers proved that those have only been created for the purpose of the case<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>after filing the suit. The learned Advocate for the respondents<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>referring<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>exhibit 6 has argued that Natarial certificate and affidavit before the Notary Public has been created showing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>date 28.8.1989 declaring that his actual name is Md. Azhar Hossain and nick name is Md. Masudur Rahman however, from the Ext. 13 deed No. 1558 dated<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>28.6.1991 it is crystal clear that the affidavit exhibit -6 has been created purposely giving ante date because if the exhibit 6 had actually been done on 28.08.1989 declaring his name Md. Azhar Hossain and nick name is Md. Masudur Rahman then later on in the exhibit 13 dated 28.06.1991 the plaintiff surely used his actual name Md. Azhar Hossain with nick name Md. Masudur Rahman. He has further referring the exhibit-1 argued that the contents of the affidavit has not been proved by the plaintiff. He fortifying his argument said that the exhibit has not been proved by the deponent who made it although deponent is none but the father of the plaintiff. So it has no evidential value. So, it is depicted from the Ext. 1,2,3,4 and 6 that those exhibits were created after thought by giving ante-date creating and inserting false name<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Masudur Rahman in those exhibits.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">36.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">The learned Advocate for the respondents has further pointed that it is admitted by the plaintiff that he is an employee of the office of the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka. So, there is a serious question of doubt why he went to make an affidavit before the Notary Public and before the Magistrate of the Metropolitan Court, Dhaka as there are so many First Class Magistrate in the office of the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka for doing the same. More-so the plaintiff did not adduce any attesting witness i.e. the learned Advocate who identified him &amp; his father and who solemnized both the affidavits. So, these exhibits neither bear any legal effect nor have any evidential value. He has further pointed that Ext. Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 submitted by the plaintiff in the Court do not prove that he got those documents from the vendors and from the proper custody and possession rather, it is clear case of the defendants that while defendants was in the possession of the suit property all those papers were in their possession and those had been looted and snatched away by the Nazrul Islam and his accomplice. Thereafter, the plaintiffs with connivance of the Nazrul Islam obtained those papers and started claiming the ownership showing himself as swindler Masudur Rahman after filing non F.I .R. Case No. 102 of 2000. He has further added that if the plaintiffs purchased the suit property surely his actual certificate name and father’s name would have been written in the title deeds. Even if, for the argument shake if it is said that he had purchased the suit property in benami in that case he must produce the man in whose name he purchased the suit property.

In reply of the said argument of the learned Advocate for the appellant, Mr. Biswas referred the testimony of the D.W. No. 4 Kazi Azizul Haque and argued that from the deposition of the said witness this point would be clear. The D.W. No. 4 in his deposition stated that “ he was the Manager of the City Bank, Islampur Branch. The original deed No. 1352 dated 17.04.2000 was deposited in the said Bank as mortgage deed. The said deed was seized by the Police Inspector of C.I.D in connection with Tejgaon Police Station Case No. 61(9) 2000. Now said deed is not lying with Bank. In reply of cross by the plaintiff he stated that the said deed was deposited by the Shamsul Alam and others.

So, according to him there is genuine explanation why the defendants produced the certified copy of their exhibits. He has further pointed that the other original deeds are on record on the exceptional way for which the defendants made out a clear case against the plaintiff that he with the connivance of Md.

Khatian of the suit property was published in the name of Md. Faizullah Bhuyain. Md. Faizullah on 11.10.1963 transferred the suit land to Nabab Ali Sardar. On 27.01.1978 Newab Ali transferred the suit land to Helal Uddin and Kanchan Nahar. They got mutated their name and paid the rent. Helal Uddin obtained Rajuk Plan. Thereafter, on 20.06.1991 Helal Uddin and his wife sold the suit property vide No. 1558 and handed over the possession of the suit property to the plaintiff. Original papers were handed over to him.

Nazrul Islasm lodged cases being Dhanmandi Police Station Case No. 35(3) 2000 and 39(3) 2000. Therefore, created forged deed and tried to take possession of the suit property. The Officer-in-Charge, Dhanmandhi Police Station on 13.3.2000 made a General Diary being No.747. Thereafter, started Non FIR case No. 102 of 2000. The officer in charge of the Dhanmandi Police Station proceeded with a proceeding under section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and prayed for appointment of receiver. On 17.03.2000 Mr. Meraz Hossain Metropolitan Magistrate passed the order of attachment until further order. He was added party in the case and prayed for release of the property in his favor. Shahjahan and others also prayed for added party in the case. On 10.08.2001 Magistrate erroneously passed the order of release of the property in favor of the defendants. He preferred the revision No. 344 of 2001 against that order. The revisional Court set aside the order of the Magistrate Court and ordered to continue the receivership until decision of the title. Against that order Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 5467 of 2001 was preferred to the Hon’ble High Court Division. Appeal was allowed and judgment of the Additional Sessions Judge was set aside.

So, it is not helpful to discard the dispute regarding the name and intentity of the plaintiff. Rather, it is revealed that the P.W.2 Lutfur Rahman contradicted his testimonies in cross examination. In reply of cross he stated that he could not recollect in which sub registry office the deed was registered. He could not say in which date deed was typed. He has read the deed. The profession of the plaintiff is business has been written in the deed. In deed the name Azahar Hossain not mentioned, however, there is Masudur Rahman. The vendor Helal Uddin is the cousin.

He learned from the plaintiff that his name is Azahar Hossain Bhuyain. He could not recollect whether he stated in his deposition in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate that the Masudur Rahman has another name Azhar Hossain. The defense suggestion were denied by him stating that not a fact that he has identified the plaintiff as Masudur Rahman as being gained over, not a fact that he was not present in Registry Office, not a fact that he has not seen the Masudur Rahman, not a fact that the plaintiff to grab the suit house pretend as being Masudur Rahman, not a fact that he has stated falsely. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">76.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Considering the deposition and reply of cross examination we could not hold that those testimonies are apparently favored the plaintiff case.

It is also asserted by Mr. Dutta that said Kanchan Nahar filed the written statement supporting the pleading of the plaintiff. So, very pertinent question is why the prosecution withheld such absolutely necessary person to support his plaint case or why instead of Kanchan Nahar to prove the identity of the plaintiff as Azahar Hossain alias Masudur Rahman produce his brother-in-law and son P.W. 3.

Azaher Hossain @ Md. Masudur Rahman, son of Ahmed Hossain @ Md. Shahjahan Bhuiyan from this 2 (two) Exhibits it is clearly depicted that the name and father’s name of the sole purchaser of the sale deed dated 20.6.1991 (Exhibit-13) and name and father’s name of the Exhibit-1 and 6 as declared by the deponents in the affidavits are not same and identical. There is a clear distinction that in the Exhibit-13 purchaser name is Md. Masudur Rahman, son of Ahmed Hossain and it is divulged from Exhibit-1 name of the deponent Md. Shahjahan Bhuiyan @ Ahmed Hossain Bhuiyan and his son name is Md. Azaher Hossain Bhuiyan @ Masudur Rahman and in exhibit 6 dated 20.08.1989 the plaintiff name is Md. Azahar Hossain alias Md.

Azaher Hossain Bhuiyan @ Masudur Rahman, the reasons is that the Exhibit-13 was registered earlier point of time on 20.06.1991 and Exhibit-1 made on 20.07.2002 later on but Ext. 6 made on more earlier on 20.08.1989. So, if the plaintiff is the purchaser of Exhibit-13 then surely at the time of making, declaring and sworn in the Exhibit-1 his father name must mentioned as per the deed, not only that when plaintiff claimed that he himself made an affidavit on 20.08.1989 then why later on at the time of registering the Exhibit -13 dated 20.06.1991 changed his name, father name, address and profession. There is no reply in any where of the plaint and his deposition. In the affidavit Exhibit No. 1 and in the Exhibit-13 the deponent could have given statement specifying the deed No. and others transactions wherein his son name were mentioned as Md. Masudur Rahman instead of Md. Azaher Hossain Bhuiyan @ Masudur Rahman.

Thereafter, the plaintiff came into scene of action claiming the property for the first time during the pendency of the none F.I.R. Case No. 102 of 2000. However, the plaintiff has denied those facts in the form of denial at the time of deposition. So, we have to discuss about the possession and custody of the Exhibits 8-12 as both the party made contradictory statement at the time of their deposition. The P.W. No.1 Md. Azaher Hossain Hossain @ Masudur Rahman @ Masud Bhuiyan submitted the exhibits before the Court, however, in the cross it has been suggested that Exhibits 8,10,11,12 had gone in his hand after the dacoity in the suit property. However, he denied the suggestion, to come in a just proper and appropriate decision we thought that the deposition of P.W. 2 and 3 would be helpful to find out the actual facts but the averment of the plaint may be looked into about the statement of the plaintiff regarding handing over of the those<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Exhibits. Therefore, we meticulously perused the averment of the plaint and deposition of P.W.2 and 3. It appears from the statement of paragraph-5 that the plaintiff claimed those exhibits were in his hand at the time of filing of the suits albeit it was not in the 1<sup>st</sup> plaint when the suit was filed. However, the deposition of P.W.2 and 3 do not support the facts that those documents were handed over to the plaintiff at the time of registration of the deed or thereafter at any point of time. We find another history from the cross examination of P.W.2 that the vendors of the Masudur Rahman, Helal Uddin Dhali, died but his wife Kanchon Nahar is alive but the plaintiff did not examined nor the Kanchon Nahar herself came to support her written statement as witness or Court witness to prove averment of the paragraph 5 of the plaint regarding possession, control and handing over of the exhibits-8-12.

However, in cross he further admitted that he could not say the name of the tenants. He further admitted that in deed No. 1558 dated 20.6.1991 he could not use the name of educational institute and service in the said deed. He could not say who type the deed, the deed in how many pages, from which stamp was purchase although he himself is the Assistant of Stamp branch of the Deputy Commissioner Office, Dhaka. He further admitted that he could not say in which date he was dispossess in the year-2000. He further admitted in the plaint that he could not say that defendant Nos. 1-4 dispossess him in the year-2000. He further admitted that he filed the Miscellaneous Case being No. 36 of 2002 for canceling of the mutation of the defendants. He further admitted that by dint of the above Miscellaneous Case there was a physical investigation regarding the possession. In the report of the physical investigation the Kanungo did not say the plaintiff was in possession at any time, however, he protested that the report was not correct, further admitting that he did not file any case against the report of the Kanungo. According to him city record was in his name but case is pending. He further admitted that Nazrul Islam collect the rent. He admitted that none of the tenants were known to him. He admitted that in his passport dated 30.3.2008 he did not use the address of the suit property and his father’s name was written Ahammad Hossain Bhuiyan. He further admitted that he never resides in the suit property. He also admitted that he did not get house rent after 1999. So, from the above cross examination we are of the view that the plaintiff has failed to prove his physical possession.

Azahar Hossain Bhuiyan (Masud) son of Alhaj Ahammad Hossain Bhuiyan. In exhibit 20 series the plaintiff’s Income Tax return Certified copies shows that the plaintiff filed the income tax return for the year 2003-2004, 2004-2005, 2005-2006, 2006-2007. It appears from those Exhibit that he filed the income tax returns for those year without showing the income of the house and without payment any tax. Wherein he had written his name Masudur Rahman @ Azahar Hossain. The Assessing Officer fixed the income as per statement showing zero tax. However, it is pertinent to mention here that the plaintiff did not show any living cost instead of that he has stated in Income Tax return form that he has been living in the village home as per order of assessee Officer. He has however, stated in his Income Tax return that he has been living in the suit plot i.e. 150 Criscent Road, Dhanmondi. Now, question is which statement is correct. In such peculiar situation it must be held that both the statement are false and fabricated. Besides these, how the exhibit 20 series would be believable in the Court of law wherein the plaintiffs himself as P.W.No.1 admitted in the cross that he never resides in the 150 Criscent Road, which is the suit plot. The plaintiff at the time of deposition has written his address 6, Wiseghat, Kotowali, Dhaka on 05.02.2008. Whereas exhibit 20 and 20(1) the income tax returns 2007-2008 used his residence as 150, Criscent Road, Dhanmondi. So, on such type of the anomalies of the address, name, father’s name and profession we can not hold that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>the plaintiff is the Md.

Therefore, it is crystal clear that he made the exhibit 19 (passport) stating that his father name Ahmed Hossain Bhuiyan instead of son of Shahjahan Bhuiyan. The plaintiff national ID Card <strong>exhibit 18</strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>wherein his father’s name has written Haji Ahmed Hossain (Shahjahan) so, which name of his father is correct. In such dubious situation, obviously the presumption would be that in doing so he proved that he had also changed his father name as Ahmed Hossain instead of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Shahjahan Bhuiyan. From exhibit ‘Niya’, ‘Niya(1)’ the order of the Assistant Commissioner and physical possession Report of Kanungo of Dhanmondi Circle it is clear that the plaintiff was not in possession of suit property. More-so it appears that from the <strong>exhibit U’</strong> <strong>series</strong> he had filed the application before 2002 for mutation of the suit property which surely after starting the litigation and dacoity in the suit property though he claimed that he purchased the suit property on 20.6.19991.

While for carrying out investigation by the police officers, there are prescribed provisions in the CrPC and the Police Regulations of Bengal, 1943, there is no such statutory procedural provisions or Apex Court’s guidelines in place for conducting a Judicial Enquiry. From the perspective of criminal proceedings, while the statutory source of commencing a Judicial Enquiry is Section 202 of the CrPC, Section 539B of the CrPC provides the extent of activities of a Judicial Enquiry. Therefore, Judicial Enquiry in connection with criminal proceedings means an enquiry of complaint of any offence ordered by a Judicial Magistrate to be carried out by the same Judicial Magistrate or by another Judicial Magistrate for the purpose of ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the complaint and, in ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the complaint, the Enquiring Magistrate may do anything which s/he considers to be relevant and appropriate, including taking evidence of witnesses on oath under Section 202(2A) CrPC and visiting/inspecting the crime spot and other place/s, as mandated by Section 539B of the CrPC.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                               </span>. . .

Aynul Hoque alias Abdul Mannan, as the informant, lodged an FIR alleging, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">inter-alia</em>, that on 10.05.2009 at about 08.30 hours his son Ahsan Habib Pinu (hereinafter referred to as the victim) went to the local Bazar and when the victim was not returning home, the informant and other relatives rushed to every possible places and, eventually, a 12-year old minor boy, who is a distant grandson of the informant, found the head of the victim floating in the latrine of one Md. Liaqat Ali and therefrom they pulled out the dead body of the victim. The informant alleged in the FIR that there was a long-standing dispute over establishment of an educational institution between the informant and Liakat Ali and, for which, the informant suspects that (1) Md. Liakat Ali along with (2) Md Bablu Mia, (3) Md. Manik Mia, (4) Md Ruhul Amin and (5) Md Rakibul Islam killed his son and hid the dead body in the latrine. Upon receiving the above FIR, the police investigated the matter and submitted charge-sheet on 29.03.2010 under Sections 302/201/34 of the Penal Code against Md. Babul Mia and Harunur Rashid and, at the same time, final report was presented in favour of four FIR-named accused, including Md. Liakat Ali, which prompted the informant to file a Naraji Petition. On considering the averments of the said Naraji Petition, the Court on 02.08.2010 ordered for conducting a Judicial Enquiry by a Judicial Magistrate. Accordingly, a Judicial Magistrate from the judicial magistracy at the District of Gaibandha (hereinafter referred to as the Enquiring Magistrate), after conducting the Judicial Enquiry, on 30.11.2011 came up with the same findings as were recorded by the police and, then, the learned Senior Judicial Magistrate, Gaibandha (hereinafter referred to as the cognizance-taking Magistrate) took cognizance against 2 (two) charge-sheeted accused persons and discharged the other not-sent-up four accused persons vide his order dated 24.07.2012. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the same, the informant filed a revisional application before the Senior Sessions Judge, Gaibandha who dismissed the revisional application upholding the Order passed by the Senior Judicial Magistrate, <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">Gaibandha. Challenging the legality and propriety</span> <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">of the above two Orders, the informant-petitioner</span> approached this Court under Section 561A of the CrPC and hence the Rule.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">Mr. Sarwar Ahmed, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the informant-petitioner, takes us through the FIR and, side by side, the statements made by the Judicial Witnesses (JWs) and submits that while the FIR merely contains the suspicion by the informant against Md. Liakat Ali, Md. Babul Miah, Md. Manik Miah, Md. Ruhul Amin and Raqibul Islam, the statements of JWs clearly suggest that they were involved in the murder. He, then, draws our attention to the report prepared by the Enquiring Magistrate and submits that the Enquiring Magistrate, having not judiciously evaluated the statements of the JWs and having<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>come to the conclusion that nothing was found against Md. Liakat Ali and his<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>3 cohorts, committed a serious illegality. He next submits that the cognizance-taking Magistrate utterly failed to perform his duty in <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">having his own satisfaction and to independently</span> decide as to whether cognizance should be taken against the non-proposed accused. In support of his above count of submissions, he refers to the cases of Anwaruddin Molla Vs Hamid Molla 18 DLR 295 and Md. Akbar Hossain Vs Hasanul Hoque Inu 11 BLT (AD) 166. Mr. Sarwar Ahmed, thereafter, takes us through the Judgment passed by the learned Sessions Judge in disposing of the revisional application and submits that the revisional application was disposed of in a perfunctory manner without applying his judicial mind and comments that it is simply unbefitting for a Senior Sessions Judge to write such a Judgment, given that the same is nothing but a mere replication of the Order passed by the learned Magistrate. Mr. Sarwar Ahmed submits that since, in this case, anyone with ordinary prudence upon considering the JWs’ statements would be of the view that there is <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">a prima facie</em> case against the FIR-named suspected persons, this Court, instead of remanding the case to the cognizance-taking Magistrate for further enquiry, should direct the Magistrate to take cognizance against all the suspected persons straightaway. In response to a query made by this Court as to whether this Court is competent to direct the Magistrate to take cognizance, he professes that since the present application is not under Section 436 of the CrPC but under Section 561A of the CrPC, this is a unique case where this Court is amply empowered to straightaway direct the Magistrate concerned to take cognizance of the offence against the not-sent-up accused. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">By making the above submissions, the learned Advocate for the petitioner prays for setting aside the Judgment and Order dated 09.01.2014 passed by the learned Senior Sessions Judge, Gaibandha in Criminal Revision No. 271 of 2012 and, also, the Judgment and Order dated 24.07.2012 passed by the learned Senior Judicial Magistrate, Gaibandha in G.R.

It would be profitable for adjudication upon this issue, if we try to be acquainted with the terms ‘Enquiry’ and ‘Judicial Enquiry’, at first. While the definition of the term ‘enquiry’ is available, having been provided in Section 4(1)(k) of the CrPC in the following wordings <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“every enquiry other than a trial conducted under this Code by a Magistrate or Court”</em>, there is no such <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">statutory definition of the phraseology “Judicial</span> Enquiry”. The Black’s Law Dictionary inscribes the meaning of the phraseology “Judicial Enquiry” in the following wordings <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“an official in-Court investigation of events, facts and actions to address a question of law and render an opinion”.</em> Commonly, Judicial Enquiry is known to be an enquiry, of any accident or crime, carried out by a Judge or Judicial Magistrate upon being directed by a Court of law/by the President of the Country/by the Parliament/by the Cabinet/by the Prime Minister. While for carrying out investigation by the police officers, there are prescribed provisions in the CrPC and the Police Regulations of Bengal, 1943, there is no such statutory procedural provisions or Apex Court’s guidelines in place for conducting a Judicial Enquiry. From the perspective of criminal proceedings, while the statutory source of commencing a Judicial Enquiry is Section 202 of the CrPC, Section 539B of the CrPC provides the extent of activities of a Judicial Enquiry. Therefore, Judicial Enquiry in connection with criminal proceedings means an enquiry of complaint of any offence ordered by a Judicial Magistrate to be carried out by the same Judicial Magistrate or by another Judicial Magistrate for the purpose of ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the complaint and, in ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the complaint, the Enquiring Magistrate may do anything which s/he considers to be relevant and appropriate, including taking evidence of witnesses on oath under Section 202(2A) CrPC and visiting/inspecting the crime spot and other place/s, as mandated by Section 539B of the CrPC. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">The Enquiring Magistrate, at the end of carrying out a Judicial Enquiry, is required to prepare a Judicial Enquiry Report on the basis of the statements made by the JWs together with their remarks/comments about the demeanour of the JWs, if any demeanour is ever noticed by the Enquiring Magistrate, as well as the findings and observations on other step/s taken by the Enquiring Magistrate, such as visiting the place of occurrence under Section 539B of the CrPC, taking snaps of the place of occurrence and the injury on the body, etc. In course of preparation of a Judicial Enquiry Report, the Enquiring Magistrate should seek to form her/his own opinion without being influenced by the findings and proposals made by the IO in the report submitted under Section 173 of the CrPC and the same should be forwarded to the Chief Metropolitan/Judicial Magistrate who, then her/himself, or any other Magistrate assigned by the CMM/CJM, would independently consider the issue of taking cognizance under Section 190 CrPC or dismissal of the complaint under Section 203 CrPC upon examining all the materials of the police report, namely, FIR, sketch map, index, seizure list, medical certificate, post-mortem report &amp; inquest report (in case of any homicidal offence), the statements made by the witnesses under Sections 161 &amp; 164 of the CrPC, the statements/confessions made by the accused under Section 164 of the CrPC, case diary, for, the police report under Section 190 (1)(b) of the CrPC does not mean only the report prepared by the IO, but it also includes all the materials mentioned above, and, also, upon examining all the materials of the Judicial Enquiry Report, which includes the statements of the JWS, together with the remarks on the demeanour of the JWs, findings and observations on the seized goods/articles seen by the own eyes of the Enquiring Magistrate, on the crime spot/other places visited and inspected under Section 539B CrPC and other incriminating materials. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 6pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">Now, let us look at the facts of this case. From a minute perusal of the annexed papers, it transpires that the FIR was lodged on 11.05.2009 under Sections 302/201/34 of the Penal Code against 5 (five) suspected persons namely, (i) Md. Liakat Ali (ii) Md. Bablu Mia (iii) Md. Manik Mia (iv) Md. Ruhul Amin and (v) Md. Rakibul Islam and, after the investigation, the Investigating Officer (IO) on 29.03.2010 while proposing to prosecute Md. Babul Mia and another person, named, Md. Harun Ur Rashid who was not named in the FIR, recommended to release other 4 suspected persons. When the informant filed a Naraji application, the learned Magistrate vide his Order dated 02.08.2010 ordered a Judicial Enquiry. Upon skimming through the materials of the Judicial Enquiry, it appears that the learned Enquiring Magistrate did not visit and inspect the place of occurrence or did not make any effort to take evidence from any witnesses other than those witnesses whose names were furnished by the complainant. Names of four witnesses were furnished by the complainant and their statements were taken on oath by the Enquiring Magistrate.

It further appears to us from the above report submitted by the Enquiring Magistrate that he tagged up and relied on the findings of the police in preparing the Judicial Enquiry Report.

The function of taking cognizance by a Judicial Magistrate is an important step in our criminal justice system and, in taking cognizance, while, in a CR case, a Judicial Magistrate is duty bound to examine and consider the complaint petition, statements, made by the complainant under Section 200 CrPC and if there is a Judicial Enquiry, then, the Judicial Enquiry Report and, likewise,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>in the GR case, the FIR, the statements made by the witnesses under Sections 161 &amp; 164 CrPC, the statements made by the accused under Section 164 CrPC, the police report and the other incriminating materials, but s/he is not bound by the findings and recommendations of <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">the police report or the Judicial Enquiry Report,</span> for, the law envisages that the cognizance-taking Magistrate shall be completely independent in having the primary satisfaction as to whether there is any <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> evidence of commission of offence by any accused for taking cognizance. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">14.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">In other words, when a criminal case is filed in the Police Station by lodging an FIR and, after investigation of the said case, the Investigating Officer (IO) submits a police report recommending for prosecuting or discharging any accused person, the Magistrate is not bound by the recommendation made by the IO for discharging any accused; rather the Magistrate is at liberty to take cognizance of any offence against any person either on the basis of the materials available before the Magistrate, such as, the police report or on the basis of his own knowledge/suspicion or information received from any person other than a police officer under Section 190 (1)(b) or under Section 190 (1)(c) of the CrPC, as the case may be. And, when a criminal case is filed through Court by presenting a petition of complaint/oral complaint before a Magistrate, the Magistrate is at liberty either to take cognizance directly under Section 190 (1)(a) of the CrPC on the basis of the statements made by the complainant under Section 200 CrPC or, <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">in the event that the complaint is sent for Judicial</span><span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;"> Enquiry, on the basis of Judicial Enquiry</span> Report. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">15.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">However, in a GR case, after submission of the police report by the IO when a Naraji petition (complaint petition) is filed and the Magistrate directs for Judicial Enquiry, then, upon receiving the Judicial Enquiry Report, the Magistrate is at liberty to take cognizance either on the basis of the Judicial Enquiry Report, treating the same as <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">‘information received from any person other than a police officer’</em> under Section 190 (1)(c) of the CrPC or on the basis of his own knowledge/suspicion under Section 190 of the CrPC or on the basis of the police report under Section 190 (1)(b) of the CrPC or on the basis of complaint (Naraji petition) under Section 190 (1)(a) of the CrPC following finding <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima-facie</em> truthfulness as to the allegation made in the complaint petition through carrying out Judicial Enquiry. It is to be borne in mind by the learned cognizance-taking Magistrates of the land that the only source of the power of taking cognizance of any offence by the Magistrates of Bangladesh is Section 190 of the CrPC and, therefore, at the time of taking cognizance, it is a pivotal duty for a Magistrate to see whether taking cognizance of any offence fits into or relates to any of the clauses of sub-Section (1) of Section 190 of the CrPC. Thus, a Judicial Magistrate or <span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt;">an Executive Magistrate having been empowered</span> to take cognizance by the Government under Section 190(4) of the CrPC is competent to take cognizance of any offence against any person in addition to the person recommended by the IO and/or the Enquiring Magistrate resorting to any of the provisions which are enumerated under sub-Section (1) of Section 190 of the CrPC. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">16.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In this case, the learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence under Sections 302/201/34 of the Penal Code only against two persons and discharged others simply saying that <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“in view of the Judicial Enquiry Report cognizance under Sections 302/201/34 of the Penal Code is taken against the sent-up accused in c/s”.</em> Evidently, the learned Magistrate did a stereotyped job, for, there is no effort on his part to assess the statements of the JWs by himself independently and thereby form his own view as to whether any statements have been made by the JWs implicating the persons who have been named in the petition of complaint. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">17.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">The proposition of law, as emanates from our research, that after receiving the Judicial Enquiry Report, when the Magistrate is going to pass an order on taking cognizance of any offence against any person/s under Section 190 (1) of the CrPC or dismissal of the complaint under Section 203 of the CrPC, it is incumbent upon the Magistrate to examine and consider the nitty-gritty of the Judicial Enquiry Report.

It is pertinent to record here that when this Court had asked the learned Advocate for the informant-petitioner for not taking any step for disposal of the Rule, in reply thereto, it was contended that the petitioner was reluctant to proceed with the enquiry and trial of this case during the period the learned Senior Sessions Judge is stationed at Gaibandha Judgeship, for, he was simply counting his time to go on <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">retirement and was not conscientiously performing</span> his duties. Some other derogatory comments about the quality of his performance, which had been performed just before his retirement, were also heard from the Bar, but those are ignored to register here.

In an effort to substantiate the above submissions, the cases of Bangladesh Vs Yakub Sardar 40 DLR (AD) 246 and Yousuf A Hossain Vs KM Rezaul Firdous 48 DLR (AD) 53 have been referred to by the learned Advocate for the accused. Let us discuss the facts and legal issues of the cited cases. In the case of Yusuf A. Hasan Vs Rezaul Firdous 48 DLR (AD) 53, the accused was a Government servant and when he had written about the complainant’s corruption to his higher authority, the complainant filed a defamation case under Section 500 of the Penal Code. Since the accused had done it in his official capacity, the law requires that the complainant must obtain approval from the Government for filing this kind of case. Thus, there was no scope for the Magistrate to take cognizance against the accused without, first, seeing the Government’s sanction to prosecute the accused and, consequently, the complaint was dismissed and, in course of adjudication of the matter by the Appellate Division, the Apex Court, while upholding the order of dismissal of the complaint petition did not order for further enquiry into the complaint, made an observation that neither the Sessions Judge nor the High Court Division can direct the Magistrate to take cognizance of an offence. In the other referred case, namely, Bangladesh Vs Yakub Sarder 40 DLR(AD) 246, the issue before the Apex Court was, whether the Sessions Judge is empowered to direct a Magistrate to send the case to him for trial when the Magistrate dismissed the complaint under Section 203 of the CrPC. In disposing of the case, while the Apex Court found it a proper case to direct for further enquiry into the complaint, however, in Paragraph 8 of this Judgment, the Apex Court indicated that had the High Court Division exercised its inherent power, there would have an occasion to examine the issue as to whether the High Court Division is competent to direct the Magistrate to issue summon against the accused towards sending the accused to the trial Court. Thus, the facts of the afore-referred cases<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>being different from the facts of this case and, more importantly, the issues taken up by the Apex Court for adjudication in the afore-cited cases being not similar, the ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ratio’</em> laid down therein is not applicable in this case. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">23.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">While it is a settled principle of law, which is being consistently followed by us, that in an appropriate criminal revisional application, direction of further enquiry should be made by the Sessions Judge or the High Court Division upon receiving an application under Section 436 of the CrPC into any complaint which has been dismissed under Section 203 or 204(3) of the CrPC, or into the case of any person who has been discharged from an offence, however, in this case, since the informant/complainant did not have the scope of approaching this Court invoking its revisional jurisdiction for revising the Order passed by the Magistrate, does he deserve an order of further enquiry into his complaint under Section 561A of the CrPC? The answer thereto now requires to be searched, for, the present application, has been filed under Section 561A of the CrPC and the same being maintainable, as has been held in the case of Syed Ehsan Abdullah Vs State 2017(1) L&amp;J 135 by this Court after revisiting scores of case-laws of our jurisdiction and that of the sub-continent, the inherent power of this Court may well be invoked for securing the ends of justice, either to order for further enquiry or for fresh consideration of the materials available before the Magistrate or for directing to take cognizance of the offence against the accused who have not been proposed to be prosecuted by the IO and also by the Enquiring Magistrate. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Now, let us see what types of ends of justice would be met if this Court directs for further enquiry. Since it would be unfair to direct further enquiry by any police officer after carrying out a Judicial Enquiry, logically, there may be a further Judicial Enquiry by a different Enquiring Magistrate. What are the steps the new Enquiring Magistrate would take; presumably s/he may visit the relevant places and may take additional evidence from some more witnesses. However, it is unlikely that by visiting the relevant place/s after 9 (nine) years <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">of the occurrence, the new Enquiring Magistrate</span> is going to obtain any useful information and also any additional witnesses. Therefore, it would be a futile exercise to carry out a further Judicial Enquiry. It follows that there may be an order by this Court to the CJM for consideration of the statements of the JWs afresh in an expectation to judiciously assess the said statements and thereby independently pass an order, either, of taking cognizance of the offence against the persons named in the police report &amp; Judicial Enquiry Report together with the persons named in the petition of complaint, or, of being in agreement with the recommendations made by the IO and the Enquiring Magistrate dropping off the names of the four accused. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">Now, a pertinent question comes up for consideration by this Court as to what would <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">happen if the new cognizance-taking Magistrate</span> passes the same order which was passed by the previous cognizance-taking Magistrate. The answer is that the informant is to approach this Court again and, pursuant thereto, this Court also would pass the same order again. So, ultimately, there would be repeated exercise at <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">the cost of putting the informant at harassments.</span> With the above hypothetical scenario, the question that pops-up is that is this Court helpless in this kind of situation to direct the Magistrate to take cognizance against the persons whose complicity in the alleged murder is apparently evident in the statements of the JWs or the statements made by the witnesses under Sections 161 &amp; 164 of the CrPC or by the accused under Section 164 of the CrPC or in any other prosecution materials? </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">26.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">The power of taking cognizance of an offence against any accused is vested in the Magistrates by the Legislature vide Section 190 of the CrPC and, therefore, it is the Magistrate who should be satisfied as to whether cognizance is to be taken or not against any person, be s/he is recommended by the IO/Enquiring Magistrate or not and, thus, the function of taking cognizance being the exclusive business of the Magistrates, passing an order of direction upon the Magistrate to take cognizance is beyond the competence of the Sessions Judge and High Court Division in exercising their appellate or revisional jurisdiction. However, by exercising the power under Section 561A of the CrPC, in a fit and proper case, which may be found in the rarest of rare cases, the High Court Division is well competent to direct the Magistrate to take cognizance towards securing the ends of justice. For example, from the prosecution materials when any one with ordinary prudence would be able to sum up that 1+1 becomes 2, making the above result to be 1.50 or 2.50 by a Magistrate would be a perverse decision and, in that scenario, interference by the High Court Division exercising its inherent power would be quite justified. Similarly, when it is vividly discernible from the evidence available before the Magistrate that s/he did not have any option other than to take cognizance of an offence against any accused, passing an order of non-prosecuting the said accused will be a perverse one. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">27.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">After carrying out careful examination of the provisions of Sections 190, 200, 202, 203, 204, 435, 436, 439, 439A and 561A of the CrPC, we are of the view that upon receiving the Naraji petition against the police report if a Judicial Enquiry is conducted and on consideration of the police report, Judicial <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">Enquiry Report and other prosecution materials,</span> the Magistrate does not take cognizance of an offence against any accused by dismissing the Naraji petition (complaint) wholly/partly under Section 203 of the CrPC and the informant-complainant seeks to revise the order directly from the High Court Division without preferring a revision before the Court of Sessions Judge, the High Court Division’s proper order would be to direct further enquiry. But when the informant-complainant takes recourse to the inherent power under Section 561A of the CrPC, irrespective of the fact whether the petitioner invoked the inherent power directly or after exhausting the revisional forum of the Court of Sessions Judge, on the ground that there is no need for further enquiry in the backdrop of availability of the evidence already obtained through Judicial Enquiry, the High Court Division is not powerless to direct the CJM or the concerned Magistrate to take cognizance of an offence against any accused against whom <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> evidence is very much evident in the Judicial Enquiry Report subject to the condition that the High Court Division is satisfied that the order of the Magistrate in dismissing the Naraji (complaint) entirely/ partly was perverse or ex-facie wrong being manifestly at variance with the evidence which the Enquiring Magistrate obtained. The rationale behind holding the above view is that when the informant, upon disagreeing with the outcome of the investigation by the police, opts for Judicial Enquiry and the Judicial Enquiry reveals commission of an offence against the accused named in the complaint petition, but the Magistrate does not take cognizance, there is no need to conduct further enquiry as the informant-complainant is not raising grievance against the Judicial Enquiry; the complainant’s grievance in the said situation is only against the Order of the cognizance-taking Magistrate. And when the CJM/the concerned Magistrate would be asked to consider the Judicial Enquiry Report afresh and, pursuant thereto, if the Magistrate passes the self-same order, sending back the matter to the CJM/concerned Magistrate would turn to be an exercise in futility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt;

In the office of the Notary Public, Dhaka in presence of one Mawlana the dower money was fixed at Tk. 3,00,000/- (Three lac). Subsequently, after the execution of ‘<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">holofnama’</em> </strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">(affidavit)</span> with regard to the marriage, according to the terms and conditions of that ‘<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">holofnama’</em></strong> on 10.12.2010 the marriage ceremony was held in the residence of the plaintiff’s father through one Md. Yousuf Kari. The ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">kabinnama’</em> was executed and registered on that date. Thereafter, the plaintiff and the defendant lived together as husband and wife in the residence of the defendant. The marriage was duly consumed, and at a stage of that; the defendant became addicted and he started to give pressure to the plaintiff for obtaining money as dowry from her father. The plaintiff while denied to bring money as dowry from her father, the defendant started torture to her and on 14.04.2013 the defendant driven her out from his residence and as a result of that; the plaintiff finding no other alternative returned back to the residence of her parents in one cloth. The further case of the plaintiff is such that the defendant was requested repeatedly to resolve the matter, but without resolving the matter of demanding dowry, the defendant again demanded Tk. 2,00,000/- (Two lac) dowry from the father of the plaintiff. The parents of the plaintiff was not in a position to give the dowry amount and since then the plaintiff is residing in the residence of her parents. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The contrary case of the defendant-petitioner in short is thus, that a relationship was developed between the plaintiff and the defendant through mobile phone initially and at a stage of that; the plaintiff asked the defendant to come at Savar of district Dhaka. Accordingly, the defendant on 25.11.2010 went to Savar, where the plaintiff and her other relatives with the help of some terrorists confined the defendant in a room and managed to obtain his signatures in a volume book and other papers. The further case of the defendant is such that the plaintiff and her men created a ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">kabinnama’</em> of marriage between he and the plaintiff, in where; the dower money was fixed at Tk.1,50,000/- (One lac and fifty thousand), out of which Tk.1,000/- (one thousand) was paid instantly. Subsequently, the defendant coming to his own residence from the residence of the plaintiff, informed the matter to his parents and other relatives and a “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Shalish-boithak</em>” was held. In that “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Shalish-boithak</em>” it was decided that the plaintiff will <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">take the rest dower money including maintenance</span> at a time. Accordingly, the plaintiff in that “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Shalish-boithak</em>” accepted Tk.1,50,000/- (One lac fifty thousand), which was given by the defendant to her.

The learned Advocate for the petitioner during his submissions after filing an application under Order XLI, rule 27 along with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure supported by two acknowledgement receipts and copy of notice under section 7(1) of Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 prays for giving the defendant-petitioner an opportunity to prove his case after accepting the papers submitted by him as additional evidence. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">As against the aforesaid submissions and application, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite party opposing the Rule and application, vehemently controverted the submissions advanced from the side of the petitioner and submits that the papers filed at present are all collusive, fraudulent and created and that, there was no threat or coercion from the side of the plaintiff-opposite party for the marriage ceremony between the plaintiff and the defendant. The learned Advocate further submits that the defendant-petitioner voluntarily with his free and full consent married the plaintiff-opposite party and the “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">kabinnama</em>” was executed and registered fairly and legally, in which; the dower money was fixed at Tk. 3,00,000/- (Three lac). The learned Advocate also submits that during disposal of the original suit and it’s subsequent appeal the learned trial court as well as the appellate court committed no illegality or irregularity, rather; on the basis of sufficient credible evidence the judgment and order was passed. The learned Advocate argued that at this stage; there is no scope for additional evidence or acceptance of the papers filed from the side of the defendant-petitioner under Order XLI, Rule 27 read with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, since all these papers are recent in origin and are forged, fabricated and manipulated. The learned Advocate further submits that, neither in the trial court nor in the appellate court, these papers were filed or exhibited after proof from the side of the defendant-petitioner and subsequently out of ill-motive to deprive the plaintiff-opposite party from getting her lawful demand which is her legal right, all these papers has been created. The learned Advocate lastly after referring some decisions of this Court and our Apex Court submits that the learned appellate court below rightly in his judgment and findings conclusively held that no notice under section 7(1) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 was given or issued by the defendant in support of the alleged ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Talaq’</em>.

On that date when the defendant went to Savar, the plaintiff in collusion with her relatives and some miscreants forcibly confined the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>defendant in a room and managed to take his signatures in a volume book by which the ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">kabinnama</em>’ was created and in that ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">kabinnama</em>’ the dower money was fixed at Tk.1,50,000/-.

Under section 21 of the General Clauses Act, the power conferred on NSC is not plenary power so as to make the power of BCB nugatory so far the amendment of the constitution is concerned unless such power is expressly conferred by the parent statute. The power conferred under Article 11.1 read with Article 26 of the Constitution is derived from the Act of 1974 and NSC had delegated the power to BCB to amend its constitution. By the memo dated 21.01.2012 NSC gave direction to BCB to include the proposed provisions in the Constitution of BCB and pursuant thereto BCB included those proposals of NSC and sent two copies of its constitutions to NSC for approval. NSC cannot do so in exercise of power under section 21 of the General Clauses Act ignoring the procedure for amendment of the constitution as contained in Articles 11.1 and 26. NSC, in fact, has usurped the power of BCB to amend its Constitution. Therefore, the High Court Division was justified in making the Rule absolute. Having considered all aspects of the case, we are of the view that the BCB is at liberty to amend its Constitution at any time as per provision of Article 11.1 and Article 26 of its Constitution so that the requirements of International Cricket Council is met subject to the approval of NSC.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">          </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">            </span>. . .
