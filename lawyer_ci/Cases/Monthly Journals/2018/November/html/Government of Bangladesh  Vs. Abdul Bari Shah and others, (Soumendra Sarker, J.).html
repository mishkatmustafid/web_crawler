The owner of the property, Gopi Dasi by a registered kabala deed dated 04.02.1960 transferred the land in favour of one Mayzuddin and the purchaser Mayzuddin after mutation of his name started to pay rents to the Government. Subsequently, Mayzuddin transferred 06 decimals of land in favour of one Shawkat Ali and 05 decimals in favour of one Ruhul Amin. Out of the remaining 05 decimals of land Moyzuddin transferred 2 ½ decimal in favour of the plaintiff No. 01 by a transfer deed dated 03.12.1973 A.D. and the rest<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">      </span>2 ½ decimals of land was transferred in favour of the father of the Defendant No. 02 by Moyzuddin. The further case of the plaintiffs is such that the plaintiff No. 01 and the father of the plaintiff No. 02 also purchased 07 decimals of land from plot No. 1618 which is adjacent to the suit plot. The plaintiffs are possessing their purchased land jointly and mutated their names in the Government <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">seresta </em>and paying rents to the Government.

The father of plaintiff No. 02 died leaving behind five daughters, one wife and one son, the plaintiffs No. 02. The plaintiff No. 02 by a registered sub-kabala deed dated 16.04.1989 A.D. purchased the lands of other co-sharers measuring 06 decimals of land in the suit holding. On 28.02.1995 the plaintiffs going to the local<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Tahshil </em>Office came to learn that the suit properly measuring 05 decimals of land has not been recorded finally in their names in the R.S. record and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>out of the suit property<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>1/2<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>decimals of land has been wrongly recorded in the name of defendant No. 02 in Plot No. 6036.

The learned Advocate further submits that, during trial of the original suit by sufficient credible evidence, the plaintiffs have proved that the original owner of the property transferred the suit land along with other land measuring 16 decimals of land by a registered sub kabala deed dated 04.02.1960 in favour of one Moyzuddin and it is also proved that Moyzuddin mutated his name in the Government <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">seresta </em>and paid rent. The learned Advocate also submits that Moyzuddin subsequently transferred the land in favour of one Shawkat Ali and Ruhul Amin. The plaintiff No. 01 subsequently by a kabala deed dated 03.12.1973 purchased 2 ½ decimals of land and by another sub-kabala deed of the same date<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Moyzuddin transferred 2 ½ decimals of land in favour of the father of plaintiff No. 02 from the suit <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">jote</em> and by successive transfer deeds, in this way the plaintiff-opposite parties have acquired right, title, interest and possession in the suit property and the suit property never became enemy property or vested property under the ambit of enemy property laws<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>inasmuch as prior to 1965 A.D. the admitted original owner of the property, Gopi Dasi transferred the suit property<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>in favour of Moyzuddin and handed over possession. The learned Advocate<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>submits that the defendant, Government in order to prove the case of their pleading’s, did not adduce any oral or documentary evidence and as such the pleading’s case of the Government remain disproved under the ambit of law. The learned Advocate in support of his contention referred some decisions of this court and our Apex court reported in BCR (1988) 179, 50 DLR (AD) 70, 17 BLD 249 and 5 CLR (AD) (2017) 51. The learned Advocate lastly submits that there is no paper from the side of the Government-petitioner, showing that the property has become enlisted ever as enemy or vested property<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>in the census list under the ambit of Defense of Pakistan Rules, 1965 and there is no gazette notification even from the side of the Government showing or treating that the property as vested or enemy property and the learned trial court as well as the appellate court after proper assessment of evidence and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>appreciation of law decided the merit of the suit in favour of the plaintiffs rightly and there is no misreading or non reading of evidence or non consideration of material facts resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice by which the impugned judgment and decree can be interfered with. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt list .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">10.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Considering the submission of the learned Advocates, having gone through the judgment and decree passed by the trial court as well as the appellate court along with the evidence on records, both oral and documentary, it transpires that, admittedly the suit property appertaining to <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">mouza </em>Chandpur under Meherpur District originally belonged to one Gopi Dasi and the S.A. <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">khatian </em>No. 343 was correctly prepared in her name.
