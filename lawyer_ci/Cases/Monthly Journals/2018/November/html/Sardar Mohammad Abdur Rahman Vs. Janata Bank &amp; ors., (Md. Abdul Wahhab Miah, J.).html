The suit was decreed ex-parte on 10<sup>th</sup> April, 2002 and then Money Execution Case No. 176 of 2002 was levied in the Court of Joint District Judge and Artha Rin Adalat No.l, Dhaka. In execution of the decree, the mortgaged property was sold in auction. Respondent No.2, Haji Md. Ayub Khan, purchased the mortgaged property in auction. Before the sale, an agreement was entered into between the predecessor-in-interest of the appellant (hereinafter referred to as the judgment-debtor) and respondent No.2, the auction purchaser, in respect of the mortgaged property stipulating that he (respondent No.2) would pay Tk. 1,50,00,000.00 within December, 2004 in the judgment-debtor’s loan account with respondent No.l Bank and then on the handing over the receipt of such payment the judgment-debtor would execute and register the sale deed in his favour, but respondent No.2, judgment-debtor purchased the mortgaged property in auction by misleading the Court and beyond the knowledge of the judgment-debtor.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">In the circumstances the appellant made an application under Order XXI, rule 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) in the Court of Joint District Judge and Artha Rin Adalat No.l, Dhaka (hereinafter referred to as the Executing Court) for setting aside the auction sale stating, inter alia, the facts as stated hereinbefore on the ground that the respondents in collusion with each other sold the mortgaged property worth taka 1,50,00,000.00 at an undervalue of taka 34,00,000.00 only and this undervalued auction sale was also admitted by the decree holder respondent No.l, Bank as it filed an application before the executing Court to reject the result of the auction sale held on 01.09.2004 and to hold fresh auction but the application was rejected.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">The application was registered as Miscellaneous Case No.43 of 2004.

It further observed that though the application was filed under Order XXI, rule 90, it was alike an application under Order XXI, rule 89 of the Code, but the judgment-debtor did not make the deposit as required by the said provision of law. Against this order of rejection, the appellant preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No.283 of 2005 before the District Judge, Dhaka and the learned District Judge by the order dated 17<sup>th</sup> August, 2005 summarily dismissed the appeal on the ground of maintainability. Against the order of the learned District Judge, the appellant moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.4201 of 2005.

He has further submitted that the Executing Court erred in law in holding that the application filed before it was one under Order XXI, rule 89 of the Code, though, in the cause title of the application the provision of Order XXI, rule 90 of the Code was clearly mentioned and the High Court Division also on total non application of mind to the cause title of the application, averment made therein, affirmed the said view of the Executing Court. He has further submitted that the very allegation made in the application that the property worth taka 1,50,00,000.00 was sold at taka 34,00,000/- (thirty four lac) only, clearly proved that fraud was committed in holding the auction sale and such allegation squarely attracts the provision of Order XXI, rule 90 of the Code.

Therefore, he submits that no illegality was committed by the High Court Division in affirming the order passed by the Executing Court rejecting the application filed under Order XXI, rule 90 of the Code.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">10.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">So far as the submission made by Mr. Khan is concerned, we have gone through the decision referred by him. The decision is not at all applicable in the facts and circumstances of the instant case, in view of the fact that the judgment-debtor did not challenge the exparte decree passed in the suit, he challenged the auction sale of the mortgaged property on the ground of fraud.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">11.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">We have considered the application filed before the executing Court which is in the paper book. A mere look at the cause title of the application shows that the provision of Order XXI, rule 90 of the Code was specifically mentioned therein. Therefore, we do not find any substance in the submission of Mr. Faruque Ahmed as well as Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali that the application in question was filed under Order XXI, rule 89 of the Code and not under Order XXI, rule 90.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">12.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">It further appears that in the application, it was specifically stated that the mortgaged property valued at taka 1,50,00,000.00 was sold in auction at Tk.34,00,000/- (thirty four lac) only which was a shockingly low price. And neither the Bank nor the auction purchaser even attempted to dislodge the said allegation made in the application in any manner. We are of the view that this very allegation constitute a prima facie element of fraud. In the context, it is pertinent to state that in the written objection filed by the auction purchaser, he only gave a general denial of the statements made in the application under Order XXI, rule 90 of the Code including the value of the auction sold property, and under the head actual facts, nothing was said about the value of the auction sold property. It is also very interesting to state that although in the application filed under Order XXI, rule 90, it was specifically asserted that the auction purchaser was a <strong><em>Bharatia </em></strong>under the judgment-debtor and that in the early part of 2003, he entered into an agreement with the judgment-debtor to purchase the auction sold property at taka 1,50,00,000.00 stipulating that he would pay the said amount to the plaintiff Bank by December, 2004 and then would hand over the receipt of such payment and on such handing over the judgment-debtor would execute and register the sale deed in his favour (the auction purchaser) and that as per terms of the said agreement, the auction purchaser was bound to make the payment to the decree holder Bank, but he did not make the payment, rather collusively managed to sell the mortgaged property in auction at a shockingly low price of taka 34,00,000.00 only beyond his knowledge, violating the terms of the agreement and these facts were not denied by the auction purchaser. It further appears that in the application, it was further stated that the decree holder respondent No.l itself filed an application in the execution Court for rejecting the auction sale held on 10.09.2001 and for holding fresh auction, but the application was rejected by the Court and this fact was not also denied either by the decree holder Bank or by the auction purchaser, respondent No.2 and these facts prima facie substantiated that fraud was committed in holding the auction sale.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">13.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Be that as it may, we have given our anxious thought over the overall facts and circumstances of the case and the allegation made in the application under Order XXI, rule 90 of the Code that the property valued at taka 1,50,00,000.00 was sold at taka 34,00,000.00 only. It prima facie appears to us that both the Courts below i.e. the Executing Court and the High Court Division totally failed to consider the cause title of the application in question, the averment made therein and misconceived and misconstrued the provision of Order XXI, rule 90 of the Code in holding that the same was filed under Order XXI, rule 89 and not under Order XXI, rule 90 of the Code and this mislead them to reject the application of the judgment-debtor. We are of the view that since in the cause title of the application in question the provisions of Order XXI, rule 90 of the Code was specifically mentioned, there was no scope on the part of the Court to construe it otherwise. It is needless to state that to file an application under Order, XXI, rule 90 of the Code, no deposit as required by rule 89 of Order XXI of the Code was necessary.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">14.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">For the discussions made above, we find merit in the appeal and the same is allowed. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">15.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">The impugned judgment and order affirming the order of the executing Court and the Appellate Court is set aside.
