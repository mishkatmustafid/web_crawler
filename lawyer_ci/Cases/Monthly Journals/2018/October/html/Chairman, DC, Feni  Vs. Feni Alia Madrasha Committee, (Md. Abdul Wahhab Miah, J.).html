The plaintiff Mosque Committee took possession of the suit tank from defendant Nos.1- 3 by an oral gift in 1923 and subsequently got its possession. Since the establishment of Alia Madrasha Mosque in 1923 and immediately after establishment of Alia Madrasha, the suit tank is being possessed and used by the students of the said Madrasha and the local Muslims. The plaintiff Mosque has been cultivating and selling fish and by its income it constructed a pucca ghat measuring 100 feet long for using by the mussullis for the purpose of ablution and accordingly, the plaintiff has been in possession of the suit tank. On several times, the suit tank was leased out to many and the same is being used for religious purpose of the locality as well as the plaintiff. Subsequently, Sub-Divisional Officer of Feni and defendant Nos.1-3 made the plaintiff caretaker of the suit tank and entrusted it with the authority to use the same as per its necessity and for the purpose of giving lease to various persons the documents were also prepared in order to avoid complications. The plaintiff has been enjoying the suit tank along with land by way of ‘waqf immemorial user’ since 1923. On 26.04.1971, the Sub-Divisional Officer prepared some papers for leasing out the suit tank to one Enamul Huq Khan for 25 years at a salami of taka 5000. After the payment of said salami, Enamul Huq Khan executed a nadabi deed in favour of the plaintiff by recognising it as the owner by way of waqf by immemorial user. Thereafter, on 10.08.1981, defendant Nos.1-3 in collusion with each other created another lease document in favour of defendant No.4 most illegally and arbitrarily and on that day some employees of the District Council tried to catch fish from the suit tank, but the moazzin of the plaintiff mosque resisted them and on being resisted they disclosed about the creation of lease document in favour of the said defendant and hence the plaintiff was constrained to file the suit. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0in left 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Defendant Nos.1-3 contested the suit by filing written statement contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that on an application of the Feni Town Hall Committee the suit tank along with the other lands measuring an area of 1.08 acres land was leased out for constructing Feni Town Hall by the resolution of the Noakhali District Council dated 20.03.1967 and thereafter a decision was taken for giving lease of the said land to the Town Hall Committee for 10 years. But subsequently, approval was not given by the controlling authority and the District Council had no authority to give lease for 99 years and no permanent lease was given to the Town Hall. Thereafter, on 13.05.1967, decision was taken for giving lease of the said quantum of land to the Town Hall for 10 years by fixing some lease money. Although agreement was executed in favour of the District Council, the possession of the suit tank was not handed over to the Town Hall and in the meantime, 10 years period had already expired. In 1977 the Town Hall was established on 43 decimals vacant land. Town Hall did not take any steps for getting possession of the suit tank. Town Hall is separated by other land by a boundary wall. The Deputy Commissioner of Feni had the authority to give lease of the suit tank to the Mosque Committee. In 1975, a pucca ghat was constructed to the north side of the tank for using the tank by the staff of the District Council. The local people, the teachers and the students of the Madrasha and the musullis of the Mosque have been using the said ghat although on 01.05.1980 the plaintiff filed an application for getting lease of the suit tank, it did not participate in the auction. On 13.08.1981 Feni Pourashava prayed for granting lease of the land along with the suit tank to defendant No.4 and ultimately, lease was given to him for 5 years and hence the suit was liable to be dismissed. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0in left 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">At the trial both the parties adduced evidence, oral and documentary.

The learned Council further submitted that the High Court Division committed an error of law in setting aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal below inasmuch as performing ablution and bathing in the pond by the people of the locality do not extinguish the title of the District Council and convert the suit tank into a waqf by immemorial user; that the High Court Division as well the trial Court committed an error of law in holding that the suit pond has become waqf by immemorial user inasmuch as there is not an iota of evidence to show that the pond was excavated for the use of Musulli of the present Mosque nor there is any evidence at all that the plaintiff got the possession of the suit tank exclusively, rather it is admitted that the pond was leased out to various persons from time to time until 1981 by the petitioners. The learned Counsel also submitted that the finding of the High Court Division that the Court of Appeal below ‘without assigning any cogent ground or reasons’ reversed the finding of the trial Court is erroneous and contrary to evidence and materials on record inasmuch as the Court of Appeal below after considering the averment of the parties, the materials and evidence on record, reversed the findings of the trial Court by assigning cogent reasons and the findings of the Court of Appeal below are based on evidence and materials on record; that the High Court Division committed an error of law in setting aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal below and restoring the judgment of the trial Court inasmuch as the learned Advocate of the plaintiff-petitioner candidly submitted before the High Court Division that the Mosque Committee applied to the District Council for getting lease of the tank in question but the District Council did not grant lease to Mosque Committee and this admitted fact completely negated the contention that the suit tank is waqf by immemorial user, more so, when the property has not been enlisted as waqf property with the appropriate authority and no mutwalli has ever been appointed for the same.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0in left 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Syed Amirul Islam, learned Counsel, appearing for the appellant has, in fact, seriously argued the first submission on which leave was granted, namely, that the suit was not maintainable in law in view of the noncompliance with the provisions of section 91 of the Local Government Ordinance, 1976 (the Ordinance) inasmuch as before institution of the suit, no notice as required under the said section was served upon the District Council, Feni.

Although there is no consequence in the section the very language that no suit shall be instituted against a local parishad . . . until the expiration of one month next after notice in writing has been delivered or left at its office and that the plaint shall contain a statement that such notice has been so delivered or left clearly shows that service of notice as required by section 91 of the Ordinance was mandatory and in the absence of such notice, the suit could not be instituted, in other words the suit could not be maintained. And in the context, we may refer to some cases of this Division as well as of the High Court Division.

There is no doubt that ordinarily the right to sue accrues immediately upon the accrual of cause of action. Thus, in Ballentine’s Law Dictionary (1948 edition) the legal meaning of “accrual of cause of action” is stated to be “the coming or springing into existence of a right to sue”. Now, the right to sue does not mean a right to a mere filing of the suit. It means that right of obtaining from the Court an adjudication of the matters raised in the suit. If upon filing a suit without serving a notice u/s 109 (1), of the Chittagong Port Act, the plaintiffs finds that “unless such notice is proved, the Court shall dismiss te suit”, it means that his right to file the suit is unaffected, but his right to sue, i e, the right to receive adjudication from the Court on matter raised in the suit is impeded and obstructed. He has to remove that obstruction by serving a notice under sec.109(1). It is only then that he acquires a full right to sue. His cause of action has arisen before he has served the notice, but his right to sue is postponed and suspended till he serves a notice. The law requires the Court to see if the notice has been proved or not. If it has not been proved, the Court has no other option but to dismiss the suit. The defendant Port Trust is not even required to take up the defence that no notice u/s 109(1) has been served. It is also not competent to waive the mandatory requirement of notice. The duty and responsibility of adjudicating the notice provisions of section 109(1) fall squirely and exclusively upon the Court. It is neither dependent upon the defendant’s plea of absence of notice nor upon the defendant’s waiver of the requirement of notice. A suit is a still-born suit without notice u/s 109(1). In one other legislations of the kind, quoted above, a similar provisions exists.</span></em></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">            </span>.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">           </span> .<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">          </span>.</span></em></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“21. It appears, therefore, that in the context of the special features of section 109(1), “accrual of the right to sue” in sec.109(2) cannot be co-extensive with “accrual of the cause of action”. Plaintiff’s right to sue has been positively obstructed by the provision of notice in section 109(1). He can file a suit without a notice only on the pain of a mandatory dismissal. The dismissal will be automatic, even if the defendant fails to plead absence of notice or even if the defendant waives the notice. Under these circumstances, plaintiff’s liberty to file a suit is not a right to sue at all. His right to sue accrues only after the expiry of the notice period of one month. The word “next” in section 109(2) is a clear pointer to that direction. Section 109(2) in our view do not set out special period of limitation for actions or purported actions under the Chittagong Port Act. The general law of limitation is unaffected by section 109(2). It only gives the Port Trust a protection against unnoticed litigations and section 109(3) affords it an opportunity to tender sufficient amends within 6 months next after the accrual of the right to sue. The plaintiff, however, has to file the suit within 6 months after the notice period is over.”</span></em></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0in left 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">12.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In the case of Nur Muhammad and others (supra), this Division held that:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“<em>In our opinion, section 14A of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act has, in clear and unmistakable terms put an express embargo on entertainment of any suit or application against any order or action under the Act.
