That is one of the basic conditions for applicability of section 4 of the Partition Act which has been expressly mentioned in the section is that the stranger transferee must sue for partition and separate possession of the undivided share transferred to him by the co-sharer. If the stranger moves execution application for separating his share by metes and bounds it would be treated to be application for suing for partition and it is not necessary that separate suit should be filed by such stranger transferee. “Such transferee sues for partition” includes idea of some action by transferee to secure partition even praying saham in suit for partition paying necessary court fees which is totally absent in this case. In this case the defendant No.5 appellant Shamsul Alam is the transferee of the land under partition and the suit has been filed by Dr. Ashim Sarker who is not the transferee and appellant did not pray for any saham as yet in the said suit for partition, so the prayer for buying up by the plaintiff was not at all maintainable at the stage of the suit when the same was prayed for.

Sunil Kanti Sarker died leaving three sons Dr. Ashim Sarker, the plaintiff, Shambhu Sarker and Sanjib Sarker, the defendant No.2. Babul Sarker gifted .13 acre of land to plaintiff Dr. Ashim Sarker and Shanjib Sarker by two deeds of gift dated 09.03.1999 and 10.09.1999. The plaintiff Dr. Ashim and his brothers are in joint possession of the lands. He requested the defendants to effect partition of the suit land but the defendants did not pay any heed.

Ishan Chandra Dey died leaving his full brother Pran Krishna as his heir. Pran Krishna Dey died leaving two sons Umesh Chandra Sarker and Surendra Lal Sarker and another son Jugesh Chandra Sarker, predeceased Pran Krishna, leaving his widow Niroda Bala. Niroda sold her share to plaintiff’s father, the defendant No.3 by kabala deed dated 16.04.1959. Surendra Lal Sarker died leaving only son Babul Chandra Sarker, the defendant No.1. Babul Chandra Sarker transferred his share to Anima Sarker by a kabala deed dated 04.05.1978. Sunil Kanti (defendant No.3), father of the plaintiff, instituted Miscellaneous Case No.16 of 1986 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Hathazari against Anima Sarker to get the said land by way of pre-emption which was allowed. Anima Sarker preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No.37 of 1988 which ended on compromise and Sunil Kanti got the said land. Sunil Kanti and Umesh Chandra Sarker gifted their share to Charu Bala by deed of gift dated 11.03.1970. Charu Bala gifted the said land to Sunil Kanti Sarker, the defendant No.3, father of the plaintiff and Dilip Chandra Sarker, the defendant No.4 uncle of the plaintiff. Umesh Chandra Sarker executed a will on 26.03.1970 in favour of Sunil Kanti Sarker, Dilip Chandra Sarker and Amalendu Sarker who filed Probate Case No.70 of 1988 which was subsequently registered as civil suit No.04 of 1990. The said suit ended on compromise and Sunil Kanti Sarker, Dilip Chandra Sarker obtained order of probate. Sunil Kanti Sarker and Dilip Chandra Sarker purchased the share of Amalendu Sarker by kabala deed dated 28.12.1969. All the co-sharers effected an amicable partition of those land on 28.10.1995. Thereafter, the defendant No.3 Sunil Kanti Sarker, father of the plaintiff and defendant No.4 Dilip Chandra Sarker, uncle of the plaintiff, sold .66 acre of land to this defendant No.5 by kabala deed No.787 dated 20.07.1996. They also sold .23 acre of land to this defendant by another kabala deed No.804 dated 27.07.1996 and delivered possession. They also transferred some other lands by a deed of exchange. One Mabia Khanom filed Miscellaneous Case No.74 of 1996 in the 3rd Court of Joint District Judge, Chittagong for getting the said land by way of preemption which ended on compromise.

Dwelling house belonging to an undivided family means family not decided qua dwelling house. The essence is that the house itself should be undivided although the cosharers having defined shares. As long as there is a dwelling house which has not been divided qua the family it might be said to be a dwelling house belonging to an undivided family for the purpose of section 4(1) of the Act.

Section 44 is to maintain the integrity of the family dwelling-house which provides that the transferee of a dwelling house, if he/she is not a member of that family, gets no right to joint possession or common enjoyment of the house. The said provision adequately protects the family members against intrusion by an outsider into the dwelling house. The purchaser, though stranger, has certainly his title to the undivided share of the joint property by reason of his purchase but in enforcing his rights he is fettered to this extent that he cannot claim any joint possession in the undivided family dwelling house. That does not mean that the purchaser is without remedy. The purchaser has his remedy and he can sue for partition by metes and bounds and after such partition possess his own share, unless he is pre-empted under section 4 of the Partition Act. The only manner in which an outsider can get possession is to sue for possession and claim separation of his share. In that case section 4 of the Partition Act comes into play. In the case of Dorab Cowasji Warder V. Loomi Sorab Warder reported in (1990) 2 SCC 117 it was observed that even if the family is divided in status in the sense that they were holding the property as tenants in common but undivided qua the property, that is, the property had not been divided by metes and bounds, it would be within the provisions of section 44 of the Transfer of Property Act.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times-Roman',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: Times-Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times-Roman;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In such view of the discussion made above, it is observed that to get an order of preemption under section 4 of the Partition Act three condition are to be fulfilled, i.e. (1) the property must be dwelling house,<span style="color: #000000;"> (2) it must be t</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">he undivided family and then (3) the purchasers must file the partition suit.

If the stranger moves execution application for separating his share by metes and bounds it would be treated to be application for suing for partition and it is not necessary that separate suit should be filed by such stranger transferee. “Such transferee sues for partition” includes idea of some action by transferee to secure partition even praying saham in suit for partition paying necessary court fees which is totally absent in this case. In this case the defendant No.5 appellant Shamsul Alam is the transferee of the land under partition and the suit has been filed by Dr. Ashim Sarker who is not the transferee and appellant did not pray for any saham as yet in the said suit for partition, so the prayer for buying up by the plaintiff was not at all maintainable at the stage of the suit when the same was prayed for.
