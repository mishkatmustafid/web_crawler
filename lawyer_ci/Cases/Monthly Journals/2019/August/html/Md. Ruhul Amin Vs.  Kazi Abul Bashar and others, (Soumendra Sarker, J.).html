Thereafter, Tanjira Akther sold her share in favour of the pre-emptors on 19.06.1995.

The learned Advocate pointed out that there is no evidence on record that there was any contract for re-convenience and the O.

With regard to defect of parties no defect is noticed and scrutinizing the pleadings of the parties no where it is found that any necessary party is left out. Furthermore; the pre-emptors during trial prayed for reply of the interrogatories, but the opposite parties did not furnish any particulars in the form of reply to interrogatories, and as such the court below rightly decided the point in favour of the pre-emptors. With regard to the point of limitation and in nature of transfer deed, it is apparent from the face of the document that the deed in question is out and out a sub-kabala deed. Within the recital of the deed, there is no mention about the so-called mortgage or as to the existence of the alleged <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Ekrarnama</em>. Which will get priority. The evidence on record goes to show that admittedly no notice of transfer was given prior to the transfer deed and the cause of action as cited from the side of the pre-emptors has been corroborated by tangible evidence as adduced from their side. Besides this, with regard to the date of knowledge, from the cross-examination of the witnesses no such discrepancy or material contradiction is noticed by dint of which it can be held that prior to the date of <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">knowledge mentioned, the pre-emptor-respondents</span> were in the know about the case transfer. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">15.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Having gone through the connected papers I find that under section 24 of the Non Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949 the instant case was filed.
