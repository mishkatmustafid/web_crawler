It was of course, incumbent upon the learned Counsel for the appellants to get the said order of bail extended from time to time, this was not done by the learned Counsel, may be<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>a fault on the part of the learned Counsel. Now the question arises as to whether such a default on the part of learned counsel, can be attributed to the appellants without any notice upon them to that effect, with a view to bring them within the mischief of the term “fugitive from law” ? more particularly when we have already noticed that they have sufficiently complied with the command of the court by remaining inside the jail while filing this appeal. Therefore, we find it profitable to quote from the judgment of the Appellate Division, as we have already referred to above and reported in 40 DLR (AD) 281. “It would be less than chartable” to attribute to the appellants that they were ‘fugitive from Law”. Under these circumstances as stated above, and the position of law discussed, we find that we can safely dispose of the appeal by the appellant Nos. 2 and 3 as well as on merit and in doing so we can proceed accordingly. In the result this appeal is dismissed in respect of appellant No. 1 while the same is allowed in respect of appellant Nos. 2 and 3. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                               </span>. . .(48, 49 and 50)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Siraj Mal and others Vs.

At about 12 mid night Putul went out of the house with said Parvin (younger to Patul) to attend the call of nature and while both of them had been returning back to their school and on returning back. Therefore Shafiqul was warned for such teasing which enraged him and on the night following 20.05.2001 at about 12 mid night when Putul went out of her hut with her cousin Parvain (younger to Patul) to attend the call of nature and when she was returning back to her hut along with her cousin Parvin at that stage Shafiqul with the help of 7 others forcibly kidnapped Putul and had taken her to an unknown destination. Hearing now raised by Putul and Parvin other witnesses came around the scene, some of whom had seen the miscreants lifting away Putul. Thereafter a G.D. Entry was made with Jhenaigati Police Station. But the Police failed to trace her out.

In support of his contention the learned Assistant Attorney General has relied on the case of Siraj Mal and others –Vs- The State reported in 45 DLR 688, the case of Harpal Singh and another –Vs- The State of Himachal Pardesh reported in AIR 1981 (SC) 361, Bhagwat Prakash –Vs- The State of Allahabad reported in AIR 1956 (All) 22 and the case of Bharwada Bhogiubhai Hirijibhai -Vs- The State of Gujrat reported in AIR 1983 (SC) 753 with special emphasis on paragraphs 7 and 9 thereof. The learned Asstt.

Although the same has been taken into consideration presumably under section 23 of the said Ain. In this connection it may be pointed out that immediately after recovery of the victim girl she was brought before the Magistrate where her statement under section 22 of the Ain was recorded where she has categorically disclosed about the act of rape perpetrated upon her by Appellant No. 1 and the said statement has been fully corroborated by her while deposing before the Court as P.W. 2.

The order was therefore, illegal but the fact remains that the appellants submitted themselves to the sentence passed and obtained an interim order of bail in their favour albeit wrongly.
