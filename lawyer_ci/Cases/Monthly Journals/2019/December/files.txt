This led to communication BANK and forth between the Banks’s BoD and the Ministry of Finance seeing the latter’s approval of appointments in the vacancies. Significantly, in its communication of 01.09.2015 to the Ministry, the Bank confirmed, inter alia, that the merit list itself had a validity period till 13.08.2015. Hence the applicants, though successful, cannot remain in expectation of being appointed after that date. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">  </span>14</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: 189.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: 189.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">Evidence Act (I of 1872)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: 189.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">Section 115</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: 189.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;">The advertisement in response to which the petitioners applied was for a finite number of vacancies.

The last date of submitting applications was 26.02.2014. The writ-petitioners duly applied for the posts advertised in the recruitment circulars upon fulfilling the necessary prerequisites. They received their admit cards and sat for the examinations as per the job circular dated 27.01.2004. The MCQ and written examinations for the posts of Senior Officer, Officer and Officer Cash were held on 22.08.2014 and 13.09.2014 respectively.

It is stated further that out of a total of 1,707 posts, 1,436 candidates were selected for direct recruitment. The Bank clarifies further that due to not having enough candidates in -the "Freedom Fighters Quota" it was not possible to appoint 271 candidates in the same. It is stated that after sending the appointment letters out to 1,436 appointees, 1,306 appointees joined in their respective posts. Among the 40 candidates who had not joined, 8 candidates were in "Freedom Fighters Quota” and subsequently due to non-availability of candidates under the said quota the Bank’s Board of Directors("BOD") on 28.07.2015 decided to recruit candidates against the 32 remaining posts where 25 candidates were in merit quota, 4 were in district quota, two were in female quota and 1 was from tribal quota and the said decision was approved at the BOD's 436<sup>th</sup> Meeting of 05.08.2015. The said decision was conveyed to respondent No.7, being the Bank's Deputy General Manager, Human Resources Development Department on 06.08.2015. This, the Bank submits, goes to show that the said 32 candidates were appointed only against the posts which could not be filled by the otherwise directly selected candidates and states in reiteration that the said posts were among those covered by the circular of January, 2014.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Before the High Court Division, it was submitted on behalf of the Bank that the statements made in the said writ petition that the writ-petitioners were supposed to be recruited from a "Panel List" is absolutely imaginary, vague, baseless and misconceived. It was asserted that there was nothing, in the job circulars that even remotely suggested the prospects of any panel or waiting list permitting of an available pool of prospective recruitees. The Bank's position generally is that it only appointed the successful candidates from the merit list in the vacant posts and that the impugned job circulars published on 22.02.2016 are for completely new posts other than the ones advertised on 27.01.2014. In the circumstances, therefore, the Bank sees no automatic right arising in favour of the writ-petitioners to be recruited for the new posts <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">at</span> any future date.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Writ-respondent No.7 further contended that there was nothing included in the job circular dated 27.01.2014 that ‘a panel’ or ‘waiting list’ would be prepared for future recruitment in the posts of Senior Officer, Officer and Officer Cash. He further contended that the idea of preparation and recruitment from such ‘panel’ or ‘waiting list’ was just a fictitious belief of the writ-petitioners. Mere proposal of recommendations made by the concerned authority as reflected in the annexure to the writ petition did not create any legal or vested right in favour of the petitioners to be recruited in the new posts circulated on 22.02.2016 in various dailies. He further contended that the writ-respondents did not provide any unequivocal assurance whether by means of an expressed promise or an established practice that the successful candidates would be recruited for any post created in future from the panel or waiting list.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Writ-respondent No.2 by filing affidavit-in-opposition contended that the panel waiting list had validity and the awaiting candidates would be called up if the appointed candidate failed to join, left the post or otherwise the post fell vacant. Under the recruitment circular dated 27.01.2014, the validity period for appointment in the post of Senior Officer, Officer and Officer Cash from the panel waiting list was on 30.06.2015 which was extended till 31.12.2015. The impugned recruitment circular dated 22.02.2016 was published after expiry of the panel waiting list’s validity period and the panel waiting list prepared under a particular recruitment circular was not entitled to be considered in the subsequent recruitment circular. Writ-respondent No.2 further contended that the said panel of Senior Officer, Officer and Officer Cash were prepared by Sonali Bank Limited before formation of BSC and BSC had no jurisdiction to give any suggestion in this regard. The impugned job circular was issued as per decision of the Ministry of Finance.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">In due course, after hearing both the parties, by the impugned judgement and order, the Rule was discharged.

The Bank authority had filled up the vacancies as per merit list from the qualified candidates. Subsequently, they prepared a waiting panel list with the successfully qualified candidates including the petitioners for the purpose of filling up the vacancies in future. The long time practice and custom of the state-owned Banks and other financial institutions is that the recruitment in the upcoming vacant positions is always filled up from the waiting panel list. Thereby, the writ-petitioners had a legitimate expectation to be recruited in the post of Senior Officer, Officer and Officer Cash in Sonali Bank Limited. He further submitted that in all the circulars pre-formation of the Bankers Selection Committee, did not contain any word that a Panel or Waiting List would be prepared with the successful candidates but it was a regular practice to form the said Panel or Waiting List for filling up the upcoming vacancies. The writ-respondents have already acted on the said tradition or practice and cannot deny without giving <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">prior</span> notice to the writ-petitioners. Hence the impugned judgement and order dated 27.07.2017 is liable to be set aside. He further submitted that the High Court Division failed to consider the fact that customs are also recognised as having force of law as per article 152 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. Considering the definition of law in the said article, the High Court Division should have made the Rule absolute and as <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">such</span><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">, </em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">the impugned judgement and order dated 27.07.2017 is liable to be </span>set aside. He further submitted that the High Court Division failed to appreciate that admittedly the list prepared by the respondents had not been made public by way <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">of</span> publishing the same in any manner. The petitioners own source gathered information about the said list. Once a List is prepared with the successfully qualified candidates to fill up specific vacancies the respondents cannot refuse to appoint them whimsically in those posts when vacancy exists. Due to the promise of the respondents, the petitioners relied upon their promise and they had been waiting to be appointed in the vacant posts and in the meantime, most of them have crossed the age limit to get appointment in the civil service. The High Court Division without considering the above facts and circumstances arrived at an erroneous conclusion of the case and as such, the impugned judgement and order dated 27.07.2017 is liable to be set aside. He further submitted that the High Court Division failed to appreciate that the respondents have promised to the petitioners that they will be recruited as and when vacancy occurs in the future and accordingly there had been vacancies in the aforesaid three posts, but respondent No.2 without considering the demand of the petitioners had published the job circulars dated 22.02.2016 which is apparent violation of the established “principle of estoppel” from going back on their earlier promise. He farther submitted that the petitioners had a legitimate expectation that they will be recruited in the aforesaid three posts, but respondent No.2 most arbitrarily and illegally published the impugned job circulars dated 22.02.2016 with an intention to fill up the vacancies excluding the petitioners who are on the waiting panel list. It is a settled principle that judicial review may be allowed on the plea of frustration of legitimate expectation in five specific situations: (i) if there is a promise by the authority expressed either by their representation or conduct, (ii) the decision of the authority was arbitrary or unreasonable <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">within the</span> Wednesbury <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">principle</span>, (i<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">ii)there was a failure on the part of the concerned authority to act fairly in taking the decision, (iv) the expectation </span>to be crystallized into a legitimate one, it must be based on clear facts and circumstances leading to a definite expectation and not a mere anticipation or a wish or hope and also must be reasonable in the circumstances and (v) judicial review may allow such a legitimate expectation and quash the impugned decision even in the absence of a strict legal right unless there is an overriding public interest to defeat such an expectation. In the present case, the above observation falls squarely in favour of the petitioners and as such, the impugned judgement and order dated 27.07.2017 is liable to be set aside. He farther submitted that the petitioners have already crossed their age limit to apply for public service while waiting to be recruited in the aforesaid three posts. The policy of the Government in the present era cannot be of ignoring the public interest. If the respondents are allowed to proceed with the recruitment in the aforesaid post of Senior Officer, Officer and Officer Cash then the petitioners will be nowhere with their lives and will suffer irreparable loss and injury and hence all farther <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">actions on the basis</span> of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">impugned</span> job circular dated 22.02.2016 should be stayed for ends of justice. He further submitted that the petitioners will be highly prejudiced if their right to have equal opportunity in the public service is denied only on technical ground. There are instances in other state-owned banks and financial institutions wherein the validity of the Panel is extended from time to time to facilitate the respective banks to fill up the upcoming vacancies to meet their urgent need. There is no specific law or tradition barring extension of the validity period of a Panel or Waiting List. At the same time, it cannot be decided whimsically to deprive the petitioners from their legitimate right. The High Court Division failed to appreciate the aforesaid aspect of the fact and law and as such the impugned judgement and order is liable to be set aside for ends of justice.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Attorney General appearing for respondent Nos.1-6 in CP Nos.161 and 397 of 2018 supported the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">10.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Mr. Shamim Khaled, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of respondent No.7 in CP No. 161 of 2018 also supported the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">11.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Mr. Sheikh Zakir Hossain, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents in CP Nos.699 and 716-717 of 2018 supported the impugned judgement and order.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">12.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates appearing on behalf of the respective parties and perused the impugned judgement of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">13.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">It appears from the judgement of the High Court Division that “the job circular of January, 2014 is silent regarding the creation of “Panels” or “Waiting Lists” and did not provide any unequivocal assurance, whether by means of a promise or an established practice, that the successfully passed candidates who have not been appointed at the initial stage shall nevertheless be appointed to any posts created in the future from any “Panel” or a “Waiting List”. The Merit List that the Respondents have relied upon in the facts for their internal purposes is instead, and in contradiction to the notion of “Panel” or “Waiting List”, found by the High Court Division to be an integral part of any fair and transparent evaluation<a name="bookmark0"></a> and selection process leading to appointments based purely on merit.” The High Court Division observed that the merit list in question in the facts was found to have lost all efficacy beyond 13.08.2015, i.e. its declared and recorded validity period. The High Court Division found that upon filling up of posts as initially remained vacant due to the non-acceptance of appointments by directly selected candidates against advertised posts, the merit list ceased to have all efficacy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">14.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">On perusal of the materials on record, we do not find anything to suggest that any indication was given to the intending applicants that they would be included in a “Panel” or “Waiting List” and would be considered for recruitment in the future. The advertisement in response to which the petitioners applied was for a finite number of vacancies. Once those vacancies are filled in there cannot be any expectation that the candidates who were successful in the examination would automatically be appointed in any future recruitment drive.

Md. Siddiqur Rahman was appointed as Nikah Registrar on 13.03.1973 by the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs and he was given a licence (mb`) authorizing him to register Mohammedan Marriage and Divorce and perform function as a Quazi within the jurisdiction of Simulpara and Siddhirgonj Union Parishads under P.S. Siddhirgonj, which was at that time within the district of Dhaka. In 2003 one Md. Masihur Rahman was appointed as Nikah Registrar for Simulpara Union Parishad curtailing the jurisdiction of the writ petitioner. In the year 2005 Siddhirgonj Union Parishad was converted into Siddhirgonj Pourasova, comprising five Wards and in the year 2011 Siddhirgonj Pourasova was merged into Narayangonj City Corporation. The writ petitioner was performing his duties as the Nikah Registrar of Ward Nos.1 to 5 under the Narayangonj City Corporation.

In a recent judgement by this Division in Civil Appeal Nos. 177 and 178 of 2005 (judgement delivered on 31<sup>st</sup> of May, 2016) it was observed that “upon conversion of the Union Parishad to a Pourasava only the character of the administrative unit changes.” In our view the same applies to the situation where a Pourasava becomes or is merged with a City Corporation. In the aforementioned case this Division held that after conversion the Kazi(Nikah Registrar) continues as Kazi for all the Wards of the newly created administrative unit (in this case City Corporation). He would remain the Nikah Registrar having jurisdiction over the whole of the territory for which he had been appointed as such until his jurisdiction is lawfully curtailed in respect of some or any of the Wards. Such curtailment is a power given to the Government by law, and cannot, therefore, be said to be unlawful. At the same time it must be stated that curtailment does not entail taking away all the Wards of the incumbent Nikah Registrar, thereby negating his licence altogether. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">14.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">In the impugned judgement the High Court Division observed that “as soon as the law regarding local jurisdiction has been changed those [posts] fallen (sic<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">.)</em> vacant and respondent No. 5 has authority to issue the impugned orders.” In our view such observation is not entirely correct, inasmuch as upon getting a new administrative character (City Corporation) the posts of Nikah Registrar for the relevant Wards do not <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ipso facto</em> become vacant. The position of Nikah Registrar for Ward Nos. 1-5 of Narayangonj City Corporation never became vacant and until the appointment of writ respondents 7-10 in Ward Nos. 1-4 of Narayangonj City Corporation, respondent No. 1 remained Nikah Registrar for all the former Wards of Siddirgonj Pourasova, i.e. Ward Nos. 1-5 of Narayangonj City Corporation.

The learned Deputy Attorney General has supplied us with a list of the incumbent Nikah Registrars of Ward Nos. 1 to 6 of Narayangonj City Corporation. It is apparent from this list that A.S.M. Siddiqur Rahman is listed as Nikah Registrar for Ward No. 5 of Narayangonj City Corporation. We also note that Md.

However, from the records we find that said Md.

However, that position appears to have been superseded by the list provided by the District Registrar, Narayangonj dated 12.10.2015 which is incorporated in the additional paper book dated 11.11.2015 at page 24, where Md. Masihur Rahman is listed as the Nikah Registrar of Ward No. 6 of Narayangonj City Corporation. At page 23 of the said paper book we find the name of A.S.M.

His jurisdiction in Ward Nos. 1-4 has been curtailed. Md. Masihur Rahman is the incumbent Nikah Registrar for Ward No. 6 of Narayangonj City Corporation.

Mina Raza Chowdhury sold the suit premises to the plaintiff by a registered kabala No.14815/2001 dated 31.12.2001. The said fact of the sale by Mina Raza Chowdhury was duly notified to the defendant. When the plaintiff demanded rent from the defendant in the first part of January, 2002 she stated that she had paid rent in advance up to December, 2002 to the ex-landlord, Mina Raza Chowdhury. On query by the plaintiff, Mina Raza Chowdhury admitted the said fact of payment of advance rent to her and handed over to her the part of the receipt of the landlord showing receipt of rent. The plaintiff and her husband jointly decided to construct multistoried building in the suit premises and the other 3(three) adjacent shops which her husband purchased earlier, by demolishing the existing dilapidated shops and, accordingly, got a plan approved by Sylhet Pourashava on 10.03.2002. After approval of the plan, the plaintiff approached the defendant in the first part of the month of April, 2002 to vacate the suit premises by receiving back the advance rent paid by her. In presence of the witnesses the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span>defendant agreed to deliver vacant possession of the suit premises in December, 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thereafter, in the first part of January, 2003 when the plaintiff asked the defendant to hand over possession of the suit premises she took time on this or that plea. Subsequently, though the plaintiff requested the defendant again and again to hand over vacant possession of the suit premises, she did not hand over vacant possession of the suit premises. Since January, 2003 the defendant did not pay any rent to the plaintiff and thus she became a defaulter. The plaintiff requires the suit premises <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">bona fide</em> for reconstruction. As the defendant did not vacate the suit premises, the plaintiff issued a notice to her on 09.03.2003 through her Advocate under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act determining the tenancy with the expiry of 31.03.2003 asking her to deliver vacant possession of the suit premises, otherwise legal steps would be taken to evict her and also to realise the arrear rents from her. The defendant duly received the said notice yet did not vacate the suit premises, hence the plaintiff filed the suit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The suit was contested by the defendant by </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">filing <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">written statement contending, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">inter alia</em></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em>, </em></strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">that she has been running a business in the suit premises in the name "Adorsha Library" under the landlord, Mina Raza Chowdhury and others.

Taufique Hossain, learned Advocate-on-Record<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span>appearing on behalf of the respondent made submissions in support of the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division. He submitted that </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">the High Court Division rightly found that the plaintiff could not establish that the transfer of ownership of the case property was made with the knowledge of the defendant tenant and moreover, even after such transfer the former landlord Mina Raza Chowdhury took advance rent for the whole year of 2002 A.D. and that payment was also admitted and acknowledged by the plaintiff and when Mina Raza Chowdhury refused to accept rent from the defendant she was compelled to deposit rent regularly to the rent controller and so the defendant could not be treated as defaulter and therefore, the judgement of the High Court Division is sustainable in law. He further submitted that the High Court Division rightly found that the defendant purchased the transferable tenancy right in the suit premises from the previous tenant who transferred the same to her with due acknowledgement of the landlord and so she is not an ordinary monthly ejectable tenant and she has been paying rent regularly and so cannot be evicted and, therefore, the judgement of the High Court Division is sustainable in law. The learned Advocate also submitted that the High Court Division having rightly found that the landlord on receipt of salami granted transferable tenancy right to the defendant tenant, the question of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">bona fide</em> requirement is not relevant in the instant case and further renovation of a market or commercial centre cannot be treated as a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">bona fide</em> requirement and for such renovation or reconstruction a permanent tenant cannot be evicted and, therefore, the judgement of the High Court Division is liable to be upheld.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He also submitted that the High Court Division rightly found that the defendant acquired a right of permanent tenancy in the suit premises and she has been paying rent regularly to the Rent Controller and the owner of the suit premises can withdraw the rent deposited with the Rent Controller and the defendant is not an ordinary ejectable monthly tenant and therefore, the judgement of the High Court Division is sustainable in law. He submitted that the Small Causes Court failed to consider that the defendant is not an ordinary monthly tenant under Mina Raza Chowdhury in that the suit premises belonged to former Zaminder Dewan Talebur Raza Chowdhury which was originally leased out to one Abdur Razzak by taking salami from him who transferred his leasehold right to one Rafique Ahmed Chowdhury who transferred it to his father Chan Miah Chowdhury who again transferred it to the father of the defendant and, subsequently, the father of the defendant transferred it to him and on the occasion of each transfer the landlord, including Chan Miah Chowdhury took salami from the transferee and all such transactions were made with the acknowledgment of the landlord Mina Raza Chowdhury and hence the defendant and her predecessor are not ordinary monthly ejectable tenant but has got perpetual tenancy right and hence the present suit for ejectment is not maintainable and as such, the High Court Division rightly reversed the judgement of the Small Causes Court. The learned Advocate submitted that from the materials on record it is seen that the transfer of ownership of the suit premises was not informed by the plaintiff to the defendant formally and even after the alleged transfer Mina Raza Chowdhury took rent for one year in advance (for the year 2002 AD) from the defendant and so the alleged transfer was made without any knowledge of the defendant and the defendant purchased the transferable monthly tenancy in the suit premises. He submitted that the High Court Division was right in holding that the defendant acquired a right of permanent tenancy in the suit premises and so there was "no scope to evict" her therefrom and the payment of rent with the House Rent Controller did not make her a monthly ejectable tenant and she cannot be termed as defaulter. The learned Judge of Small Causes Court failed to appreciate that the notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act is invalid for not containing the actual description of the suit premises and the suit premises being vague and unspecified the judgment of the Small Causes Court is not sustainable in law which has been rightly reversed by the High Court Division. He submitted that the learned Judge of the Small Causes Court committed an error of law in not considering that the plaintiff failed to prove her <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">case of atornment and </span>the defendant admittedly paid rent up to December 2002 and for payment of rent for the month of January 2003 went to the house of Mina Raza Chowdhury who was found absent and accordingly sent the rent by money order on 04.02.2003 and the same was returned on 22.02.2003 and filed Rent Control Case No. 11<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>of 2003 on 26.02.2003 and since then is depositing the rent till today and hence, the defendant cannot be termed as defaulter and therefore, the judgement of the High Court Division reversing the decision of the Small Causes Court is sustainable in law. He lastly submitted that the learned Judge of the Small Causes Court failed to give due consideration to the fact that the defendant used to run the business of "Adarsha Library" in the suit premises for long 50 years with goodwill and as permanent tenant and in the circumstances the defendant is not an ordinary monthly ejectable tenant under the Premises Rent Control Act and therefore, the judgment of the High Court Division is sustainable in law.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates appearing for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The Small Causes Court Suit No.4 of 2003 was filed by the respondent herein on 11.05.2003 for eviction of the monthly tenant, appellant herein for default in payment of rent, claiming also that the property being in a dilapidated condition, she wished to construct a new multi-storied building which she needed for her own use.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">10.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">On the other hand, the appellant denied the plaintiff’s claim that the building was dilapidated or that she needed the property for her own use.

On the other hand, we note that section 10 of the Premises Rent Control Act provides that no landlord can demand any premium, salami, security or any like payment, or advance rent in excess of one month’s rental. Even if there was a specific term in the tenancy agreement to pay salami, such a term would render the agreement void under section 23 of the Contract Act, as was held in the case of <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Mustaque Hussain (Md) vs Md Shajahan Miah and another, 57 DLR (AD) 60.</em></strong> It was further held that, “Section 10 of the Premises Rent Control Act, 1991 makes the legal practice of payment of salami prohibited and that the tenant is entitled to refund of the salami paid by him within six months of such payment under section 14 and the landlord was liable to pay fine for receiving salami under section 3 of the said Act. The widespread and long-standing practice of voluntary payment of salami in the commercial world did not make the tenant a non-ejectable one and no interest other than the tenancy right recognised by law could be created on payment of salami so as to prevent the tenant not liable to be ejected on specific legal ground for the purpose. Under section 18 of the Premises Rent Control Act the landlord is entitled to eject a tenant as soon as a monthly tenant is a defaulter or a landlord bona fide requires the premises or for building and rebuilding purpose.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">15.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In view of the above decision, the finding of the High Court Division is palpably erroneous.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">16.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">With regard to the notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, the High Court Division simply stated that the plaintiff could not establish that the transfer of ownership was made known to the defendant or that formal notice was sent to the defendant. Such finding is clearly in oversight of the evidence and materials on record. We find that DW1 admitted having received the notice under section 106 in March 2003. He also admitted that the said notice mentioned the fact that the plaintiff had purchased the shop premises on 31.12.2001. This is borne out by the legal notice dated 09.03.2003, which was marked as Exhibit-6. He was also aware that, apart from the suit shop, the plaintiff’s husband had purchased the other three adjacent shops.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">17.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">It is evident that in spite of finding out that the property had been purchased by the plaintiff and admittedly having received the notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, the defendant continued to deposit rent before the Rent Controller for the benefit of the original landlord rather than for the benefit of the plaintiff who claimed in her notice to have purchased the property. We find from the records that the defendant filed the Rent Control Case No.11 of 2003 before the Rent Controller on 26.02.2003 after the original landlord, namely Mina Raza Choudhury had refused to receive rent. Thereafter, she admittedly received the legal notice under section 106 dated 09.03.2003 wherein it was stated that the plaintiff had purchased the property, but still the defendant did not in any way approach or pay rent to the plaintiff. In this regard we may profitably refer to the decision in the case of <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Basiruddin Ahmed and another vs Dhirendra Mohan Das and another, 1984 BCR (AD) 297</em></strong>. In that case it was argued that the tenants did not make any offer of rent to the plaintiffs as they had certain bona fide doubt as to whether the latter were really entitled to receive the rent. It was observed that the tenants never came to the landlords to enquire whether they were ready to accept rent from them, and the Rent Deposit Case was filed against the previous landlord who had allegedly refused to accept rent. In the instant case we also note that admittedly the defendant did not make any enquiries as to the transfer of the property to the plaintiff nor approached the plaintiff in order to pay the rent. In the aforementioned case their Lordships held that, “deposit of rent in favour of the previous landlord became totally irrelevant as soon as that landlord ceased to have any interest in the suit premises after the transfer; deposit in her favour cannot be taken as a ground to resist ejectment when sought by the new landlord to whom no rent was paid in spite of notice of the transfer. If the tenants had any doubt about the service of the notice through lawyer they could have enquired from the landlords themselves seeking clarification.” Their Lordships went on to hold that the new landlords may not be entitled to the rent prior to the transfer, but they are certainly entitled to receive rent since the transfer and this rent not having been paid the tenants were defaulters.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">18.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The High Court Division held that the question of bona fide requirement was not relevant since the transferable tenancy right was granted by the landlord on receipt of salami. However, in view of our observation regarding legality/illegality of salami, such finding of the High Court Division is not tenable. Moreover, from the deposition of witnesses, it is evident that the suit property is old and requires modernisation, especially since all the adjacent properties are multi-storied.

The writ-petitioner had since been performing her duties. On completion of her probation period, the Managing Committee of the School at a meeting dated 25.7.1992 took a decision confirming her service. The writ-petitioner got herself admitted to B.Ed Programme under the Open University of Bangladesh. <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">For </span>appearing in the 4<sup>th</sup> Semester examination, she took leave from the school authority <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">from 23.06.20</span>01 to 26.06.2001. Because of hartal, the examination <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">scheduled to be held </span>On 26.06.2001 could not take place and was ultimately <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">shifted to 30.06.2001. </span>On 27.06.2001, the writ-petitioner came to the school and performed <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">her </span>usual duties and after that she went to the office of writ-respondent No.8 (Headmistress of the School) informing her about the examinations to <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">be </span>held on 28.06.2001 and 30.06.2001 and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>prayed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>for<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>leave<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>for appearing in those remaining examinations. On 01.07.2001 the writ-petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">came to the </span>School and started discharging her routine duties. She also <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">filed an </span>application praying for leave of absence for those 2 days but to her utter surprise, she found that writ-respondent No.8 rejected the application <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">for </span>leave of absence. The following day, writ-respondent No.8 issued an <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">order in </span>writing restraining the writ-petitioner from performing all kinds of activities <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">in the </span>school for 15 days and served a notice on the writ-petitioner for showing cause within 7 days as to why action should not be taken against her for negligence of duties. On 07.07.2001, the writ-petitioner replied to the notice for showing cause denying the allegations levelled against her. The writ-petitioner made an application to writ-respondent No.8 stating that she was extremely sorry for not taking leave by filing an application for appearing in the remaining two papers of the 4<sup>th </sup>semester B.Ed examination and, therefore, she prayed for exoneration. By influencing writ-respondent No.7, writ-respondent No.8 succeeded in suspending the writ-petitioner from service. The writ-petitioner acknowledged receiving the order of suspension and made an application to respondent No.7, the President of the Managing Committee of the School requesting him for reconsideration of the order of suspension but without any result. Finding no other alternative, the writ-petitioner filed Title Suit No.260 of 2001 in the Court of Assistant Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka challenging the order of suspension. Without prior approval of the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dhaka (the Board), writ-respondent Nos.7 and 8 dismissed the writ-petitioner from service on 02.09.2001. Having collected a copy of the order of dismissal, the writ-petitioner made an amendment of the plaint incorporating the order of dismissal in it. During pendency of the suit, the writ-petitioner appeared before the Appeal and Arbitration Committee of the Board. In presence of both the parties, the Appeal and Arbitration Board verbally made a decision directing the writ-petitioner to withdraw the suit within 15 days and to give an undertaking on a non-judicial stamp of Tk.150/- that she would not remain absent in future without leave and that after compliance, the writ-petitioner would be entitled to join in service. On 10.08.<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">2002, </span>the writ-petitioner made a representation in writing to writ-respondent No.2, the Chairman of the Board (the Ex-Officio Chairman of the Appeal and Arbitration Board) praying for a written copy of the above decision. But the Board slept over the matter for about 5 months. Meanwhile, Title Suit No.260 of 2001 was dismissed by the judgement and decree dated 21.08.2002. The writ-petitioner appealed against the decree being Title Appeal No.512 of 2002. During pendency of Title Appeal No. 512 of 2002, the Appeal and Arbitration Committee communicated its decision dated 17.07.2002 and 05.08.2002 by a memo dated 08.1.2003 (Annexure-J) to the writ-petitioner after long 5 months of its decision. On receipt of the decision of the Appeal and Arbitration Committee, the writ-petitioner filed an application under Order XXIII Rule 1(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) before the learned District Judge on 13.1.2003 for withdrawal of the appeal. The order of withdrawal was passed on the same date. Having fulfilled all the conditions set forth by the Appeal and Arbitration Committee of the Board, the writ-petitioner filed an application to writ-respondent No.7 on 21.01.2003 to reinstate her in service but was refused. On 04.02.2003 the writ-petitioner made a representation to the Board for non­compliance of its decision contained in the memo, dated 08.01.2003 by writ-respondent No.7. Writ-respondent No.5 communicated the decision of the Board by a memo dated 11.05.2003 directing writ-respondent No.8, the Head Mistress of the school to reinstate the writ-petitioner in her service within 30 days from the date of issuance of that memo. The order dated 11.05.2003 issued under the signature of writ-respondent No.5 is binding upon the school authority. On 19.05.2003 the writ-petitioner made another application to writ-respondent No.7 pursuant to the memo dated 11.05.2003 praying for reinstating her in service. Writ-respondent No.8 did not accept the copy of that application. The writ-petitioner then sent the same by registered post. On 17.06.2003, the writ-petitioner made another application to writ-respondent No.2 referring to the memo dated 11.05.2003 issued under the signature of writ-respondent No.5 requesting the Board Authority for taking effective measures for reinstating her in service. That letter was received by the office of writ-respondent No.2 on 17.06.2003. On 10.08.2003, the writ-petitioner made a representation to the Minister for Education stating all facts as well as her miserable economic condition. On 10.08.2003 the Minister directed the Chairman of the Board to resolve the matter, but unfortunately it did not happen. On 09.03.2004 the writ-petitioner made an application to writ-respondent No.2 for reinstating her in service. Similar applications were made thereafter, but without any result. On 27.06.2004, the writ-petitioner served a notice upon the writ-respondents demanding justice. After that, the writ-petitioner filed Writ Petition No.3844 of 2004 before the High Court Division praying for a direction upon the Managing Committee of the School to accept her joining pursuant to the decision of the Appeal and Arbitration Committee. The Rule <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Nisi</em> was, however, discharged on the ground of its non-maintainability. Having obtained a copy of the judgement passed in the above writ petition, the writ-petitioner made an application to writ-respondent No.3 praying for reinstating her in service pursuant to the observation made by the High Court Division. Soon afterwards, the writ-petitioner came to know that the Appeal and Arbitration Committees suspended its own decision dated 08.01.2003 approving the illegal and unlawful order of dismissal passed by the school authority.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Writ-respondent No.8 filed an affidavit-in-opposition in the instant case controverting all the material allegations made in the writ petition. The case of writ-respondent No.8, in short, is that instead of giving reply to the allegations brought against the writ-petitioner, she made some wild allegations against the authority. The Managing Committee of the School advised the writ-petitioner to submit a fresh reply stating the actual facts, but she ignored the advice and filed an application to the Headmistress seeking permission to join her service on 15.07.2001. Instead of taking permission from the Managing Committee the writ-petitioner took away that application. When the Managing Committee, asked the writ-petitioner about her misbehaviour with the Headmistress, she misbehaved with one of the members of the Managing Committee from the category of the guardians. On 16.7.2001 the Managing Committee in its meeting formed a three-member enquiry committee headed by Mr. Aminullah, a member of the Managing Committee. According to the report of the committee, the writ-petitioner was suspended from service. During pendency of the suit the Appeal and Arbitration Committee of the Board advised the writ-petitioner to withdraw the suit and to file an undertaking, but she did not withdraw the suit. The suit was in fact dismissed by a decree against which the writ-petitioner filed an appeal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">After hearing the parties, by the impugned judgement and order, the High Court Division made the Rule <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Nisi</em> absolute.

Section 3 of the Arbitration Act makes a general statement about the ‘scope’ of application of the provisions of Arbitration Act. The Legislature by engraving the word ‘scope’ in the marginal note of Section 3 of the Arbitration Act sought to mean that while the provisions of this law shall be mandatorily applied to ‘domestic arbitration’, ‘international commercial arbitration’ which would take place in Bangladesh and execution of the award passed by the foreign arbitral tribunal as provided in Sections 45, 46 &amp; 47, the provisions of the Arbitration Act may also be applied for foreign arbitration, if the parties to the foreign arbitration in their arbitration agreement makes such stipulation. There is apparently no mentioning about conferring or ousting of the jurisdiction of the High Court Division or the Court in Section 3 of the Arbitration Act. Section 3 of the Arbitration Act is a general statement about the ‘scope’ of applicability of the provisions of the Arbitration Act for ‘the arbitration’; it does not make any statement about the functions or jurisdiction of the Court. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                                   </span>...36, 37 and 56</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Arbitration Act (I of 2001)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Sections 7, 7A, 10, 12, 14(4), 20, 21(4), 42, 44, 45, 48 and 50<u></u></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Jurisdiction of the Courts in arbitration matters: </span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">‘</span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman Bold',serif;">Parties to the arbitration’ are barred by the provisions of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act to file any legal proceeding in any Court. However, there is permissive space for ‘the parties to the arbitration’ to file legal proceedings, about which the Arbitration Act makes provisions to approach the Courts. The legal proceedings permitted by the Arbitration Act are; (i) application under Section 7A for obtaining interim order, (ii) application under Section 10 for referring the dispute to the arbitration tribunal and thereby stay the proceedings in the Court, (iii) application under Section 12 for appointment of arbitral tribunal, (iv) application under Section 20 before the High Court Division for determining the jurisdiction of arbitral tribunal, (v) application under Section 21(4) before the District Court for enforcement of an interim order passed by the tribunal, (vi) application under Section 42 for setting aside arbitral award, (vii) application under Sections 44 and 45 before the District Court for enforcement of domestic arbitral award and foreign arbitral award respectively (viii) appeals under Sections 14(4) and 48 before the High Court Division and (ix) application under Section 50 before the District Court for arbitrators’ remuneration. It is the Section 7 of the Arbitration Act which deals with the issues of jurisdiction of the Courts. The position of Section 7 is superior than other provisions of the Arbitration Act and other laws and till now it retains its aforesaid superiority, except in the case of passing the injunction Order, preservation Order and other interim/interlocutory Orders enumerated in clauses (a) to (g) of Section 7A(1) of the Arbitration Act. </span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">         </span>...39 and 56</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Arbitration Act (I of 2001)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Sections 7A and 45<u></u></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Whether this Court is competent to pass any interim Order where the arbitration is being or would be held outside Bangladesh: </span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Since in sub-Section (1) of this newly inserted Section 7A, the Legislature has employed the expression “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">until enforcement of the award under Section 45”</em>, therefore, an interim Order may be passed by the High Court Division to help the foreign tribunal till the time a foreign arbitral award is enforced. In other words, in case of a foreign arbitration, from the time of initiation of an international commercial arbitration (foreign arbitration) up to the period of enforcement of the award passed by the foreign arbitration tribunal, the High Court Division is competent to pass any interim Order centering around the said foreign arbitration. Provisions of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act being supernal, this newly inserted provision extended the jurisdiction of the Courts of Bangladesh investing the power of issuance of injunction Order, preservation Order and other interim Orders not only for the arbitrations taking place in Bangladesh, but also for the foreign arbitrations by clearly stating that “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 7…… until enforcement of the award under Section 45……. the High Court Division…….. may pass Order</em>”. ...43 and 56</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Words and phrases</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">‘Per incurium’<u></u></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">When any Judgment is passed by any Court in ignorance of the applicable laws either because of forgetfulness of the Hon’ble author Judge or due to ill-information about the applicable laws by the learned Advocate/s or for not making the relevant laws available before the Court, the decision should be held to have been given <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">per incuriam</em> and, consequently, it would not have legal force to bind the Courts to follow and apply the<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> ratio</em> laid down therein. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                                                               </span>...56</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Interpretation of statute<u></u></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Cardinal principles of statutory interpretation:</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">If there is no ambiguity in the words employed by the Legislature in any Act of Parliament, no attempt should be made to give any meaning other than its literal meaning, and when one provision of an Act of Parliament would appear to be inconsistent with the other provision of the same Act of Parliament, the Court’s duty is to provide a harmonious interpretation on the touchstone of the Preamble and other provisions of the Act, so that none of the provisions turns out to be useless or nugatory. ...56</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Words and Phrases</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>“Bank Guarantee” <u></u></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">A Bank Guarantee is an undertaking given by a Bank to pay an amount on demand to the named beneficiary.

The Courts should not grant an Order of injunction to restrain the realization of a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit. The rationale behind it is that a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit is an independent and a separate contract and is absolute in nature and, thus, the existence of any dispute between the parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an Order of injunction to restrain enforcement of a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit and, secondly, stoppage of encashment of an unconditional Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">the party concerned (beneficiary of the Bank Guarantee or the LC).

Now, after hearing the learned Advocates for both the sides, it appears to this Court that the cardinal principles for granting temporary injunction apparently exist in this case and, therefore, I am of the view that the petitioners deserve to be remedied with a preventive relief for a specified time, in order to preserve the subject in controversy, namely, the PPA and the IA without determining any question of right. Accordingly, the respondents are restrained from terminating the Power Purchase Agreement (Contract No. 10144) and the Implementation Agreement both dated 09.01.2017 for 60 (sixty) days from the date of receipt of this Order towards allowing the petitioner to seek any interim Order, including the preservation Order/injunction Order, from the foreign arbitral tribunal which, as per admission of both the parties, is in seisin of the matter.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">    </span>...57 &amp; 58</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">HRC Shipping Limited Vs.

The company is established by its promoter, the petitioner no. 2, in order to carry out the works of development of a 200MW (AC) Grid Tied Solar Park on Build-Own-Operate (BOO) basis for 20 years at Teknaf, Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh (“Project”). On 06.10.2014 the petitioner no. 2 submitted an unsolicited proposal to the respondent no. 3 (the Secretary, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources) who along with respondent no. 1 (Bangladesh Power Development Board) (BPDB), approved the said proposal. Thereafter, the respondent no. 1 issued a Letter of Intent (LOI) on 21.10.2015 to the petitioner no. 2, who on 25.10.2015 accepted the LOI. Then, the petitioner no. 2 incorporated the petitioner no. 1 in Bangladesh in the year 2016 to implement the project. The estimated investment for the project was US$300 million and once built, it would be the biggest ever solar-based electricity generation plant in Bangladesh. As per the terms of the LOI, the company then submitted a performance security deposit through Bank Guarantee No. 11011000106 dated 13.11.2016 (“Bank Guarantee”) issued by Bank Asia Ltd, a scheduled Bank in Bangladesh (proforma respondent no. 5) for an amount of USD 10,00,000.00 (USD one million) to the respondent no. 2 (Secretary of the BPDB). The respondent no. 1 represented by the respondent no. 2 thereafter executed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) on 09.01.2017 with the company with a view to authorizing the petitioner to initiate construction of the Project. It is stated that, under the terms of the PPA, the company is under obligation to complete the construction of the project within 18 months from the signing of the PPA and when the company was ready to initiate the construction works of the project at Teknaf, Cox’s-Bazar, upon obtaining all the financial supports from the financiers, it experienced extreme difficulty in progressing with the project, because a massive number of Rohingyas took refuge around the project area at Teknaf, Cox’s Bazar, and eventually when the company realized that it would not be possible to complete the construction of the project within the timeline stipulated in the PPA, on 05.10.2017 the company informed the respondent no. 2 of force majeure events with a request to grant an extension for 12 months of all the project related milestones. Thereafter, instead of granting an extension to the company, the respondent no. 2 issued a “BPDB Notice of Default” on 15.10.2017 upon the company informing that it has failed to achieve the ‘Financial Closing’ and this resulted in a “Company Event of Default”.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It is stated that thereafter the parties sat together on various times to discuss how to mitigate the problem and continue with the PPA. The company even attempted to search for new land all around Bangladesh and conducted various feasibility studies. However, it could not manage any other suitable properties within such short period. The company at all material times kept the respondent no. 1 informed about its activities in various progress update meetings held with the respondent no. 1. Instead of acknowledging such diligent exercises and efforts of the company, the respondents issued a “Notice of Intent to Terminate” dated 05.04.2018 upon the company informing that it has failed to cure the default. Thereafter, the respondent no. 2 requested the company on 26.04.2018 to extend the tenure of the Bank Guarantee and, accordingly, the company extended the tenure of the Bank Guarantee till 12.05.2019. On 22.05.2018, the company submitted its reply to the respondent no. 2’s “Notice of Intent to Terminate” having stated the reasons for its failure to make progress and requested the respondent no. 2 to schedule an official site visit to understand the gravity of the problem. However, when the respondent nos. 1 and 2 neither made any response to such reply dated 22.05.2018 of the company, nor did they arrange any site visit to the project area to understand the matter, the company again sent a letter dated 06.06.2018 to the respondent no. 2 requesting it to extend the time period of the project and also to allow the petitioners to change the location of the project site, but the respondent nos. 1 and 2 did not make any response to such request of the company. Finding no other alternative, the foreign lawyer of the company, Squire Patton Boggs, issued a notice of dispute dated 02.07.2018 upon the respondent no. 2 having requested to arrange a consultation meeting between the parties so that the parties can attempt, in good faith, to settle the dispute within 30 days of the date of the said letter. Upon receiving no response from the respondents, the aforesaid foreign lawyer of the company issued another notice dated 01.08.2018 upon the respondent no. 2 informing it that the company had nominated Mr. Ismael Guerrero and requested the respondents to appoint its representative so that they can sit together and settle the dispute with a cautionary note that if the dispute is not resolved by the referral to CEO by 16.08.2018, then the company will have no choice but to refer the dispute for arbitration. Since the respondents did not co-operate and/or try to resolve the dispute, the company felt that the arbitration is the ultimate solution for resolving the dispute, and since the company is under the apprehension that the respondents may terminate the PPA &amp; the IA at any time and encash the Bank Guarantee in course of processing the arbitration, the respondents are required to be restrained by way of an interim injunction from wrongfully terminating the PPA &amp; the IA and encashing the Bank Guarantee. Hence, the petitioners have approached this Court.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0in left 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">   </span>The respondent nos. 1 &amp; 2 (BPDB) and the respondent no. 4 (Power Grid Company of Bangladesh) by filing affidavits contested this case. Their common contentions are that the PPA was signed on the understanding that the company shall finance, build, own and operate a 200MW Grid Tied Solar Park for a period of 20 years at Teknaf, Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh and subsequently sell to the respondent no. 1 (BPDB) electricity from the project on a “no electricity - no payment” basis. If the petitioner fails to achieve “Financial Closing” by the “Required Financial Closing Date” of 08.10.2017, which was the date nine months from the effective date of the PPA, it shall constitute an “Event of Default”. A key component of the company’s obligations for the implementation of the project was the acquisition of land for the “Site” in Teknaf, Cox’s Bazar at its own cost and initiative. This requirement was set out in the project approval dated 15.10.2015 and in the PPA and IA. By mid-August 2017, it was apparent that the company would not be able to achieve Financial Closing by 08.10.2017 or commercial operation by the required commercial operation date of 08.07.2018. Rather than conceding its impeding breaches, the company opportunistically seized upon the humanitarian assistance that Bangladesh provided to the Rohingya minority group fleeing from Myanmar to make a last minute claim of force majeure. It is stated that the company did not claim the presence of the Rohingya as a Political or Force Majeure Event until October 2017, just a few days before it was to miss the required ‘Financial Closing Date’. On 15.10.2017, by written notice the respondent no. 1 informed the company that it had failed to achieve Financial Closing by 08.10.2017 deadline, constituting an “Event of Default” and, therefore, exercised its contractual remedy to issue a “Notice of Default”. On 22.10.2017, a committee tasked with investigating the project status conducted a site visit and prepared a report containing that while the project required at least 600 acres, the company had submitted agreements for the intended sale and purchase of only 43 acres and there are no displaced persons at the designated site. On 12.12.2017, the respondent no. 1 informed the company that there was no existence of Rohingya adjacent to the project area and thus refused the company’s request for extension of the implementation period. Since the company could not take any corrective steps to cure the “Event of Default”, the respondent no. 1 issued a ‘Notice of Intent to Terminate’ on 05.04.2018. Over one month after the ‘Notice of Intent to Terminate’ was sent to the company, on 22.05.2018 the respondent no. 1 wrote that an alleged ongoing Force Majeure or Political Event had affected its ability to further the project at the designated project site and sought for relocation of the project site. On 06.06.2018, the company wrote to the respondent no. 1 requesting a change in the project site along with a prayer for extension to complete the project.

Mr. Alam submits that although the company was not competent to raise the issue of force majeure event in the manner as has been adopted by the company by writing a usual letter to the respondents about the matter only 10 (ten) days before the Financial Closing, nevertheless, after issuance of the Notice of Default, when the company expressed their desire to sit with the respondents, the respondents responded to their call and sat together and after having discussion with the company when the respondents found out that the company is not in a position to achieve Financial Closing by 08.10.2017 towards commencing the commercial operation of the project, only then, the respondents as per the provision of T&amp;C of the PPA proceeded towards issuance of “Notice of Intent to Terminate the PPA”. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0in left 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">13.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">   </span>By referring to the T&amp;C No. 19.4(h) of the PPA, he submits that since the parties agreed in the PPA not to initiate any proceedings or to file any action/suit in any Court of competent jurisdiction or before any judicial or other authority arising under, out of, in connection with or relating to the PPA, whether or not any such dispute has been referred to arbitration under T&amp;C No. 19.4(a), and since the arbitration is to be conducted at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre in Hong Kong as per the ICC Rules, the company by purposefully violating the law, has filed this application knowing fully well that this Court is not competent to pass the interim Order of injunction.

Its complexity was increased in the succeeding centuries; and, though some of the less reasonable medieval rules were eliminated, it became more elaborate and remained very technical, whilst the growing complexity in the law of pleading made it increasingly difficult to be sure that a disputed award would be enforced. In 1698 the Legislature made a salutary change in the law as to the method of entering awards, but it was not till the legislation of the 19th century that the manifold complexities and irrational technicalities of the common law as to arbitration were reformed, and the law assumed its modern form." </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The people of this part of the world (sub-continent) are acquainted with the concept of arbitration from time immemorial. In good old days, disputes between private individuals used to be placed before ‘Shalish’, ‘Panchas’ and ‘Panchayats’. Likewise, commercial matters were decided by ‘Mahajans’ and ‘Chambers’. Formal arbitration proceedings, however, had come into existence after the Britishers started commercial activities in India. The provisions relating to arbitration were found in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1859 (CPC) and, then, in subsequent CPCs. Protracted, time-consuming, atrociously expensive and complex Court-procedures impelled the commercial world to an alternative, less formal, more effective and speedy mode of resolution of disputes by Judges of choice of the parties which culminated into passing of an Arbitration Act. A full-fledged law pertaining to arbitration in India was the Arbitration Act, 1899. Thereafter, in order to cope with the burgeoning issues relating to arbitration, an amended law was passed in 1940, known as the Arbitration Act, 1940. Experience, however, belied expectations. Proceedings became highly technical and thoroughly complicated. The provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1940 made 'lawyers laugh and litigants weep'. Observations were being made inside/outside the Courts to amend the law by making it more responsive to contemporary requirements. Moreover, apart from arbitration, conciliation has been getting momentum and worldwide recognition as an effective instrument of settlement of disputes. There was no composite statute dealing with all matters relating to arbitration and conciliation. The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) adopted a Model Law in 1985 on International Commercial Arbitration. The General Assembly of the United Nations recommended its member-States to give due consideration to the Model Law to have uniformity in arbitration procedure which resulted in passing of the Arbitration Act, 2001.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The intent of the Legislature has vividly been couched in the Preamble of the Act, 2001, which reads as follows:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman Bold',serif;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman Bold',serif;">An Act to enact the law relating to international commercial arbitration, recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral award and other arbitrations.</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">26.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">From a plain perusal of the Preamble, it is my understanding that by enactment of the Arbitration Act, 2001, the Legislature sought to make a perfect law of arbitration, containing both the substantive and procedural provisions, upon consolidating and amending the law relating to domestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration, arbitration tribunal, arbitral award, foreign arbitral tribunal, foreign arbitral award and enforcement of domestic as well as foreign arbitral awards. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">27.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">While the expression ‘domestic arbitration’ can be easily understood from its literal meaning that it is a form of the ADR where one or more persons are appointed to hear a case that takes place within one jurisdiction, the meaning of other expressions, namely, arbitration tribunal, arbitral award, international commercial arbitration, foreign arbitral tribunal, foreign arbitral award and enforcement of domestic as well as foreign arbitral awards, have been codified in different sub-Sections of Section 2 of the Arbitration Act.

Section 3 of the Arbitration Act makes a general statement about the ‘scope’ of application of the provisions of Arbitration Act. My humble understanding about the provisions of in Section 3 of the Arbitration Act is that since there is no prohibitory wordings to apply the provisions of the Arbitration Act for the foreign arbitration and foreign arbitral tribunal, nor is there any statement to the effect that the provisions of the Arbitration Act shall ‘only’ be applicable in case of ‘international commercial arbitration’ taking place in Bangladesh, the relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act may be borrowed and applied by the foreign arbitral tribunal, if the parties of the arbitration so agree. And our High Court Division may also apply the necessary provisions of the Arbitration Act for the foreign arbitration such as, Sections 7A and 10 in addition to the provisions of Sections 45 to 47 of the Arbitration Act. In other words, while ‘the foreign arbitration tribunal’ is free to observe, follow and apply our law, our High Court Division may use the relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act, namely, Sections 7A and 10 on top of applying the provisions of Sections 45 to 47, in an arbitration which would take place or is being held in a foreign country, for, the wordings of Section 3 of the Arbitration Act do not seek to oust the jurisdiction of the High Court Division in relation to an arbitration proceeding where the place of arbitration is outside Bangladesh. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">35.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The Legislature by engraving the word ‘scope’ in the marginal note of Section 3 of the Arbitration Act sought to mean that while the provisions of this law shall be mandatorily applied to ‘domestic arbitration’, ‘international commercial arbitration’ which would take place in Bangladesh and execution of the award passed by the foreign arbitral tribunal as provided in Sections 45, 46 &amp; 47, the provisions of the Arbitration Act may also be applied for foreign arbitration, if the parties to the foreign arbitration in their arbitration agreement makes such stipulation.

So, it is crystal clear that the aforesaid ‘limitation’ is meant for mandatory application of the provisions of the Arbitration Act for arbitration, arbitrators, arbitration proceedings, arbitration award, arbitration tribunal; the limitation is in no way meant to be applicable for the Courts. In other words, the provisions of this Act are enacted by the Parliament having aimed at governing the different provisions starting from making of the ‘arbitration agreement’ right up to the end of arbitration, which include initiation of arbitration, appointment of arbitrators, constitution of arbitration tribunal, arbitral award and its execution. Section 3 seeks to state that the provisions of the Arbitration Act are the guidelines for arbitration; i.e. for arbitration tribunal (not for Courts), within Bangladesh territory, as the foreign arbitration tribunals are formed and their businesses are conducted as per the laws of the foreign countries or international bodies, such as ICC and other International Commercial Chambers/forum. Thus, there is apparently no mentioning about conferring or ousting of the jurisdiction of the High Court Division or the Court in Section 3 of the Arbitration Act.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">36.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">With the above conclusion, I have to search for the provisions which confer or limit the jurisdiction of the Courts in arbitration matters, and I find Section 7 of the Arbitration Act to be such a provision.

Section 7 of the Arbitration Act seeks to oust ‘any other law’, and since the Legislature has employed the word ‘shall’ in the expressions ‘no judicial authority shall hear any legal proceedings’, the provisions of Section 7 is to be applied by the Courts mandatorily. So, it means that ‘parties to the arbitration’ are barred by the provisions of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act to file any legal proceeding in any Court. However, there is permissive space for ‘the parties to the arbitration’ to file legal proceedings, about which the Arbitration Act makes provisions to approach the Courts. The legal proceedings permitted by the Arbitration Act are; (i) application under Section 7A for obtaining interim order, (ii) application under Section 10 for referring the dispute to the arbitration tribunal and thereby stay the proceedings in the Court, (iii) application under Section 12 for appointment of arbitral tribunal, (iv) application under Section 20 before the High Court Division for determining the jurisdiction of arbitral tribunal, (v) application under Section 21(4) before the District Court for enforcement of an interim order passed by the tribunal, (vi) application under Section 42 for setting aside arbitral award, (vii) application under Sections 44 and 45 before the District Court for enforcement of domestic arbitral award and foreign arbitral award respectively (viii) appeal under Section 48 before the High Court Division and (ix) application under Section 50 before the District Court for arbitrators’ remuneration. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">38.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Now, if the provisions of the Preamble, Sections 2(c), 2(k), 3, 7, 10, 42 and 45 of the Arbitration Act is read concurrently, it would be found that the Legislature’s intention was to endow the people of this country with a complete code relating to both types of arbitration matters, namely, ‘domestic arbitration’ and ‘international commercial arbitration’/‘foreign arbitration’, with as much provisions as they could comprehend at the time of enactment of the law. However, the irony is that the Legislature’s effort of providing a full code on arbitration matters subsequently surfaced to still be a bit incomplete, for, while Section 45 of the Arbitration Act in clearer terms states that the award of the foreign arbitration would be enforced in Bangladesh subject to fulfillment of certain conditions, it apparently overlooked to mention that ‘international commercial arbitration’ held outside Bangladesh (i.e. the foreign arbitration) shall also enjoy the benefit of enactment of this latest Act, particularly (i) in dealing with interim Orders and (ii) for keeping in abeyance any litigation during pendency of any foreign arbitration regarding the same dispute. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">39.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The apparent complete code of Arbitration Act, 2001 triggered multifarious interpretations on Sections 3, 10 and 12 of the Arbitration Act because of having several ambiguities with regard to ‘international commercial arbitration’.

The Legislature in this newly incorporated provision not only enlisted the matters in which the Courts are competent to pass the interim Order/s, it also did not forget to arm the Courts with the ‘power’ which are usually available to the Courts in dealing with the interim/interlocutory Oder/s, as evident from the provision of sub-Section (2) of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act. The Legislature also did not overlook to mention the purpose of empowering the Courts in passing the interim Order/s, by specifically stating that in order to keep the interim measures intact, the Courts will have the mastery of passing interim Order/s without even hearing the other parties, if the situation permits, as can be understood from the Proviso to sub-Section (3) of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act. And, by incorporating the provision of sub-Section (4) of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act, the Legislature vested a superior class of power in the Courts by spelling out that, where the arbitration tribunal is either powerless or has failed to exercise its power to pass any interim Orders, the Courts shall have the dominion to pass the necessary Order/s. The Legislature, then, by incorporation of sub-Section (6) of the Section 7A of the Arbitration Act makes it clear that power of the Courts in passing the interim Order/s are vested in the Courts to help/assist the arbitration tribunal, meaning that the provisions of Section 7A have been inserted in the Arbitration Act in aid of the arbitration tribunal, not to disturb the functions of the arbitration tribunal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">41.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The above examen of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act leads me to find out whether this Court is competent to exercise the above powers in a scenario where the seat of arbitration is outside Bangladesh. In other words, whether this Court is competent to pass an interim Order to assist a foreign arbitration tribunal. In quest for the answer, I went through the provisions of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act line by line and it appears to me that since in sub-Section (1) of this newly inserted Section 7A, the Legislature has employed the expression “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">until enforcement of the award under Section 45”</em>, therefore, an interim Order may be passed by the High Court Division to help the foreign tribunal till the time a foreign arbitral award is enforced. In other words, in case of a foreign arbitration, from the time of initiation of an international commercial arbitration (foreign arbitration) up to the period of enforcement of the award passed by the foreign arbitration tribunal, the High Court Division is competent to pass any interim Order centering around the said foreign arbitration. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">42.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">After the above explorations on the scheme of the Arbitration Act, 2001 in tandem with the origin of arbitration, definitions of domestic arbitration, foreign arbitration, foreign arbitral award, functions to be performed by the Courts in a foreign arbitration matter, I should now examine the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ratio</em> laid down by this Court in the cases referred to, and relied on, by the parties of this matter.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">43.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Let me, at first, advert to the case-laws referred to by the learned Advocates for the petitioners. In the case of Bangladesh Air Service (Pvt.) Ltd Vs British Airways PLC 17 BLD (AD) 249, there was a stipulation in the contract that any dispute between the parties shall be resolved through the law of arbitration of England (Arbitration Act, 1950). However, when the Bangladeshi-party approached the Civil Court of Bangladesh for appointment of an arbitrator, the British-party questioned the jurisdiction of the Bangladeshi-Court to appoint an arbitrator. After hearing, the trial Court held that the jurisdiction of the Court was not ousted, but the High Court Division by exercising its revisional jurisdiction set aside the trial Court’s Order holding that the Courts in Bangladesh have no jurisdiction over an arbitration which is agreed by the parties to be held outside Bangladesh, and the same was upheld by the Appellate Division by an illuminating Judgment authored by his Lordship Justice Mustafa Kamal upon a masterly analysis of all the available case laws of the period. Upon reading the entire Judgment, I find that this Judgment was delivered on 08.05.1997, when the Arbitration Act, 2001 was not enacted and, secondly, revealed that the learned Advocate for the petitioners, by merely quoting a few lines from Paragraph 23 of the Judgment, is endeavouring to make out a favourable case. The Appellate Division had granted leave in the said case on four grounds, and the No. 1 ground was whether the High Court Division failed to consider the true import of Exception 1 to Section 28 of the Contract Act, 1872. In dealing with this ground, at first, the Hon’ble Appellate Division embarked on the question of ‘proper law of contract’, which was raised by the learned Amicus Curie as an ancillary point, as evident in Paragraphs 14 to 18 of this reported case and, then, examined the No. 1 ground which is imprinted in Paragraphs 19 to 24. In paragraph 23 of this case, the Apex Court observed that since any party to an arbitration is free to file a Damage Suit, the local Courts retain the jurisdiction to decide the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">lis</em> between the parties and, in that circumstance, the defendant would also be entitled to seek stay of the suit. I find that neither the aforesaid observations made in Para 23 do help the petitioners, nor the overall <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ratio</em> laid down by the Apex Court in this case nor the ultimate result of the case do assist the petitioners in any manner.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">44.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In the case of HRC Shipping Ltd Vs MV X-press Manaslu and other 12 MLR (HC) 265 (2007), when the plaintiff (HRC Shipping Ltd) filed an Admiralty Suit for payment of compensation for loss of cargo and containers, the defendant nos. 5 &amp; 6 (MV X-press Manaslu and Sea Consortium Pvt.

The most significant feature of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act is that by coming into effect on 19.02.2004, it removed the limited nature of applicability of the provisions of the Arbitration Act, as was prevalent in Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, by heralding that the non-obstante clause of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act would no longer be in operation. Given the status of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act that it is the provision by which jurisdiction of the Courts regarding arbitration matters have been conferred upon the Courts, albeit only for dealing with the limited issues, having dictated the Courts not to hear any case regarding arbitration, except for the causes enunciated in the Arbitration Act, my view is that incorporation of Section 7A in the Arbitration Act by the Legislature on 24.01.2004 has obviously changed the jurisdictional footing of the Courts. More importantly, all the above-referred cases were decided without taking into consideration the expression “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 7……… until enforcement of the award under Section 45 ……. the High Court Division …….. may pass Order</em>”, which is engraved in Section 7A(1) of the Arbitration Act.

And, that is how, they succeeded to obtain Judgments, sometimes in favour of application of the provisions of the Arbitration Act and, at times, to its contrary. While a number of Hon’ble Judges who authored their verdicts against the applicability of the provisions of the Arbitration Act to foreign arbitrations due to their oversight on the specific Section (namely, Section 7 of the Arbitration Act) by which jurisdiction regarding arbitration matters has been vested in the Courts in addition to overlooking the pertinent provision of Section 7A(1) of the Arbitration Act, the other Hon’ble Judges delivered their Judgments in support of applicability of the provisions of the Arbitration Act by ignoring to dwell on the above aspects. Had the aforesaid issues, namely, (i) conferment of jurisdiction through Section 7, not vide Section 3, and (ii) specific mentioning about foreign arbitration in Section 7A(1) of the Arbitration Act, been delved into by the Hon’ble Judges, there would have been a resolution of this issue with the status of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Stare Decisis</em>.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">While all the provisions of the Arbitration Act, except the provisions of Sections 45 to 47, are mandatorily applicable by the Courts of Bangladesh for the arbitration which takes place in Bangladesh, the aforesaid Sections 45 to 47 shall be mandatorily applied to foreign arbitration. The provisions of Sections 7A and 10 of the Arbitration Act may be applied by the High Court Division to foreign arbitration at its discretion in order to assist/help the foreign arbitration proceedings. In other words, the Preamble, Sections 2(c), 2(k), 7, 7A(1) and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>10 authorise the High Court Division to pass necessary Order/s for the purpose of furthering, not to weakening, the foreign arbitration. However, during pendency of foreign arbitration, the High Court Division should not exercise this discretionary power if it appears that passing any Order would cause disturbance to the performance of the functions of the foreign arbitration tribunal. The High Court Division must not take it as an usual duty when it would be dealing with the applications under Sections 7A and 10 of the Arbitration Act in a foreign arbitration scenario. Only upon strictly and meticulously carrying out the need and usefulness of the interference of the High Court Division in cases of foreign arbitration, it should pass the necessary Order. Such as, in a Section-7A application, if the situation is that the foreign arbitral tribunal is yet to be composed of or it lacks required power or the foreign arbitral tribunal cannot be constituted quickly, in the aforesaid situations, for saving the arbitration from becoming a “hollow formality” i.e. in order to protect/secure the subject matter of the arbitration, a discretion may be exercised by the High Court Division so as to restrain the parties from irreversibly altering <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">status quo</em> of the subject matter before the arbitrators are able to render a decision. Similarly, in a Section-10 application, if the High Court Division is <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ex-facie</em> satisfied that due to the multifarious litigations pending in the Court and arbitration pending in the foreign arbitration tribunal, ultimately the decisions of both the forums (Courts and foreign arbitral tribunal) shall be rendered useless, the High Court Division may in appropriate cases exercise its discretion under Section 10 of the Arbitration Act. In other words, for foreign arbitration matters, towards making the said arbitration meaningful and effective, the High Court Division may allow applications under Sections 7A and 10 of the Arbitration Act.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The Legislature may consider to add the following expressions <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“Provisions of Sections 7A and 10 may be applied for foreign arbitrations by the High Court Division on its satisfaction as to exigencies and usefulness of issuance of the order/s prayed for”</em> at the bottom of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, either as a ‘Proviso’ or as an “Explanation” taking into consideration that this Court has been spending its invaluable time in interpreting the applicability of the provisions of the Arbitration Act in a foreign arbitration scenario, sometimes expressing its opinion in favour of the application of the Arbitration Act for foreign arbitration and, on some occasions, opining against its applicability for the foreign arbitration. It appears to me to be pertinent to state here that there are contrary views by our Hon’ble Judges of this Court about making exegesis on the Act of Parliaments, and often observations made by the legendary Judges of the UK are quoted in substantiating their views. Out of the said observations, the statements made by Lord Loreburn L.C in the case of Vickers, sons of Maxim Limited -Vs-Evans 1910 AC 444, is widely used by most of the Hon’ble Judges of the sub-continent, which is reproduced below:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">"My Lords, this appeal may serve to remind us of a truth sometimes forgotten, that this House sitting judicially does not sit for the purpose of hearing appeals against Acts of Parliament, or of providing by judicial construction what ought to be in an Act, but simply of construing what the Act says.

Since it was the intention of the framers of the Constitution to see the Supreme Court of Bangladesh as the Guardian of the Constitution, this Court owes a duty to assist the Legislature by pointing out the lacunae and loopholes of the laws of this country whenever any such laws would be referred to before this Court. While the Court merely expresses its views, it remains open for the Legislature to enact/amend the laws accordingly or to ignore them. When this Court carries out the above exercise, it should not be seen as transgression by the Judiciary into the domain of the Legislature. The position of the UK’s Constitution being completely different from our Constitution, the observations made by the UK-Judiciary are not applicable in our jurisdiction. The Judiciary of the UK is not constitutionally allowed to make any comments on the Acts of Parliament, let alone declaring them void.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Taking into consideration the cardinal principle of interpretation of law that if there is no ambiguity in the words employed by the Legislature in any Act of Parliament, no attempt should be made to give any meaning other than its literal meaning, and when one provision of an Act of Parliament would appear to be inconsistent with the other provision of the same Act of Parliament, the Court’s duty is to provide a harmonious interpretation on the touchstone of the Preamble and other provisions of the Act, so that none of the provisions turns out to be useless or nugatory. All that I wish to say in summing up my views is that, in the backdrop of embodiment of the clear-cut wordings “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 7…… until enforcement of the award under Section 45……. the High Court Division…….. may pass Order</em>” in Section 7A(1) of the Arbitration Act, this Court should not be hesitant to issue appropriate necessary interim Order/s for foreign arbitration matter. Even if it is conceded that there is ambiguity in the wordings employed in the Preamble and in Sections 2(c), 2(k), 7 and 7A(1) of the Arbitration Act for not specifically mentioning as to whether ‘international commercial arbitration’ includes foreign arbitration, in that event also, furnishing the interpretation in favour of applicability of the provisions of Sections 7A of the Arbitration Act would not make other provisions of the Arbitration Act nugatory. Rather, it that would seek to harmonise with all the provisions of the Arbitration Act on top of saving the above-quoted provisions of Section 7A(1) of the Arbitration Act from rendering nugatory.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .75in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">56.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Thus, from the above threadbare all-out scrutiny on the issue of the applicability of the provisions of the Arbitration Act to a foreign arbitration, the irresistible conclusion that derives is that this Court is well competent to entertain an application under Section 7A of the Arbitration Act regarding an arbitration which would take place or is taking place in a foreign country and, therefore, I hold that the present application is maintainable, from the view point of the applicability of the provisions of the Arbitration Act in a foreign arbitration scenario. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">57.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The above resolution on the first count of maintainability issue of this case, namely, whether this Court can hear an application under Section 7A of the Arbitration Act if arbitration takes place outside Bangladesh, leads me to embark upon the second count of maintainability issue, namely, whether this Court is competent to issue an Order of Injunction restraining the Bank or beneficiary from encashing a Bank Guarantee.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">58.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In order to deal with the issue, let me first know what is a Bank Guarantee.

(E) 1975 A.C 396 has articulated the aforesaid principles in the following eloquent words;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">“The object of the interlocutory injunction is to protect the plaintiff against injury by the violation of his right for which he could not be adequately compensated in damages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial; but the plaintiff’s need for such protection must be weighed against the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against injury resulting from his having been prevented from exercising his own legal right for which he could not be adequately compensated under the plaintiff’s undertaking in damages if the uncertainty were resolved in the defendant’s favour at the trial. The Court must weigh one need against another and determine where “the balance of convenience” lies.” </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">61.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">And it is no more a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">res integra</em> on the subject of injunction that if there is no <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> case, there is no need to go for conducting the investigation of the remaining two requirements. Nonetheless, to briefly put on record as to whether the aforesaid two requirements do exist in this case, I find from the fact that if the petitioners succeed in the arbitration and, consequently, they are allowed to proceed with the PPA and IA, the company shall not be required to submit another Bank Guarantee in favour of the respondents on top of claiming damage, if the company suffers any. Moreover, at the end of hearing when this Court expressed its opinion that it is the settled law of our jurisdiction that payment of Bank Guarantee cannot be stopped by the Order of injunction, it was contended by the petitioners’ learned Advocate Mr. Md. Anisul Hassan that the petitioners are not worried about the Bank Guarantee, rather the concern of the petitioners is with regard to preservation of the PPA and the IA. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">62.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In a catena of case-laws of our jurisdiction, it has been observed that no order of injunction can be passed by the Courts to stop payment of Bank Guarantee or Letter of Credit. From the reading of the said case-laws, I find that when an unconditional Bank Guarantee or Letter of Credit is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realize such a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes relating to the terms of the contract, and the Bank giving such guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. The Courts should not grant an Order of injunction to restrain the realization of a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit. The rationale behind it is that a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit is an independent and a separate contract and is absolute in nature and, thus, the existence of any dispute between the parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an Order of injunction to restrain enforcement of a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit and, secondly, stoppage of encashment of an unconditional Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">the party concerned (beneficiary of the Bank Guarantee or the LC). Only if there is clear allegation of committing fraud in preparation of a </span>Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit, having vitiated the very foundation of such a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit, the Court may interfere into the matter by passing an Order of injunction. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">63.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Since the issue as to whether an order of injunction can be issued for stopping the payment of an irrevocable Bank Guarantee was examined time and again by the Courts of all the jurisdictions and it is the unanimous decision of all the Courts of the world that payment of an irrevocable Bank Guarantee and a Letter of Credit cannot be prevented by the Courts unless any one comes out with an egregious allegation of committing fraud in the documents/papers of a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit, the bottom line, as appears to me, is that enforcement of an "On Demand Bank Guarantee" in terms thereof is not subject to judicial interference on the basis of the terms of the contract. Since in this case, evidently, the Bank Guarantee is an ‘On Demand Bank Guarantee’, this application is not maintainable, so far as it relates to the prayer for encashing of the Bank Guarantee. Hence, I do not find any reason to continue with the preventive Order passed by this Court at the time of issuance of this Rule restraining the respondents from encashing the Bank Guarantee of USD 10,00,000 (one million). </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">64.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Since the legal issue as to the applicability of the provisions of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act in a foreign arbitration scenario has been settled hereinbefore in the affirmative, I should now probe into the facts of this case to see whether this Court should exercise its discretionary power in favour of the petitioners by granting an Order of injunction restraining the respondents from terminating the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and the Implementation Agreement (IA). </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">65.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It appears that at the time of approaching this Court, the petitioners were in the process of formation of arbitration tribunal in Hong Kong as per the terms of the arbitration agreement, and since there was an apprehension by the petitioners that before the arbitral tribunal is composed, the respondents may terminate the PPA and IA and encash the Bank Guarantee, this Court having found a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> case and balance of inconvenience in favour of the petitioners, passed an ad interim Order of injunction.
