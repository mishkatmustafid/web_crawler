Mina Raza Chowdhury sold the suit premises to the plaintiff by a registered kabala No.14815/2001 dated 31.12.2001. The said fact of the sale by Mina Raza Chowdhury was duly notified to the defendant. When the plaintiff demanded rent from the defendant in the first part of January, 2002 she stated that she had paid rent in advance up to December, 2002 to the ex-landlord, Mina Raza Chowdhury. On query by the plaintiff, Mina Raza Chowdhury admitted the said fact of payment of advance rent to her and handed over to her the part of the receipt of the landlord showing receipt of rent. The plaintiff and her husband jointly decided to construct multistoried building in the suit premises and the other 3(three) adjacent shops which her husband purchased earlier, by demolishing the existing dilapidated shops and, accordingly, got a plan approved by Sylhet Pourashava on 10.03.2002. After approval of the plan, the plaintiff approached the defendant in the first part of the month of April, 2002 to vacate the suit premises by receiving back the advance rent paid by her. In presence of the witnesses the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span>defendant agreed to deliver vacant possession of the suit premises in December, 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thereafter, in the first part of January, 2003 when the plaintiff asked the defendant to hand over possession of the suit premises she took time on this or that plea. Subsequently, though the plaintiff requested the defendant again and again to hand over vacant possession of the suit premises, she did not hand over vacant possession of the suit premises. Since January, 2003 the defendant did not pay any rent to the plaintiff and thus she became a defaulter. The plaintiff requires the suit premises <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">bona fide</em> for reconstruction. As the defendant did not vacate the suit premises, the plaintiff issued a notice to her on 09.03.2003 through her Advocate under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act determining the tenancy with the expiry of 31.03.2003 asking her to deliver vacant possession of the suit premises, otherwise legal steps would be taken to evict her and also to realise the arrear rents from her. The defendant duly received the said notice yet did not vacate the suit premises, hence the plaintiff filed the suit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The suit was contested by the defendant by </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">filing <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">written statement contending, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">inter alia</em></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em>, </em></strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">that she has been running a business in the suit premises in the name "Adorsha Library" under the landlord, Mina Raza Chowdhury and others.

He submitted that </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">the High Court Division rightly found that the plaintiff could not establish that the transfer of ownership of the case property was made with the knowledge of the defendant tenant and moreover, even after such transfer the former landlord Mina Raza Chowdhury took advance rent for the whole year of 2002 A.D. and that payment was also admitted and acknowledged by the plaintiff and when Mina Raza Chowdhury refused to accept rent from the defendant she was compelled to deposit rent regularly to the rent controller and so the defendant could not be treated as defaulter and therefore, the judgement of the High Court Division is sustainable in law. He further submitted that the High Court Division rightly found that the defendant purchased the transferable tenancy right in the suit premises from the previous tenant who transferred the same to her with due acknowledgement of the landlord and so she is not an ordinary monthly ejectable tenant and she has been paying rent regularly and so cannot be evicted and, therefore, the judgement of the High Court Division is sustainable in law. The learned Advocate also submitted that the High Court Division having rightly found that the landlord on receipt of salami granted transferable tenancy right to the defendant tenant, the question of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">bona fide</em> requirement is not relevant in the instant case and further renovation of a market or commercial centre cannot be treated as a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">bona fide</em> requirement and for such renovation or reconstruction a permanent tenant cannot be evicted and, therefore, the judgement of the High Court Division is liable to be upheld.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He also submitted that the High Court Division rightly found that the defendant acquired a right of permanent tenancy in the suit premises and she has been paying rent regularly to the Rent Controller and the owner of the suit premises can withdraw the rent deposited with the Rent Controller and the defendant is not an ordinary ejectable monthly tenant and therefore, the judgement of the High Court Division is sustainable in law. He submitted that the Small Causes Court failed to consider that the defendant is not an ordinary monthly tenant under Mina Raza Chowdhury in that the suit premises belonged to former Zaminder Dewan Talebur Raza Chowdhury which was originally leased out to one Abdur Razzak by taking salami from him who transferred his leasehold right to one Rafique Ahmed Chowdhury who transferred it to his father Chan Miah Chowdhury who again transferred it to the father of the defendant and, subsequently, the father of the defendant transferred it to him and on the occasion of each transfer the landlord, including Chan Miah Chowdhury took salami from the transferee and all such transactions were made with the acknowledgment of the landlord Mina Raza Chowdhury and hence the defendant and her predecessor are not ordinary monthly ejectable tenant but has got perpetual tenancy right and hence the present suit for ejectment is not maintainable and as such, the High Court Division rightly reversed the judgement of the Small Causes Court. The learned Advocate submitted that from the materials on record it is seen that the transfer of ownership of the suit premises was not informed by the plaintiff to the defendant formally and even after the alleged transfer Mina Raza Chowdhury took rent for one year in advance (for the year 2002 AD) from the defendant and so the alleged transfer was made without any knowledge of the defendant and the defendant purchased the transferable monthly tenancy in the suit premises. He submitted that the High Court Division was right in holding that the defendant acquired a right of permanent tenancy in the suit premises and so there was "no scope to evict" her therefrom and the payment of rent with the House Rent Controller did not make her a monthly ejectable tenant and she cannot be termed as defaulter. The learned Judge of Small Causes Court failed to appreciate that the notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act is invalid for not containing the actual description of the suit premises and the suit premises being vague and unspecified the judgment of the Small Causes Court is not sustainable in law which has been rightly reversed by the High Court Division. He submitted that the learned Judge of the Small Causes Court committed an error of law in not considering that the plaintiff failed to prove her <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">case of atornment and </span>the defendant admittedly paid rent up to December 2002 and for payment of rent for the month of January 2003 went to the house of Mina Raza Chowdhury who was found absent and accordingly sent the rent by money order on 04.02.2003 and the same was returned on 22.02.2003 and filed Rent Control Case No. 11<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>of 2003 on 26.02.2003 and since then is depositing the rent till today and hence, the defendant cannot be termed as defaulter and therefore, the judgement of the High Court Division reversing the decision of the Small Causes Court is sustainable in law. He lastly submitted that the learned Judge of the Small Causes Court failed to give due consideration to the fact that the defendant used to run the business of "Adarsha Library" in the suit premises for long 50 years with goodwill and as permanent tenant and in the circumstances the defendant is not an ordinary monthly ejectable tenant under the Premises Rent Control Act and therefore, the judgment of the High Court Division is sustainable in law.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates appearing for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The Small Causes Court Suit No.4 of 2003 was filed by the respondent herein on 11.05.2003 for eviction of the monthly tenant, appellant herein for default in payment of rent, claiming also that the property being in a dilapidated condition, she wished to construct a new multi-storied building which she needed for her own use.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">10.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">On the other hand, the appellant denied the plaintiff’s claim that the building was dilapidated or that she needed the property for her own use.

Hence, it was found that the defendant was not a defaulter. The High Court Division also found that as Salami was paid, the tenancy became a permanent one and that the defendant was not an ordinary monthly evictable tenant.

No authority has been cited for such finding. On the other hand, we note that section 10 of the Premises Rent Control Act provides that no landlord can demand any premium, salami, security or any like payment, or advance rent in excess of one month’s rental. Even if there was a specific term in the tenancy agreement to pay salami, such a term would render the agreement void under section 23 of the Contract Act, as was held in the case of <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Mustaque Hussain (Md) vs Md Shajahan Miah and another, 57 DLR (AD) 60.</em></strong> It was further held that, “Section 10 of the Premises Rent Control Act, 1991 makes the legal practice of payment of salami prohibited and that the tenant is entitled to refund of the salami paid by him within six months of such payment under section 14 and the landlord was liable to pay fine for receiving salami under section 3 of the said Act. The widespread and long-standing practice of voluntary payment of salami in the commercial world did not make the tenant a non-ejectable one and no interest other than the tenancy right recognised by law could be created on payment of salami so as to prevent the tenant not liable to be ejected on specific legal ground for the purpose. Under section 18 of the Premises Rent Control Act the landlord is entitled to eject a tenant as soon as a monthly tenant is a defaulter or a landlord bona fide requires the premises or for building and rebuilding purpose.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">15.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In view of the above decision, the finding of the High Court Division is palpably erroneous.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">16.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">With regard to the notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, the High Court Division simply stated that the plaintiff could not establish that the transfer of ownership was made known to the defendant or that formal notice was sent to the defendant. Such finding is clearly in oversight of the evidence and materials on record. We find that DW1 admitted having received the notice under section 106 in March 2003. He also admitted that the said notice mentioned the fact that the plaintiff had purchased the shop premises on 31.12.2001. This is borne out by the legal notice dated 09.03.2003, which was marked as Exhibit-6. He was also aware that, apart from the suit shop, the plaintiff’s husband had purchased the other three adjacent shops.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">17.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">It is evident that in spite of finding out that the property had been purchased by the plaintiff and admittedly having received the notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, the defendant continued to deposit rent before the Rent Controller for the benefit of the original landlord rather than for the benefit of the plaintiff who claimed in her notice to have purchased the property. We find from the records that the defendant filed the Rent Control Case No.11 of 2003 before the Rent Controller on 26.02.2003 after the original landlord, namely Mina Raza Choudhury had refused to receive rent. Thereafter, she admittedly received the legal notice under section 106 dated 09.03.2003 wherein it was stated that the plaintiff had purchased the property, but still the defendant did not in any way approach or pay rent to the plaintiff. In this regard we may profitably refer to the decision in the case of <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Basiruddin Ahmed and another vs Dhirendra Mohan Das and another, 1984 BCR (AD) 297</em></strong>. In that case it was argued that the tenants did not make any offer of rent to the plaintiffs as they had certain bona fide doubt as to whether the latter were really entitled to receive the rent. It was observed that the tenants never came to the landlords to enquire whether they were ready to accept rent from them, and the Rent Deposit Case was filed against the previous landlord who had allegedly refused to accept rent. In the instant case we also note that admittedly the defendant did not make any enquiries as to the transfer of the property to the plaintiff nor approached the plaintiff in order to pay the rent. In the aforementioned case their Lordships held that, “deposit of rent in favour of the previous landlord became totally irrelevant as soon as that landlord ceased to have any interest in the suit premises after the transfer; deposit in her favour cannot be taken as a ground to resist ejectment when sought by the new landlord to whom no rent was paid in spite of notice of the transfer. If the tenants had any doubt about the service of the notice through lawyer they could have enquired from the landlords themselves seeking clarification.” Their Lordships went on to hold that the new landlords may not be entitled to the rent prior to the transfer, but they are certainly entitled to receive rent since the transfer and this rent not having been paid the tenants were defaulters.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">18.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The High Court Division held that the question of bona fide requirement was not relevant since the transferable tenancy right was granted by the landlord on receipt of salami.
