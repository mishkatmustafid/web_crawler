The writ-petitioner had since been performing her duties. On completion of her probation period, the Managing Committee of the School at a meeting dated 25.7.1992 took a decision confirming her service. The writ-petitioner got herself admitted to B.Ed Programme under the Open University of Bangladesh. <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">For </span>appearing in the 4<sup>th</sup> Semester examination, she took leave from the school authority <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">from 23.06.20</span>01 to 26.06.2001. Because of hartal, the examination <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">scheduled to be held </span>On 26.06.2001 could not take place and was ultimately <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">shifted to 30.06.2001. </span>On 27.06.2001, the writ-petitioner came to the school and performed <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">her </span>usual duties and after that she went to the office of writ-respondent No.8 (Headmistress of the School) informing her about the examinations to <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">be </span>held on 28.06.2001 and 30.06.2001 and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>prayed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>for<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>leave<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>for appearing in those remaining examinations. On 01.07.2001 the writ-petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">came to the </span>School and started discharging her routine duties. She also <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">filed an </span>application praying for leave of absence for those 2 days but to her utter surprise, she found that writ-respondent No.8 rejected the application <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">for </span>leave of absence. The following day, writ-respondent No.8 issued an <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">order in </span>writing restraining the writ-petitioner from performing all kinds of activities <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">in the </span>school for 15 days and served a notice on the writ-petitioner for showing cause within 7 days as to why action should not be taken against her for negligence of duties. On 07.07.2001, the writ-petitioner replied to the notice for showing cause denying the allegations levelled against her. The writ-petitioner made an application to writ-respondent No.8 stating that she was extremely sorry for not taking leave by filing an application for appearing in the remaining two papers of the 4<sup>th </sup>semester B.Ed examination and, therefore, she prayed for exoneration. By influencing writ-respondent No.7, writ-respondent No.8 succeeded in suspending the writ-petitioner from service. The writ-petitioner acknowledged receiving the order of suspension and made an application to respondent No.7, the President of the Managing Committee of the School requesting him for reconsideration of the order of suspension but without any result. Finding no other alternative, the writ-petitioner filed Title Suit No.260 of 2001 in the Court of Assistant Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka challenging the order of suspension. Without prior approval of the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dhaka (the Board), writ-respondent Nos.7 and 8 dismissed the writ-petitioner from service on 02.09.2001. Having collected a copy of the order of dismissal, the writ-petitioner made an amendment of the plaint incorporating the order of dismissal in it. During pendency of the suit, the writ-petitioner appeared before the Appeal and Arbitration Committee of the Board. In presence of both the parties, the Appeal and Arbitration Board verbally made a decision directing the writ-petitioner to withdraw the suit within 15 days and to give an undertaking on a non-judicial stamp of Tk.150/- that she would not remain absent in future without leave and that after compliance, the writ-petitioner would be entitled to join in service. On 10.08.<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">2002, </span>the writ-petitioner made a representation in writing to writ-respondent No.2, the Chairman of the Board (the Ex-Officio Chairman of the Appeal and Arbitration Board) praying for a written copy of the above decision. But the Board slept over the matter for about 5 months. Meanwhile, Title Suit No.260 of 2001 was dismissed by the judgement and decree dated 21.08.2002. The writ-petitioner appealed against the decree being Title Appeal No.512 of 2002. During pendency of Title Appeal No. 512 of 2002, the Appeal and Arbitration Committee communicated its decision dated 17.07.2002 and 05.08.2002 by a memo dated 08.1.2003 (Annexure-J) to the writ-petitioner after long 5 months of its decision. On receipt of the decision of the Appeal and Arbitration Committee, the writ-petitioner filed an application under Order XXIII Rule 1(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) before the learned District Judge on 13.1.2003 for withdrawal of the appeal. The order of withdrawal was passed on the same date. Having fulfilled all the conditions set forth by the Appeal and Arbitration Committee of the Board, the writ-petitioner filed an application to writ-respondent No.7 on 21.01.2003 to reinstate her in service but was refused. On 04.02.2003 the writ-petitioner made a representation to the Board for non­compliance of its decision contained in the memo, dated 08.01.2003 by writ-respondent No.7. Writ-respondent No.5 communicated the decision of the Board by a memo dated 11.05.2003 directing writ-respondent No.8, the Head Mistress of the school to reinstate the writ-petitioner in her service within 30 days from the date of issuance of that memo. The order dated 11.05.2003 issued under the signature of writ-respondent No.5 is binding upon the school authority. On 19.05.2003 the writ-petitioner made another application to writ-respondent No.7 pursuant to the memo dated 11.05.2003 praying for reinstating her in service. Writ-respondent No.8 did not accept the copy of that application. The writ-petitioner then sent the same by registered post. On 17.06.2003, the writ-petitioner made another application to writ-respondent No.2 referring to the memo dated 11.05.2003 issued under the signature of writ-respondent No.5 requesting the Board Authority for taking effective measures for reinstating her in service. That letter was received by the office of writ-respondent No.2 on 17.06.2003. On 10.08.2003, the writ-petitioner made a representation to the Minister for Education stating all facts as well as her miserable economic condition. On 10.08.2003 the Minister directed the Chairman of the Board to resolve the matter, but unfortunately it did not happen. On 09.03.2004 the writ-petitioner made an application to writ-respondent No.2 for reinstating her in service. Similar applications were made thereafter, but without any result. On 27.06.2004, the writ-petitioner served a notice upon the writ-respondents demanding justice. After that, the writ-petitioner filed Writ Petition No.3844 of 2004 before the High Court Division praying for a direction upon the Managing Committee of the School to accept her joining pursuant to the decision of the Appeal and Arbitration Committee. The Rule <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Nisi</em> was, however, discharged on the ground of its non-maintainability. Having obtained a copy of the judgement passed in the above writ petition, the writ-petitioner made an application to writ-respondent No.3 praying for reinstating her in service pursuant to the observation made by the High Court Division. Soon afterwards, the writ-petitioner came to know that the Appeal and Arbitration Committees suspended its own decision dated 08.01.2003 approving the illegal and unlawful order of dismissal passed by the school authority.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Writ-respondent No.8 filed an affidavit-in-opposition in the instant case controverting all the material allegations made in the writ petition. The case of writ-respondent No.8, in short, is that instead of giving reply to the allegations brought against the writ-petitioner, she made some wild allegations against the authority. The Managing Committee of the School advised the writ-petitioner to submit a fresh reply stating the actual facts, but she ignored the advice and filed an application to the Headmistress seeking permission to join her service on 15.07.2001. Instead of taking permission from the Managing Committee the writ-petitioner took away that application. When the Managing Committee, asked the writ-petitioner about her misbehaviour with the Headmistress, she misbehaved with one of the members of the Managing Committee from the category of the guardians. On 16.7.2001 the Managing Committee in its meeting formed a three-member enquiry committee headed by Mr. Aminullah, a member of the Managing Committee. According to the report of the committee, the writ-petitioner was suspended from service. During pendency of the suit the Appeal and Arbitration Committee of the Board advised the writ-petitioner to withdraw the suit and to file an undertaking, but she did not withdraw the suit. The suit was in fact dismissed by a decree against which the writ-petitioner filed an appeal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">After hearing the parties, by the impugned judgement and order, the High Court Division made the Rule <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Nisi</em> absolute.

The learned Advocate further submitted that the order impugned in the writ petition issued by the appellants dated 12.09.2004 was done with <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">mala fide</em> intention and is arbitrary. The Board Authority reviewed its earlier decision without giving respondent No.1 the opportunity of being heard, which caused serious prejudice to her and, therefore, the appeal is liable to be dismissed. She further submitted that with the withdrawal of the appeal under Order XXXIII, Rule 1(1) of the Code, there is no scope for implementing the decree dated 21.08.2002 passed in Title Suit No.260 of 2001 of the Court of 3<sup>rd</sup> Assistant Judge, Dhaka.

She submitted that respondent No.1 withdrew the appeal in good faith and now she will be prejudiced if the instant appeal is not dismissed. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates appearing for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">We find from the records that by Memo dated 08.01.2003 the Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board, Dhaka intimated to the writ petitioner-respondent No.1 herein the decision of the Appeal and Arbitration Committee taken in their meeting dated 17.07.2002 and 05.08.2002. The decision reached in those meetings was that the writ petitioner would submit an undertaking-‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ongikarnama’</em> on non-judicial stamp paper of Tk.150 that she will not commit such infraction in the future. The said ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ongikarnama’ </em>was to be filed along with her joining letter and that she would be allowed to join her service. The writ petitioner accordingly filed the ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ongikarnama’ </em>dated 21.01.2003 along with her joining letter on the same date. We also note that by letter dated 11.5.2003 (Annexure L-1)the Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, Dhaka directed the Headmistress of Bongshal Girls’ High School to reinstate the Assistant Teacher, Mrs. Kawser Parven (writ-petitioner) in her service and to report compliance. Thereafter, by letter dated 12.09.2004 from the School Inspector, Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board, Dhaka the earlier decision of the Board dated 17.07.2002 was stayed. It was from this decision of the Board of Secondary and High Secondary Education, which was impugned in the writ petition, the present appeal arises. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">10.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The only ground upon which leave was granted is that ‘the writ petitioner being an Assistant Teacher of a non-Government Secondary School, which is neither statutory body nor a local authority, the writ petition was not maintainable’.
