C.S. khatian No. 6615 was correctly prepared in his name. Nawab Khaja Yusufjan transferred the said land along with his some other properties to his only daughter Mst. Nurunnessa Khanam alias Nurun Bibi and her husband Syed Mohammad Kashmiri on 25.09.1922 by a deed of gift and delivered possession to them who accepted the gift and took over possession of the said land. Thereafter, they died one after another leaving only son Syed Jamil Hasan. S.A. Khatian was prepared in his name. Jamil Hasan entered into an agreement for sale of the suit land with the writ petitioner on 11.04.1990 for a consideration of Tk.30,00,000/- (taka thirty lac) and upon receiving taka 29,50,000/- he executed an agreement for sale. On 15.04.1991, Syed Jamil Hasan denied to execute and register the sale deed and , thus, the writ petitioner instituted Title Suit No.161 of 1991 in the First Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka for Specific Performance of Contract. Said suit was transferred in the Second Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka and renumbered as Title Suit No.139 of 1993 and was decreed on compromise by a judgment and decree dated 06.07.1993. Accordingly, sale deed was executed and registered through Court on 21.09.1994 executing the said decree. The petitioner got delivery of possession of the case land through Court on 27.01.1996. The Government, insptie of service of summons, did not contest the said suit. On query, Additional Deputy Commissioner (L.A.), Dhaka by his Memo No.324/L.A. Section General /95 dated 06.04.1995 informed that the case land was not acquired for Bangladesh Railway. The proclamation No.342 dated 02.09.1882 published in the Calcutta Gazette on 6th September, 1882 shows that the villages/ areas were acquired by the Government for the purpose of construction of Dhaka-Mymensingh State Railway. But the case land, situated within Mouza Dhaka Shahar, was not acquired. On the basis of the said proclamation, C.S. khatian No.16868 was published in the name of Eastern Bengal State Railway. Said C.S. khatian No.16868 is covered by ward No.3, sheet No.4 while the petitionerâs case land is covered by C.S. khatian No.6615 of Ward No.3, Sheet No.22. Dhaka City Corporation, the writ respondent No.3 appellant prepared a sketch map by its surveyor demarcating the case land of the petitioner. The case land of the writ petitioner is situated not within the area of Osmani Uddayan as evidenced by the said sketch map. The writ petitioner with a view to construct an international Standard Five Star Hotel and Shopping Centre in the case land in the name and style of M/S. South East Development Corporation (Pvt.) Ltd. applied to the Prime Minister and Chairman of Board of Investment for approval of the said project. After due investigation, the said project was approved in the 184th Board Meeting of the Board of Investment, Office of the Prime Minister on 21.03.2000 and the Board of <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">Investment issued a certificate being Registration</span> No.2000005122-H dated 30.05.2000 under section 11 of the Board of Investment Act, 1989. For implementation of the said project at a cost of tk.564/- crore, a foreign loan equivalent to 10 Million US dollar was sanctioned by International Investment World Inc. Company, U.S.A. by a letter dated 14.03.2000. Considering the importance of the use of said project for NAM conference, the respondent No.1, by a Memo No. Sha Pro-6/RAJ- 68/98/256 dated 24.05.2001 addressed to RAJUK , asked to issue clearance certificate and to approve the plan for the said project in favour of the writ petitioner. On 27.06.2001, the petitioner came to know from news item published in the âDaily Starâ that the approvals of the proposal for construction of five star hotel within Osmani Uddyan has been cancelled on 26.06.2001. Against which, the writ petitioner filed writ petition No.2882 of 2001 and obtained Rule and got an order of status-quo. In connection with the said writ petition, contempt Rule was issued for violation of the order of status-quo against the petitioner and her husband Advocate M.A. Khaleque. In that case the High Court Division directed the police to take over possession of the disputed land and to protect the same. The contempt Rule was disposed of accepting the petitionerâs unconditional apology. The Rule issued in writ petition was discharged. However, police took over possession of the disputed land. In view of aforesaid circumstances, the writ petitioner has filed this writ petition for a direction upon the writ respondents to hand over possession of the disputed land.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">The High Court Division, by the impugned judgment and order, made the Rule absolute.

He submits that Syed Jamil Hasan, judgment debtor, himself filed Title Suit No.151 of 1980 in the third Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka for declaration of his title and recovery of khas possession which established that the writ petitionerâs alleged vendor, had no possession in the disputed land and his title in the case land, if any, is disputed so the writ petitioner is not entitled to get possession of the disputed land from this Court getting direction by way of mandamus. He submits that in the suit for specific performance of a contract, title of the disputed land had not been ascertained, the High Court Division erred in law in making the Rule absolute. He further submits that over the subject matter, several suits are pending for determination of its ownership, the High Court Division erred in law in giving direction to hand over possession of the same. He further submits that the land, in question, was acquired for Railway in 1882 and, accordingly, possession of the same was handed over to the Railway and, at present, same is under the management by the Dhaka City Corporation, the High Court Division erred in law in making the Rule absolute.

There are certain principles with regard to issuance of a writ of mandamus. It may be granted only where there is a statutory duty imposed upon the officials concerned and there is a failure on their part to discharge that <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">statutory obligation. In order to get such direction,</span> the writ petitioner has to satisfy that she has a legal right in the case land, the writ respondents have a legal obligation to hand over possession of the same to the writ petitioner, such prayer has been made bonafide and that the writ respondents, insptie of her legal right in the case land, refused to perform their legal duty to hand over possession of the same. The object of mandamus is to compel performance of a legal duty. It is the peremptory order of the High Court Division commanding to do which the Government or any local authority is under a legal duty to do.

It was the case of the plaintiff-writ petitioner that Syed Jamil Hasan executed a âbainanamaâ in her favour. She is the wife of Advocate M.A. Khaleque of village Joleswaritola, 2nd floor, Bogra Town, P.S. and District Bogra at present Section -6, Block-1, Road No.4, House No.4, Mirpur, P.S. Mirpur, Dhaka. From the âbainanamaâ, it appears that the writ petitioner Most. Monowara Begum wife of M.A. Khaleque is the recipient of the âbainanamaâ and Syed Jamil Hassan, represented by his Attorney to M.A. Khaleque of the aforesaid address is the executant. That is, by virtue of the Power of Attorney alleged to have been executed by Syed Jamil Hasan in favour of writ petitionerâs husband M.A. Khaleque, he (M.A. Khaleque) executed the said âbainanamaâ on 11.04.1990.

It further appears that prior to execution of the said âbainanamaâ M.A. Khaleque, on 24.01.1990, mentioning his present address at 112, Dakkhin Basabo, District, Dhaka created a power of attorney allegedly executed by Syed Jamil Hasan in respect of his 84.7116 acres of land situated within Dhaka City Corporation, in which, the authority to sell of those lands was given. Though the said power of attorney authorised the husband of the writ petitioner to transfer entire 84.7116 acres of land including the case land of Syed Jamil Hasan but her husband, without executing the sale deed to her on the strength of that power of attorney, allowed her to file suit for specific performance of contract on 12.05.1991 stating that the defendant Syed Jamil Hasan had denied to execute the sale deed on 05.04.1991. Thereafter, on 24.06.1993 the plaintiff-writ petitioner mentioning her present address at 14/3, Pallobi, Mirpur, Dhaka and address of Syed Jamil Hasan at No.88, Goalnagar Lane, Court House Street, Dhaka filed a compromise petition to effect compromise of the suit . It appears from the first page of the compromise petition that the plaintiffsâ Lawyer was A.H. M.Ziauddin and defendantâs Lawyer was A.B.M. Bayezid but from affidavits submitted in support of the said compromise petition both the plaintiff and defendant were identified by A.H.M. Ziauddin, Advocate. Non identification of Syed Jamil Hasan by his Lawyer and identification by the plaintiffâs Lawyer indicates that fraud has been committed on the Court in effecting compromise. It further appears that first condition amongst others in the compromise petition was, inter alia, </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: SutonnyMJ;">ÃDÂ³ Avg â gvÂ³vibvgv `wjj mZÂ¨, mwVK Ges envj Avâ¡Q I _vwKâ¡e|Ã</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"> Perhaps with a motive for getting seal of the Court declaring the power of attorney genuine and valid, such condition has been incorporated in the compromise petition inasmuch as the same was extraneous matter and such condition cannot be a legal condition to effect a compromise of a suit for specific performance of contract. It was a fraudulent attempt to legalize the power of attorney in respect of entire 84.7116 acres of land inasmuch as suit land was only 2.8172 acres. In condition No.2 it has been stated that the plaintiff writ petitioner paid consideration money since 1977 and having received in total a sum of taka 29,95,000/- , the attorney executed the deed of agreement for sale. In such situation, it is not understandable what prevented the husband of the writ petitioner to execute the sale deed in favour of his wife, the writ petitioner, when she paid tk.29,95,000/- out of tk.30,00,000/- by virtue of his power of attorney which is highly doubtful.

A decree for specific performance of contract only declares the right of decree holder to have a deed of transfer of the property covered by the decree executed in his favour. The decree by itself does not transfer the title. It is the execution of the sale deed that transfers the property. Such transfer of title is taken place if the vendor himself has transferable perfect title in the land transferred. In that suit, neither the appellants of these appeals were impleaded nor title of the disputed land has been adjudicated and ascertained.

Earlier Motwalli of Shahjadi Waqf Estate filed Title suit No. 363 of 1985 against Railway and others and in that suit Munsif, 4th Court Dhaka found the title and possession of the Railway. In Title Appeal No.158 of 1987 and 159 of 1987, Additional District Judge, 3rd Court, Dhaka observed that the disputed land is the acquired land of the Government and Railway has been possessing the same. The plaintiff of the said suit fought up to the Appellate Division and lost. Syed Jamil Hasan, the alleged vendor of the writ petitioner, himself filed Title Suit No.151 of 1980 for declaration of title and recovery of possession in the then 3rd Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka against Railway and others admitting the possession of the Railway. The said suit is still pending in the Second Court of Joint District Judge, Dhaka where the same was renumbered as Title Suit No.837 of 2015. That is, at the time of alleged execution of âbainanamaâ Syed Jamil Hasanâs title was doubtful and he had no possession of the case land.

In the case of Mohan Panday V. Usha Rani Rajaria reported in 1992 (IV) SCC 61 it has been laid down that no mandamus can be based on a Civil Court decree, which would be in the nature of executing or giving effect to a civil decree. This writ petition was full of disputed facts and the prayer made in it cannot be granted in a proceeding under Article 102 of the Constitution as factual disputes cannot be decided in this proceeding. The writ of mandamus cannot be demanded ex-debito justifiae but it issues only in the discretion of the court. It is a high prerogative writ and is to ampliate justice not to give effect of a decree which is apparently fraudulent and collusive in nature. It is a malafide attempt on behalf of writ petitioner Monowara Begum, wife of an Advocate to grab the property of the Republic.
