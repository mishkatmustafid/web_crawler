He went to the court and purchased the stamp paper and he took the scribe to his shop when he kept the defendants No. 1 and 2 sitting at Rokman Ali’s shop.

If the father-in-law of the plaintiff was the negotiator then there was no reason for the said negotiator to be not present at the time of writing of the bainapatra and be a witness of the said bainapatra instead of a shop keeper and a stranger to become attesting witnesses in the said bainapatra.

In respect of the Handwriting Expert’s report the High Court Division observed “ the Handwriting Expert also stated in his report that <em>apparently the signatures in all the relevant papers<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>including the deed of agreement are of same hand but on further analyses the expert find some difference in respect of pen movement, density of ink or hesitation in putting the signature in the deed of agreement.”</em><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The High Court Division observed ‘since the trial Court did not consider the expert’s report as a correct one it compared<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>the signature by itself and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>came to the conclusion that the signatures in all relevant papers are of same hand’. Thus it affirmed the said finding of the trial Court holding that there may be<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>some differences in the signature of one person to another because of time, age, health condition and mental condition of a person and, as such, the trial Court rightly discouraged such report’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In respect of thumb impression the High Court Division observed that “it is further apparent that the thumb impressions are of same hand in respect of size and nature but there is some difference in respect of density of ink about such difference. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">17.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">On these backdrops the Handwriting Expert report dated 08.07.1993 has been placed before us by filing additional paper book dated 28.11.2016.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Having gone through the same it appears that the High Court Division completely misread the same and without considering the entire report came to a wrong conclusion that the expert found that the signatures are of same hand.

So, on the face of such report by the Handwriting Expert the High Court Division committed serious error in relying on the opinion of the trial Court and also upon its one opinion and thereby erroneously passed the impugned judgment and order. No doubt the court is the expert of all experts as decided in the case of Abtab Ali(Captain, Retired) Vs. SM Kutubuddin (56 DLR(AD)117). But when modern technologies are available in comparing the disputed signatures with the admitted signature the court should not take the risk of comparing the signature by itself when the experts with modern technologies are available. This view finds support in the case of Serajuddin Ahmed (Md) and others Vs. AKM Saiful Alam and others (9 MLR (AD) 201) and Tarek Chandra Majhi Vs. Atahar Ali Hawlader and others (8 MLR (AD)209). In respect of thumb impression it is not at all possible to justify whether one thumb impression matches with other by naked eye other than with the help of modern technique and enlargement of impression for which the Expert is the right person who can give opinion upon critical analyses of all marks of the impressions, as decided in the cases cited above.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">19.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">In a suit for specific performance of Contract the plaintiff is to prove that there was a talk of sale, pursuant to the said talk consideration/earnest money was passed and an agreement for sale(bainapatra) was executed by the vendor stipulating certain conditions, if any, to enforce the agreement.
