He next submits that the accused-appellant Siddiqur Rahman @ Siddique Miah was taken on remand repeatedly but the police failed to record confessional statement from him. Moreover, the three confessional statements under sections 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure made by Asad Bin Kadir, Abu Taher Md. Murtoza Ehsan @ Appollo Bishwas and Md. Tamjid Hossain @ Babu are not corroborative, rather contradictory. Two witness, Monir Mollah and Bobi Akther who made statements under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure but they did not say that they saw the occurrence. Monir Mollah and Bobi Akther who deposed in court as witness but they were declared hostile by prosecution, which means they dismissed the previous statement made under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. So, the statements made by two witnesses have no evidentiary value under section 155 and 157 of Evidence Act. In this regard he referred a decision reported in 42 DLR (AD) 1990-253. He also submits that Abu Taher Md. Mortuja Ehsan @ Appollo Bishwas and other accuseds made confessional statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure where they stated they knew the alleged occurrence after murder. Moreover, they did not say about manner of killing where they implicated themselves. The learned Advocate tried to submit confessional statements of accuseds Tamjid Hossain @ Babu and Abu Taher Md. Murtoza Ehsan @ Appollo Bishwas are exculpatory. He further argued ejhar has been filed after 9 hours of the occurrence. No explanation has been given for delay in lodging ejahar. Ejahar was lodged against unknown persons, at the time of filing of ejahar no assign or allege to be expressed within the four corner of ejahar regarding motivation of murder. But it was made after thought. The room from where the dead body of the deceased has been found, the lock has not been seized, even in whose presence the lock was broken those were not produced before court. He submits that the recording Magistrate has recorded the confessional statements not as per rules embodied in section 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Finally, he submits that the accuseds were not drawn to their confessional statements when they were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, they are obviously prejudiced. Such defense is not curable under section 537 of the Code. He lastly submits that P.W 2 and P.Ws-3, 5, 6, 7, 15 and 16 are reporters of newspapers and hear say witnesses, they in a chorus deposed that Goutam has been murdered for reporting on the irregularity, corruption on renovation work of âMujib Sarakâ, Faridpur. But failed to prove the involvement of the accuseds in the work of âMujib Sarakâ, Tamjid Hossain Babu was arrested on 18.11.2005 but his confessional statement was recorded on 26.11.2005 which means he was taken under police custody for about 9 days and tortured him for which he is bound to make confessional statement.

But the document speak that he made his statements just after on third day of the occurrence i.e. 19.11.2005. No documents have been produced to prove that he was doing job in police line. Therefore, it is presumed that under pressure and threat the witness, Monir Mollah departed himself to state in court which he stated earlier under section 164. So, the citation referred by learned Advocate Helal Uddin reported in 42 DLR (AD) 1990 at page-253 has no manner and application in the facts and circumstances of the present case. <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Thus Exhibits-4 and 5, coupled with P.W-4 and 12 it is proved that the accused Imran, Siddique and Zahid came in Sarani Market on 17.11.2005 at 7.00 am which was seen by Monir Mollah (P.W-4), Guard Sheikh Matiur Rahman Khokon (P.W-12). </strong>Guard Sheikh Matiur Rahman was declared hostile by prosecution and in cross-examination he said, the accused Imran, Kazi Murad are influential person and they execute the work of Mujib Sarak.

The above statements of the accuseds Asad-Bin-Kadir, Abu Taher Md.

From the evidence of P.W.-8, Md. Anwar Hossain, the confessional statements recording Magistrate, it appears that accused Asad-Bin- Kadir was arrested at 12.02 on 20.11.2005 and produced before him at 12.30 on the same date. It further appears the accused Abu Taher Md. Murtoza Ehsan @ Appollo Bishwas was produced before him at 3.15 on 22.11.2005. It also appears from the confessional statement that the accused Abu Taher Md. Murtoza Ehsan @ Appollo Bishwas arrested at 3.15 pm on the same date i.e. 22.11.2005. P.W-8 deposed that he observed all the formalities as contemplated in law to ensure about the willingness of the accuseds for recording the confession of Asad Bin Kadir. Abu Taher Md. Murtoza Ehsan @ Appollo Bishwas. Accordingly, to P.W-8 before recording the statement he told the said accuseds that he was a Magistrate, the accused was not bound to make any confession and if he did not so it would be used as evidence against him. In his cross examination he said that he did not say the said accuseds as to whether any mark of torture. But no suggestion has been given him that there were marks of torture in their body. Similarity Tamjid Hossain Babu was arrested on 18.11.2005 and produced before the Magistrate on 26.11.2005. P.W-8 deposed that he observed all the formalities as contemplated in law to ensue about the willingness of the accused for recording the confession. The accused Tamjid Hossain Babu and Abu Taher Md.

The guard Sheikh Motiar Rahman Khokon as P.W-12 stated that the accused Imran and Kazi Murad were influential person and involved in constructing the Mujib Sarak. The accused Abu Taher Md.

So there is obvious no doubt that Monir Molla and the night guard Khokon under pressure or threat of influential accuseds restrained them to speak the truth. Therefore, there is no scope to disbelieve the statements made under section 164 by Monir Molla.

These reports were produced by the informant Hasanuzzaman who was a journalist and colleague of the deceased, collected from the room of deceased. The defence challenged those writing of Goutam Das but they did not prayed for expert. <strong>So, Exhibit 5, 4ka, coupled with P.W-4, 12 and P.W-1 and material Exhibits-I, II</strong> proved that the accused Imran, Siddique, Zahid were involved directly in killing Goutam Das. In this respect reliance may be placed to the decision reported in 8 BLC (2003), 562, wherein it has been held. âIt is well settled that then a case rests on circumstantial evidence, such evidence must satisfy three tests: (1) the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be cogently and firmly established; (ii) those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused; (iii) the circumstances taken cumulatively, should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the offence was committed by the accused and none else.â </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">128.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The accuseds namely <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Asif Imtiaz Bulu, Kazi Murad @ Murad, Apon @ Kamrul Islam Apon, Md.
