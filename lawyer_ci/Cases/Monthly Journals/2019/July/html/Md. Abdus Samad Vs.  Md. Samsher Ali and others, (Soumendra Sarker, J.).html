The S.A. recorded tenant Chhutku Mahmud had been owning and possessing 1.65 acres of land including the case land measuring 0.30 acres. Subsequently, he transferred the total 1.65 acres of land in favour of one Afuruddin. Afuruddin died leaving behind one wife Shahijan Nessa and 04(four) sons namely Abdus Samad, Abdur Hamid, Abdus Salam and Abul Hossain and two daughters namely Afiton Nessa and Rashida Khatun. Thereafter, Abdul Hamid transferred .29 acres of land to his brother Md. Abdus Samad by a registered sale deed No.2863 dated 04.05.1987 and on the same date Shahijan Nessa transferred 0.20½ acres of land by a registered ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">heba-bil-awaj</em>’ deed No.2864 to Abdus Samad and Abdul Hamid. The opposite party No. 2 and 4-7 transferred their respective land in favour of Abdus Samad by different deeds and in this way Abdus Samad become a co-sharer in the case Khatian No.34. The further case of the pre-emptor-petitioner Abdus Samad is such that the opposite party No.2 Abdul Hamid transferred the case land measuring 0.30 acres of land by a registered deed No.3021 on 20.06.2000 in favour of the opposite party No.1 Md. Shamser Ali, a stranger to the case <em>jote, </em>and no notice of transfer was served upon the pre-emptor-petitioner Abdus Samad and to deprive the pre-emptor-petitioner’s right to pre-emption, the transfer deed was written in the name and style of an “Exchange Deed,” but in fact, the said deed is a sub-kabala deed in favour of stranger opposite party No.1. The pre-emptor-petitioner knowing about the case transfer finally on 14.08.2001 after getting certified copy of the deed, filed the original pre-emption miscellaneous case for getting the case land pre-empted.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The contrary case of the purchaser opposite party No.1 in short is thus that the transfer deed is out and out a ‘deed of exchange’ and it is not at all a sub-kabala in favour of the pre-emptee-purchaser-opposite party No.1, and that the case land measuring 0.30 acres described in the schedule ‘Ka’ of the pre-emption miscellaneous petition was exchanged by the opposite party No.2 and the opposite party No.1 in exchange of the land of ‘Ka’ schedule, transferred ‘kha’ schedule land measuring .25 acres by a transfer deed dated 27.06.2000 in favour of opposite party No.2, but the pre-emptor-petitioner out of ill-motive to grab the case land on false allegation instituted the original miscellaneous case, which is liable to be disallowed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The learned trial court during trial of the original case after taking evidences from the sides of the respective parties by its judgment and order dated 10.02.2002 disallowed the pre-emption miscellaneous case.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Being aggrieved, the pre-emptor-petitioner filed a Miscellaneous Appeal being No.24 of 2002 in the Court of learned District Judge, Rangpur which was transmitted to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Court of learned Additional District Judge, Rangpur for hearing and disposal and the learned Additional District Judge by the impugned judgment and order dated 11.02.2004 disallowed the miscellaneous appeal affirming the judgment and order passed by the trial Court. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order, the pre-emptor-appellant-petitioner has preferred this civil revision under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the Rule.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">During hearing of the Rule, Mr. Md.

The courts below in their observation and findings concurrently held that inasmuch as, it was not a sale deed, for exchanging the land between O.P.W.1 and O.P.W.2, the value of the land was shown inadequate which is a strong circumstantial evidence in this case. Besides this, having gone through the testimonies of the witnesses it is evident to note that P.W.1 and P.W.2 in their examination-in-chief, despite tried to corroborate the pleadings case of the pre-emptor-petitioner, but both of them have been discredited in their cross-examination and on the other hand, O.P.Ws.1-3 corroborated one-another in respect of the pleading’s case of the opposite party. Except some minor discrepancies no such material contradiction or omission is noticed, by dint of which these witnesses can be disbelieved.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">18.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Under the ambit of section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 [XXVIII of 1951] it is a decided matter in our judicature that in case of a colourable transaction, the onus of proof is entirely lies upon the party, who assert that the transfer is a sub-kabala in disguise of a deed of exchange under section 101 and 103 of the Evidence Act [I of 1872].
