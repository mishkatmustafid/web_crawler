Whilst it is the professional duty of the learned Advocates to protect the interest of their clients, it does not necessarily mean that they would be driven by the whimsical request or unlawful instructions of the clients; rather they should act on their good conscience. A gutsy Advocate shall never be motivated by mere material instructions, nor shall s/he ever get involved in squabble in the open Court for satisfying the client. The learned Advocates must not take any step to waste the invaluable business-hours of the Court. The members of the Bar should bear in mind that the Court room is considered and recognized all over the world to be the most formal place where the Judges and lawyers are obligated not only to comply with the rules regarding dresses/outfittings, but also they are required to maintain their professional ethics, etiquette and norms by mindfully using the words they utter before the Court in a genteel accent as well as by showing their demeanour to be humble without having the minimum characteristics of being egotistic or arrogant.

Whilst it is true that as per the original Judgment and Order dated 05.02.2018, the petitioner is not legally bound to purchase the shares of the respondent no. 4, the background of filing the instant case strongly suggests that it would be impossible for the respondent no. 4 to partner with the petitioner in any business and, thus, it is inevitable that either the original Judgment shall be complied with by the parties or the petitioner shall buy the shares of the respondent nos. 2, 3 and 4. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It is contended by the petitioner that prior to passing the Order on 13.12.2018 by this Court, this matter was appearing in this Court’s Cause List for the last one month, since the date of filing of the petitioner’s application for payment of interest &amp; profit on top of the share-price, by serving copy upon the respondent no. 4, but the learned Advocate for the respondent no. 4 did not bother to remain present in the Court-room. It is prayed by the petitioner that implementation of this Court’s Order dated 13.12.2018 should not be suspended or cancelled on the plea of hearing the application of the respondent no. 4 inasmuch as the claim of the respondent no. 4 requires to be adjudicated upon in an independent application under Section 233 of the Companies Act upon conducting fresh audit of the company. On the contrary, the contention of the respondent no. 4 is that the petitioner has succeeded to obtain the Order dated 13.12.2018 by misleading this Court inasmuch as the petitioner did not bring the fact to the notice of this Court that if the petitioner is made the sole signatory of the company’s bank account, it will not only be a violation of the provisions of Memorandum &amp; Articles of Association of the company, but shall also create an opportunity for the petitioner to illegally divert<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>the funds of the company elsewhere, jeopardizing the rights and interest of the respondent no. 4. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">10.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The learned Advocate for the petitioner was repeatedly emphasizing on the point that as per the original Judgment and Order dated 05.02.2018, the respondent no. 4 could have requested the respondent nos. 2 &amp; 3 to buy his shares and, further, at the time of filing this joint application, had the respondent nos. 2 &amp; 3 bargained with the petitioner about purchasing of the shares of the respondent no. 4, there would have been an occasion for the petitioner to consider the issue.

Eventually, this Court asked the respondent nos. 2 &amp; 3 placing them in the Court-dock as to whether they are ready to pay off the entire amount with interest together with the profit of the petitioner’s shares to the petitioner by depositing Pay Order/s by today or tomorrow, against the backdrop that the petitioner is ready to pay off the amount of money agreed to by the respondent nos. 2 &amp; 3 instantly through Pay Order. In reply thereto, the respondent nos. 2 &amp; 3 informed this Court that if they are allowed to issue a post-dated cheque with 2 (two) months’ time, then they will be in a position to pay off the money as per the Judgment and Order passed by this Court on 05.02.2018 with the interest plus the profit of the petitioner’s shares which would be accrued till the date of payment through the Pay Order/s after 2 (two) months. Prayer of the respondent nos. 2 &amp; 3 for allowing two months’ time for purchasing the petitioner’s shares appeared to this Court to be a cunning device with a motive to frustrate both the Judgments and Orders dated 05.02.2018 &amp; 13.12.2018, given that after their failure to comply with this Court’s direction passed in the original Judgment, they had voluntarily made the joint application for selling their shares, instead of purchasing the petitioner’s shares. Moreover, the respondent nos. 2 &amp; 3 did not make any prayer to this Court previously for extension of time in order to enable him to comply with the original Judgment and Order, nor did he file an application for arranging analogous hearing of the Contempt Petition by this Court with the petitioner’s application for granting interest and profit of the shares for the delay, at which event this Court would have been in a position to refer the application to the Hon’ble Chief Justice for his appropriate Order. In the alternative, the respondent nos. 2 &amp; 3 directly could have approached the Hon’ble Chief Justice for obtaining an Order for analogous/simultaneous hearing of the Contempt Petition and this Company Matter by this Bench. Now, when this Court is going to implement the Judgment and Order dated 13.12.2018, upon directing the learned Advocate for the RJSC to remain present in the Court room to witness the transfer of shares by the respondent nos. 2 &amp; 3 to the petitioner so as to relieve the parties from attending the office of the RJSC, the prayer of the petitioner to implement the original Judgment and Order dated 05.02.2018 does not appear to me to be bonafide. When a party to a litigation approaches any Court with a prayer for recalling the Court’s Order/Direction which was passed modifying the original Judgment and Order on the consent of the said party, s/he must come with clean hands upon fully satisfying the Court that s/he is at once ready to comply with the original Judgment and Order. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">18.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">While this offer and counter-offer was going on in a very congenial environs in the open Court with an expectation of perpetual settlement of the dispute among the directors of the company, the learned Advocates for all the parties to this matter indulged themselves in making some inappropriate comments to each other in ominous tones leading to an untoward atmosphere.
