Dr. Anwar Hossain died leaving behind the writ petitioners, as legal heirs, who applied to the Ministry of land on 22.04.2001 (Annexure-B to the writ petition) for releasing the unused land in favour of the writ petitioners upon which the Deputy Commissioner, Barishal was asked by the Ministry, vide letter dated 30.05.2001 (Annexure-C to the writ petition) to give a report. The Roads and Highway Department, Barishal upon proper inquiry also found that 0.75 acres land out of total acquired 1.50 acres of land is totally unused by the requiring body. The requiring body, Roads and Highway Department vide Memo dated 10.09.2001 and 08.12.2001 (Annexure-D and D(1) to the writ petition) made a recommendation to release the unused 0.75 acre land and in view of that recommendation Ministry of Communication vide letter dated 11.04.2005 (Annexure-E to the writ petition) gave no objection and consented to release the unused land to the original owners on condition to refund the compensation money as earlier paid to the title holder to the account of Roads and Highway Department. In pursuant to the said letter dated 11.04.2005 (Annexure-E to the writ petition) the Ministry of Land vide letter dated 27.07.2006 (Annexure-F to the writ petition) requested writ respondent No.3, i.e., the Deputy Commissioner, Barishal to submits a report mentioning 4 (four) terms in the said letter pursuant to which the writ respondent No.3, the Deputy Commissioner, Barishal, vide letter dated 29.09.2009 informed the Secretary, Ministry of Land that 1.50 acres of land under S.A.

Finally the writ respondent No.3 in the said letter recommended that as the price of the land now has already been increased the writ petitioners’ application can be considered if compensation money repaid at the present value of the land. The writ petitioners although applied to the writ respondent No.3 to release and hand over the unused land as per direction of Ministry to the writ petitioners but got no reply.

These Inter-Ministerial Communications only lay down the policy of the Government which the various Government departments shall follow in the case of unutilized requisitioned land. These Inter-Ministerial Communications are merely policy guidelines as to how the excess and unutilized lands are to be treated but these instructions do not create any legal right in favour of the petitioners to ask for return of the land from the Government after the same has been validly requisitioned under the law. It is also on record that CDA with the approval of the Government had already completed the project for distributing plots to the low-paid employees and, as such, in reality it cannot be said that the land is not being utilized. Mere non-use of the land for years will not give any right to the petitioners. We also find that after completing all necessary formalities the land had already been handed over to the requiring body, namely, CDA. Since no legal or vested right has accrued in favour of the petitioners by mere Inter-Ministerial Communications the petitioners cannot have any legal right to ask for return of the land”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">         </span></span></p><p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 115%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">In the case of Brahamanbaria Pourashava Vs.

Thereafter, from the office of the Additional Chief Engineer, Barishal Zone vide memo No.20-1(4)/2398/1(2) dated 10.11.2004 has informed the Chief Engineer, Roads and Highways (pJS), Sarak Bhaban, Ramna, Dhaka that the land proposed to be derequisitioned would be required for expansion of the Barishal Jhalakhati Highways for making it 8 lanes from the present condition. However, this Communication was not produced before the High Court Division while the writ petition was heard, but added by the learned Deputy Attorney General, before this Division at the hearing of the appeal. In the present case, the appellant Government submits that the land in question would be required for the expansion of the Barishal-Jhalakhati highways to make it 8 lanes for the purpose for which land was requisitioned and eventually, the same was acquired upon paying the compensation under the law. So, under such circumstances and discussions made above, we are, therefore, of the considered opinion that the land in question after being acquisitioned upon payment of compensation cannot be withdrawn from acquisition and give it back to the heirs of the awardee on the plea of non-utilization as directed by the High Court Division.
