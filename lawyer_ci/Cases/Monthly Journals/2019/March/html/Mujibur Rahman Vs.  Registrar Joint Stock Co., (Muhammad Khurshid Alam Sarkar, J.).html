In other words, the AGM for the each Gregorian calendar year shall be held on any date before or on the 31<sup>st</sup> December of the concerned calendar year, inasmuch as the last Proviso to Section 81(1) of the Companies Act makes a mandatory provision for the Registrar of the Joint Stock Companies &amp; Firms that the latest date for holding the AGM of any company is “</span><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">the 31st December of the calendar year in relation to which the annual general meeting is required to be held</span></em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">”. From a conjoint reading of the entire provisions of Section 81(1) with the provisions of Sections 183(2)(b)(i) &amp; 183(4) of the Companies Act, I am of the view that at the time of holding an AGM, preparation of the Balance Sheet or Financial Report for an entire calendar year (i.e. 1<sup>st</sup> January to 31<sup>st</sup> December or for a total period of 12 (twelve) months) is not the requirement of law. If any company counts its financial year from 1<sup>st</sup> July to 30<sup>th</sup> June, then there should not be any problem for the said company to hold AGM within 31<sup>st</sup> December after conducting its audit and observing other legal formalities in July or in the subsequent months. But the companies who count their financial year from 1<sup>st</sup> January to 31<sup>st</sup> December, they have the liberty to hold AGM after preparation of their Balance Sheet for a period of 9 (nine) to 12 (twelve) months, as per their convenience. Upon minute reading of the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, namely, Section 81(1) together with its last Proviso, Sections 183(2)(b)(i) &amp; 183(4) and Regulations 50, 51 &amp; 109 of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>the Schedule 1 to the Companies Act, I find that the intent of the Legislature was that the companies must hold their AGM at any point of time from 1<sup>st</sup> July to 31<sup>st</sup> December upon preparation of their Balance Sheet for the financial year ending on 30<sup>th</sup> June so that the companies can smoothly call and hold their AGM after observing the necessary formalities as to conducting audit, issuance of notice, preparation of the reports by the Board of Directors and the Auditor. However, for any reason at the time of holding the AGM, if the dividends are not declared, Balance Sheet and/or directors’/auditors’ report were not considered, remuneration of the auditor could not be fixed or the directors could not be elected, it can be done in any EGM subject to the condition that that the aforesaid business shall not be called/termed as special business. If preparation of ‘Financial Report’ for the calendar year i.e. from 1<sup>st</sup> January to 31<sup>st</sup> December is required to be done under any other law, it can be done separately by the companies. All that I wish to make clear is that since Section 183(4) of the Companies Act does not religiously require a ‘Balance Sheet’ or ‘Financial Report’ to be prepared for a calendar year (from 1<sup>st</sup> January to 31<sup>st</sup> December), the period may be either for twelve months from 1<sup>st</sup> July to 30<sup>th</sup> June or for a period of less than 12 months (1<sup>st</sup> January to 30<sup>th</sup> September/31<sup>st</sup> October/30<sup>th</sup> November/31<sup>st</sup> December). However, when the Balance Sheet is prepared for a period less than 12 months, it would be prudent for the Board of Directors and Auditor to furnish the reasons thereof in their respective reports for non-preparation of 12 months’ Balance Sheet.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">13.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">To put the above proposition in plain words, all that I wish to say is that for every calendar year, a company shall mandatorily call, hold and conduct an AGM.

The term ‘impracticable’ is to be meant impracticable from a reasonable point of view, for, the law does not require to exist an ‘impossible’ scenario.

The fact that no share-holder of the company, including the petitioners of the aforesaid two Writ Petitions, came up to oppose the instant application despite publication of the Order of this Court as to admission of the instant matter in the two widely-circulated daily national newspapers, namely, ‘the Daily Prothom Alo’ &amp; ‘the Daily Star’ -amply suggests that the petitioner’s cause is supported by the other share-holders of the company. From the annexed papers, it transpires that the petitioner holds 1,64,287 shares of the company and it is a very normal expectation of a shareholder of any listed company that the AGM of the company would be held within/on time, so that dividends, if any, can be disbursed and the value of the share does not fall. Moreover, from the statements made in this petition, it appears to me that the petitioner has not suppressed any fact in approaching this Court and, in fact, the disclosure of the fact as to pendency of the aforementioned two Writ Petitions demonstrates his bonafides. Furthermore, it has been submitted by the learned Advocate for the petitioner that the company is trying its best through its lawyer to get the Writ Petitions disposed of and, therefore, apparently due to the Division Benches’ overwhelming preoccupation with backlog of cases, it is the Court which is not in <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">a position to dispose of the aforementioned Writ</span> Petitions. Thus, I do not find any ill motive behind filing this application before this Court. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">22.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">Now, the question which comes up for consideration by this Court is whether this Court is competent to call or direct the company for calling the 24<sup>th</sup> AGM of the company, when evidently the aforesaid two Writ Petitions wherein Order of injunction on holding the company’s AGM was passed by the Division Bench of this Court, are pending for final disposal. For arriving at a decision on this issue, besides becoming familiar with the facts/the subject matter of the aforesaid two Writ Petitions, I need to know the impact of issuance of the Order of injunction to hold the AGM of the company. The copies of both the Writ Petitions have been produced before me by the petitioner by way of annexing the same to the supplementary affidavits. From the statements made in the Writ Petitions, it appears to me that both the Writ Petitions have been filed challenging the propriety and legality of a letter issued by the Bangladesh Bank to the company granting permission to declare ‘stock dividend’ subject to fulfillment of some conditions. The grounds for challenging the said letter are that while the Bangladesh Bank had issued ‘show cause notice’ against the Managing Director, Chief Financial Officer and the Secretary of the company for being defaulters in preparation of the financial statements of the company, the Bangladesh Bank was not justified to allow the company to declare 5% ‘stock dividend’. For a better understanding of the contents of the aforesaid letter, it is reproduced herein below: </span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: center;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;

However, since this application has been filed with the expectation to enable the company to hold the AGM of the company, I should see whether the Bangladesh Bank’s above-quoted decision in permitting the company to declare 5% ‘stock dividend’ in any manner is connected with the AGM of the company. The Companies Act has not delineated the items/agenda for the Companies’ AGM, nor has it categorized the types of businesses required to be taken up and transacted in the AGM, except enshrining that the presentation of the balance sheet together with the profit &amp; loss account shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section 183, presentation of a report shall be prepared by the Board of Directors as per the provisions of Section 184, an auditor of the company shall be appointed as per Section 210 and an audit report shall be presented by the auditor as per the provisions of Section 213 (3) of the Companies Act. As per the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, election of directors and declarations of dividends are required to be taken up and transacted in a ‘general meeting’ and, AGM being the general meeting, usually it is the practice of the companies to elect the director/s of the company, to declare dividends, arrange gala function, etc. in the AGM. However, declaration of dividend is not a mandatory business to be transacted in the company’s AGM, for, it may be declared in any general meeting as provided in Regulation 96 under Schedule 1 of the Companies Act, and Regulation 97 of the Schedule 1 of the Companies Act mandates the directors of the company to pay interim dividend from time to time. More so, Regulation 32 of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (Listing) Regulations, 2015 makes provisions for the companies to proceed with the company’s AGM without declaring the dividend where there is any litigation pending before the Court. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">In the aforesaid two Writ Petitions, the legality of declaration of ‘stock dividend’ has been challenged. The issue as to whether the directors’ decision for declaring dividend has been taken as per the provisions of Regulations 96 to 103 of the Schedule to the Companies Act or not and, further, whether the interests and rights of the shareholders are being prejudiced in any manner because of the recommendation made by the company’s Board for declaration of the ‘stock dividend’ -can be questioned before this Court by minimum of 10% shareholders by filing an application under Section 233 of the Companies Act. In these two Writ Petitions, the decisions of the Board of Directors regarding declaration of dividend has been challenged in the Division Bench of this Court, in a round-about manner by questioning the legality of issuance of Bangladesh Bank’s letter by which Bangladesh Bank granted permission to declare ‘stock dividend’. ‘Stock dividend’ is not same as ‘cash dividend’ and, also, from the papers submitted before this Court,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>it transpires that the company has already complied with the conditions attached for declaration of the 5% ‘stock dividend’ as contained in the letter issued by the Bangladesh Bank and, therefore, it would certainly be an issue for the Division Bench to adjudicate upon as to whether there is any illegality and/or whether the company shall suffer any financial loss because of declaration of the ‘stock dividend’ against the backdrop of the fact that the company has already complied with all the conditions imposed by the Bangladesh Bank. Since the above-discussed issue is to be examined and adjudicated upon by the Division Bench, I refrain from dwelling on this issue. </span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; color: black;">The issue to be adjudicated upon by this Court is whether the company’s AGM can be called and held without declaring the company’s dividend, and the answer thereto I have already got from the examination of Regulation 96 of the Schedule of the Companies Act that it may be declared in any general meeting which may be called at any time subsequent to holding the AGM of any company. </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Considering the importance of annual general meeting of shareholders, it has been held in a catena of cases of all the jurisdictions of the world that the directors must call the meeting, even though the company is not functioning or the management of the entire business of the company is vested in the Government. Taking into consideration the observations made by the Court, the Dhaka Stock Exchange has made provisions in the Dhaka Stock Exchange (Listing) Regulations, 2015 that AGM of the companies cannot be halted on the plea of pendency of any litigation in any Court on the issue of declaration of dividend. <span style="color: black;">AGM is the only occasion of the public company where the general share-holders get the opportunity to quiz the directors of the company about different aspects of the company. Since the Writ Petitioners in the aforementioned two Writ Petitions have raised the question of legality of the Board’s recommendation for declaration of 5% ‘dividend stock’, it would be a great opportunity for them to ask the directors about the issue and, upon getting a satisfactory answer, they might agree to the decision taken by the Board of Directors regarding declaration of ‘stock dividend’ and, that is how, their grievance might be mitigated and the company might be in a position to declare the dividend unanimously in the AGM.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In view of the fact that, currently, there is no injunction Order in operation in the aforesaid two Writ Petitions, I hold that the AGM of the company, named, First Finance Limited, may be called, held and conducted at any time from now without declaring the ‘stock dividend’ in the AGM.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">      </span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">26.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">Now, the next issue comes up for consideration whether the Court is empowered to call or to direct for calling, holding and conducting the further AGMs, which have fallen due during the pendency of this case. In other words, I need to examine the question as to whether this Court would direct the company to call only the 24<sup>th</sup> AGM, as prayed for in this petition; or this Court should direct the company to call all the AGMs which have fallen due by now. Under the mandate provided in Section 81(2) of the Companies Act in the following expressions <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“the Court may ……… give such ancillary or consequential direction as the Court thinks expedient in relation to the calling, holding and conducting of the meeting” </em>and by dint of the power given in Section 85(3) of the Companies Act in the following terms “</span><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">if for any reason it is impracticable to call a meeting of a company ……………. the Court may either of its own motion ………….... order a meeting of the company to be called, held and conducted in such manner as the Court thinks fit, and where any such order is given the Court may give such ancillary or consequential directions …….................</span></em><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">”</span></em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">, I hold that the company Court is empowered not only to direct the company to call the AGM/s which have not been called, held and conducted due to interference of this Court or for some other reasons which were beyond the control of the company, but also, if the Court thinks it expedient, it may give, as the ancillary relief,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>required directions for calling, holding and conducting the AGM/s fallen due and, in order to implement the Court’s direction for holding the AGM/s, the Company Court may consider to pass some other consequential order/s and direction/s, such as (i) appointment of the auditor for the company as per the choice of the Court, for, the company and the Court-appointed auditor often involves in dispute regarding amount of the auditor’s fees and, ultimately, they again approach this Court for its resolution (iii) schedule of time and date of the AGM, (iv) selection of the venue of the AGM and, if necessary, some other appropriate ancillary orders/directions. Since it is the requirement of laws that an audited balance sheet, profit &amp; loss account and summary of the property, assets, shares, capital and liabilities must be presented in the AGM, if this Court simply passes direction upon the company to call and hold the AGM/s fallen due, there may be a delay again for not passing appropriate orders on the aforesaid connected issues. The Legislature has, thus, not only empowered this Court to <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">suo motu</em> call, hold and conduct the meeting of the company, but it has also vested this Court with the power of granting any consequential and ancillary direction upon the company or other concerns to do the needful for the purpose of calling, holding and conducting the company’s meeting fruitfully without putting the company into further hassle of approaching this Court separately for ancillary issues connected with the calling, holding and conducting the company’s meeting. In this case, the AGMs of the calendar years 2016 (24<sup>th</sup> AGM) and 2017 (25<sup>th</sup> AGM) have not been held due to the misconception of law, but the AGM of the company for the calendar year 2018 (26<sup>th</sup> AGM) has fallen due for the reason of pendency of the cases and, therefore, I am inclined to extend the time for calling &amp; holding the AGMs for the calendar years 2017 &amp; 2018 (25<sup>th</sup> &amp; 26<sup>th</sup> AGMs) of the company in addition to extending the time for calling/directing to call the AGM of the calendar year 2016 (24<sup>th</sup> AGM).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">27.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">Let me now take up the issue whether the company and its directors &amp; officers have incurred penalty under Section 82 of the Companies Act. From the circumstances stated in the substantive petition and supplementary affidavits and, further, from a minute perusal of the papers &amp; documents annexed to the substantive petition as well as to the supplementary affidavits, it transpires that there has been a delay for holding the AGM of the calendar year 2016, for, the Gregorian calendar year of 2016 ended on 31<sup>st</sup> December 2016, but the company’s AGM was scheduled to be held on 15.06.2017. </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">It was held in the case of Gibson v Barton, (1875) L.R. 10 Q.B. 329 and in the case of Park v Lawton (1911) L.R 1 K.B. 588 that “year” means calendar year starting from 1<sup>st</sup> January and ending on 31<sup>st</sup> December. Thus, I find that the Chairman, the Managing Director &amp; all other directors, Chief Financial officer and the Secretary of the company have incurred penalty for their failure to call and hold the AGM of the calendar year 2016 within 31<sup>st</sup> 2016. However, in the light of my findings that <span style="color: black;">the delay for the subsequent calendar years, namely, 2017 &amp; 2018 is occurred not for the company’s willful laches or negligence or default, I hold that the company or its directors <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">have not incurred any penalty for their failure to</span> <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">hold the AGM for the calendar years 2017 &amp; 2018.</span></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">28.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">After resolutions of the issue that the Chairman, MD, Directors, CFO and the Secretary of the company have incurred penalty, now I need to see whether this Court is vested with the power to deal with the issue of imposing the penalty and, in an appropriate case, to exonerate the delinquent/s from the penalty incurred. From a concurrent reading of the provisions of sub-Sections (1) &amp; (2) of Section 396 of the Companies Act, it is my view that if no proceeding has been drawn against the company/its director/officer for failure to comply with any provisions of the Companies Act, the delinquent company/its director/officer may file an application for exoneration from the fine/penalty and, in the event that any proceeding for failure to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act is pending before the competent Court, the Company Court would not deal with the issue of fine/penalty and simply deal with the issues of civil nature, such as condonation of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>delay towards enabling the company to do the needful in compliance with the various provisions of Companies Act. The above view was taken by this Court in the case of Creative Engineers Ltd V RJSC 2018(2) 13 ALR. Following holding that this Court is well empowered to deal with an application under Section 396 of the Companies Act, it is now incumbent upon me to see whether the delinquents should be penalized or they deserve mercy of this Court. At the very outset, I would say that it was their duty to approach this Court long ago to seek permission for holding the AGMs of the calendar years 2016 &amp; 2017. However, in view of the findings made hereinbefore that the company’s AGM for the year 2016 has not been held due to misconception of law and due to pendency of the two Writ Petitions before the Division Benches of this Court wherein the company was restrained to hold its AGM resulting in becoming impracticable for the company to call, hold and conduct AGMs of the company as per the provisions of the Act as well as the Articles of Association of the company, without the interference of this Court, I see it justified to opine that the company or its responsible directors/officers should not be penalized for delay in holding the AGMs.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">29.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">In the result, the petition is allowed.
