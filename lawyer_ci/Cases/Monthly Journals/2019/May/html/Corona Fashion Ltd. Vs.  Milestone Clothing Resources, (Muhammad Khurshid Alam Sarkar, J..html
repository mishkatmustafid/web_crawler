If the terminologies "party" and "parties” imprinted in Section 12 of the Arbitration Act are read with the above definition of "Party", it becomes clear that Section 12 of the Arbitration Act will apply and an application thereunder can be maintained only if a party to an “arbitration agreement” invokes Section 12 of the Arbitration Act.

Documentary Collection is subject to the Uniform Rules of Collection modelled by International Chamber of Commerce, Publication No. 522, which has been named ʻURC-522'. There are two types of Documentary Collection. (1) Documents against Payment (“D/P'), in which the Bank will release documents to the buyer upon his payment and (2) Documents against Acceptance ('D/A), by which the Bank will release documents to the buyer upon his acceptance of a Bill of Exchange that undertakes to pay at a determinable future date.

Step-2: Seller presents documents to the remitting Bank with clear instruction for collection of payment. Step-3: Remitting Bank forwards the documents and collection instruction to the collecting/presenting Bank. Step-4: Collecting/presenting Bank presents documents to the buyer for payment. Step-5: Buyer pays for the document. Step-6: Collecting/presenting Bank remits the net proceeds to the remitting Bank after deducting its own charges. Step-7: Remitting Bank credits the net proceeds into the seller's account after deducting its own charges. In a “Documentary Collection” under URC-522, it is now established that URC-522 does not create privity of contract between the principal/seller and the collecting Bank.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">          </span>. . .

Such an agreement can be in one document or can be gathered from several documents also. It can be gathered from correspondences consisting of letters, fax messages, telegrams or even telex messages. An arbitration agreement can also be constituted when the existence of the agreement is depicted in a statement of claim and defence and the existence of the contract is alleged by one party and not denied by the other. The arbitration clause may exist either in the circumstances by way of incorporating an arbitration agreement or in the situation as contemplated in Section 9 of the Arbitration Act.

Thus, the difference between an L/C transaction and D/A transaction is that in the former case the buyer's Bank guarantees to the L/C beneficiary Bank (i.e. exporter's Bank) that it would make payment on receipt of compliant shipping documents, whereas in the latter case the buyer's Bank does not provide any such independent guarantee/ undertaking. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">     </span>. . .(52)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Words and Phrases </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">L/C and Documentary Collection. </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Now-a-days, many of the remitting Banks inscribe the provisions of arbitration in the L/C and Documentary Collection. It has become a frequent custom to incorporate the provision of arbitration in dealing with Documentary Collection, more particularly in dealing with transactions relating to Documents by Acceptance (D/A). Since the practice of “Documentary Collection” is highly specialized and often counter-intuitive to the general commercial lawyer, the judicial process has not generally afforded speedy, final and sound relief desired by the parties to a dispute under Documentary Collection. To resolve this predicament, International Centre for Letter of Credit Arbitration INC was founded in 1996, which is located in Washington DC, USA. This Centre has established a set of rules, namely, ICLOCA Rules of Arbitration. These rules are modelled to assist in the resolution of disputes arising out of international banking operations, including Letters of Credit, Confirmations or Advices, Documentary Collections, Funds Transfers etc. The interested parties of the transactions may refer the dispute under ICLOCA Rules by inserting a clause into the undertaking or agreement providing that all future disputes, arising out, or in connection to the agreement be subjected to the Centre for Resolution under those Rules. . . .

Once the parties adopt any such model in their contractual relationship, the arbitration clause incorporated in such model impliedly becomes applicable in their contractual transactions. For example, if the parties adopt ICC Rules of Arbitration or Rules of the International Cotton Association Limited, the arbitration clauses incorporated therein become impliedly applicable and binding in their contract. Therefore, in “Documentary Collection”, if the parties by express term decide to include ICC Arbitration Rules or ICLOCA Rules of Arbitration in their contract, then the parties shall be bound by such term.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">  </span>. . .(55)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Arbitration Act (I of 2001)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Section 12</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">After carrying out the examination of all the five issues, as framed by me for the purpose of adjudication of this case, I find that this case (application under Section 12 of the Arbitration Act) is liable to fail against the respondent no. 2 (collecting Bank), mainly, on the grounds of non-existence of the arbitration agreement. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">         </span>. . .

The “Documentary Collection” transaction was handled according to the Uniform Rules for Collection, International Chamber of Commerce Publication no. 522 (“URC 522”). Wells Fargo Bank acted in the transaction as the collecting bank and presenting bank, under collection instructions of the remitting bank, i.e. Brac Bank Limited (respondent No. 4). Brac Bank authorised Wells Fargo Bank to handle documents on a collection basis and to release documents to the importer upon receipt of Milestone's letter of undertaking to pay the collection amount in 90 days. Wells Fargo Bank duly carried out its obligations in such capacity and released the documents to the importer after receiving their signed letter of undertaking. But Wells Fargo Bank did not receive any payment from the importer. If the importer does not honour the letter of undertaking, Wells Fargo Bank does not have any obligation under the URC 522 to make any payment to the exporter (petitioner-company). If the petitioner-company were to recover any payment, they should initiate proceedings against Milestone. Wells Fargo Bank did not, and does not, have any contractual relationship with the petitioner-company, let alone an arbitration agreement.

It is stated that upon receipt of the so-called notice of arbitration dated 10.01.2018, Wells Fargo Bank issued a reply dated 10.02.2018 stating clearly that the said “notice of arbitration” would be disregarded by Wells Fargo Bank, inasmuch as there was no arbitration agreement between the parties. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mr. Syed Mohidul Kabir, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner-company, takes me through the e-Mail sent by the importer-company on 24.02.2017 and submits that this Court should construe this piece of e-Mail communication as a clear ‘proposal’ from the importer to give security of <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">this “Documentary Collection” and the remitting</span> Bank’s (the Brac Bank-respondent no. 4) letter dated 30.03.2017 and the commercial document dated 22.03.2017 issued by the advising Bank (Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited) are to be taken by this Court as the ‘acceptance’ to the importer’s proposal and the letter of undertaking given by the importer to the Wells Fargo Bank is the “consideration” and, that is how, a contract was established between the petitioner-company and the importer together with his Bank (Wells Fargo Bank).</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">He refers to Article 9 of the URC-522 and submits that since Wells Fargo Bank, as the collecting Bank, has given a maturity date in the Bill of Exchange under URC-522 as 90 days deferred payment and delivered the commercial documents to the importer, the collecting Bank is under an obligation to act in good faith and exercise reasonable care.

The Indian Supreme Court only recently took the view that the issue as to “existence of the arbitration agreement” can be examined by the Court.

There is a significant difference between 'an arbitration clause' and ‘a <u>valid</u> arbitration clause'. Following are the few instances to demonstrate when a clause may constitute ‘an arbitration agreement’, but not a ‘<u>valid</u> arbitration agreement’; (1) if there had been an arbitration clause but the parties by mutual consent relinquish,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>(2) if the parties agree on incorporating arbitration clause with specific term that the same will expire unless invoked within certain period and the parties do not invoke the clause within time, (3) if both the parties annul the agreement including arbitration clause, (4) if one of the parties forges arbitration agreement and the tribunal may determine the arbitration agreement, (5) if the parties incorporate arbitration agreement which is void or otherwise barred under section 23 of the Contract Act, (6) if the agreement itself is barred by law or otherwise immoral, the arbitration clause as such will not be a valid agreement since the valid arbitration agreement is a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">sine qua non</em> of a valid substantive agreement, (<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">7) t</span>here is arbitration clause but the dispute referred to is not wide enough to cover the arbitration clause, therefore, for a particular dispute, there may not be a valid arbitration agreement to cover the dispute, (8) there is arbitration agreement but both the parties went to Court and resolved the dispute through Court of law and the arbitration clause becomes redundant and ineffective, (9) there is arbitration clause to be resolved through by a named arbitrator only and he dies and thereby the arbitration clause comes to an end; and (10) there is arbitration agreement but one of the parties had incapacity to enter into a valid arbitration agreement, making the arbitration agreement non-est. </span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">31.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Thus, from the aforesaid examples, it is apparent that the terms “arbitration agreement' and <u>'valid</u> arbitration agreement’ are different expressions and terminologies.

Therefore, if the Court, while assuming the jurisdiction of the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> existence of an arbitration clause for the purpose of appointing an arbitrator, the same will not be in conflict with Section 17(a) of the Arbitration Act. Section 17 of our Arbitration Act is to be interpreted in the manner that the arbitral tribunal has the competence to rule on its own jurisdiction when such issues arise before it. This can happen when the parties have gone to the arbitral tribunal without recourse to Section 12 of the Arbitration Act. In other words, it would be incumbent upon the arbitral tribunal to determine the issue when the parties themselves constitute the tribunal without the Court's intervention.

Documentary Collection is subject to the Uniform Rules of Collection modelled by International Chamber of Commerce, Publication No. 522, which has been named ʻURC-522'. There are two types of Documentary Collection. (1) Documents against Payment (“D/P'), in which the Bank will release documents to the buyer upon his payment and (2) Documents against Acceptance ('D/A), by which the Bank will release documents to the buyer upon his acceptance of a Bill of Exchange that undertakes to pay at a determinable future date. The instant case is a case of Documents against Acceptance (D/A). In a ‘Documentary Collection’ transaction a number of parties are involved. They are (a) Seller/ Exporter: The seller/exporter is also known as the Drawer in a ‘Documentary Collection’. The seller/ exporter will ship the goods to the buyer based on the sale contract and submit documents to his banker with instructions for collecting payment; (b) Remitting Bank: The remitting Bank is the seller/ exporter's Bank. It will send the documents to the buyer's Bank with instruction for collecting payment. Upon receipt of payment from the buyer's Bank, the remitting Bank will credit the net proceeds to the seller/exporter's account; (c) Collecting/ Presenting Bank: The collecting/presenting Bank is the agent of the remitting Bank in the buyer's country. Its main function is to forward the documents and collection instruments to the buyer. The presenting Bank is the Bank that presents the documents to the buyer for payment or acceptance based on the collection instructions. Upon receipt of the payment from the buyer, the presenting Bank will pay the net proceeds to the collecting Bank, which will in turn pay the remitting Bank after deducting its own charges. A collecting Bank may also become the presenting Bank in the buyer's country; (d) Buyer/ Importer: The buyer/ importer is also known as the drawee in the “Documentary Collection”.

In a “Documentary Collection” under URC-522, it is now established that URC-522 does not create privity of contract between the principal/seller and the collecting Bank. As the collecting Bank is the agent of the remitting Bank, there is no privity of contract between him and the customer, i.e. the seller. This is based on the principle that there is normally no privity of contract between a principal and his sub-agent. Even if the remitting Bank engages a collecting Bank, which is specifically nominated by the customer and who is not one of the remitting Bank's usual correspondences, there is no privity of contract between the collecting Bank and the customer. The High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, Commercial Court, in the case of Grosvenor Casinos Limited v National Bank of Abu Dhabi, reported in 2 All ER (Comm) 112, held that URC-522 does not create privity of contract between the principal and the collecting Bank. To conclude the issue in a simpler version, all that I record here is that there being no ‘offer’ by the petitioner-company to Wells Fargo Bank, resultantly, there is no ‘acceptance’ from Wells Fargo Bank and, thus, there is no consideration and, therefore, it is crystal clear that there is no existence of any contract between the petitioner-company and the respondent no. 2.</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">39.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">I would, now, take up the third issue, namely, whether the legal notice sent by the petitioner’s lawyer to the collecting Bank and the reply thereto by the collecting Bank compose an implied form of arbitration agreement under the provisions of Section 9(2)(b)&amp;(c) of the Arbitration Act.</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 6pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">40.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It would be useful, if we look at the provisions of Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, which run as follows:</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 6pt 0.5in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">9.

Section 9(2) of the Arbitration Act provides, among others, that an arbitration agreement must be in writing and the agreement may be deemed to be in writing if it is contained in a contract signed by the parties or contained in written communication as elaborated in clauses (a) to (c) under Section 9(2) of the Arbitration Act. It further appears that Section 9(2)(b) of the Arbitration Act is not an alternative to Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act, but an explanation to determine whether an arbitration agreement is in writing or not. As per Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act, an arbitration agreement can be in the form of a clause in a contract or as a separate agreement. Section 9(2) of the Arbitration Act went further to explain that such agreement as mentioned in Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act should be in writing, in other words, oral agreement is not acceptable. In addition, Section 9(2) of the Arbitration Act also enlightens that an arbitration agreement will be considered as written if any of the conditions, laid down under it, is satisfied. </span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">42.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">For determining the existence of an arbitration agreement through Section 9(2)(b) of the Arbitration Act, the following conditions are to be satisfied: (1) the subject matter of agreement i.e. arbitration agreement shall be mentioned in a letter, telex, telegram, email, fax or any other medium and (2) the party on whom such agreement has been served shall agree to such communication. If the second condition as aforesaid is disregarded, and Section 9(2) of the Arbitration Act is found independent, then it would make arbitration obligatory only on the willingness of one party. </span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">43.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">For determining the existence of an arbitration agreement through Section 9(2)(c), the following conditions are to be satisfied: (1) the subject matter of agreement i.e. arbitration agreement shall be mentioned in an exchange of statement of claim or defence and (2) the agreement is alleged by one party, and not denied by the other.

Such an agreement can be in one document or can be gathered from several documents also. It can be gathered from correspondences consisting of letters, fax messages, telegrams or even telex messages. An arbitration agreement can also be constituted when the existence of the agreement is depicted in a statement of claim and defence and the existence of the contract is alleged by one party and not denied by the other. The arbitration clause may exist either in the circumstances by way of incorporating an arbitration agreement or in the situation as contemplated in Section 9 of the Arbitration Act. An arbitration agreement may be included by way of implied terms. For example, the agreement in World Cotton Association by way of implied term may incorporate an arbitration clause. Similarly, in documentary collection, if the parties by express term decide to include ICC Arbitration Rules in their contract, then the parties shall be bound by such term. In the instant case, from the documents on record, it appears that there is no implied term for any arbitration.</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">45.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">From the above discussions, it leads me to hold that in order to constitute an arbitration agreement, a written document must be present, which states or refers or demonstrates the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ad idem</em> intention of the parties to adopt a quasi judicial method, i.e., a private tribunal as to dispute resolution, whose decision shall be binding upon both the parties.</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">46.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">In<em> Thomson Press India Limited v N.C.T. of Delhi, </em>reported in<em> 1999 (1) Arb </em></span><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">LR</span></em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">421</em>, the Court decided that even though, an arbitration agreement does not necessarily have to include words like 'arbitrator' or 'arbitration', the words used for the purpose must be words of choice and determination to go to arbitration. </span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">47.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">In Jagdish Chander v Ramesh Chander (2007) 5 SCC 719, the Court decided </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">that the essential elements of an arbitration agreement are, (i) the agreement should be in writing; (ii) the parties should have agreed to refer any dispute between them to the decision of a private tribunal; (iii) the private tribunal should be empowered to adjudicate upon the disputes in an impartial manner and (iv) the parties should have agreed that the decision of the private tribunal in respect of the disputes shall be binding upon them.

In other words, from the communications dated 05.10.2017 and 14.11.2017 between the petitioner and the respondent no. 2, there seems to have no indication or reference to any expression of either party to a pre-meditated consensus to refer any potential dispute to an arbitrator for dispute resolution and hence, while considering whether there exists an arbitration agreement between the parties under reference, the communications dated 14.11.2017 and 05.10.2017 do not attract Section 9(2)(b) &amp; (c) of the Arbitration Act. By merely raising a dispute, an arbitration does not come into play as a matter of course. Thus, I find that the petitioner's legal notice dated 05.10.2017 to the respondent no. 2, and the reply dated 14.11.2017 to the legal notice do not attract Section 9(2)(b) and (c) of Arbitration Act. Section 9(2)(b) and (c) of Arbitration Act would have applied only if the aforesaid legal notice by the petitioner and the reply by the respondent no. 2 contained an agreement, i.e. meeting of the minds, to refer disputes between these parties to arbitration. The reply dated 14.11.2017 issued by the respondent no. 2 does not contain indication whatsoever that the respondent no. 2 was willing to refer the dispute to arbitration. To the contrary, the respondent no. 2 clearly stated that if the petitioner was to pursue any legal action against the respondent no. 2, the only proper forum would be USA Courts. Thus, there was no arbitration agreement between the petitioner-company and Wells Fargo Bank, even through written correspondence. By no stretch of imagination, thus, it can be said that there exists any arbitration agreement between the petitioner-company and Wells Fargo Bank under Sections 9(2) &amp;(3) of the Arbitration Act. However, since Coreattire Fashion (respondent no. 6) through its reply letter dated 04.02.2018 (Annexure H) made the statement <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“My client proposes to appoint one arbitrator for my aforesaid client himself</em>” (at paragraph 6), this scenario satisfies all the conditions under Section 9(2)(b) of the Arbitration Act, for, the above-quoted statement amounts to a consent to settle the dispute through arbitration. </span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">49.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">Now, let me deal with the issue no. 4, namely, if the arbitral tribunal is not formed by appointing an arbitrator, whether the petitioner-company is going to be non-suited or remains remediless. </span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">50.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">There is no scope under the Arbitration Act to refer a dispute to arbitration only on the ground of financial hardship or any other inconvenience of a party, as has been pleaded in this case that since the petitioner is a Bangladeshi party and the counterparty to the dispute is a resident in USA, it would not be feasible to contest the suit in the USA Court given the value of the subject-matter of arbitration is trivial. The basis for appointing an arbitrator is the existence of an arbitration agreement, and not the supposed inconvenience of a particular party. If it is possible to appoint an arbitrator without the existence of an arbitration agreement, any and all parties can apply to the Court for appointment of arbitrators by pleading inconvenience in pursuing the relevant remedy under the applicable law. This would make arbitration agreements, which are foundations of all arbitrations and the law of arbitration, entirely redundant. If this Court takes a view that a party may maintain an application under Section 12 of the Arbitration Act even in the absence of a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> arbitration agreement on the ground of inconvenience, the whole scheme of the Arbitration Act would become frustrated and a floodgate would open allowing a party to any civil dispute to apply to Court for constitution of an arbitral tribunal.

The plaint in such event has to disclose a valid cause of action to maintain the suit in Bangladesh. If the Bangladeshi party can establish that the cause of action arose wholly or in part in Bangladesh, a Court in Bangladesh may also exercise jurisdiction over such dispute (Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908). The difficulty lying here may be that there is no reciprocity of enforcement of Judgment between USA and Bangladesh. Therefore, even if a verdict is obtained in Bangladesh, the same cannot be enforced in USA. However, the verdict of Bangladeshi civil Court may be enforced, in a roundabout manner, with the assistance of Bangladesh Bank and other scheduled Banks. For example, if the petitioner-company somehow comes to know that the importer or the Wells Fargo Bank has any money in any Bank in Bangladesh or has stored any goods anywhere in Bangladesh, it may seek to attach the same by the order of the Court. <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">My considered view, thus, is that since the petitioner-company is free to sue the respondent no. 2 (Wells Fargo Bank) and respondent no. 1 (importer) either in the competent Court of USA or in Bangladeshi civil Court and, further, since the petitioner-company can commence arbitration in Bangladesh any time with the importer (respondent no. 1), the petitioner-company is not going to be either non-suited or remain remediless.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">52.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The last issue to be dealt with by this Court is whether the collecting Bank is under any obligation to recover money from the drawee (Importer). In case of a transaction through letter of credit ("L/C"), an issuing Bank (the buyer's or importer's Bank) unconditionally guarantees to pay the seller's Bank when the shipping documents, as listed in the L/C, are presented in an acceptable condition. However, in a ‘Documentary Collection’ arrangement (“D/A"), as per Article 16 of the URC-522, the collecting Bank is responsible to make payment only if it has collected payment from the buyer. It has no independent obligation to make payment, if the buyer has not made payment of the agreed amount to the collecting Bank. URC-522 clearly sets out the respective obligations of the parties, and does not contain any provision requiring the collecting Bank to make any payment if it has not received the amount concerned from the buyer. Thus, the difference between an L/C transaction and D/A transaction is that in the former case the buyer's Bank guarantees to the L/C beneficiary Bank (i.e. exporter's Bank) that it would make payment on receipt of compliant shipping documents, whereas in the latter case the buyer's Bank does not provide any such independent guarantee/undertaking. </span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">53.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In this case, the collecting Bank had engaged in a ‘Documentary Collection’ with an obligation to send the money to the remitting Bank, only when the importer will make payment under D/A. Under the provisions of ‘URC-522', the collecting Bank is under no obligation to take any collateral security towards securing the deferred payment (D/A) at the time of releasing the documents to the drawee, unless the collecting Bank is otherwise instructed by the drawer. URC-522 does not impose any obligation upon the collecting Bank to obtain collaterals from the drawee; it merely obliges the collecting Bank to comply with the collection instructions provided by the drawer. In order to protect its interest, the collecting Bank, sometimes, becomes tempted to release the documents under a trust receipt. Under such a document a genuine trust is constituted, the drawee being the trustee, the collecting Bank being the beneficiary and the proceeds of sale of the goods collected by the drawee being the trust property. In other words, the collecting Bank may enter into any arrangement with the drawee for securing the collecting Bank's interest; so long such arrangements do not contravene the collection instructions by the drawer or the remitting Bank. </span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">54.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">In this case, the collecting Bank had received instructions from the remitting Bank merely to pass the documents onto the importer upon taking an undertaking from the importer that the latter shall pay within 90 days and, accordingly, the collecting Bank has performed its duties. Whether the collecting Bank has acted in good faith and has exercised reasonable care in dealing with the petitioner-company’s ‘Documentary Collection’, as per the provisions of Article 9 of the URC-522, or it has violated any provisions of Unified Commercial Code (UCC), which has been termed by the learned Advocate for the petitioner-company to be a law of the USA, -is a question of fact to be examined by the Court, in absence of any arbitral tribunal which could not be constituted due to non-incorporation of an arbitration clause in the correspondences of “Documentary Collection”. Now-a-days, many of the remitting Banks inscribe the provisions of arbitration in the L/C and Documentary Collection. It has become a frequent custom to incorporate the provision of arbitration in dealing with Documentary Collection, more particularly in dealing with transactions relating to Documents by Acceptance (D/A). Since the practice of “Documentary Collection” is highly specialized and often counter-intuitive to the general commercial lawyer, the judicial process has not generally afforded speedy, final and sound relief desired by the parties to a dispute under Documentary Collection. To resolve this predicament, International Centre for Letter of Credit Arbitration INC was founded in 1996, which is located in Washington DC, USA. This Centre has established a set of rules, namely, ICLOCA Rules of Arbitration. These rules are modelled to assist in the resolution of disputes arising out of international banking operations, including Letters of Credit, Confirmations or Advices, Documentary Collections, Funds Transfers etc. The interested parties of the transactions may refer the dispute under ICLOCA Rules by inserting a clause into the undertaking or agreement providing that all future disputes, arising out, or in connection to the agreement be subjected to the Centre for Resolution under those Rules. There are two circumstances in which a dispute might be referred to arbitration under ICLOCA Rules and administered by the centre: (i) a clause may be inserted into the undertaking or agreement providing that all future dispute arising out of, in connection with or relating to, that undertaking or agreement be submitted to the centre for resolution under these rules, (ii) an existing dispute may also be referred to the centre for resolution by agreement of the parties, even if there was no advance agreement to arbitration. </span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">55.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">There are different models of law governing the contractual relationship between the parties.

He has particularly emphasized on the Preamble of Arbitration Act, 2001 in an expectation to pursue this Court that the scheme and object of repealing the old law of arbitration and enacting the new Arbitration Act in 2001 is to facilitate arbitration for any ‘international commercial dispute’ to be held in Bangladesh. In order to address the above submissions, it would be pertinent to briefly know about the history of arbitration in our jurisdiction. In this part of the world (sub-continent), the concept of arbitration is known to the people from time immemorial. In good old days, disputes between private individuals used to be placed before ‘Panchas’ and ‘Panchayats’. Likewise, commercial matters were decided by ‘Mahajans’ and ‘Chambers’. Formal arbitration proceedings, however, had come into existence after the Britishers started commercial activities in India. The provisions relating to arbitration were found in the Code of Civil <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">Procedure, 1859 (CPC) and, then, in subsequent</span> CPCs. A full-fledged law pertaining to arbitration in India was the Arbitration Act, 1899. A consolidated and amended law relating to arbitration was passed in 1940, known as the Arbitration Act, 1940. <span style="color: black;">Protracted, time-consuming, atrociously expensive and complex Court-procedures impelled the commercial world to an alternative, less formal, more effective and speedy mode of resolution of disputes by a Judge of choice of the parties which culminated into passing of an Arbitration Act. Experience, however, belied expectations. Proceedings became highly technical and thoroughly complicated. The provisions of the Act made 'lawyers laugh and litigants weep'. Representations were made from all quarters of the society to amend the law by making it more responsive to contemporary requirements. Moreover, apart from arbitration, conciliation has been getting momentum and worldwide recognition as an effective instrument of settlement of disputes. There was no composite statute dealing with all matters relating to arbitration and conciliation. The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) adopted a Model Law in 1985 on International Commercial Arbitration. The General Assembly of the United Nations recommended its member-States to give due consideration to the Model Law to have uniformity in arbitration procedure which resulted in passing of the Arbitration Act, 2001. The Act is almost a complete Code in itself and consolidates and amends the law relating to domestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration and enforcement of <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">foreign arbitral awards. The Preamble expressly</span> refers to International Commercial Arbitration.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">60.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Thus, with the passage of time, the customs and laws relating to arbitration of disputes have achieved the status of the finest law of our jurisdiction, as now it contains both procedural and substantive laws. It has clearly now categorized the provisions for local arbitration and the international arbitration. The latest position of the laws relating to arbitration of all the countries of the world is, which has now become an inviolable law, like Veda’s statement, that there cannot be any arbitration without any arbitration agreement. I find the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner-company to be a desperate attempt to bring his case within the purview of arbitration agreement, although his agreements do not attract the Preamble, Section 2(c) and Section 9(2)(b) in any manner. Since, this Court finds that there is no existence of any arbitration agreement with the Well’s Fargo Bank, this application cannot succeed against it.
