The circumstances as evident appear to have been established beyond all doubt. Hence, Abu Taher and Alamgir cannot escape the guilt. On the other hand, accused Aminul did not accompany his two brothers in search of the victim and hence may get the benefit of doubt. In the case of accused <span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Aminul, his failure to pursue the victim in order to take revenge for his mother’s beating breaks the chain of circumstances, and he therefore cannot be convicted of the offence alleged.<span style="mso-tab-count: 2;">            </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">            </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 2;">                        </span>....(15)</span></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Penal Code, (XLV of 1860)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Sections 149, 302/35</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Per Muhammad Imman Ali, J. minority view:</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">The evidence on record does not indicate any assembly of persons and, therefore, the commission under section 149 of the Penal Code is not sustainable. However the injury found would certainly attract an offence under sections 302/35 of the Penal Code. Accordingly the appeal is allowed in part. Accused-appellant Aminul Hoque is found not guilty and is acquitted of the charge levelled against him. The impugned judgement and order in respect of appellant Aminul Hoque is set aside and he be set at liberty if not wanted in connection with any other case.

If those elements are satisfied, then only a conviction under section 149 of the Penal Code may be substantiated. Even in order to hold all the appellants vicariously liable for the offence committed it was the duty of the prosecution to establish that they were the members of unlawful assembly and they shared the common object of killing victim Rubi. In absence of evidence and findings as to common object of killing the victim the conviction of all the accused persons including the appellants, who are the members of a same family is, unsafe.<span style="mso-tab-count: 3;">                                </span>-- (30)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Penal Code, (XLV of 1860)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Section 149</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Per Hasan Foez Siddique, J. delivered the main Judgment, majority view:</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">To secure conviction with the aid of section 149 of the Penal Code an overt act on the part of a member of unlawful assembly is not necessarily required by participation with common object must be proved to the hilt which is absent in this case. When there as general allegation against a large number of person the court will hesitate to convict all of them on theory of constructive liability on vague evidence. Similarly, the individual liability of any of the accused person has not been proved in this case. Normally, this Division does not interfere with the concurrent findings of fact of the court below in the absence of very special circumstances or gross error of law committed by the High Court Division. But where circumstances show that the accused persons are entitled to get benefit of doubt it is duty of this court to step in and correct the erroneous decision of the High Court Division. In consideration of the evidence on record as discussed, we are of the view that all the convict appellants are entitled to get the benefit of doubt. In such view of the matter, the order of conviction and sentence of the appellants is liable to be set aside.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">           </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 3;">                                    </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">            </span>....

There is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between may be proved and must be or should proved. There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human provability the offence must have been done by the accused. The circumstances should be closely scrutinized and the same must be cogent, sufficient, reliable and must be of a such a character as to exclude all possibility of the accused being innocent and there should be no weak link, every weak link being a ground of reasonable suspicion, always calling from acquittal.

In the morning Rubi was not found in the room. On inquiry, the informant’s brother Tayab Ali (PW2) informed them that he had seen the dead body of Rubi hanging from a tree on the west side of his brother Israfil’s compound. The informant at once rushed to that place and found his daughter hanging from a Menda tree branch and her legs were touching the ground. He found injuries on her face, hands and legs and also found a few pieces of cloth inside her mouth. The police came and brought down Rubi’s dead body from the Menda tree and prepared inquest report on the spot. The informant stated in the First Information Report (FIR) that on his return home in the previous evening (16.07.1994), he had heard that his daughter had a quarrel with his brother Israfil’s sons and they had threatened to kill her.

When Rubi’s brother Bashar came home and said something, Israfil’s wife Khursheda, son Aminul, and Abu Taher’s wife (Shamsun Nahar) caught hold of Bashar. Tayab Ali (PW2) another brother of Israfil and of the informant intervened and stopped the quarrel. During the altercation, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">Rubi inflicted </span>a lathi <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">blow on Khursheda</span>. About an hour later accused Abu Taher and Alamgir, both sons of Israfil returned home and found out about the lathi blow upon their mother, who was crying. After hearing about the incident, Abu Taher and Alamgir went to Rubi’s living quarters and kicked on her door. They were turned away by Tayab Ali. The next morning Rubi’s dead body was found hanging from the Menda tree near the south side of Abu Taher’s house. The post-mortem report gave details of injuries visible near the mouth, cheek and front of the left and right leg as well as a circular, continuous ligature mark in the middle of the neck of the victim. The opinion given was that the death was caused by strangulation, which was ante-mortem and homicidal.</span></h4><h4 style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The trial court, upon consideration of all the evidence and materials on record convicted all six accused persons, namely Israfil, Abu Taher, Alamgir, Aminul, Khursheda and Shamsun Nahar under sections 302/149 of the Penal Code and sentenced them as stated above. The criminal appeal preferred by the convicted persons was dismissed by the High Court Division, thereby upholding the judgement of the trial court. The appellants then filed Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 344 of 2008 and obtained leave giving rise to this appeal. The grounds of appeal before this Division essentially are that there are no ingredients of an offence under sections 302/149 of the Penal Code by altering the charge from section 302/34 of the said Code, particularly since none of the prosecution witnesses spoke of any unlawful assembly. The other and more fundamental ground taken was that both the trial Court and the High Court Division found that there was no direct evidence, but proceeded to pass the judgement and order of conviction and sentence based solely on circumstantial evidence.</span></h4><h4 style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">There can be no gainsaying that conviction can be based on circumstantial evidence alone, otherwise criminals who commit crimes in the dead of night, where there are no eyewitnesses, would go scot-free, thus making a mockery of the criminal justice system. The effect would be anarchy in society. However, there are certain factors which are to be taken into account in adjudicating cases based on circumstantial evidence. These can be summarised as follows: (i) the circumstances must be fully established; (ii) the chain of circumstances must be complete as to be consistent with the guilt of the accused and preclude any notion that the accused may be innocent; (iii) the evidence must be such that it can safely be concluded that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused. In other words, the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty.</span></h4><h4 style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The case is one of a tragic death of a 17/18 year old girl in the prime of her life.

Clearly the action of the victim in dealing a lathi blow on Khursheda caused her to cry and complain when her sons arrived on the scene. The natural reaction of the two sons, namely Abu Taher and Alamgir being goaded by their father Israfil was to find Rubi and take revenge for the beating and humiliation suffered by their mother. We note that the other brother, namely Aminul did not accompany Abu Taher and Alamgir. The two brothers who went to seek revenge could not reach Rubi as she was behind closed doors. On finding Rubi’s door closed they kicked the door and broke the wooden latch </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: SutonnyMJ; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">(wLj)</span> <span lang="BN-BD" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;">of the door</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;"> and left the place being turned away by their another the paternal uncle, Tayab Ali.</span> <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> Between this failure to take revenge and the death of the victim being discovered at dawn, there were the few hours of darkness. Nothing intervened. There was no evidence that the victim came out of her house or that anyone else entered that house. In my view there is no break in the chain of events from the occurrence of the quarrel and discovery of victim’s dead body.</span></p><p class="Style1" style="line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="Style1" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo5; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">11.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="BN-BD" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;">The</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> occurrence took place</span><span lang="BN-BD" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;"> in the night that fo</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;">l</span><span lang="BN-BD" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;">lowed</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;"> after the quarrel and kicking and breaking the latch of the door</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">. Tayab Ali, brother of the informant and of the accused Israfil, is a neutral witness being paternal uncle of the victim Rubi and paternal uncle of accused Abu Taher, Alamgir and Aminul. No enmity was alleged between this witness and the accused. There is no reason to disbelieve his evidence. He deposed with regard to the circumstances of the quarrel between the victim and the mother of accused Abu Taher, Alamgir and Aminul, and the fact that Abu Taher and Alamgir pursued the victim to her living quarters and tried to kick open the locked door, and that the dead body was found at the break of dawn tied to a tree next to the house of Abu Taher. This clearly is a chain of events which cannot be disbelieved.</span></p><p class="Style1" style="line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="Style1" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo5; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">12.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">It is to be noted that the case was sent for hearing to the Metropolitan Sessions Judge, who framed charge against the</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> accuse-appellants under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and read over and explained to them to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Before pronouncement of judgement charge was altered and framed under sections 302/149 of the Penal Code which was again read over and explained to them to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Looking at the evidence as a whole, I do not find any cogent reason as to why the charge was altered. If at all, the injuries found on the body of the victim tend to suggest that the blows to the body of the victim were neither intended to nor done with the knowledge that they would cause death of the victim. On the contrary, the injuries appear to be incidental to the victim being gagged and dragged from her house. Gagging of the victim with pieces of cloth was done with the intention of preventing her from making any sound. That certainly did not cause her death. The cause of death was the fatal injury on the middle of her neck. This was caused by tightening the rope around the neck of the victim. </span></p><p class="Style1" style="line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="Style1" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo5;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">13.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">The defence case is that the accused persons are absolutely innocent and Rubi had committed suicide as she had not given marriage with someone she loved and they have been falsely implicated in the case. This clearly was negated by the fact that the victim had been gagged with a handful of cut piece cloth and her body was not in fact hanging from the tree, rather her feet were touching the ground. Moreover, in a case of suicide, the ligature mark would not be in the middle of the neck. No other hypothesis as to the innocence of the accused was put forward.</span></p><p class="Style1" style="line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="Style1" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo5;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">14.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">In a case where the only evidence is circumstantial, it is important that the prosecution establish the guilt of the accused by cogent and reliable evidence and the proved circumstances must unequivocally point to the guilt of the accused and must exclude any hypothesis inconsistent with the innocence of the accused. It is also important to see what motive the accused would have in committing the offence alleged. In the instant case the motive is clear. The victim struck Khursheda with a lathi and her sons being instigated by the words of their father went to take revenge. Clearly accused Abu Taher and Alamgir were most vengeful as they immediately went in search for the victim and where prevented only by the locked door and by their uncle Tayab Ali (PW2). No other intervening event took place between that time and the break of dawn which would explain the death of the victim. The dead body having been found adjacent to the house of accused Abu Taher, the inference is clear that he is complicit in the commission of the offence. The proximity of time between the quarrel, assault on Khursheda, the mother of accused Abu Taher and Alamgir, reaction of accused Abu Taher and Alamgir in searching for the victim from her living quarters and being prevented only due to the door being locked and the intervention by their uncle Tayeb Ali and the victim being strangulated to death in the dead hours of that night and absence of all the accused persons from their respective living quarters from early morning, in my view, establish the circumstances proving the guilt of accused Abu Taher and Alamgir. Since, evidently these two accused persons were most animated by the beating of their mother, their revengeful reaction speaks of their involvement in the offence alleged. </span></p><p class="Style1" style="line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="Style1" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo5;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">15.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">From the facts and circumstances discussed above it is clear that no link in the chain is missing and the circumstances clearly lead to the guilt of the accused and as such the same are incompatible with reasonable hypothesis of the innocence of the accused persons. The circumstances as evident appear to have been established beyond all doubt. Hence, Abu Taher and Alamgir cannot escape the guilt. On the other hand, accused Aminul did not accompany his two brothers in search of the victim and hence may get the benefit of doubt. In the case of accused Aminul, his failure to pursue the victim in order to take revenge for his mother’s beating breaks the chain of circumstances, and he therefore cannot be convicted of the offence alleged.</span></p><p class="Style1" style="line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="Style1" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo5;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">16.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">The evidence on record does not indicate any assembly of persons and, therefore, the commission under section 149 of the Penal Code is not sustainable.

In the morning of 17.07.1994, the informant’s wife did not find their daughter Rahima Khatun alias Rubi, aged about 17 years, in her bed room. Accordingly, they started searching. At that time, one Shahabuddin informed them that he had seen the dead body of victim Rubi hanging in a ‘menda’ tree situated at the western side of Israfil’s dwelling homestead. The informant rushed there and found his daughter’s deadbody hanging in a ‘menda’ tree. He found marks of injuries on her person and also found some pieces of cloths pushed in her mouth. He raised alarm. People of the area rushed there. They apprehended that the victim had been killed by someone.

He submits that the occurrence took place in a place which is only 50 yards far from the dwelling homestead of P.W.1 and that the prosecution case was that the victim was brought out from inside of her dwelling hut and, thereafter, was killed at the place of occurrence but neither her parents nor her uncle P.W.2 Tayeb Ali, brother and other inmates of the house heard any kind of sound, which is absurd.

Of them, P.W.1 is the father of the victim who, in his testimony, stated that in the night of occurrence he was sleeping in their dwelling hut. At the time of Fazar prayer, he woke up from sleep. His wife did not find victim Rubi in her bed room and the door of their dwelling hut was open. He started searching and, at that time, P.W.6 Shahabuddin informed him that he had seen the dead body of Rubi hanging in a ‘menda’ tree situated at the western side of the homestead of the accused Israfil. He rushed there and found his daughter hanging. He found marks of injuries on her person and some pieces of cloths inside her mouth. Getting information, police went to the place of occurrence and brought down the dead body of the victim from that ‘menda’ tree and held inquest of the deadbody. He put his signature in inquest report which is ext.1/1. He lodged the FIR ext.2 and his signature therein is ext.2/1. He proved the material exts.I, II and III sandal, sewing machine and a rope respectively. In his cross-examination, he stated that at the place of occurrence he found some marks of foot steps. He denied the defence suggestion that the deceased Rubi committed suicide as she was not given in marriage with a boy she loved. P.W.2 Tayeb Ali is the uncle of the appellants as well as the victim, who, in his testimony, stated that the victim Rubi had a quarrel with the mother of the accused-appellants in respect of ownership of a plate. He settled the dispute on the spot and, thereafter, went to have his meal. Subsequent thereafter, they again started quarreling. He saw that deceased Rubi dealt a bamboo stick blow on the person of the mother of appellants who started crying. At that time, Taher and Alamgir returned home. The people of the locality rushed there. P.W.2 assured the litigants that he would settle the matter. Next morning, hearing hue and cry of the P.W.1 and his wife, he rushed to the place of occurrence and found the dead body of Rubi hanging in a ‘Menda’ tree situated at the southern side of appellant Abu Taher’s house. He also found some pieces of cloth inside the mouth of the victim. Thereafter, police went to the place of occurrence and brought down the dead body of the deceased from the tree. He identified appellant Abu Taher, Israfil, Aminul, Khorsheda Begum and Samsunnahar in the dock. In cross-examination he denied the suggestion of the defence that Rubi was not murdered and she had committed suicide. P.W.3 Abul Bashar is the brother of the victim. He corroborated the testimonies of P.Ws.1 and 2 about the previous day quarrel which was taken place between Rubi and the appellant Khorsheda Begum in connection with the dispute over a plate and that Rubi, at one stage of quarrel, dealt a blow with a bamboo stick on the person of Khorsheda Begum. He also stated that Abu Taher, Alamgir and Shamsunnahar tried to break the door of their dwelling hut. Local people rushed there and prevented them. After that occurrence, P.W.3, out of fear, left their house and went to his father-in-law’s house with his wife and, on the next day, he heard that Rubi had been killed. He returned home and found the dead body of Rubi hanging in a ‘Menda’ tree. P.W.5 Md. Alimuddin Miah stated that he went to the place of occurrence and found deadbody of Rubi hanging in a tree. He also found some pieces of clothes inside the mouth of the deceased. He further stated that he heard about the previous day quarrel. P.W.7 Md. Farooq, Imam of the of local mosque, after offering Fajor prayer, knowing about occurrence, went to the place of occurrence and found the dead body of the victim hanging in a ‘Menda’ tree. P.Ws.4,6,8,9 and 13 were  tendered by the prosecution and the defence declined to cross-examine them. P.W.10 Md. Aminuddin stated that he assisted the police officer in holding inquest of the deadbody of the victim and sending the same to Sir Salimullah Medical College and Hospital, Dhaka for holding post mortem examination. He proved the Challan and his signature therein as Ext.4 and 4/1 respectively. Defence declined to cross-examine him. P.W.11 Mohiuddin, S.I. of police stated that on 17.07.1994, as Duty Officer, after receiving written FIR from the informant, registered the case. He filled up the FIR form. He proved the FIR and his signature as Ext.5 and 5/1 respectively. P.W.12 is a Police constable who stated that before preparing inquest report, the dead body of the victim was found hanging in a tree which was brought down by the police. P.W.14 S.I. Enamul Monowar is the first Investigating Officer of the case. He prepared seizure list, sketch map with Index and recovered some alamots. In his evidence, he stated that on 17.07.1994 pursuant to the direction of the Officer-in-Charge of Demra Police Station he went to the place of occurrence and found the dead body of the deceased hanging in a ‘Menda’ tree.

It was claimed by the prosecution that sewing machine, allegedly belonged to one of the family members of the appellants, was recovered from the dwelling hut of one Abul Hossen as per identification of one Shyama Begum but said Shyama was not examined.

The essential ingredients of section 149 are that there must be an unlawful assembly for commission of an offence by any member of the said unlawful assembly and such offence must have been committed in prosecution of the common object of the assembly; or must be such as the members of the assembly knew that the offence to be likely to be committed. If those elements are satisfied, then only a conviction under section 149 of the Penal Code may be substantiated. Even in order to hold all the appellants vicariously liable for the offence committed it was the duty of the prosecution to establish that they were the members of unlawful assembly and they shared the common object of killing victim Rubi. In absence of evidence and finding as to common object of killing the victim the conviction of all the accused persons including the appellants, who are the members of a same family, is unsafe.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">31<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">                 </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">We have already held that in this case there was no eye witness of the occurrence and the appellants were convicted solely on the basis of circumstantial evidence. </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">32<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">                 </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">In the case of Sharder Birdichand Sarda V.

As to prove the case, by circumstantial evidence, well settled principle is that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established and not ‘may be’ established. There is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between ‘may be proved’ and ‘must be or should be proved’. There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the offence must have been done by the accused. The circumstances should be closely scrutinized and the same must be cogent, succinct, reliable and must be of a such a character as to exclude all possibility of the accused being innocent and there should be no weak links, every weak link being a ground of reasonable suspicion, always calling for an acquittal. Great care must be taken in evaluating circumstantial evidence and if the evidence relied on is reasonably capable of two inferences, the one in favour of the accused must be accepted. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo4;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">34.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">            </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Keeping in mind the views expressed above, let us examine the evidence adduced by the prosecution in this regard. From the testimonies of P.W.1 and P.W.14 it appears that before lodging formal FIR at about 3.15 on 17.07.1994 the P.W.1 went to Demra Police Station and informed the police about the occurrence and pursuant to that information the Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station directed P.W.14 to visit to the place of occurrence and, accordingly, P.W.14 S.I. Enamul Monwar rushed to the place of occurrence at about 10.30 a.m. He prepared inquest report of the deadbody of the victim. From the evidence of P.W.3 Abul Bashar it appears that the accused persons absconded before lodging FIR.

P.W.1 did not suspect the convicts and he also did not disclose in the FIR that the accused persons absconded subsequent after the occurrence. Even in his evidence he did not say anything about the story of appellants’ alleged abscondence. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo4;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">35.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">            </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">It is well known that different persons are differently constituted, and that some accused persons, though innocent, deliberately abscond rather face the ordinal of a criminal case. Even an innocent man may feel panicky and try to evade arrest when wrongly suspected of a grave crime. Absconding by itself need not necessarily lead to an inference of culpable mind against all the absconders. Absconding by itself is not conclusive either of guilt of a guilty conscience because the person may abscond on account of fear of being involved in the offence or for any other allied reason. </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo4;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">36.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">            </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">In the case of Raghubir Singh V.

The courts below convicted the accused (1)Israfil, (2)Abu Taher, (3)Alamgir, (4)Aminul Haque (5)Khorshida Begum and C(6)Shamsun Naher assuming that all of them, forming unlawful assembly with a common object to kill the victim, went to the place of occurrence and had killed the victim but we do not find any evidence either circumstantial or direct. There is no answer to the question as to who went to the place of occurrance and what was their actual number? All the members of the same family have been convicted relying only on presumption, surmises and conjectures. It is the cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence that a case can be said to be proved only when there is certain and explicit evidence and no person can be convicted on pure on moral conviction. Another golden thread which runs through the web of the administration of justice in criminal cases is that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and other to his innocence, the view which favourable to the accused should be adopted. This principle has a special relevance in cases wherein the guilt of the accused is sought to be established by circumstantial evidence. On consideration of the evidence and the circumstances referred to above, we are satisfied that this is a case in which the circumstantial evidence did not prove the case against accused conclusively and unerringly, and at any rate two reasonable views are possible.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo4;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">38.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">            </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Moreover, in absence of prove of the ingredients of common object, the courts below committed error of law in convicting the appellants and others under sections 302/149 of the Penal Code.

Shahid Ali. The defendants are the President and Secretary of a Club namely ‘Friends Club’ and the defendants were the tenants under the landlord Shahid Ali. After the death of Shahid Ali his wife Firoza Begum and three sons namely, Md. Mirajul Islam, Md. Sirajul Islam, Md. Ferojul Islam and daughter Mst. Ifthesham Ali become the legal heirs of Md. Shahid Ali and the defendants were continuing their tenancy as monthly ejectable tenants under the aforesaid heirs of Shahid Ali. The monthly rent of the suit shop was fixed at Tk.1,000/- (one thousand). Subsequently, the plaintiff to the original suit purchased the land from the heirs of Shahid Ali by registered sub-kabala dated 20.11.2006 at a consideration of Tk.15,00,000/- (Fifteen lac). After purchasing the suit property while the defendants stopped in paying the rent in favour of the plaintiff, the plaintiff served a legal notice to the defendants to pay the rents in favour of her, on 02.03.2007, but the defendants did not pay the rent. Thereafter, the plaintiff served a notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, on 03.11.2009 and by this notice the plaintiff has terminated the tenancy with the defendants and asked the defendants to deliver vacant possession of the suit premises in favour of the plaintiff. The defendants received the notice by putting their signatures in the acknowledgment card on 08.11.2009. The further case of the plaintiff is such that the defendants out of ill-motive without payment of the rents to the plaintiff after filing a House Rent Control Case No.17 of 2007 depositing the rents to the court. The suit shop is badly required for the <em>bonafide</em> purpose of the plaintiff to construct a multistoried building thereon. During pendency of the original suit the defendants after making their appearance contested the suit by filing a written statement and at this stage the present opposite parties No.3-7 filed an application for addition of party under Order I rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, alleging that the suit shop is the ancestral property of the applicant’s predecessor Wahida Begum, who was the sister of Md. Shahid Ali. Shahid Ali was possessing the property in <em>ejmali</em> with the predecessor of the applicants and thereafter died leaving behind three sons, one wife and one daughter. For getting a separate saham in the ejmali property, Wahida Begum filed a Partition Suit being No.192 of 2003 in the Court of learned Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Dinajpur, which is pending for disposal. The further case of the applicants is such that the sub-kabala deed of the plaintiff dated 20.11.2006 is illegal, inoperative and not binding upon the predecessor of the applicants Wahida Begum and challenging the said deed the successors of Wahida Begum i.e. the applicants filed an Other Class Suit No.105 of 2008 in the Court of learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Dinajpur, which is also pending for disposal. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The learned trial court by its order dated 15.07.2018 allowed the application for addition of party and being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned order the plaintiff as petitioner has preferred this civil revision under section 25 of the Small Cause Courts Act, 1887 and obtained the Rule with an interim order of stay.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">During hearing of the Rule, Mr. Probir Neogi, the learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the petitioner while Mr. A.H.M Mushfiqur Rahman, the learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the added defendant-opposite parties No.3-7.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the learned trial court in allowing the application for addition of party committed illegality. The learned Advocate further submits that the learned trial court failed to appreciate that the suit was filed by the owner of the suit premises for ejectment of tenants and the matter of adjudication in the instant suit is as to whether the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendants are landlord and tenants and as such the question of title to the suit premises is not relevant and not a matter of adjudication and as such the added defendants are not necessary parties or proper parties to the suit. The learned Advocate also submits that the decision cited by the learned trial court is not applicable in the instant suit due to distinguishable facts and feature of the case and the defendants after filing a rent control case have already recognized the plaintiff as owner to the suit premises, but the learned trial court in allowing the application for addition of party committed an error in law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. The learned Advocate in support of his submission referred some decisions of our Apex Court reported in 16 BLD(AD) 237, 1981 BLD (AD)128 and a decision of this Court reported in 56 DLR 53.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">As against the aforesaid submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioner, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the added opposite parties opposing the Rule controverted the argument advanced from the side of the petitioner and submits that, the learned trial Court during passing the impugned order dated 15.07.2018 in Small Causes Case No.01 of 2010 committed no illegality or irregularity. The learned Advocate further submits that the predecessor of the applicants is a co-sharer in the suit property with the vendor’s predecessor of the plaintiff Md. Shahid Ali. The learned court below rightly apprised the decision reported in 2 MLR(AD)357 and thereafter, allowed the application for addition of parties. The learned Advocate also submits that the opposite party’s predecessor-in-interest Wahida Begum was the full sister of Md. Shahid Ali and the suit property is the <em>ejmali</em> property of the co-sharers. In order to get a separate <em>saham</em> in the suit property the predecessor of the applicants, Wahida Begum filed a Partition Suit being No.192 of 2003 in the Court of learned Senior Assistant Judge, Dinajpur Sadar, which is awaiting for disposal. Furthermore, challenging the sub-kabala deed of the plaintiff from the heirs of Md. Shahid Ali, dated 14.02.1993 the predecessor of the applicant filed an Other Suit No.105 of 2008 in the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of learned Joint District Judge, Dinajpur, which is also pending for disposal and considering all these facts and circumstances the learned trial court committed no wrong in passing the impugned order dated 15.07.2018.

Shahid Ali , who was the owner of the suit premises by a registered sub-kabala dated 20.11.2006 at a consideration Tk.15,00,000/- (Fifteen lac). It was further contended by the plaintiff to the suit that the suit shops are very old and dilapidated, which can be broken at any time and since the defendants are defaulters in paying the rents, they are liable to be evicted from the suit premises and meanwhile the plaintiff served a notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 terminating the ‘landlord and <em>varatia’</em> relationship directing the defendant No.1 and 2 to handover the vacant possession of the suit premises. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">On perusal of the written statement, which is the pleadings of the defendant No.1 and 2, I find that the defendants are the tenants under Md.

The contention of the defendant No.1 and 2 as it appears from their written statement is such that the defendants are not habitual defaulter under the plaintiff and while the plaintiff denied to accept rent for the month of November and December, 2006 and January of 2007, the defendants under the ambit of Rent Control Ordinance depositing the rents regularly after filing of a Rent Control Case No.17 of 2007 and as such the defendants are not habitual defaulter and they cannot be evicted from the suit shops. It was further alleged by the contesting defendant No.1 and 2 that late Md. Shahid Ali was the owner of the suit premises and on the said premises there are some shops. On the roof of those shops after taking rent by an agreement dated 05.05.1992, the defendants have erected a Club namely Friends Club. It was further contended by the contesting defendants in their pleadings that they have paid rent at the rate of Tk.1,000/- (one thousand) per month in favour of Md. Shahid Ali according to ‘<em>varatia</em> agreement’ and after the death of Md. Shahid Ali, his successive owners also realized rent for the schedule premises at the rate of Tk.1,000/- (one thousand) per month.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In view of the papers, facts and circumstances of the case it is noticed that the plaintiff is a subsequent purchaser from the successive landlords, who are the legal heirs of the original landlord Md.

The defendant No. 1 (Jamuna Oil Company Ltd) contested the suit by filing written statement on 07.08.2002, denying the material allegations of the plaint, and making a counter-claim of Tk. 39,38,371.47 alleging short landing of its cargo by the plaintiff. The said Admiralty Suit No. 5 of 2002 was dismissed for default on 18.03.2010. By the Judgment and Order dated 10.03.2011, the counter-claim of the defendant No. 1 was decreed in favour of the defendant No. 1 and against the plaintiff for an amount of Tk. 39,38,371.47 and, against the said Judgment and Order, the plaintiff filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1819 of 2011, which was dismissed by the Hon’ble Appellate Division by its Judgment and Order dated 15.11.2015. Against the aforesaid Judgment dated 15.11.2015, the plaintiff filed Civil Review Petition No. 173 of 2016, which was pending before the Hon’ble Appellate Division at the time of filing the instant application and, subsequently, it has been dismissed for default (non-appearance) on 15.11.2018. Meanwhile, the defendant No. 1 as decree-holder filed the instant Execution Case No. 02 of 2013, and had the coastal tanker M.T. ASHA attached for sale through auction. The plaintiff filed an application on 23.10.2017 praying for stay of the auction-sale along with an account-payee cheque for an amount of Tk. 39,38,372/- equivalent to the decreetal amount. Upon hearing the application, this Court passed an Order dated 23.10.2017 staying the auction proceedings and, upon considering the ill health of the Managing Director of the plaintiff-company, allowed until 23.02.2018 for encashment of the said cheque, ordering that otherwise a proceeding shall be caused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881(shortly, NI Act). As the plaintiff was unable to arrange for encashment of the cheque, this Court by Order dated 27.02.2018 asked the plaintiff to show cause as to why a proceeding under the NI Act shall not be initiated against it, and further vacated the Order of stay on auction proceedings and directed the Marshall to take steps for auction-sale of the vessel. The auction notice was published on 10.03.2018, and the auction was held on 20.03.2018. On the day of the auction i.e. 20.03.2018, the auction-purchaser, Al-Haj Abul Kalam Azad (Babul), Proprietor M/s Padma Ship Recycling Industries, bid an amount of Tk. 1,05,70,700/-, which was the highest bid for the vessel, submitting a Pay Order of 10% of the bid-money as earnest money. Against the Order dated 20.03.2018 holding the auction, the plaintiff filed CMP No. 361 of 2018, along with a Bank Guarantee for the decreetal amount, and the Hon’ble Judge-in-Chambers was pleased to pass an Order dated 27.03.2018 staying the auction and directed for the Bank Guarantee to be kept with the Registrar General of the Supreme Court, where it remains till date unencashed. The ensuing Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 2573 of 2018, however, was dismissed by Order dated 07.08.2018. Thereafter, the auction-sale was confirmed by this Court’s Order dated 13.08.2018. Now, when an application by the auction-purchaser for a direction to deliver the vessel is pending before this Court, the plaintiff has come up with this application praying for recalling this Court’s above-mentioned Order dated 13.08.2018, upon depositing two separate Pay Orders, one for satisfaction of the decreetal amount and another in the name of the auction-purchaser as solatium.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The auction-purchaser is contesting this application by filing written objection contending, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">inter-alia</em>, that the Judgment-Debtor (plaintiff) having exhausted all the stages in the suit and, thereafter, again all the stages in the execution case, now has come up with this device with a malafide intention to abuse the process of this Court and simply attempting to harass this bonafide auction-purchaser. The auction held on 20.03.2018 was a continuation of the auction process that was initiated by publication of auction notices 1st time on 17.10.2017. The Judgment-Debtor, including his counsel in person, has made several representations or promises to this Court for paying off the decreetal amount, but ultimately it proved that the Judgment-Debtor persistently flouted with the Court proceedings and obtained unfair advantage to delay the process of execution. It is stated that the Judgment-Debtor obtained stay of the auction 1<sup>st</sup> time on 23.10.2017 by misleading this Court with a cheque for paying the decreetal amount, but the cheque was dishonored. The Judgment-Debtor also misled the Hon'ble Appellate Division by presenting a Bank Guarantee which was encashable after 6 (six) months and also presenting blank cheque instead of Pay Order as per the direction of the Court, which the Appellate Division refused to accept.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Mr. Mustafizur Rahman Khan, the learned Advocate appearing for the Judgment-Debtor contends that there has been serious illegalities in calling and holding the auction for selling the vessel inasmuch as the auction-sale was held on 20.03.2018, while the notice for such auction-sale was given only on 10.03.2018; that is to say, there was only 10 (ten) days between the notice and the auction. By taking me through Order 21 Rule 68 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), he submits that in the case of property of the kind described in the Proviso to Order 21 Rule 43 of the CPC, no sale in execution shall, without the consent in writing of the Judgment-Debtor, take place until after the expiration of at least 30 (thirty) days in the case of immovable property, and of at least 15 (fifteen) days in the case of movable property, calculated from the date on which the copy of the proclamation has been affixed on the Court-house of the Judge ordering the sale and the proclamation has to be in the form prescribed under Order 21 Rule 66 of the CPC. He submits that the Proviso of Order 21 Rule 43 of the CPC is inapplicable in the instant case in that the said provision concerns goods which are subject to speedy and natural decay or when the expense of keeping it in custody is likely to exceed its value. In an effort to elaborate his above submissions, he contends that in the instant case, the first proclamation that approximates the requirement of Order 21 Rule 66 of the CPC was not published until 10.03.2018 and, hence, the property intended to be sold being a movable property, the auction-sale ought not to have occurred until 25.03.2018. He submits that the requirement under Order 21 Rule 68 of the CPC is a substantive requirement of law, as opposed to a procedural one, in view of the provision of Order 21 Rule 69(3) of the CPC, which provides that every sale shall be stopped if, before the lot is knocked down, the debt and costs including the costs of the sale, are tendered to the officer conducting sale, or proof is given to his satisfaction that the amount of such debt and costs have been paid into Court which ordered the sale. According to Mr. Khan, Order 21 Rule 69(3) of the CPC gives an opportunity to the Judgment-Debtor to pay off the decreetal amount along with costs, even after the proclamation of sale of 15 (fifteen) days in case of a movable property, before any auction takes place, unless the Judgment-Debtor has consented to a shorter period under Order 21 Rule 68 of the CPC. He argues that since in the instant case, the plaintiff had never consented to a shorter period under Order 21 Rule 68 of the CPC, the auction suffers from an illegality for violating the said provisions of Order 21 Rule 68 of the CPC, which is to the prejudice of the rights to property of the plaintiff. Mr. Khan forcefully submits that this is a serious illegality, which cannot be regarded as a procedural irregularity within the terms of Order 21 Rule 78 of the CPC not vitiating the sale. In an effort to buttress up his argument on this issue, he refers to the case of Narayan Chandra Vs Manhar Mandal 43 DLR(AD) 152 and submits that on the ground of non-compliance of these provisions the Appellate Division set aside the auction-sale held in the afore-cited case. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">He, then, alleges that as per the plaintiff’s claim, the market value of the vessel is about 20 (twenty) crore, but the vessel has been sold in auction only at 1 (one) crore and odds.

But this information was not disclosed to the Hon’ble Presiding Judge of the Admiralty Court at the time of filing the application for confirmation of auction-sale on 13.08.2018.

He submits that it is now an obligation for the executing Court to deliver the moveable property to the auction-purchaser under Order 21 Rule 79 of the CPC. By referring to the case of Fariduddin Chowdhury Vs. Sylhet Gas Works Ltd 1995 BLT (AD) 168 and the case of Sonali Bank Vs.

He argues that if the confirmation of sale is set aside in the present case, it will tantamount to declaring the title of the auction-purchaser nugatory, thereby, extending and giving an unwarranted benevolence to the Judgment-Debtor. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">He submits that the auction-sale was conducted as per the law in compliance with Order 21 Rule 68 of the CPC.

He contends that, in this case, the Judgment-Debtor will not be able to show that it has sustained an injury owing to such irregularity, because the Judgment-Debtor has been avoiding to pay the decreetal amount in the last 6 (six) years by abusing the process of the Court. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">10.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Mr. Haque lastly submits that in view of the dubious conduct of the Judgment-Debtor in an effort to frustrate the execution of the decree, it is clear that he has not come in clean hands before this Court and, as such, he is not entitled to plea for equitable relief. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">11.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">One day the plaintiff (Judgment-Debtor) having appeared in person in the Court-room was telling so many stories by wailing and lamentation regarding this suit and prayed for not to dispose of the application summarily.

It is the settled law of this jurisdiction that once the auction-sale is confirmed by the executing Court upon being satisfied that the auction-purchaser has complied with the Directions and Orders issued/passed by the executing Court from time to time, including the payment of the consideration money within the stipulated time, then there is no scope for the executing Court to show any sympathy to the Judgment-Debtor even if the Judgment-Debtor pays full decreetal amount together with a further amount of solatium after confirmation of auction-sale. In this case, it is apparent that after confirmation of auction-sale the Judgment-Debtor (plaintiff), having managed the funds, has deposited a Pay Order of the decreetal amount together with a Pay Order for an amount of Tk. 4,59,500/- as solatium vide Pay Order No. 1002200/215 dated 03.02.2019, however, this Court is unable to exercise its discretion at this stage. While it is evident from the record that this suit was dealt with by his previous engaged lawyer in a very cavalier fashion, there is no provision in the law to help the plaintiff at the fag end of the execution of a lawful decree. This Court has taken note of the facts that (i) the original suit was dismissed for default, but the engaged lawyer of that time did not restore the suit within the prescribed time and consequently this plaintiff missed the chance to prove his case by adducing relevant witnesses before the trial Court<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>as to whether the Judgment-Debtor (plaintiff) was<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>responsible for the shortage of delivery or the Jamuna Oil Company (defendant) was liable for the said shortage and (ii) after the suit was dismissed for default, the plaintiff’s engaged lawyer again missed the chance to contest the counter-claim and eventually the original suit was decreed <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">exparte</em>.

An ‘Official Receiver’ is required to be always attached to the Company Bench and, in absence of such “attached Official Receiver”, the Government may appoint a person as the “Official Receiver” for the purpose of attaching the said person to this Court and the said “attached Official Receiver” having been appointed as the “Official Liquidator” shall assist this Court in dealing with the winding-up matters. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">   </span>.......(6)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Company Act (XVIII of 1994)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Sections 255, 256 and 264</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Other than the “Official Receiver”, this Court may appoint any person/s competent to assist this Court in dealing with the actions/steps required to be taken after passing the Order of winding up of a company towards its dissolution. Usually, this Court opts to appoint either an Advocate or a Chartered Accountant or any director/employee of the company-in-liquidation as the “Official Liquidator” of the company. It is for this Court to decide as to who shall be appointed as the “Official Liquidator” (whether Official Receiver or any other person), how many (one or more) OL should be appointed and how much remuneration they will be paid. Section 264 of the Companies Act provides that any Official Liquidator (be it Official Receiver or any other person) may appoint an Advocate for assisting him in appearing before this Court, subject to the sanction of this Court. When the “Official Receiver” (OR) is appointed as the “Official Liquidator” (OL), there would be only one OL; no Assistant Official Liquidator (AOL) or Additional Liquidator (Additional OL) would be appointed by this Court. However, the Official Receiver (OR) may seek approval of this Court to appoint an Advocate on his behalf so that the said Advocate can represent the ‘OR-turned-OL’ before this Court. An Advocate is granted permission by the Court to perform the functions of an Advocate before this Court. In other words, an Advocate is allowed to appear before this Court only for carrying out the Court-related works, for example, making submissions, filing affidavits, applications, reports etc. But s/he is not permitted to deal with the Bank accounts or any other administrative functions. The Bank account must be opened and operated by the ‘OR-turned-OL’ himself; not by the appointed Advocate. It follows that when the ‘OR’ is appointed as the ‘OL’, there is no provision for appointing more than one ‘OL’ except taking assistance of an Advocate to send him in this Court. When an Advocate or Chartered Accountant or any Director/employee of the liquidated-company is appointed as the ‘OL’, this Court may consider for appointment of more than one ‘OL’. If more than one ‘OL’ are appointed, they all would be regarded as the ‘OLs’ as there is no provision in the Companies Act to name them Assistant/Additional ‘OL’. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">         </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                                    </span>.....(11, 13, 14 and 15)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Company Act (XVIII of 1994)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Section 256<u></u></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">The provisions regarding remunerations are also very much clear as provided in Section 256(3) of the Companies Act and Rule 131 of the Companies Rules, 2009. The remuneration may be a fixed-amount or a percentage of the amount of assets left over/saved after payments of all dues &amp; debts. When the ‘OL’ is the ‘OR’, the question of payment of salary does not arise at all, for, s/he is a Government Officer and the Government would pay the salary as per her/his scale. If an Advocate is appointed to assist the ‘OR-turned-OL’, her/his fees may be paid either from the Government Exchequer or from the Bank account opened and maintained by the ‘OR-turned-OL’ for the liquidated-company. If the fees of the Advocate (legal representative of the ‘OR-turned-OL’) is paid from the account of the liquidated-company, then the amount paid as the fees of the appointed-Advocate, if any, and as the salaries of the employees, if recruited on contract basis for the purpose of taking care and looking after the properties of the liquidated company, the same shall be deducted from the Government commission to be paid into the Government Exchequer at the time of dissolution of the company. The Government would be entitled to get the commission only in the event when there will be money available in the Bank account of the OL after payment of all debts, bills and other dues. The maximum commission the Government may get from the residue is its 5%. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                                                           </span>.....(16)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Company Act (XVIII of 1994)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Sections 251 and 264</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Since the work-force of a more or less 20 (twenty) persons of this office (AGOT) is almost sitting idle, appointment of an ‘Attached Person in the Company Bench’ as provided in Section 251(1) of the Companies Act may make the officials/employees busy with the works, if this Court allocates sufficient cases to the said “Attached Person”. Presently, this Court is allocating most of the cases in favour of individual Advocates appointing them as the ‘OL’ on the prayer of the petitioners, for, the petitioners are aware of the present non-functional status of this office. When an “Attached Person to the Company Bench” would be appointed from the categories of the people illustrated hereinbefore in para (i), this Court unhesitatingly would appoint “The Attached Person” in all the winding up cases as the ‘OL’ and, consequently, the aforesaid work-force of 20 (twenty) persons would find themselves busy with works. If the Secretary, Ministry of law is desirous to continue to perform the duty of ‘Attached Person of the Company Bench’ (Official Receiver ‘OR’-for the purpose of Company Bench) under the provisions of Section 251(1) of the Companies Act, he is at liberty to do so and, in that event, either he himself would remain present in this Court regularly, at least once a day for an hour, or he may appoint any Advocate on his behalf. But the Bank account of the wound-up companies must be opened and operated by the Secretary, Ministry of Law as the ‘OL’ and, further, he is required to obtain sanction from this Court to appoint an Advocate on behalf of the ‘OL’ for each case separately, as per the provisions of Section 264 of the Companies Act. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                                                           </span>.....(18)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Dr. Sharif Bhuiyan with </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Mr. Tanim Hussain Shawon, Advocate</span></p><p align="right" class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: right;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. . .</span></em></strong> <strong><em><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">For the Petitioner</span></u></em></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">No one appears</span></p><p align="right" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: right;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">. . .</span></em></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> For the Respondent</span></u></em></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Mr. M.

In Section 249(3) of the Companies Act, it is provided that where the Court makes an order for the winding up of a company, it shall, except where a liquidator is appointed simultaneously, forthwith cause intimation thereof to be sent to the ‘Official Receiver’. Now, a question arises, as to who is the Official Receiver?

However, the Official Receiver (OR) may seek approval of this Court to appoint an Advocate on his behalf so that the said Advocate can represent the ‘OR-turned-OL’ before this Court. An Advocate is granted permission by the Court to perform the functions of an Advocate before this Court. In other words, an Advocate is allowed to appear before this Court only for carrying out the Court-related works, for example, making submissions, filing affidavits, applications, reports etc. But s/he is not permitted to deal with the Bank accounts or any other administrative functions. The Bank account must be opened and operated by the ‘OR-turned-OL’ himself; not by the appointed Advocate. It follows that when the ‘OR’ is appointed as the ‘OL’, there is no provision for appointing more than one ‘OL’ except taking assistance of an Advocate to send him in this Court. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">16.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">When an Advocate or Chartered Accountant or any Director/employee of the liquidated-company is appointed as the ‘OL’, this Court may consider for appointment of more than one ‘OL’.

The remuneration may be a fixed-amount or a percentage of the amount of assets left over/saved after payments of all dues &amp; debts. When the ‘OL’ is the ‘OR’, the question of payment of salary does not arise at all, for, s/he is a Government Officer and the Government would pay the salary as per her/his scale. If an Advocate is appointed to assist the ‘OR-turned-OL’, her/his fees may be paid either from the Government Exchequer or from the Bank account opened and maintained by the ‘OR-turned-OL’ for the liquidated-company. If the fees of the Advocate (legal representative of the ‘OR-turned-OL’) is paid from the account of the liquidated-company, then the amount paid as the fees of the appointed-Advocate, if any, and as the salaries of the employees, if recruited on contract basis for the purpose of taking care and looking after the properties of the liquidated company, the same shall be deducted from the Government commission to be paid into the Government Exchequer at the time of dissolution of the company.

The sanction of this Court for appointment of any legal representative should be sought for by the ‘OR’ separately for each case in which this Court would appoint the ‘OR’ as the ‘OL’. Under the provisions of Section 264 of the Companies Act, the ‘OR-turned-OL’ is statutorily required to obtain approval of this Court to engage an Advocate on his behalf and it is, then, for the ‘OR-turned-OL’ to pay the legal fees either from the Bank Account opened and run for the company-in-liquidation, for whom the Advocate’s service was sanctioned by this Court, or to pay from the National Exchequer upon arranging funds from the Ministry of Finance. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">19.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Following the above examination of the law, I consider it useful to make some observations and also to pass some directions upon the concerned authority to ease their respective tasks and duties. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">(i)<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                  </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">This Court has been informed that no ‘OR’ has been appointed under the Official Receivers Act, 1938. Under the circumstances, the Government, as per Section 251(1) of the Companies Act, is obliged to appoint, by publication in the Official Gazette, a person who shall remain attached to this Court. The Government may appoint any Judicial Officer or Advocate or a Chartered Accountant to perform the duty of the ‘OR’ who shall remain attached only to this Court and have an office room in the present office building of the ‘Official Receiver’. This Court is told that the Secretary of the Ministry of Law &amp; Justice has been performing the functions of the ‘OR’ for last many years. This Court takes the above information to be incorrect, for, ‘OR’ under the OR Act is a full-time Government civil post and there is no provision in the OR Act to depute a Government Officer in the post of ‘OR’ as in-charge. The scenario might be that the Government, by publication of Gazette Notification under Section 251(1) of the Companies Act, has appointed the Secretary, Ministry of law as the “attached person to the Company Bench”. Although no such Gazette has been produced by Mr. Moksadul Islam before this Court, I assume that the Secretary, Ministry of law, having been appointed as the “attached person to the Company Bench” through Gazette Notification, has been engaging Mr. Moksadul Islam as his legal representative. Since the Law Secretary remains overwhelmingly overburdened with the nationally important duties and assignments, it is very logical for him to appoint an Advocate on his behalf. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.3pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">(ii)<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">However, it would be a better course of action for the Government to appoint, by publication in the Gazette notification, a meritorious Judicial Officer from the District Judge/Additional District Judge level as ‘OR’ who will have the opportunity to prepare her/himself as the future Company-Judge.

It should be noted here that there is no legal basis for existence of such office given that “Enam Commission”; having been formed under a Martial Law Proclamation, has lost its legality and validity by the verdict of the Appellate Division passed in the Fifth Amendment Case. The net result is that currently there is neither any ‘Official Receiver’ nor any ‘Official Administrator’ nor any Official Trustee in the country. I am not interested in making any observation on whether the Government should take necessary steps to appoint an ‘Official Receiver’ and one or more ‘Deputy Official Receiver’ as per the mandate of Official Receivers Act, 1938. All that I wish to record here is that since the work-force of a more or less 20 (twenty) persons of this office (AGOT) is almost sitting idle, appointment of an ‘Attached Person in the Company Bench’ as provided in Section 251(1) of the Companies Act may make the officials/employees busy with the works, if this Court allocates sufficient cases to the said “Attached Person”. Presently, this Court is allocating most of the cases in favour of individual Advocates appointing them as the ‘OL’ on the prayer of the petitioners, for, the petitioners are aware of the present non-functional status of this office. When an “Attached Person to the Company Bench” would be appointed from the categories of the people illustrated hereinbefore in para (i), this Court unhesitatingly would appoint “The Attached Person” in all the winding up cases as the ‘OL’ and, consequently, the aforesaid work-force of 20 (twenty) persons would find themselves busy with works. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">(iv)<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">If the Secretary, Ministry of law is desirous to continue to perform the duty of ‘Attached Person of the Company Bench’ (Official Receiver ‘OR’-for the purpose of Company Bench) under the provisions of Section 251(1) of the Companies Act, he is at liberty to do so and, in that event, either he himself would remain present in this Court regularly, at least once a day for an hour, or he may appoint any Advocate on his behalf.

Given the fact that the Ministry of Law &amp; Justice is manned predominately by the Judicial Officers, this Court initially, after filing of this application on 13.05.2018, asked Md. Moksadul Islam to sit with the concerned officials of the aforesaid Ministry to resolve the issue. Probably, in October, 2018, Mr. Islam informed this Court that the Deputy Secretary (Admin) of the Ministry of Law &amp; Justice has opined that if this Court passes appropriate Order to pay off Mr. Islam’s salary, then, the Ministry will take necessary steps for payment of his salary. In the light of the fact that this Court cannot direct the Government to pay off Mr. Islam’s salary, this Court made some observation with regard to the remuneration of Mr. Islam as per the desire of the Law Ministry and Mr. Islam, in course of passing a Judicial Order in a different Company Matter. In the meanwhile, whenever Mr. Islam was appearing before this Court in other matters (which is quite significant in number) as the legal representative of the ‘OR-turned-OL’, Mr. Islam kept informing this Court that since he is not getting remuneration, it has become difficult for him to assist this Court and used to implore to find a permanent solution of this impasse. Again, on 08.04.2019, when Mr. Islam was asked by this Court to appear and assist in the Company Matter No. 105 of 2000, he informed this Court that he is present in the Court as per the Court’s verbal direction, but not to represent the Law Secretary. He goes on to state that he has met the Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice and had a long discussion for two hours but without any result. At this juncture, I told him that after consulting the issue with my brother-Judges, who previously served as the Law Secretary, an appropriate Order shall be passed on 23.05.2019 and directed Mr. Islam to keep trying to resolve the matter by placing the interpretation of the relevant legal provisions before the Hon’ble Law Minister and Law Secretary. Today, when the matter is taken up, I asked Mr. Islam as to whether he has shared the legal issues with the Hon’ble Law Minister and the Law Secretary with regard to regularization of his appointment in each of the Company cases as the ‘Legal Representative’ of the ‘Official Receiver’ upon appointing the ‘Official Receiver’ or, as the Legal Representative of the ‘Attached Person to the Company Bench’ if any one (the Law Secretary or any officer) has been so appointed by publication of the Gazette Notification. Mr. Islam, in reply thereto, beseeched this Court to pass a detailed Judgment on this issue upon framing some guidelines for the Ministry of law and Justice, so that all the concerned persons and authorities may be benefitted. It is under this circumstance that this Court carried out the above exercise.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">21.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">This Court, therefore, makes it clear that the aim of this exercise was to ease the works of the Law Ministry as well as the duty of this Court and I earnestly hope that the Ministry of Law and Justice would help this Court to resolve the dilemma it has been facing for decades.

Moksadul Islam, Bar-at-law, an Advocate of this Court, would no longer have to face the embarrassment which he has been enduring for long by this Court in answering the questions as to how and under what provisions of law his salary from this Court may be paid, as asked by this Court, whenever any new Judge is given the jurisdiction of the Company Bench.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">22.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">The Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice is directed to file an affidavit-of-compliance on or before 27<sup>th</sup> August, 2019 and the Registrar General of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh is directed to send this Order to the Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice so as to assist this Court towards expeditious resolution of the matter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">23.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Let the matter be posted in the daily cause list on 27.08.2019 under the column “For Order”.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 27.0pt; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 27.0pt; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Ed. </span></strong></p><div style="mso-element: footnote-list;"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><br clear="all"/><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><!--[endif]--><div id="ftn1" style="mso-element: footnote;"><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="file:///H:/Issue_November_19(2)/Issue%20__November__19(2)__Com.%20Mat.%20_43%20of%2007_M.%20Khurshid%20Alam%20Sarker,%20J.__4.doc#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1;" title=""><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Company Matter No. 43 of 2007</span></u></strong></a></p></div></div></div></div>

The company is engaged in running the business of hotel and resort, currently at only one spot, at Plot 492, Kolatoli, Marine Drive Road, Cox's Bazar, where a multistoried building had already been constructed with more than 100 (one hundred) studio apartments with facilities of a hotel and resort by Khettra Architects Limited, a Developer-company, in which the petitioner nos. 1 and 2 are the Managing Director and the Chairman respectively. The name of this iconic building was given ‘Neeshorgo’. While the landowner was owning 60% of the spaces/flats of the said iconic building and the Developer-company was owning 40% of its spaces/flats, they sold the bulk of their respective proportions to the present flat owners, and till now the landowner and the Developer-company own a considerable part of the ‘Neeshorgo’. The flat owners, which include the Managing Director and the Chairman of the Developer-company, of ‘Neeshorgo’ and members of their families purchased the shares of the company and as such all the shareholders of the company are either flat owners of the ‘Neeshorgo’ or their family-members.

He next submits that since the petitioners have raised disputed questions of fact, their adjudication requires taking oral evidence in a properly framed suit, and not in the present proceedings under Section 233 of the Companies Act and, therefore, the present application under Section 233 of the Companies Act is not maintainable. On this issue, he further submits that the cancellation of contracts with the company and execution of fresh agreements of the flats with the Enterprise by the flat owners in respect of management of the apartments are all matters of Civil Court to adjudicate upon. He next submits that the respondent nos. 2-6 did not violate Article 23 of the AoA of the company as they have not done anything which goes against the interest of the company, because the rent agreements of the flat owners have been terminated much earlier than the date when respondent nos. 2-6 entered into agreements with the flat owners and had the respondent nos. 2-6 not executed the rent agreements, the flat owners would have rented out their flats to third parties and as such the petitioners could not be removed from their position as Directors of the company. The learned Advocate for the respondent nos. 2-6 submits that the allegation brought against these respondents do not fall within the definition of gross misconduct and, therefore, they should not be debarred from performing the duty as the Directors of the company. He lastly submits that since all the flat owners of the ‘Neeshorgo’ have pulled themselves out of the company, the company is no more in existence and, on the other hand, since they have joined the Enterprise, it should be declared as a valid business. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Mr. Md.

This iconic plaza has been named ‘Neeshorgo’ by the Developer-company. The petitioners and all the respondents are the owners of the flats of the ‘Neeshorgo’. They have purchased their flats either from the land owner’s portion of 60% or from the Developer-company’s portion of 40% and, still now, the land owner and the Developer-company own some open spaces/flats, including the open space at first floor which is now being used as the restaurant (Marine Drive Restaurant), even after selling out the significant number of flats from their respective portions. The Managing Director and the Chairman of the Developer-company, eventually in the year 2016, came out with an idea that the flats and the restaurant may be rented out to a company with a view to getting the rents of the flats and restaurant without any hassle. Although it was possible to rent the flats to one company/individual, and the restaurant to a separate company/individual, they decided to manage all these assets by one company and, for the aforesaid purpose, most of the flat owners and owners of the restaurant-space at first floor (who are the Managing Director and Chairman of the Developer-company) formed a company having it incorporated as the ‘Neeshorgo Hotel and Resort Ltd’ on 27.01.2016. Thus, it appears to me that the company is not the owner of any flat or open space of this plaza named ‘Neeshorgo’. The company has simply taken lease/rent of the spaces/flats of this building. From the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Assocaition of the company, it transpires that the aim and object of the company is to run hotel and resort business, either by purchasing the flats, open space or by taking rent from the flat owners and building owners not only of this single premise (the Neeshorgo), but by purchasing and taking rent of other properties from all over Bangladesh and, simultaneously, to expand the business outside Bangladesh. In other words, the object of the company is not to keep its activities limited only within the periphery of a single spot at the Plot No. 492, Kolatoli, Marine Drive Road, Cox’s Bazar, but also to spread its business in some other suitable places of Bangladesh and abroad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">23.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Apparently, it was a noble initiative by the Managing Director and the Chairman of the Developer-company to show the flat owners a dream of making them the owners/shareholders of an incorporated company, in addition to getting rent of their respective flats and space and also to enjoy dividends, if the company flourishes. In other words, the flat owners who would become the shareholders of the company would hold two statuses, and financially they would be benefitted in two ways. Their first status is that they are the flat/space owners of the plaza named ‘Neeshorgo’ and their second status is that they are the owners of a company engaged in hotel and resort business named ‘Neeshorgo Hotel and Resort Ltd’. And, from the perspective of financial benefit, while on the one hand, they shall get rent of their respective flats/spaces from the company, on the other hand, if the company can make profit, they would get dividends. Thus, the flat owners of this edifice ‘Neeshorgo’ hold separate and distinct entity from having their entity as the shareholders of the company (Neeshogro Hotel and Resort Ltd). While the flat owners who have not become the shareholders of the company are free to rent out their flats either to the company or to any person or they themselves may live therein, similarly, the flat owners who have become the shareholders of the company are also at liberty to rent out their respective flats either to their company or to other person/company or they themselves may stay therein and if the shareholder-cum-flat owners rent out the flats to the company, they will get the rents for the flats like the other general flat owners. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">So, whether the flat owners would rent out their flats to the company or to the newly formed Partnership Firm or they themselves would manage their flats/space is a matter, out of the touch and reach of this Company Matter No. 295 of 2018. Therefore, the flat owners who are not the shareholders of the company, such as the respondent nos. 11-48, have nothing to do in these cases, and the petitioners rightly had not impleaded them as the respondents of this Company Matter. But, for the reason best known to them, they filed an application for addition of party in this Company Matter No. 295 of 2018. Although this Court was reluctant to allow their application for addition of party, however, on the persistent insistence of the learned Advocates for the respondent nos. 2-6 &amp; 11-48, they were added as the proper party; not as the necessary party. However, had the application for addition of party been strictly considered by this Court, their status would have been found to be one, which does not even come within the ambit of the proper party. But, since there was a direction by the Hon’ble Appellate Division upon this Court to give final verdicts on these two Company Matters (Company Matter No. 151 of 2019 and Company Matter No. 295 of 2019) on or before 09.05.2019, this Court considered it prudent not to create an opportunity for the respondents of the Company Matter No. 295 of 2019 to take the matter again before the Appellate Division against the Order of rejection of their application for addition of party towards squandering further time in disposing of two substantive Company Matters.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In the light of the position of the added respondent nos. 11-48 that, as the flat owners of this mega building, they are always at liberty either to live in their respective flats or to rent out to the company or to rent out to the newly formed Partneship Firm or to any other individual or proprietorship businesses or partnership business or company and, further, given the nature of their legal relationship with the petitioners, the issue as to whether they are still with the company or they have terminated their contracts with the company, or whether they are currently with the newly formed Partnership Firm, is not the subject matter of the present application under Section 233 of the Companies Act. Therefore, I do not find any issue to be framed and adjudicated upon by this Court for the respondent nos. 11-48.

The first ground is that no specific allegation has been brought by the petitioners against the respondents (the majority shareholders). In the light of the admitted fact that since the respondent nos. 2-6 &amp; 8-9 collectively are the majority shareholders, and since the respondent nos. 8 &amp; 9 as the Managing Director &amp; the Chairman and the respondent nos. 2-6 as the Directors of the company were not taking necessary steps for conducting the audit of the company, nor were they holding the AGM of the company, and since all of the respondent nos. 2-6 directly and the respondent nos. 8 &amp; 9 as abettors were blamed to have formed a parallel rival business, there is no scope for the respondents to say that no specific allegation has been brought against them. As per clause (a) of Section 233 (1) of the Companies Act, the petitioners are simply required to bring to the notice of this Court that <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">the affairs of the company are being conducted or the powers of the directors are being exercised in a manner prejudicial to one or more of its members or debenture </span>holders or in disregard of his or their interest.

In other words, while the petitioners have perfectly satisfied this Court about the requirement of Section 233(1)(a) of the Companies Act, the submissions of the learned Advocate for the respondent nos. 2-6 have no legs to stand upon and, accordingly, the same are repelled by the Court.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">31.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Although there are some other allegations of not running the affairs of the company in a beneficial manner (a) by not operating the Bank account with the signatures of the authorized Directors, (b) by running a parallel rivalry business at the same site, (c) by not signing the further agreements with the flat owners, (d) by not paying the rents to the flat owners regularly and so on, however, I would not go for examination of each of the aforesaid allegations, for, when the allegations of not conducting the audit and not holding the AGM are the admitted facts by all the respondents, and the allegation of commencing a new parallel business is also admitted by the respondent nos. 2-6, which sufficientty attracts the provisions of clause (a) of Section 233 (1) of the Companies Act, there is no need to deal with other factual issues by this Court. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">32.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The second ground of maintainability is that this Court is legally not empowered to adjudicate upon the factual issues involved in this case. There are two types of factual issues in any case, namely, admitted facts and disputed facts. When the facts contended by the plaintiff/petitioner are admitted by the defendants/respondents, question of taking any oral or documentary evidence becomes redundant. And, if any fact stated by the petitioner is disputed, not only by raising mere objection but also by attempting to substantiate the objection through credible written statements/affidavit and upon adducing the relevant document/paper, if any, in that scenario, the Courts are required to take oral evidence in an effort to discover and assess the truth. Now, the pertinent question that crops up for consideration is whether this Court is empowered to take oral evidence, if needed, for finding out the truth to arrive at the appropriate conclusion. In reply thereto, my humble understanding of the scheme of the Companies Act is that the Legislature intended to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>resolve all types of disputes or grievances arising out of the Companies Act expeditiously through a higher rank of Court i. e. either the District Court or the High Court Division, in a summary manner so as to help smoothly flourish the business and commerce without experiencing protracted, time-consuming and complex procedures which are required to be followed/observed/applied by the Civil Courts and, therefore, most of the Company Matters relating to/arising out of/in connection with the grievance of any members of the company or debenture holder of the company are tried/adjudicated upon without taking any oral evidence. However, it does not necessarily mean that the Company Court is not competent to dispose of a company case by taking oral evidance, because there is no provision within the four corners of the Companies Act prohibiting the Company Court to take oral evidence. Rather, the expressions employed in Section 233(3) of the Companies Act, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“If after hearing the parties present on the date……”,</em> implies that there may be petitioner witness/es (PW/s) or respondent witness/es (RW/s) or the Court witnesses/es (CW/s) if the facts and circumstances so warrant, inasmuch as this Court requires to form an opinion <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“If the Court is of the opinion”, </em>(the wordings of Section 233 (3) of the Companies Act) for passing necessary Order and/or Direction. Thus, I hold that since the Company Court is competent to frame any issue for trial, any complicated question of facts can be adjudicated upon by it through taking documentary and oral evidence towards passing an appropriate Order and Direction. Therefore, the ground taken by the learned Advocates for the respondents gets repelled. Even for the sake of argument if it is held, without being prejudiced, that the Company Court does not have the power to adjudicate upon the cases by taking oral evidence, in that event also, the ground taken by the learned Advocate for the respondents will not stand, for, the allegations of (i) not conducting the audit of the company, (ii) not holding the AGM of the company and (iii) running a rival business in the same building being admitted facts, there is no need of taking any oral evidence on these factual issues. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">33.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The last ground is that, since the issue as to whether valid contracts exist between the company and the flat owners can not be adjudicated upon here in this case, the petition under Section 233 of the Companies Act is not maintainable. This Court is fully in agreement with the above proposition. This Court’s clear opinion is that whether the respondent nos. 2-6 or 11-48 have got any contractual relationship with the company as the tenant and landlord, is a matter to be adjudicated upon by the Civil Court.

From a minute perusal of the entire provisions relating to Directors in the Companies Act, as enshrined in Sections 90 to 110, my humble understanding about the terminology “Director” is that a Director is a person who is elected by the majority members entrusting upon him/her day-to-day business activities and finances and, also, to ensure that all statutory filing obligations are met. Thus, the Directors of the company in true sense are the ‘trustees’ of the company as defined in the Black’s Law Dictionary. The shareholders /members of the company keep a trust upon the Directors that they shall do everything for the welfare and benefit of the company and its members and, therefore, there exists a fiduciary relationship between the Directors and others members of the company. Once this fiduciary relationship is broken, a Director must no longer hold the position of a Director of the company.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">38.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Having laid down the above dictum on the term “Director”, I need to see now whether the respondent nos. 2-6 have lost the trust of the shareholders (members) of the company resulting in breaking up the fiduciary relationship between them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">         </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">39.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It is an admitted fact that the respondent nos. 2-6 have created a Partnership Firm under the name and style of ‘Neeshorgo Management Enterprise’ which has been impleaded in this petition as respondent no.7. It is also an admitted position that the respondent nos. 2-6 while performing functions as the Directors of this company did not take any consent from the company to form another parallel business during the existence of this company. If the respondent nos. 2-6 were eager to run a separate business of the same nature at the same spot under the same roof, it was the duty of these Directors of this company to, at least, discuss the issue in the Board meeting, let alone taking approval from the Board of the company and, thereafter, they could have opted to undertake a separate business under the same roof. Anyone with ordinary prudence would be of the view that if a parallel business is run under the same roof by the Directors of the existing company, the interest of the company as well as its shareholders would inevitably be jeopardised. And, particularly when it is admitted by these respondents that due to providing a better service by their newly formed Enterprise, the flat owners of the plaza ‘Neeshorgo’ are becoming interested to sever their ties with the company, it is crystal clear to this Court that the activities of the respondent nos. 2-6 are crippling the business of the company and, hence, there is no reason for the members of the company to trust them any longer as the trustees (Directors) of the company. Therefore, this Court is of the view that the respondent nos. 2-6, having acted against the interest of the company as well as the interest of the shareholders of the company, are not competent to perform their duty as the Directors of the company. In augmenting my above conclusion, I find it pertinent to state that when the majority members of a cricket team lose faith in some players because of the latter’s involvment in “match fixing” to help win the opponent team, like the respondent nos. 2-6, they should not be in the team any longer. Likewise, when an ocean-going ship is drifting in the middle of the sea and, eventually upon finding another boat/ship, a few of crew members selfishly escape by boarding therein, they lose their right to remain as the crew member of the ship.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">40.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Now, a pertinent question may crop up as to under what provisions of law this Court is going to declare these Directors incompetent and expel them from the Board of Directors of the company. The answer thereto is that when the Court is of the opinion that the interest of the petitioner of a Section-233 application is being prejudicially affected, it may pass any Order it deems fit, as mandated by the Legislature in Section 233(3) of the Companies Act. Accordingly, in exercising the power vested in this Court under Section 233(3) of the Companies Act, this Court is well empowered to pass an Order decreeing that the respondent nos. 2-6 are hereby declared to be ‘disqualified’ or the offices of the respondent nos. 2-6 are hereby declared to have been ‘vacated’, but, for the reasons to be known hereinafter, I prefer not to use the legal terminologies ‘disqualified’ or ‘vacated’ in declaring them incompetent to be the members of the Board of the company.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">41.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However, because of not using the above-mentioned terminologies, there should not be any confusion that this Court can not declare any Director of the company to be ‘disqualified’ until a Director’s case falls within the ambit of Section 94 of the Companies Act or the office of a Director shall not be ‘vacated’ until a Director’s circumstance attracts the provisions of Section 108 of the Companies Act or a Director cannot be ‘removed’ without passing an extraordinary resolution under Section 106 of the Companies Act, inasmuch as the powers invested in the Court under Section 233(3) of the Companies Act is wider and superior than the power given to the Court by any other provisions of the Companies Act. By virtue of the power under Section 233(3) of the Companies Act, the Court is competent to order the company to conduct its audit, to appoint an Independent Auditor and to fix the remuneration of the Auditor, to direct the company for calling and holding any meeting (which may be Board meeting, EGM or AGM) and to make any necessary Order/Directions <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">‘to regulate the conduct of the company’s affairs’</em> (the expression engraved in Section 233(3)(b) of the Companies Act).

For this to happen, the declaration made by this Court hereinbefore as to becoming or remaining incompetent as the Directors of the company is temporarily kept in abeyance till the date of holding the first Board meeting of the company, in an expectation by this Court that the respondent nos. 2-6 upon attending the Board meeting of the company will inform the Board about the closure of their Enterprise.

From a plain perusal of the entire petition in tandem with its prayers, I find that the petitioners’ case is not at all directed at obtaining such a declaration.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">46.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Mr. AM Aminuddin, the learned Senior Counsel, has submitted that since the company does not run practically, there is no point of allowing the petitioners to operate the business of the company. On this issue, this Court’s view is that until and unless the company is dissolved through the process of winding up, there is no impediment for the company to carry out its business in full swing. The incident of opening up a new business by the influential Directors of the company or the whimsical decision of some landlords as to deserting the company or the financial stutus of the company as to not possessing any fund - can not lead this Court to go for a declaration that the company does no more exist, in this application under Section 233 of the Companies Act. So, this Court is neither going to declare the ‘Neeshorgo Management Enterprise’ as an illegal business nor going to declare that the company has lost its substratum necessitating its dissolution. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">47.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The above proposition, now, leads me to embark upon the issue as to whether this Court should make appopropriate Observations, Orders and Directions for this company, so that it may unhesitatingly go for its next course of actions, particularly, in the backdrop of keeping the existence of both these two business entities intact by this Court.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">48.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It is to be known, if it is already not known, that the Company Court acts as the ‘Ombudsman’ of the companies; meaning that normally the Company Court will not interfere with the internal affairs of the company, but if the situation demands, then the Court shall do the needful.

This is the scheme of enactment of Company Laws in most of the countries around the world. In other words, any action taken or omissions occured either by the member/s of the Board (such as, Director, Managing Director and Chairman) or by the agent/s of the company (such as, Company Secretary, General Manager, Accounts Officer and other Officers) in running/managing the affairs of the company, may be examined by this Court either <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">suo motu</em> or on receiving application.

It appears from the order passed by the Tribunal that representative of the assessee argued that the DCT as well as CT(A) was wrong in calculating manufacture of bricks without considering capacity of one section of brick field and payment of VAT on the gradation of brick manufacturing. So, findings of the Tribunal in one line that the assessee could not produce evidential documents to disprove finding of the taxing authority below is not tenable in law since under section 159(2) of the ordinance, Tribunal had the scope to call for particulars as it may require or cause further inquiry.

It reveals from the order that though notice was served upon the assessee but he did not attend. Presumably, the assessee could not contradict the report based on unilateral inquiry. A bare reading of section 120 of the Ordinance makes it clear that in exercising revisional jurisdiction the authority has to be satisfied on two Counts, i) the order of the Assessing Officer sought to be revised is erroneous; and (ii) it is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue. If one of the condition is absent i.e. if the order of the Income Tax Officer is erroneous but is not prejudicial to the revenue or if it is not erroneous but is prejudicial to the revenue ….. recourse is not under section 120 of the Act. There can be no doubt that the provision cannot be invoked to correct each and every type of mistake or error committed by the Assessing Officer. It is only when an order is erroneous that the Section will be attracted. An incorrect assumption of facts or an incorrect application of law will satisfy the requirement of the order being erroneous. In the same category fall orders passed without applying principle of natural justice or without application of mind. There must be some grievous error in the order passed by the income tax officer, which might set a bad trend or pattern for similar assessment, which on a broad reckoning, the revisional authority might think to be prejudicial to the interest of revenue administration. The scheme of the 0rdinance is to levy and collect tax in accordance with the provisions of the ordinance and this task is entrusted to the revenue. If due to an erroneous order of the income tax authority, the revenue is losing tax lawfully payable by a person, it will certainly be prejudicial to the interest of the revenue. (Ref- M/S.

However, despite repeated persuasions, the lender Bank did not extend any kind of co-operation whatsoever to the Borrower-Company. Besides, the lender Bank refrained from opening any L/C which caused a huge setback in continuing its regular business. Since the company’s business fully depends upon import from abroad/local market by way of opening the L/C, the stoppage of opening any new L/C facility by the lender Bank placed the business of the Borrower-Company in complete deadlock. Recently, time and again, the Borrower-Company vide its letters dated 14.02.2018, 13.03.2018, 28.03.2018, 23.04.2018, 16.05.2018, 27.06.2018, 23.07.2018 requested the lender Bank either to re-fix its liability waiving interest and allow 2(two) years’ time to repay the loan, or to reschedule the liability for adjustment purpose. At the same time, the Borrower-Company requested the lender Bank to sanction fresh working capital. In order to approve the said proposal, the Borrower-Company paid off Tk. 1.40 crore as down payment. Although the lender Bank on principle agreed to reschedule the liability of the Borrower-Company, nonetheless, without paying any heed to the business dilemma of the Borrower-Company, they put preconditions to pay additional Tk. 2.35 crore as down payment and to provide with additional security in the form of mortgage. In such situation, the Borrower-Company vide its letter dated 27.08.2018 requested the lender Bank to fix its liability as of 20.07.2018 and provide its Board approval as to the agreed rescheduling in order to facilitate the Borrower-Company to pay the balance down payment.

In such situation, the petitioner filed Writ Petition no. 13846 of 2018 in the High Court Division challenging the legality of the Memo no. BRPD(R-2)651/9(26)Ga/2018-6676 dated 10.09.2018 and hearing of the motion is yet to be concluded. However, the petitioner, after being advised that it was a misconceived application, has decided not to proceed with the aforesaid Writ Petition 13846 of 2018 and filed the instant application before the Company Bench.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">By filing two separate affidavits-in-opposition, the Bangladesh Bank (the respondent no.1) and the One Bank Ltd, the lender Bank (the respondent no. 4) are contesting this matter. Their common contentions are that the petitioner is the Managing Director and shareholder of the Borrower-Company, which borrowed money from the lender Bank through different credit facilities and also by furnishing various securities in favour of the lender Bank. But due to failure of regular payment of the loan money by the Borrower-Company, it accrued a huge amount of loan liability. In such a stagnant situation, the petitioner, in a meeting held on 09.07.2018 with the lender Bank, agreed to deposit Tk. 2.35 crore as down payment which is only 5% against the petitioner’s loan outstanding of 46.37 crore as on 30.06.2018 and accepting the said meeting as successful negotiation, the lender Bank issued letter dated 17.07.2018 requesting the petitioner to deposit the said down payment and to complete mortgage formalities of 38 decimals of land as agreed earlier. But the respondent no. 4 received only Tk. 0.45 crore through PO on 25.07.2018. In view of such situation, the lender Bank issued a letter under memo dated 31.07.2018 to the Borrower-Company represented by the Managing Director (petitioner) requesting him to deposit rest of the down payment of Tk. 2.54 crore at the earliest as per Bangladesh Bank requirement contained in Bangladesh Bank Rescheduling Guidelines, failing which the Bank would be constrained to take necessary legal action against the petitioner. But the petitioner did not take any positive step regarding payment of the said down payment and, under the circumstances, the Bangladesh Bank served the notice as per provision of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act upon the petitioner vide Memo No. BPRD(R-2)651/9(26) Ga/2018-6676 dated 10.09.2018 having enclosed the notice dated 16.08.2018 issued by the lender Bank. It is stated that the petitioner having received the said notice on 24.09.2018 issued an acknowledgment receipt which has been duly forwarded by the respondent no.6 (Mercantile Bank Ltd.) to the respondent no.1 through memo dated 25.09.2018.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Thereafter, the petitioner submitted his representation in writing to the respondent no. 1 on 09.10.2018 which was duly received by the respondent no. 1 on 09.10.2018. Having received the said representation of the petitioner, the Bangladesh Bank informed the lender Bank about the said reply and sought further clarification about the service of notice under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act. The lender Bank then under Memo dated 21.10.2018 furnished its explanation regarding service of notice under Section 17 of the said Act. Thereafter, the Bangladesh Bank gave its decision on 29.10.2018. Having received the said notice dated 29.10.2018 through Chittagong Central Jail Authority, the petitioner acknowledged receipt of the letter on 13.11.2018 and the said receipt has been forwarded by the Mercantile Bank under the memo dated 20.11.2018 to the Bangladesh Bank for taking necessary measures. Thereafter, the lender Bank issued the letter dated 22.11.2018 requesting Bangladesh Bank to take a decision commensurate with the notice served by the said Bank through Bangladesh Bank upon the petitioner as per law. Subsequently, Bangladesh Bank issued a letter under Memo dated 29.11.2018 upon the petitioner imitating that the post of the petitioner as a Director of the respondent no.6 stood vacated as per Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act with effect from 24.11.2018 and Section 17(5) of the Banking Companies Act shall come into effect to realize the dues of the lender Bank.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Mr. Shah Manjurul Haque, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner takes me through Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act and submits that the proceedings under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act being a recovery process, the petitioner should not be removed from the position of the Director of the Mercantile Bank. In an effort to substantiate his above count of submissions, he places Sections 3 &amp; 5 of the Artharin Adalat Ain, 2003 (henceforth would be referred to as the Artharin Ain) and submits that Section 3 of the Artharin Ain heralds that the provisions of the Artharin Ain shall prevail over any other law including the Banking Companies Act and Section 5 of the Artharin Ain provides that all recovery process for recovery of loan of any financial institution must be commenced through filing of the Artharin Suit in the Artharin Adalat established under the Artharin Ain and, as such, the lender Bank cannot commence recovery process under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act, instead of commencing recovery process under the Artharin Ain.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Mr. Haque then contends that evidently the proceeding is started centering around the loan taken by the Borrower-Company.

In other words, when a Director of any scheduled Bank either takes loan for himself or stands as a guarantor of another loanee, and if the loan remains unpaid despite issuance of notice by the Bangladesh Bank under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act, his/her directorship may be vacated without exhausting the formalities set out in sub-Sections (2) &amp; (3) of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">To put the provisions of Section 17(1)(b) of the Banking Companies Act more specifically, all that this Court records here are that after issuance of notice to the defaulter Bank-Director, who has stood as a guarantor of a Borrower-Company or for a third party, when the Bangladesh Bank asks the defaulter-Bank Director to pay the loan and if the loan is not paid within two months, then the office of the defaulter-Bank Director falls vacated. Although there is a provision in sub-Section (2) of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act to allow 30 days time to explain the Bank Director’s position, but the vacancy of the office of the Bank Director shall take place, after two months of receipt of the notice under Section 17(1) of the Banking Companies Act, whether or not the Bangladesh Bank timely deals with the application of the defaulter-Bank Director’s written representation filed under Section 17(2) of the Banking Companies Act.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">21.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">After being acquainted with the provisions of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act, I may now take up the first legal issue as framed by me hereinabove, namely, whether directorship/ office of the petitioner, who is a shareholder-cum-Director of a scheduled Bank and having stood as a guarantor of the Borrower-Company has failed to pay off the loan of the Borrower-Company, is liable to be vacated. Upon meticulously going through the annexures appended to the instant application and its affidavits-in-opposition, it transpires that after issuance of notice by the lender Bank through the Bangladesh Bank to the petitioner (who has placed himself as the guarantor for the loan taken by the Borrower-Company) for paying off the loan taken by the Borrower-Company (for whom the petitioner has stood as guarantor), the petitioner admittedly failed to pay off the Borrower-Company’s loan and, consequently, after two months of receipt of the aforesaid notice, the petitioner’s office of Director has fallen vacant. Although the petitioner made a written representation under sub-Section (2) of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act within time explaining his position, the petitioner’s explanation were found to be unsatisfactory by the lender Bank and the Bangladesh Bank (respondent nos. 1-4) and, accordingly, the Bangladesh Bank rejected the petitioner’s representation within the time stipulated in sub-Section (3) of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act. The decision given by the Bangladesh Bank being final, the law would obviously take its own course under Section 17(5) of the Banking Companies Act. It is to be noticed from the language employed in sub-Sections 1, 2 &amp; 3 of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act that vacancy of directorship occurs the moment any of the events enumerated in clauses (a) to (c) of sub-Section 1 of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act takes place, for, neither any of the sub-Sections of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act nor any other provisions of the Banking Companies Act seek to halt the proceedings under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act on the plea of filing a representation to the lender Bank or to the Bangladesh Bank or to any other authority.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">22.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">From a bare reading of the provisions of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act, it appears to me that the wordings and expressions of the law are so unambiguous that anyone with ordinary prudence would be able to understand the meaning of the provisions of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act and, therefore, the submissions advanced by the learned Advocate for the petitioner that the petitioner being not the loanee, that is to say that the petitioner being merely a guarantor of the loanee, his directorship in a scheduled Bank should not be taken away by invoking the provisions of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act, is completely misconceived. The laws herald very stoutly that a Director of any scheduled Bank whenever would be found to be either as the ‘defaulter loanee’ or as the ‘defaulter guarantor’, proceedings against the aforesaid Director under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act would be initiated.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">        </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">23.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Now, let me take up the second issue, namely, whether the respondent nos. 1-4 were competent to commence proceedings under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act without first going for recovery of the loan from the ‘Borrower-Company’ invoking the provision of the Artharin Ain. For adjudication upon this issue, I have read the Preamble and other relevant provisions of the Artharin Ain and, side by side, that of the Banking Companies Act and it appears to me that the scheme of these two statutes are distinct and, further, the provisions of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act and the provisions of Section 5 of the Artharin Ain provide completely different course of actions for the ‘defaulter loanee’ and ‘defaulter guarantor’. In other words, while the provisions of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act aims at vacating the directorship of a person of a scheduled Bank, Section 5 of the Artharin strategies about recovery of outstanding loan from the borrower, mortgagor and guarantor. Thus, the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner that without going for recovery of loan by invoking the provisions of the Artharin Ain from the Borrower-company at first, commencement of any proceedings under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act is not legal, appears to me to be completely without any substance.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">With the above findings of fact and examination of legal issues, this matter is liable to be dismissed with an exemplary costs of Tk. 10,00,000/- (ten lacs).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Before parting with this Judgment, I find it pertinent to record the reasoning for slapping a cost of Tk. 10,00,000/- in dismissing this matter. At the time of admission of this matter, this Court was not inclined to admit it making an observation in the open-Court that interpretations on Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act has been given by this Court on numerous occasions against the ‘defaulter loanee’ or the ‘defaulter guarantor’, and, therefore, there being no issue to be examined by this Court by admitting an application under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act, admission of this matter shall simply add a case to the huge backlog of works of this Court causing wastage of its invaluable working hours. Nevertheless, the learned Advocate for the petitioner was persistently insisting upon this Court by putting his best effort to pursue this Court that there are some nexus with the provisions of Artharin Ain and the provisions of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act and for examination of the aforesaid issue the matter should be admitted. Against the aforesaid backdrop, this Court admitted the matter with a verbal condition that the petitioner may be given an opportunity to place his case at length on the condition that upon hearing the learned Advocate for the petitioner, if this Court expresses its views against the petitioner, it shall be the duty for the petitioner not to proceed with this matter and shall non-prosecute the same at his own initiative and, further, if the learned Advocate finds any difficulty to non-prosecute this matter, at that event a cost Tk. 10,00,000/- (ten lacs) shall be slapped upon the petitioner.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">26.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">With the above preconditions this matter was admitted and the learned Advocate for the petitioner was allowed to make his submissions as lengthy as he wished and eventually when he was informed by this Court that this case is going to be dismissed with a cost of Tk. 10,00,000/- as this Court found no substance in the instant matter, the petitioner opted to receive a detailed Judgment. The petitioner’s above attitude amply suggests that he is adamant to squander further time of the Apex Court, even at the expense of paying an exemplary costs, wherefrom it transpires that the petitioner’s option of invocation of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act is nothing but clearly a deliberate step of abusing the process of this Court and, thus, this Court is of the view that the petitioner deserves to be slapped with an exemplanary cost.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">27.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">In the light of the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ratio</em> laid down hereinabove, I find no substance in the instant matter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">28.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">   </span>In the result, the Company Matter No. 342 of 2018 is dismissed with a cost of Tk. 10,00,000/- (ten lacs) to be paid by the petitioner in the national exchequer by way of submitting Treasury Challan within 30 (thirty) days.

The opposite party Nos. 1 and 2 Abdul Khaleque (died on 02.03.1987), Abdus Samad and one Nogendra Nath who were in possession of the suit land measuring 72 decimals. The said defendant entered into a contract with the plaintiff to sale the suit land at taka 350/- (Taka three hundred fifty) and out of which taka 325/- (Taka three hundred twenty five) was paid as baina money and a written bainapatra was executed on 27.07.1966. Since the vendor defendants were Hindu believers, they had to obtain a clearance certificate for registering a sale deed under the provisions of law which could not be obtained. However, the present defendant opposite parties delivered the possession of the suit land to the present plaintiff petitioners. Subsequently the said vendor defendants sold the suit land measuring 36 decimals evenafter knowing fully well about the aforementioned baina.

The said baina contains a condition for registration of a sale deed after obtaining a clearance certificate from the relevant authority as the vendors were Hindu believers.

After perusing the said documents, I found some inconsistencies in the document itself and also considering the deposition of the PWs and DWs, I found that the attesting witnesses of the said baina were illiterate villagers who use to execute documents by way of their left thump impression (L.T.I.), however, the said document contains their signatures which are inconsist and doubtful for execution of the document, therefore, any claim of execution of a sale deed pursuant to the said bainapatra the defendant opposite party Nos. 3-5 were not obliged to perform as per the said purported document. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">12.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Another most important aspect in his suit is that limitation period.

Under Section 145D of the SAT Act, the Land Survey Tribunal shall exercise the powers and procedure under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

If the person initiating the proceeding has a right to the land, then the person in whose favour the land was recorded, does not have a right to the land. If Land Survey Tribunal does not have the power to review the title deeds, just the way a competent Civil Court does in a suit for declaration of title, then Land Survey Tribunal cannot hold that a particular record of right is incorrect and direct the concerned authorities to correct the record of rights. To hold otherwise would be to negative the powers conferred by the SAT Act. .....(16)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Article 102</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">This Division is adjudicating over the instant matter in exercise of powers under Article 102 of the Constitution. This Division is not adjudicating the matter under any statutory power. While exercising the powers under Article 102 of the Constitution, High Court Division has certain restrictions/limitations. For instance, High Court Division cannot adjudicate factual disputes. However, when this Division exercises appellate power conferred by a statute, this Division presides as an appellate Court and in such cases, this Division is required to review all factual issues, disputed or otherwise. For instance, when this Division hears Customs Appeals under the Customs Act 1969, this Division can call for the records to review the authenticity of documents. However, when this Division hears writ petitions arising out of Customs Act 1969, this Division cannot exercise such powers. If the High Court Division is to act as an appellate Court, the statue must expressly provide; this is because appeals are statutory rights. In the instant case, the matter before this Division is not in the form of appeal. The SAT Act does not contain any provision which empowers the High Court Division to act as an appellate Court. The matter before this Division is in the form of writ petition. That being the position, we are of the view that in exercising the powers under Article 102 of the Constitution, this Division cannot automatically become an appellate Court and exercise all powers that can be exercised by an appellate Court. This Division must </span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman Bold',serif; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">adjudicate the matter under Article 102 of the Constitution and the adjudication process is subject to certain limitations. This Division, in writ petitions arising from the judgments passed by the Land Survey Tribunal, cannot deal with disputed questions of facts; this Division will adjudicate the matter to understand whether there has been any violation of law or whether there is an error on the face of the record. There are disputed questions of facts in the instant writ petition. Furthermore, there was finding of forgery by a competent Court. Such finding was certainly adverse to the petitioners’ position. This Division also takes the view that the judgment passed, impugned by the petitioners, was not legally erroneous. Accordingly, this Division takes the view that there is no merit in the Rule.</span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                                                </span>.....(20 and 21)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Mr. Tajul Islam Miajee, Advocate</span></p><p align="right" class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: right; line-height: 110%;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">. . .</span></em></strong> <strong><em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">for the Petitioners</span></em></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Mr. Md.

Khatian No. 15307, Plot No. 370 (“the Land”). The petitioners contend that the Land belongs to them. The petitioners provide elaborate details regarding the devolution of the Land in their favour. The record of right of the Land has been prepared in favour of the petitioners. The respondent Nos. 2-8 initiated a proceeding before the Land Survey Tribunal, Dhaka Metropolitan City for correction of the record of right. The Land Survey Tribunal, Dhaka Metropolitan City- respondent No.1 passed judgment and decree in favour of the writ respondent Nos. 2-8. The respondent Nos.2-8 tried to dispossess the petitioners from the Land after obtaining the judgment and decree from the respondent No.1. Being aggrieved, the petitioners moved this Division and obtained the instant Rule.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">The petitioners filed a Supplementary Affidavit annexing certain documents, which were not annexed to the writ petition.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Affidavit in Opposition was not filed.

However, when this Division exercises appellate power conferred by a statute, this Division presides as an appellate Court and in such cases, this Division is required to review all factual issues, disputed or otherwise.

Agrani Bank Ltd. and others reported in 14 BLD(AD) 197 this Division observed that the Artha Rin Adalat Ain is a special legislation providing for special measures to realise loans given by financial institutions. Section 5(4) of the Act gives Artha Rin Adalat the powers and jurisdiction of a Civil Court, but subject to the provisions of the Act itself. Section 5(5) of the Act makes the Code of Civil Procedure applicable to the proceedings of the Artha Rin Adalat but only if the Ain does not contain anything different. Identical view has been expressed by this Division in the Case of Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd. Vs. Alhaj Md. Shafiuddin Howlader and another reported in 20 BLD (AD) 162 stating that according to subsection (4) of Section (5) of the Ain the Artha Rin Adalat is a Civil Court having all the powers and jurisdiction under Civil Procedure Code, 1908, subject to the provision of the Ain. Sub- Section (5) of Section 5 thereof makes the provisions of the said Code applicable, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the conduct of proceedings in an Artha Rin Adalat. In the case of M/S. Antibiotic Stores and others Vs.

On 24.01.1980, the appellant took loan of tk.2,50,000/- from Pubali Bank Ltd. by mortgaging the said land. According to him, he repaid the entire loan amount and Pubali Bank Ltd. issued no objection certificate in his favour. He decided to take loan second time from Shilpa Bank. Thereafter, the Pubali Bank Ltd. filed Title Suit No.94 of 1992 against the father of the appellant and others for recovery of defaulted loan of a sum of tk.7,946/- and got decree on 17.09.1994 from the Artha Rin Adalat No.3, Dhaka. The bank put the said decree in execution in Title Execution Case No.46 of 1995 against the present appellant and others for realization of tk.20,358/-. Accordingly, the disputed property was attached and the Adalat fixed 28.08.1996 for holding auction. Four bidders participated in auction and highest offer was tk.22,05,000/-. The decree holder bank raised objection against the auction stating that the offer was shockingly low. The Adalat cancelled the auction. Thereafter, on 28.09.1996, that is, within one month from the date of cancellation of first auction, the said land was again put in auction and writ respondent No.3 Parveen Sultana offered tk.16,10,000/- which was accepted by the Adalat. She deposited 25% of the auction money. On 09.10.1996, auction purchaser Parveen Sultana filed an application before the Adalat for staying realization of balance auction money till disposal of the F.A. No.330 of 1994 pending in the High Court Division against the aforesaid decree passed in Artha Rin Suit No.94 of 1992 inasmuch as the High Court Division did not stay the execution of the said decree. The Adalat, by an order dated 20.10.1996, suspended the process of realization of the balance auction amount. Thereafter, on 29.04.2001, the Adalat vacated the order of suspension of realization of the balance auction money and proceeded with the execution case. Meanwhile, the record of execution case was called for by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.891 of 2001, which was finally discharged as not being pressed. On 10.11.2003, First Appeal No.330 of 1994 was dismissed by the High Court Division. On 08.01.2004, the auction purchaser deposited the balance auction amount along with poundage fees. The Adalat, accepting the balance money, confirmed the sale. Thereafter, the appellant, on 24.01.2004, filed application under section 57 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain praying for cancellation of the auction sale on the grounds that the auction purchaser failed to deposit the balance auction money within 15 days from the date of auction as required under Order XXI Rule 85 of the Code of Civil Procedure and that the auction was held fraudulently and at a shockingly low price. It was contended that at the relevant time, the price of the said land was more than tk.1,0000000/-(one crore). The Adalat, by its order dated 15.02.2004, rejected the said application of the appellant.

Since law provides that the balance amount of auction money should be deposited within 15 days from the date of holding auction, it was the statutory obligation of the auction purchaser respondent to deposit the same in time. Order XXI rule 86 of the Code provides the consequence of non depositing the balance auction amount within 15 days, which is, in such circumstances the Executing Court shall proceed for holding auction afresh.

On 23.12.1953, sale of the property was held and it was purchased by the auction purchaser applicant. On that day, he deposited 25 percent of the purchase money under Order XXI rule 84. The balance of the purchase money he had to deposit within fifteen days from the date of the sale, i.e. the deposit should have been made by 07.01.1954 at the latest, as required by rule 85 of Order XXI. On 06.1.1954, instead of depositing the money, the auction purchaser prayed for extension of time to deposit the money till 23.1.1954. The court extended the time only by ten days. On 15.01.1954, the remaining amount was deposited. On 23.01.1954, the sale was confirmed and the sale certificate was issued. On 29.01.1954, i.e. after the confirmation of the sale, an application was moved stating that since the money had not been deposited within the statutory period of fifteen days, as required under Order XXI rule 85 the sale should be set aside, and it was the application which gave rise to the application in revision. The executing court held that the sale was a nullity as 75 percent had not been deposited in time and, therefore, it set aside the sale and ordered resale of the property. Against that order, the auction purchaser went to Allahabad High Court. Allahabad High Court observed that “in a case where an auction purchaser fails to deposit the money within fifteen days, there is an imperative duty cast upon the executing court itself to set aside that sale and to order resale of the property”. Order XXI, rule 85 of the Code requires that the full amount of the purchase-money shall be paid by the auction purchaser into Court before the Court close on the 15th day from the sale of the property. Rule 86 also requires that in default of payment within the period mentioned in the last preceding rule, the deposit may, if the Court thinks fit after defraying the expenditure, be forfeited to the Government and the property shall be resold. When the default is made in depositing the balance of the amount as required by Rule 81, the Court ought to order the re-sale of the property.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">12.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Having examined the language of the relevant provisions and the decisions upon the subject, we are of the view that the provisions of the rules requiring the deposit of 25<strong>% </strong>of the purchase money immediate, on the person being declared as a purchaser and the payment of the balance within 15 days of the sale are mandatory and upon non-compliance with these provisions there is no sale at all. The rules do not contemplate that there can be any sale in favour of a purchaser without depositing 25<strong>% </strong>of the purchase money in the first instance and the balance within 15 days.

Agrani Bank Ltd. and others reported in 14 BLD(AD) 197 this Division observed that the Artha Rin Adalat Ain is a special legislation providing for special measures to realise loans given by financial institutions. Section 5(4) of the Act gives Artha Rin Adalat the powers and jurisdiction of a Civil Court, but subject to the provisions of the Act itself. Section 5(5) of the Act makes the Code of Civil Procedure applicable to the proceedings of the Artha Rin Adalat but only if the Ain does not contain anything different. Identical view has been expressed by this Division in the Case of Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd. Vs. Alhaj Md. Shafiuddin Howlader and another reported in 20 BLD (AD) 162 stating that according to subsection (4) of Section (5) of the Ain the Artha Rin Adalat is a Civil Court having all the powers and jurisdiction under Civil Procedure Code, 1908, subject to the provision of the Ain. Sub- Section (5) of Section 5 thereof makes the provisions of the said Code applicable, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the conduct of proceedings in an Artha Rin Adalat. In the case of M/S. Antibiotic Stores and others Vs. Subordinate Judge and Artha Rin Adalat reported in 8 MLR(AD) page 4 this Division again observed that under Section 5(4) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 1990, the Artha Rin Adalat is a Civil Court and subject to the provisions of the Ain, the Artha Rin Adalat have all the powers and jurisdictions under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">16.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Since the instant auction was held under Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 1990 which did not provide specific procedure to be followed for holding auction and as to time limit for payment of auction money, the Adalat followed the provision of the Code of Civil Procedure rightly.
