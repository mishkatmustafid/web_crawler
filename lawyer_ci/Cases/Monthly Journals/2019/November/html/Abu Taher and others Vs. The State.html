The circumstances as evident appear to have been established beyond all doubt. Hence, Abu Taher and Alamgir cannot escape the guilt. On the other hand, accused Aminul did not accompany his two brothers in search of the victim and hence may get the benefit of doubt. In the case of accused <span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Aminul, his failure to pursue the victim in order to take revenge for his mother’s beating breaks the chain of circumstances, and he therefore cannot be convicted of the offence alleged.<span style="mso-tab-count: 2;">            </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">            </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 2;">                        </span>....(15)</span></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Penal Code, (XLV of 1860)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Sections 149, 302/35</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Per Muhammad Imman Ali, J. minority view:</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">The evidence on record does not indicate any assembly of persons and, therefore, the commission under section 149 of the Penal Code is not sustainable. However the injury found would certainly attract an offence under sections 302/35 of the Penal Code. Accordingly the appeal is allowed in part. Accused-appellant Aminul Hoque is found not guilty and is acquitted of the charge levelled against him. The impugned judgement and order in respect of appellant Aminul Hoque is set aside and he be set at liberty if not wanted in connection with any other case.

If those elements are satisfied, then only a conviction under section 149 of the Penal Code may be substantiated. Even in order to hold all the appellants vicariously liable for the offence committed it was the duty of the prosecution to establish that they were the members of unlawful assembly and they shared the common object of killing victim Rubi. In absence of evidence and findings as to common object of killing the victim the conviction of all the accused persons including the appellants, who are the members of a same family is, unsafe.<span style="mso-tab-count: 3;">                                </span>-- (30)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Penal Code, (XLV of 1860)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Section 149</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Per Hasan Foez Siddique, J. delivered the main Judgment, majority view:</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">To secure conviction with the aid of section 149 of the Penal Code an overt act on the part of a member of unlawful assembly is not necessarily required by participation with common object must be proved to the hilt which is absent in this case. When there as general allegation against a large number of person the court will hesitate to convict all of them on theory of constructive liability on vague evidence. Similarly, the individual liability of any of the accused person has not been proved in this case. Normally, this Division does not interfere with the concurrent findings of fact of the court below in the absence of very special circumstances or gross error of law committed by the High Court Division. But where circumstances show that the accused persons are entitled to get benefit of doubt it is duty of this court to step in and correct the erroneous decision of the High Court Division. In consideration of the evidence on record as discussed, we are of the view that all the convict appellants are entitled to get the benefit of doubt. In such view of the matter, the order of conviction and sentence of the appellants is liable to be set aside.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">           </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 3;">                                    </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">            </span>....

There is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between may be proved and must be or should proved. There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human provability the offence must have been done by the accused. The circumstances should be closely scrutinized and the same must be cogent, sufficient, reliable and must be of a such a character as to exclude all possibility of the accused being innocent and there should be no weak link, every weak link being a ground of reasonable suspicion, always calling from acquittal.

In the morning Rubi was not found in the room. On inquiry, the informant’s brother Tayab Ali (PW2) informed them that he had seen the dead body of Rubi hanging from a tree on the west side of his brother Israfil’s compound. The informant at once rushed to that place and found his daughter hanging from a Menda tree branch and her legs were touching the ground. He found injuries on her face, hands and legs and also found a few pieces of cloth inside her mouth. The police came and brought down Rubi’s dead body from the Menda tree and prepared inquest report on the spot. The informant stated in the First Information Report (FIR) that on his return home in the previous evening (16.07.1994), he had heard that his daughter had a quarrel with his brother Israfil’s sons and they had threatened to kill her.

When Rubi’s brother Bashar came home and said something, Israfil’s wife Khursheda, son Aminul, and Abu Taher’s wife (Shamsun Nahar) caught hold of Bashar. Tayab Ali (PW2) another brother of Israfil and of the informant intervened and stopped the quarrel. During the altercation, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">Rubi inflicted </span>a lathi <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">blow on Khursheda</span>. About an hour later accused Abu Taher and Alamgir, both sons of Israfil returned home and found out about the lathi blow upon their mother, who was crying. After hearing about the incident, Abu Taher and Alamgir went to Rubi’s living quarters and kicked on her door. They were turned away by Tayab Ali. The next morning Rubi’s dead body was found hanging from the Menda tree near the south side of Abu Taher’s house. The post-mortem report gave details of injuries visible near the mouth, cheek and front of the left and right leg as well as a circular, continuous ligature mark in the middle of the neck of the victim. The opinion given was that the death was caused by strangulation, which was ante-mortem and homicidal.</span></h4><h4 style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The trial court, upon consideration of all the evidence and materials on record convicted all six accused persons, namely Israfil, Abu Taher, Alamgir, Aminul, Khursheda and Shamsun Nahar under sections 302/149 of the Penal Code and sentenced them as stated above. The criminal appeal preferred by the convicted persons was dismissed by the High Court Division, thereby upholding the judgement of the trial court. The appellants then filed Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 344 of 2008 and obtained leave giving rise to this appeal. The grounds of appeal before this Division essentially are that there are no ingredients of an offence under sections 302/149 of the Penal Code by altering the charge from section 302/34 of the said Code, particularly since none of the prosecution witnesses spoke of any unlawful assembly. The other and more fundamental ground taken was that both the trial Court and the High Court Division found that there was no direct evidence, but proceeded to pass the judgement and order of conviction and sentence based solely on circumstantial evidence.</span></h4><h4 style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">There can be no gainsaying that conviction can be based on circumstantial evidence alone, otherwise criminals who commit crimes in the dead of night, where there are no eyewitnesses, would go scot-free, thus making a mockery of the criminal justice system. The effect would be anarchy in society. However, there are certain factors which are to be taken into account in adjudicating cases based on circumstantial evidence. These can be summarised as follows: (i) the circumstances must be fully established; (ii) the chain of circumstances must be complete as to be consistent with the guilt of the accused and preclude any notion that the accused may be innocent; (iii) the evidence must be such that it can safely be concluded that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused. In other words, the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty.</span></h4><h4 style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The case is one of a tragic death of a 17/18 year old girl in the prime of her life.

Clearly the action of the victim in dealing a lathi blow on Khursheda caused her to cry and complain when her sons arrived on the scene. The natural reaction of the two sons, namely Abu Taher and Alamgir being goaded by their father Israfil was to find Rubi and take revenge for the beating and humiliation suffered by their mother. We note that the other brother, namely Aminul did not accompany Abu Taher and Alamgir. The two brothers who went to seek revenge could not reach Rubi as she was behind closed doors. On finding Rubi’s door closed they kicked the door and broke the wooden latch </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: SutonnyMJ; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">(wLj)</span> <span lang="BN-BD" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;">of the door</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;"> and left the place being turned away by their another the paternal uncle, Tayab Ali.</span> <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> Between this failure to take revenge and the death of the victim being discovered at dawn, there were the few hours of darkness. Nothing intervened. There was no evidence that the victim came out of her house or that anyone else entered that house. In my view there is no break in the chain of events from the occurrence of the quarrel and discovery of victim’s dead body.</span></p><p class="Style1" style="line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="Style1" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo5; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">11.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="BN-BD" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;">The</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> occurrence took place</span><span lang="BN-BD" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;"> in the night that fo</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;">l</span><span lang="BN-BD" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;">lowed</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;"> after the quarrel and kicking and breaking the latch of the door</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">. Tayab Ali, brother of the informant and of the accused Israfil, is a neutral witness being paternal uncle of the victim Rubi and paternal uncle of accused Abu Taher, Alamgir and Aminul. No enmity was alleged between this witness and the accused. There is no reason to disbelieve his evidence. He deposed with regard to the circumstances of the quarrel between the victim and the mother of accused Abu Taher, Alamgir and Aminul, and the fact that Abu Taher and Alamgir pursued the victim to her living quarters and tried to kick open the locked door, and that the dead body was found at the break of dawn tied to a tree next to the house of Abu Taher. This clearly is a chain of events which cannot be disbelieved.</span></p><p class="Style1" style="line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="Style1" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo5; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">12.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">It is to be noted that the case was sent for hearing to the Metropolitan Sessions Judge, who framed charge against the</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> accuse-appellants under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and read over and explained to them to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Before pronouncement of judgement charge was altered and framed under sections 302/149 of the Penal Code which was again read over and explained to them to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Looking at the evidence as a whole, I do not find any cogent reason as to why the charge was altered. If at all, the injuries found on the body of the victim tend to suggest that the blows to the body of the victim were neither intended to nor done with the knowledge that they would cause death of the victim. On the contrary, the injuries appear to be incidental to the victim being gagged and dragged from her house. Gagging of the victim with pieces of cloth was done with the intention of preventing her from making any sound. That certainly did not cause her death. The cause of death was the fatal injury on the middle of her neck. This was caused by tightening the rope around the neck of the victim. </span></p><p class="Style1" style="line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="Style1" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo5;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">13.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">The defence case is that the accused persons are absolutely innocent and Rubi had committed suicide as she had not given marriage with someone she loved and they have been falsely implicated in the case. This clearly was negated by the fact that the victim had been gagged with a handful of cut piece cloth and her body was not in fact hanging from the tree, rather her feet were touching the ground. Moreover, in a case of suicide, the ligature mark would not be in the middle of the neck. No other hypothesis as to the innocence of the accused was put forward.</span></p><p class="Style1" style="line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="Style1" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo5;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">14.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">In a case where the only evidence is circumstantial, it is important that the prosecution establish the guilt of the accused by cogent and reliable evidence and the proved circumstances must unequivocally point to the guilt of the accused and must exclude any hypothesis inconsistent with the innocence of the accused. It is also important to see what motive the accused would have in committing the offence alleged. In the instant case the motive is clear. The victim struck Khursheda with a lathi and her sons being instigated by the words of their father went to take revenge. Clearly accused Abu Taher and Alamgir were most vengeful as they immediately went in search for the victim and where prevented only by the locked door and by their uncle Tayab Ali (PW2). No other intervening event took place between that time and the break of dawn which would explain the death of the victim. The dead body having been found adjacent to the house of accused Abu Taher, the inference is clear that he is complicit in the commission of the offence. The proximity of time between the quarrel, assault on Khursheda, the mother of accused Abu Taher and Alamgir, reaction of accused Abu Taher and Alamgir in searching for the victim from her living quarters and being prevented only due to the door being locked and the intervention by their uncle Tayeb Ali and the victim being strangulated to death in the dead hours of that night and absence of all the accused persons from their respective living quarters from early morning, in my view, establish the circumstances proving the guilt of accused Abu Taher and Alamgir. Since, evidently these two accused persons were most animated by the beating of their mother, their revengeful reaction speaks of their involvement in the offence alleged. </span></p><p class="Style1" style="line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="Style1" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo5;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">15.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">From the facts and circumstances discussed above it is clear that no link in the chain is missing and the circumstances clearly lead to the guilt of the accused and as such the same are incompatible with reasonable hypothesis of the innocence of the accused persons. The circumstances as evident appear to have been established beyond all doubt. Hence, Abu Taher and Alamgir cannot escape the guilt. On the other hand, accused Aminul did not accompany his two brothers in search of the victim and hence may get the benefit of doubt. In the case of accused Aminul, his failure to pursue the victim in order to take revenge for his mother’s beating breaks the chain of circumstances, and he therefore cannot be convicted of the offence alleged.</span></p><p class="Style1" style="line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="Style1" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo5;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">16.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">The evidence on record does not indicate any assembly of persons and, therefore, the commission under section 149 of the Penal Code is not sustainable.

In the morning of 17.07.1994, the informant’s wife did not find their daughter Rahima Khatun alias Rubi, aged about 17 years, in her bed room. Accordingly, they started searching. At that time, one Shahabuddin informed them that he had seen the dead body of victim Rubi hanging in a ‘menda’ tree situated at the western side of Israfil’s dwelling homestead. The informant rushed there and found his daughter’s deadbody hanging in a ‘menda’ tree. He found marks of injuries on her person and also found some pieces of cloths pushed in her mouth. He raised alarm. People of the area rushed there. They apprehended that the victim had been killed by someone.

He submits that the occurrence took place in a place which is only 50 yards far from the dwelling homestead of P.W.1 and that the prosecution case was that the victim was brought out from inside of her dwelling hut and, thereafter, was killed at the place of occurrence but neither her parents nor her uncle P.W.2 Tayeb Ali, brother and other inmates of the house heard any kind of sound, which is absurd.

Of them, P.W.1 is the father of the victim who, in his testimony, stated that in the night of occurrence he was sleeping in their dwelling hut. At the time of Fazar prayer, he woke up from sleep. His wife did not find victim Rubi in her bed room and the door of their dwelling hut was open. He started searching and, at that time, P.W.6 Shahabuddin informed him that he had seen the dead body of Rubi hanging in a ‘menda’ tree situated at the western side of the homestead of the accused Israfil. He rushed there and found his daughter hanging. He found marks of injuries on her person and some pieces of cloths inside her mouth. Getting information, police went to the place of occurrence and brought down the dead body of the victim from that ‘menda’ tree and held inquest of the deadbody. He put his signature in inquest report which is ext.1/1. He lodged the FIR ext.2 and his signature therein is ext.2/1. He proved the material exts.I, II and III sandal, sewing machine and a rope respectively. In his cross-examination, he stated that at the place of occurrence he found some marks of foot steps. He denied the defence suggestion that the deceased Rubi committed suicide as she was not given in marriage with a boy she loved. P.W.2 Tayeb Ali is the uncle of the appellants as well as the victim, who, in his testimony, stated that the victim Rubi had a quarrel with the mother of the accused-appellants in respect of ownership of a plate. He settled the dispute on the spot and, thereafter, went to have his meal. Subsequent thereafter, they again started quarreling. He saw that deceased Rubi dealt a bamboo stick blow on the person of the mother of appellants who started crying. At that time, Taher and Alamgir returned home. The people of the locality rushed there. P.W.2 assured the litigants that he would settle the matter. Next morning, hearing hue and cry of the P.W.1 and his wife, he rushed to the place of occurrence and found the dead body of Rubi hanging in a ‘Menda’ tree situated at the southern side of appellant Abu Taher’s house. He also found some pieces of cloth inside the mouth of the victim. Thereafter, police went to the place of occurrence and brought down the dead body of the deceased from the tree. He identified appellant Abu Taher, Israfil, Aminul, Khorsheda Begum and Samsunnahar in the dock. In cross-examination he denied the suggestion of the defence that Rubi was not murdered and she had committed suicide. P.W.3 Abul Bashar is the brother of the victim. He corroborated the testimonies of P.Ws.1 and 2 about the previous day quarrel which was taken place between Rubi and the appellant Khorsheda Begum in connection with the dispute over a plate and that Rubi, at one stage of quarrel, dealt a blow with a bamboo stick on the person of Khorsheda Begum. He also stated that Abu Taher, Alamgir and Shamsunnahar tried to break the door of their dwelling hut. Local people rushed there and prevented them. After that occurrence, P.W.3, out of fear, left their house and went to his father-in-law’s house with his wife and, on the next day, he heard that Rubi had been killed. He returned home and found the dead body of Rubi hanging in a ‘Menda’ tree. P.W.5 Md. Alimuddin Miah stated that he went to the place of occurrence and found deadbody of Rubi hanging in a tree. He also found some pieces of clothes inside the mouth of the deceased. He further stated that he heard about the previous day quarrel. P.W.7 Md. Farooq, Imam of the of local mosque, after offering Fajor prayer, knowing about occurrence, went to the place of occurrence and found the dead body of the victim hanging in a ‘Menda’ tree. P.Ws.4,6,8,9 and 13 were  tendered by the prosecution and the defence declined to cross-examine them. P.W.10 Md. Aminuddin stated that he assisted the police officer in holding inquest of the deadbody of the victim and sending the same to Sir Salimullah Medical College and Hospital, Dhaka for holding post mortem examination. He proved the Challan and his signature therein as Ext.4 and 4/1 respectively. Defence declined to cross-examine him. P.W.11 Mohiuddin, S.I. of police stated that on 17.07.1994, as Duty Officer, after receiving written FIR from the informant, registered the case. He filled up the FIR form. He proved the FIR and his signature as Ext.5 and 5/1 respectively. P.W.12 is a Police constable who stated that before preparing inquest report, the dead body of the victim was found hanging in a tree which was brought down by the police. P.W.14 S.I. Enamul Monowar is the first Investigating Officer of the case. He prepared seizure list, sketch map with Index and recovered some alamots. In his evidence, he stated that on 17.07.1994 pursuant to the direction of the Officer-in-Charge of Demra Police Station he went to the place of occurrence and found the dead body of the deceased hanging in a ‘Menda’ tree.

It was claimed by the prosecution that sewing machine, allegedly belonged to one of the family members of the appellants, was recovered from the dwelling hut of one Abul Hossen as per identification of one Shyama Begum but said Shyama was not examined.

The essential ingredients of section 149 are that there must be an unlawful assembly for commission of an offence by any member of the said unlawful assembly and such offence must have been committed in prosecution of the common object of the assembly; or must be such as the members of the assembly knew that the offence to be likely to be committed. If those elements are satisfied, then only a conviction under section 149 of the Penal Code may be substantiated. Even in order to hold all the appellants vicariously liable for the offence committed it was the duty of the prosecution to establish that they were the members of unlawful assembly and they shared the common object of killing victim Rubi. In absence of evidence and finding as to common object of killing the victim the conviction of all the accused persons including the appellants, who are the members of a same family, is unsafe.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">31<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">                 </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">We have already held that in this case there was no eye witness of the occurrence and the appellants were convicted solely on the basis of circumstantial evidence. </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">32<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">                 </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">In the case of Sharder Birdichand Sarda V.

As to prove the case, by circumstantial evidence, well settled principle is that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established and not ‘may be’ established. There is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between ‘may be proved’ and ‘must be or should be proved’. There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the offence must have been done by the accused. The circumstances should be closely scrutinized and the same must be cogent, succinct, reliable and must be of a such a character as to exclude all possibility of the accused being innocent and there should be no weak links, every weak link being a ground of reasonable suspicion, always calling for an acquittal. Great care must be taken in evaluating circumstantial evidence and if the evidence relied on is reasonably capable of two inferences, the one in favour of the accused must be accepted. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo4;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">34.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">            </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Keeping in mind the views expressed above, let us examine the evidence adduced by the prosecution in this regard. From the testimonies of P.W.1 and P.W.14 it appears that before lodging formal FIR at about 3.15 on 17.07.1994 the P.W.1 went to Demra Police Station and informed the police about the occurrence and pursuant to that information the Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station directed P.W.14 to visit to the place of occurrence and, accordingly, P.W.14 S.I. Enamul Monwar rushed to the place of occurrence at about 10.30 a.m. He prepared inquest report of the deadbody of the victim. From the evidence of P.W.3 Abul Bashar it appears that the accused persons absconded before lodging FIR.

P.W.1 did not suspect the convicts and he also did not disclose in the FIR that the accused persons absconded subsequent after the occurrence. Even in his evidence he did not say anything about the story of appellants’ alleged abscondence. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo4;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">35.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">            </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">It is well known that different persons are differently constituted, and that some accused persons, though innocent, deliberately abscond rather face the ordinal of a criminal case. Even an innocent man may feel panicky and try to evade arrest when wrongly suspected of a grave crime. Absconding by itself need not necessarily lead to an inference of culpable mind against all the absconders. Absconding by itself is not conclusive either of guilt of a guilty conscience because the person may abscond on account of fear of being involved in the offence or for any other allied reason. </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo4;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">36.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">            </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">In the case of Raghubir Singh V.

The courts below convicted the accused (1)Israfil, (2)Abu Taher, (3)Alamgir, (4)Aminul Haque (5)Khorshida Begum and C(6)Shamsun Naher assuming that all of them, forming unlawful assembly with a common object to kill the victim, went to the place of occurrence and had killed the victim but we do not find any evidence either circumstantial or direct. There is no answer to the question as to who went to the place of occurrance and what was their actual number? All the members of the same family have been convicted relying only on presumption, surmises and conjectures. It is the cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence that a case can be said to be proved only when there is certain and explicit evidence and no person can be convicted on pure on moral conviction. Another golden thread which runs through the web of the administration of justice in criminal cases is that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and other to his innocence, the view which favourable to the accused should be adopted. This principle has a special relevance in cases wherein the guilt of the accused is sought to be established by circumstantial evidence. On consideration of the evidence and the circumstances referred to above, we are satisfied that this is a case in which the circumstantial evidence did not prove the case against accused conclusively and unerringly, and at any rate two reasonable views are possible.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo4;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">38.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">            </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Moreover, in absence of prove of the ingredients of common object, the courts below committed error of law in convicting the appellants and others under sections 302/149 of the Penal Code.
