Pursuant to the conditions of the Notifications of Awards, the petitioner furnished Bank Guarantee/Performance Security issued by the Standard Chartered Bank bearing Bank Guarantee Nos. 411020278783 dated 03.08.2015 and 411020278774 dated 03.08.2015 for an amount of €62,500.00 (Euro Sixty Two Thousand Five Hundred) each in the format proposed by the BMPCUL.

Pursuant to the Contracts, the Purchase Orders and the L/Cs, the petitioner procured all the required components and equipments from several different sources, including internationally reputed manufacturers, for the supply of goods and related services for Chilled Water Plant for BDP and DDP. Subsequently, there were various correspondences between the petitioner and the BMPCUL regarding the pre-shipment inspection (PSI) of the said goods and, eventually, on 14.04.2016, the petitioner sent a letter to the BMPCUL notifying that the said goods were ready for inspection with a request to perform the PSI tests through the BMPCUL’s appointed PSI company, Continental Inspection Co.

Upon inspection, the PSI company did not issue PSI certificate, nor did it issue any communication pertaining to any technical or other discrepancies. Thereafter, it came to the knowledge of the petitioner that the PSI company by sending a letter on 27.04.2016 to the BMPCUL pointed out some discrepancies about the Item No. 1.1 (Ice Thermal Storage Unit), Item No. 1.6 (Evaporative Condenser) and about the Motor. Notwithstanding the discrepancy raised by the PSI company, the BMPCUL’s PSI team, which includes a specialist from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), issued a clean pre-shipment inspection certificate on 29.04.2016 (“BMPCUL’s certificate”). Immediately after obtaining the BMPCUL’s certificate, the petitioner shipped the said goods to Bangladesh, which arrived at the Chittagong Port in June-2016 but the BMPCUL denied to accept the said goods due to non-conformity to the terms of the L/Cs with respect to the country of origin. It is stated that although the L/Cs stipulate at sight payment, subject to furnishing of a PSI certificate together with other documents, the BMPCUL’s bank, i.e. the Sonali Bank Ltd refused to clear the payment due under the L/Cs as per the BMPCUL’s instructions despite furnishing all the documents. The BMPCUL has been made aware of the petitioner’s ordeal as to incurring huge demurrage at the Chattogram Port at numerous times vide e-Mails, letters, phone-calls and face-to-face meetings in Dhaka. The petitioner has made numerous requests to the BMPCUL, both in writing and during meetings, to amend and extend the terms of the L/Cs and thereby amicably resolve the matter, but the BMPCUL has continuously and unreasonably rejected such requests although the shipped equipments met all material technical specifications as required under the Contracts, POs and the L/Cs, which have been certified in the BMPCUL’s Certificate. Subsequently, the BMPCUL sent a letter dated 18.06.2016 stating that the BMPCUL would extend the L/Cs only if the following conditions were met: (a) the petitioner would have to release shipped machineries from the Chattogram Sea Port at its own cost and liabilities and (b) payments due under the L/Cs will be made after a full year following successful installation of the plants. In response to the above conditions, the petitioner vide letter dated 29.06.2016 proposed some favorable payment terms for the BMPCUL. Since then, the BMPCUL did not attempt to resolve the issues regarding the country of origin in good faith, nor is the BMPCUL concerned about the rising cost of demurrages. More so, the BMPCUL has unreasonably refused to extend the term of the L/Cs and amend the appropriate clauses thereof, all of which have raised a ‘dispute’ between the petitioner and the BMPCUL. The petitioner has attempted and failed, at numerous times, to resolve the dispute through an amicable settlement. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l2 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">It is stated that in view of dispute as to the extension of the terms of the L/Cs and the amendment of the appropriate clauses, the petitioner had invoked the arbitration clause. It is further stated that the relevant clause of the Particular Conditions of Contract (PCC) empowers the BMPCUL to choose the law from among (i) the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Arbitration Rules 1976, (ii) the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), (iii) the Rules of Arbitration of the Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (ISCC) and (iv) the Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA). The petitioner had invoked the multi-option arbitration provision contained in GCC Clause 47.3 read with the relevant PCC clauses and intended to commence the arbitration proceedings by sending two notices of arbitration to the BMPCUL on 24.11.2016 and 05.12.2016 respectively. The BMPCUL, disregarding the petitioner’s request for arbitration, sent a letter under Memo No. PD/CWP(D)/LC-10/2013/46 dated 30.11.2016 informing the petitioner that the BMPCUL shall not allow the extension of the L/C validity and has decided to cancel the said contracts and the L/Cs.

Thereafter, by a letter dated 21.05.2018, the petitioner reiterated its intention to commence arbitration to resolve the dispute at the BMPCUL’s earliest convenience having appointed Mr. AM Amin Uddin, a Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, as one of the arbitrators, with a request to the BMPCUL to appoint its arbitrator within 30 (thirty) days of receipt of the letter, so that the two appointed-arbitrators may choose the third arbitrator who shall be Chairman of the arbitral tribunal. Then, the BMPCUL, vide its letter dated 25.06.2018, refused to appoint an arbitrator claiming that there is no dispute between the petitioner and the BMPCUL.

In addition to the PSI company’s inspection, a three-member team of the BMPCUL will inspect the Chilled Water Plant for BDP prior to shipment in the manufacturer’s workshop. All the related costs i.e. both-way air tickets, food, lodging, local transport and pocket money of at least USD 100.00 per day for each representative for 07 (seven) days will be borne by the supplier. The same representative will issue PSI certificate which will form part and parcel of the shipping documents for drawing payment. Advance copies of the shipping documents must be sent to the cited addresses at least 07 (seven) days before the expected date of arrival of the consignment at the destination of the Chattogram Sea Port, Bangladesh and the invoice should contain full information such as item, weight, measurement value etc. Bill of lading should indicate freight prepaid. L/C Nos. 033015010605 (“L/C 1”) and 033015010606 (“L/C 2”), both dated 01.09.2015, were issued against the Purchase Order (PO) 1 and the Purchase Order (PO) 2 respectively (collectively referred to as the “L/Cs”). However, the PSI company of the BMPCUL vide their report dated 27.04.2016 informed that the supplier did not provide any testing facility to its inspector at the time of inspection in Belgium. The supplier arranged only visual inspection to its inspector and its inspector conducted only visual inspection of the subject consignment in Belgium on 25.04.2016 for Item No. 1.1 (Ice Thermal Storage Unit) and Item No. 1.6 (Evaporative Condenser) and found the following discrepancies: (i) For Item No. 1.1 (Ice Thermal Storage Unit), its inspector found the country of origin to be Belgium; instead of Italy, (ii) For Item No. 1.6 (Evaporative Condenser), its inspector found its Model No. VSC-250; instead of VXC-C250 and the country of origin to be Belgium; instead of Italy and (iii) Motor was found by Siemens, Germany; instead of Baltimore Air Coil (BAC), Italy. And, as per the report of the PSI company dated 30.04.2016, it was also detected that (iv) For Item No: 1.2, Volume of the Refrigerant Receiver was found 2610 Ltr; instead of 3000 Ltr, (v) For Item No: 1.3 (Single Stage Reciprocating Compressor) running speed, capacity control, power consumption of motor and insulation protection (whether it is IP 23 or not) are not mentioned on the name-plate of the motor. It is alleged that the petitioner with ill-motive shipped discrepant machineries on 30.04.2016 without informing the BMPCUL and without obtaining PSI certificate from the PSI agent of the BMPCUL which is evidenced by the Bill of Lading provided by the carrier. Thereafter, the petitioner sent letter to the BMPCUL requesting for extension of L/C dated 24.05.2016.

The supplier company, thereafter, without resolving the discrepancies wrote letters on 01.06.2016 and 07.06.2016 having tried to explain the situation as to why the discrepancies arose, in an attempt to persuade the BMPCUL that the equipments shipped are of superior model and would be of the expected performance and earnestly requested the BMPCUL to accept the goods. The petitioner, without any legal authority, wrote a letter to the PSI company (Continental Inspection Company) on 08.06.2016 to issue PSI certificate.

Again, the supplier wrote a letter on 09.07.2016 for extension of L/Cs. Subsequently, several meetings were held for amicable settlement of the dispute with an aim to arrive at a conclusive decision between the BMPCUL and the supplier. Finally, the supplier by its letter dated 27.07.2016 confirmed the BMPCUL to take back the goods. It is claimed by the BMPCUL that as per the terms of the settlement, it provided all sorts of support as required for example; the BMPCUL, as per the request of the petitioner, wrote a letter to the Sonali Bank dated 27.07.2016 and the Sonali Bank accorded NOC on 28.07.2016; the petitioner wrote a letter to the BMPCUL for appointment of C&amp;F Agent for re-shipping purpose dated 31.07.2016 and, accordingly, the BMPCUL wrote a letter to the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports who accorded NOC on 01.08.2016, the BMPCUL wrote a letter to the Commissioner of Customs, Chattogram on 01.08.2016 and accorded their permission for re-shipment on 31.08.2018; Pursuant to the petitioner’s request, the BMPCUL wrote a letter to the customs authority for permission for taking back the goods by the petitioner on 01.08.2016. Thereafter, the BMPCUL wrote a letter to the petitioner’s C&amp;F Agent ‘Transmire’ on 01.08.2018, but the petitioner when requested for appointing ‘Oshin Enterprise’ as its C&amp;F Agent on 03.08.2016, the BMPCUL, as per the request of the petitioner, issued a letter of authorization to the new C&amp;F Agent (Oshin Enterprise) on 03.08.2016. In the meantime, an auction letter was issued by the customs authority on 31.07.2016 which was received on 08.08.2016 by the BMPCUL and the BMPCUL then sent a request letter to the customs authority to stop auction process on 08.08.2016. A request letter from the petitioner was received by the BMPCUL on 09.08.2016 for endorsement of shipping documents for taking back the entire consignments, the BMPCUL then sent a letter on 10.08.2016 to the Sonali Bank to endorse the documents for re-shipping. As per the request of the BMPCUL, the Sonali Bank endorsed the documents for re-shipping of the concerned goods vide letter dated 11.08.2016. When the customs authority again sent the letter dated 10.08.2016 for auction sale of the goods, the BMPCUL requested the customs authority to stop the auction sale vide the letter dated 23.08.2016. The petitioner further requested the BMPCUL to send a letter to the Bangladesh Bank for issuing NOC for re-shipping of the consignment on 31.08.2016 and the BMPCUL sent a request letter to the Sonali Bank to obtain the NOC from the Bangladesh Bank on 03.09.2016; the Sonali Bank requested the Bangladesh Bank for NOC for re-shipping vide letter dated 04.09.2016 and it accorded permission vide letters dated 19.09.2016 and 21.09.2016. Thereafter, the petitioner surprisingly, by taking a U-turn, sent a letter to the BMPCUL for amendment of the L/Cs on 29.09.2016, to which the BMPCUL replied on 26.10.2018. The petitioner sent a letter requesting the BMPCUL for extension of the L/Cs on 27.10.2016 and the petitioner also sent a letter to the BMPCUL to take steps to stop the auction sale on 31.10.2016 and the BMPCUL sent a letter for that purpose to the customs authority on 08.11.2016.

For avoiding the future legal complexities over this international purchase by the BMPCUL, while the BMPCUL at that point of time could have straight-a-way rejected the proposal of the petitioner on the plea of nonconformity to the terms of the L/Cs, this Court takes judicial notice of the conduct of the concerned officials of the BMPCUL that they agreed to accept the goods. Had the BMPCUL right-away cancelled the contract on the ground of admitted infraction of the terms of the contract, purchase orders and the L/Cs, the supplier (the petitioner) would not have insisted upon the BMPCUL for taking the matter to the arbitration. Another unusual fact also has caught sight of this Court that despite finding inconsistencies in the goods at the time of pre-shipment inspection by the appointed PSI company, on 29.04.2016 how did the specialist team issue the pre-shipment inspection certificate (PSI) in the following terms ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The discrete components, which form part of the Chilled Water Plant, have been physically verified and <u>are as mentioned in the purchase order.</u> At the time of <u>inspection it was found that the goods were ready for shipment</u>, which will be assembled at the BMPCUL site.’</em> (emphasis added) This Court also has taken judicial notice of the conduct of the supplier (petitioner) that when evidently there was a non-compliance to the terms of the L/Cs, how did the petitioner dare to take the risk of shipping the goods to the Chattogram Port. These are apparently some mysterious eventual facts, which require to be investigated by the high officials of the concerned regulatory/ controlling ministry of the country and, if any illegalities surface, disciplinary action against the delinquent should be taken as per the recommendation of the investigating authority. However, in reply to the proposal made by the BMPCUL vide letter dated 18.06.2016, when the petitioner made a counter offer with regard to the mode of payment and, ultimately, they failed to reach an agreement with regard to mode of payment, eventually, the petitioner requested the BMPCUL to assist the petitioner in taking back the goods to its country, so that it can re-ship the goods as per the terms and conditions of the L/C. In other words, in order to re-ship the goods upon assembling those from the country of origin being Italy to the BMPCUL, the petitioner agreed to take back the goods lying at the Chattogram Port, as evident from the petitioner’s letter dated 23.06.2016, which is quoted below; </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 112%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">“In order to provide an amicable settlement, it is hereby agreed that the shipped Ice Bank Tank and Condenser, as the purchaser do not accept the origin Belgium, although ice bank tanks were inspected and verified by <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">the BMPCUL inspection team in Belgium,</span> will be taken back to the manufacturer <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">Baltimore Company and <u>we will supply</u></span><u> the Ice Bank Tank and Condenser from Italy”.</u> (underlined by me)</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l2 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">The petitioner, thereafter, again wrote to the BMPCUL on 27.07.2016 in the following language; </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 112%; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">“I am writing to request that you permit us to reship the above-mentioned consignment back to Turkey.

It is the case of the petitioner that if the tenure of the L/Cs is not extended, there is no question of taking back the goods inasmuch as, in that case, the petitioner shall not be able to resupply the goods to the BMPCUL. This Court, thus, finds that since the BMPCUL has not rebutted the petitioner’s claim of reshipping the goods and since the BMPCUL had agreed with the petitioner to assist the petitioner in obtaining all the required papers and documents from the concerned State-Functionaries and statutory authorities, the issue as to whether refusal by the BMPCUL to extend the validity of the L/Cs in order to enable the petitioner to re-supply the goods was justified or not, should be adjudicated upon by the arbitration tribunal. In the light of the fact that the BMPCUL has unilaterally cancelled the contract having declined to extend the tenure of the L/Cs for enabling the petitioner to re-supply the goods, this Court is of the view that <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> there is existence of a dispute and there is no scope on the part of the BMPCUL to claim that the dispute has amicably been settled. Given the fact that it is the BMPCUL who had agreed with the petitioner to send back the goods and the petitioner had agreed thereto with a condition to resupply the goods to the petitioner as per the specification/terms and conditions of the original L/Cs, now, if the BMPCUL intends to claim that it had never agreed to take the goods afresh from the petitioner, that position itself amounts to a dispute, resolution of which can be done through adducing evidence before the arbitration. </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l2 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">27.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">To put the above rescript in a shorter and simpler version, all that this Court wishes to record here that the issue as to whether the BMPCUL had agreed with the petitioner only to send back the shipped-goods lying at Chattogram Port, or it had also agreed with the petitioner to take the goods from the petitioner afresh as per the specification of the original L/Cs, apparently remains unsettled between the petitioner and the BMPCUL. More importantly, since the contract has been cancelled by the BMPCUL without arriving at any consensus thereto, there should be an adjudication by the arbitration tribunal as to whether the BMPCUL has properly and lawfully cancelled the contract. While that is the scenario, this Court finds it difficult to concede to the argument advanced by the learned Advocate for the BMPCUL that the parties have amicably settled the dispute.

On the other hand, the petitioner’s case is that it does not disagree with the BMPCUL’s above position, but since the place of arbitration has not been mentioned either in the GCC or anywhere in the PCC, the Arbitration Act shall be applicable either in tandem with one of the above foreign Rules, if chosen by the BMPCUL in course of disposal of this cases, and if the BMPCUL remains adamant not to select a foreign Rules of Procedures, in that scenario, this Court may direct the parties to proceed with the arbitration under the Arbitration Act.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l2 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">30.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">At this juncture, I consider it pertinent to look at the general provisions regarding Amicable Settlement, Adjudication, Arbitration contained in the Contract, and the special provisions of the GCC, which have been placed in Section (Part) 4 of the Contract and have been regarded in the Contract as the PCC. </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 112%;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">General Conditions of Contract (GCC)</span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 112%; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">47.1- Amicable Settlement:</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 112%; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">The purchaser and the supplier shall use their best efforts to settle amicably all disputes arising out of or in connection with this Contract or its interpretation. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 112%; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">47.2-Adjudication :</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 112%; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">If the supplier/purchaser believe that amicable settlement of dispute is not possible between the two parties, the dispute shall be referred to the Adjudicator within 14 (fourteen) days of first written correspondence on the matter of disagreement;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 112%; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">The Adjudicator named in the PCC is jointly appointed by the parties.

But, this Court could not trace out any provisions as to the place or venue of arbitration anywhere in the four-corners of the GCC or PCC. As per the PCC sub-clause (a) of the GCC clause 47.3(b), the BMPCUL has been given the liberty to choose one Rules of Procedures out of the four foreign Rules of Procedures, but it does necessarily mean that if the BMPCUL names the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the venue of arbitration has to be at the office of the United Nations Office or if the BMPCUL opts for the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Rules, the place of arbitration needs to be in London and so on for the other Rules of procedures.

The Civil Courts of our country are well-competent to make a declaration in favour of/against this petitioner by examining the issue as to whether the Arbitration Act is applicable in the present scenario. Because, our Civil Courts are bestowed with ample power to adjudicate upon any civil dispute, including making a declaration as to whether a particular law is applicable for adjudication upon a dispute by any Court, or tribunal or quasi-judicial body. However, since in this case, this Court has already adjudicated upon the issue upon examining the relevant facts in connection with or arising out of the GCC &amp; PCC clauses and the relevant law, namely Sections 3 of the Arbitration Act, there is no need to approach the Civil Court for the said purpose. In the backdrop that the BMPCUL is purposefully refraining from choosing one foreign Rules of Procedures as well as selecting the venue of the arbitration leaving this foreign petitioner in limbo, therefore, ends of justice would be best served if a forum of adjudication for the petitioner’s grievance is declared by this Court, instead of pushing the petitioner to the Civil Court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">    </span></span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l2 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">37.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The third sub-issue is whether this Court is competent to compel the BMPCUL to opt for one of the Rules of Procedures for arbitration, out of the agreed four foreign Rules of Procedures and determine the venue of the arbitration.

Since (i) there is an “agreement to arbitrate” in the GCC Clause 47.3(a), (ii) the parties have not agreed to a seat of arbitration, (iii) the BMPCUL has failed to make any choice of Rules of Procedures and (iv) the governing law of the Contract is Bangladesh, this Court holds that it has jurisdiction under Section 12 of the Arbitration Act to impose upon the parties to fix/determine the place of arbitration to be Bangladesh and, accordingly, this Court is well competent to appoint an arbitrator from the respondent’s side.

When any of the circumstances set out in sub-Section (1) of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act would be found to have existed in an application under Section 7A of the Arbitration Act, this Court shall unhesitatingly pass the necessary  Order/s or Direction/s, but if this Court finds that the stated-facts do not attract the circumstances enumerated in sub-Section (1)  of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act, in that event, this Court has to be satisfied that whether the stated-circumstances fulfill the cardinal principles of granting interim Orders, namely, whether (i) there exists a <em>prima-facie</em> case, (ii) whether the balance of inconvenience is in favour of the applicant and (iii) whether, if the other party is not restrained, the applicant shall suffer irreparable loss and injury not commensurable in monetary terms. In the instant Section-7A application, being Arbitration Application No. 36 of 2016, two interim Orders and one direction upon the BMPCUL had been prayed for by the petitioner. One interim Order is sought for preservation of two contracts dated 04.08.2015 executed between the petitioner-company and the BMPCUL for supply of goods and related services for Chilled Water Plant for BDP and DDP valued at €1,250,000 (Euro One Million two Hundred and Fifty Thousand) collectively and the second interim Order is prayed for restraining the BMPCUL and the Standard Chartered Bank from encashment of the Bank Guarantee Nos. 411020278783 and 411020278774 both dated 03.08.2015 issued by the Standard Chartered Bank as the Performance Securities of the contracts. And the only direction which is sought for by the petitioner-company upon the BMPCUL is for compelling the BMPCUL to extend the tenure of the L/C in order to enable the petitioner-company to take back the goods from the Chattogram Port and, then, reship the goods as per the specifications of the original L/C.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin: 0in 2.7pt 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">52.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">With regard to the petitioner’s prayer for the interim Order for preservation of the contracts, this Court’s view is that there exists a <em>prima-facie</em> case of the petitioner-company to agitate before the arbitration tribunal as to whether the petitioner-company is entitled to complete the Contracts by re-shipping the goods after taking back the goods from the Chottagram Port. Because if the Contracts are not preserved, there is no point of formation of the arbitration tribunal.

So, there is no scope for the petitioner-company to make out a case seeking a declaration from this Court or from the civil Court or from the arbitration tribunal that BMPCUL’s request to the Standard Chartered Bank for encashment of the Bank Guarantee is illegal. When this Court is getting a clear picture about the nature of relationship between the BMPCUL and the Standard Chartered Bank, there remains hardly any chance for the Standard Chartered Bank or the petitioner-company to make an endeavour for making out a <em>prima-facie</em> case. In any event, the petitioner-company is not going to suffer a loss by encashment of the Bank Guarantee, which can not be compensated. Because if the petitioner-company succeeds in the arbitration tribunal, the BMPCUL would no longer ask for the new Bank Guarantees against these Contracts. More importantly, the Bank Guarantees have been issued under the ICC Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees, ICC Publication No. 758, which is the Biblic Rules for the Banks of all the member (signatory) countries. Since the said URDG 758 mandatorily requires the Banks to make instantaneous payment of the Bank Guarantees whenever is asked by the beneficiary of a Bank Guarantee, Bangladesh being a member country of the ICC, the Banks which are conducting banking business in Bangladesh are legally obliged to observe and obey the said laws and, accordingly, the Standard Chartered Bank is legally bound to encash the Bank Guarantees without getting involved in any dispute of the petitioner-company with the BMPCUL. It leads me to hold that there is no scope for this Court to stop encashment of the two Bank Guarantees by issuing any interim Order.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin: 0in 2.7pt 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">55.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">Now, remains prayer for issuance of Direction upon the BMPCUL for extension of L/C.

From the materials produced before us it is fully established that there was no arbitrariness whatsoever on the part of the banks in filling up the posts which were made from the waiting list as referred by the learned Counsel for the respondents. Since the advertised vacancies had been filled up according to merit and following the quota system, therefore, selection process in that respect stood exhausted. The waiting list does not survive. Moreover, in absence of any statutory provision one year can be considered as reasonable period for validly of a waiting list. Since the validity of the select panel has come to an end of the affix of time, therefore, there cannot be any order to appoint the persons from such select list prepared about 4/5 years ago. The writ petitioner-respondents have not acquired any enforceable right to be appointed. It is settled principle that a mandamus may issue to compel the authorities to do something, it must be shown that the statute imposes a legal authority and the aggrieved party had a legal right under the statute or rule to enforce it. This classical position continues and a mandamus could not be issued in favour of the writ petitioners directing the Banks to appoint the writ petitioners since they failed to establish that they have acquired an enforceable legal right to be appointed in the Banks since their names were empanelled and that the Banks have legal duty to appoint them. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                                        </span>. . .

The said circulars were also posted in its website. Those circulars were subsequently amended inviting applications from eligible candidates for preparing a panel of qualified candidates for recruitment in the posts of ‘Senior Officers’ and ‘Officers’. Last date of submitting applications was on 10.07.2013. The writ petitioners applied for the posts advertised and participated in the MCQ test and written examination which were held on 27.09.2013 and 04.10.2013 respectively. Results of MCQ and written examinations were duly published. A total number of 2655 candidates for the posts of Senior Officers, and 1414 candidates for the posts of Officers, were passed in the MCQ and written examinations. The Viva Voce tests were held from 17.01.2014 to 29.01.2014 for the posts of Senior Officers and from 13.12.2013 to 15.12.2013 for the posts of Officers. Final result of the candidates, who passed in the viva voce test, was published officially on 03.07.2014. A total number of 401 candidates were selected for recruitment in the posts of Senior Officers and a waiting list was prepared. Similarly, a total number of 501 candidates were selected for recruitment in the posts of Officers and a waiting list was prepared. On 21.09.2015, a circular was issued under the signature of the Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Finance, forming a 17 members Bankers Selection Committee (shortly, the BSC) for appointment of Officers (1st and 2<sup>nd</sup> Class) of State owned Commercial Banks, Specialized Banks and Financial Institutions. Member Secretary of the BSC issued a letter communicated under memo No.weGmwmGm-103/2015-11 ZvwiL 03/11/2015 addressing the Managing Director, Rupali Bank informing him about the resolution of the 1<sup>st</sup> meeting, held on 28.10.2015, of the BSC for recruitment in the posts of Senior Officers and Officers. The writ petitioners tried to know about the fate of empanelled candidates but the Bank authority did not publish their names/roll numbers despite repeated requests. The Bank for unknown reasons delayed recruitment from the said waiting list inasmuch as writ petitioners are supposed to be recruited in those posts according to their position in the merit list. The Bank, by not taking any step for the recruitment of the writ petitioners, frustrated their legitimate expectation causing immense sufferings to the writ petitioners. News has been published in different electronic and print media that about seven thousand candidates have been depriving from the opportunity of being appointed for the decision of the Finance Ministry. The writ petitioners including other candidates of Sonali Bank, Janata Bank and Rupali Bank filed applications to the Government for their appointments but without giving any attention to their right and legitimate expectation to be appointed, the writ respondent No.3, Member Secretary of the BSC published the impugned job circulars. Thereby, the writ respondents violated the writ petitioners’ fundamental right guaranteed under articles 27 and 29 of the Constitution and frustrated their legitimate expectation to be appointed in those posts. Thus, they filed the aforesaid writ petition and obtained Rule.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The Rupali Bank contested the Rule, by filing an affidavit-in-opposition and a supple-mentary affidavit-in-opposition contending that the BSC is a Committee that has been formed to prepare a panel for holding examination, scrutinization and selection of the candidates for the purpose of appointments in the posts of 1st and 2nd Class Officers in the nationalized banks and financial institutions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">It is stated that earlier Rupali Bank issued an employment notification inviting applications from competent candidates for recruitment in the posts of Senior Officers and Officers.

In total 2655 candidates for the posts of the Senior Officers and 1414 candidates for the posts of the Officers passed in MCQ and written examinations. Their Viva voce test was held from 13.12.2013 to 29.01.2014 for the post of Senior Officers and Officers. A total number of 1322 candidates appeared in the Viva Voice test for the post of Officers and 2308 candidates for the post of Senior Officers. Finally, 501 candidates were selected for the post of Officers and 403 candidates were selected for the post of Senior Officers. It was further contended that appointment letters for the post of Senior Officers were issued to 401 selected candidates and appointment letters for the posts of Officers were issued to 501 selected candidates in order to their merit and following quota system.

The writ petitioners applied for the above mentioned post and got admit cards for sitting in MCQ test and written examination. The MCQ test, written examination and Viva Voce tests were held duly. Thereafter, final results of the qualified candidates were published on 08.06.2015 for the post of AEO and on 27.08.2015 for post of AEOTeller. Of them, 189 candidates were selected for appointment in the post of AEO and other 583 candidates were kept in the Panel for future recruitment. For the post of AEO-Teller, more than 1883 candidates were found successful in the Viva Voce test. Among them, initially 497 candidates were selected for appointment and 1386 candidates were kept in the waiting list. Thereafter, 10 more were recruited in the post of AEO on 05.08.2015 from waiting list in order of their merit. Thereafter, again one on 18.10.2015 and 12 on 24.11.2015 were recruited for the post of AEO. A panel of 570 candidates was prepared. The writ petitioners further contended that there is established practice of appointments from empanelled candidates. But a new committee namely the ‘Bankers Selection Committee’ (the BSC) was formed by the Ministry of Finance (Bank and Financial Institution Division) on 21.09.2015 for recruitment of 1st and 2nd Class Officers in the State owned banks and other financial institutions replacing the old ‘Bankers Recruitment Council’(BRC). The Member Secretary of the BSC have published the impugned circulars being Circular Nos.16/2016 and 17/2016 in various dailies on 24.03.2016 and 25.03.2016 for recruitment to the posts of AEO and AEO-Teller without appointing the successfully passed and eligible candidates from the existing panels prepared in 2015.

The posts falling vacant due to not joining of respective selectees or leaving the job for any reason would be fulfilled from the panel against the quotas of the same candidates. Likewise 497 candidates were directly appointed in the post of AEO-Teller and a list of panel consisting 1386 candidates were prepared for future appointment against those who would fail to join by 29.02.2016 from the same quota. Waiting list was prepared to fulfill the posts falling vacant due to not joining or otherwise leaving the job from among the panel. Specific validity period of penal was fixed on 31.12.2015 for the post of AEO and 29.02.2016 for the post of AEO-Teller. Within the said period if any post is lying or falling vacant in the posts of AEO and AEO-Teller the same should be filled up from among the panel strictly maintaining quota system. It was never decided to give appointment to all candidates from the panel list. Some of the posts as mentioned have been filled up against those who did not join the job even after receipt of appointment letters. In the meantime, some more posts i.e. 302 in the posts of AEO and 417 in the posts of AEO-Teller had fallen vacant. Human Resource Development Department of Janata Bank with a view to fill up the vacant posts, wrote a letter to the MD and CEO of the Bank for filling up the vacant posts of AEO &amp; AEO-Teller from the existing panel list by obtaining permission from the Ministry of Finance. The Board of Directors of the Bank approved the proposal for appointment subject to prior permission from the Ministry of Finance. But the Ministry of Finance vide its letter dated 24.05.2015 refused to give permission for appointment from the existing panel. It has been made binding upon the banks to obtain clearance from the Ministry of Finance in case of any appointment of manpower vide letter dated 17.12.2009. The Chairman of the respondent Bank had no independent power to give appointment in any post of Janata Bank without prior clearance of the Ministry of Finance. Since the Ministry had already refused approval for appointment in the posts of AEO &amp; AEO-Teller to meet urgent manpower requirement of the bank from among the existing AEO &amp; AEO-Teller panel list which was recommended by the Board of Directors of Janata Bank, as such, the Chairman was unable to exercise any power regarding appointment in any post of this bank.

There must be a judicially enforceable right as well as a legally protected right before one suffering a grievance can ask for a mandamus.

Mr. Islam failed to show any statement or undertaking that the Bank authorities assured the writ petitioners that they would be appointed since their names are in the waiting list. Mere advertisement is not a promise to appoint. The same is an invitation to fairly complete with all similarly situated persons who think that fulfill particular eligibility criteria.

However, if the particular teacher’s term of service is less than 4 years, then his previous service years shall not be counted after the nationalization. The issue is whether this provision, should be struck down. The respondents did not offer any explanation on the rationale of Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules. Regardless, our understanding is as follows: the teachers who are nationalized, shall cease to be private employees and shall be treated as Government employees. They shall be entitled to different Government facilities, including but not limited to pension benefits. We are mindful of the fact that the Government has nationalized hundreds of schools and in the process, affirmed the status of the employees and teachers of those schools as Government employees entitled to pension benefits and other benefits. If Rule 2(Ga) is was drafted differently to take account of the entire period of service prior to nationalization, then it would have had severe financial implications on the Government. Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules is therefore, in our view, the mechanism used to reduce the financial exposure and at the same time, provide benefits to the teachers. The learned Counsel for the petitioners submits that as a result of Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules, the petitioners’ “rights and entitlements” have been affected to their prejudice and therefore, Rule 2(Ga) should be struck down.</span></strong> <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Now, let us consider the legality of Rule 9 of the 2013 Rules.

In the meantime, the teacher who was nationalized would be working for 5 more years, as nationalized teacher and his total tenure would be 10 years.

The respondents also did not set out the rationale behind Rule 9(1) of the 2013 Rules. Even when we pointed out that Rule 9(1) is manifestly absurd for the reasons we have set out aforesaid, the learned Counsels for the respondents could not provide any interpretation, alternative to our interpretations. In the instant case, we are not dealing with any issue relating to procedural irregularity/illegality committed at the time of framing of the 2013 Rules. We are dealing with the issue whether Rule 9(1) and Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules should be struck down as being unreasonable.

The respondent No.4 filed an Affidavit in Opposition. With regard to the Rule issuing order, the respondent No.4 states that Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules is legal; the petitioners had voluntarily joined knowing that their service tenure would be reduced and therefore, the petitioners are estopped form raising this issue. Furthermore, since the 2013 Rules were framed in accordance with the procedure laid down under the Primary School (Taking Over) Act 1974, there is no scope for this Division to interfere. In the Affidavit in Opposition, it is stated that the promotion to the post of Head Master can be made if the person has the requisite qualification. Furthermore, to be eligible for promotion to the post of Head Master, the person must be working as Assistant Teacher for 7 years from the date of enlistment in the MPO. After nationalization, the Government issued an order which states that there is no scope to promote Assistant Teachers to Head Masters. Through the Affidavit, it is pointed out that the documents submitted by the petitioners are under challenge and questionable and therefore, this Division should not intervene. Through the Affidavit, the respondent No.4 also points out <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“That the petitioners claim that they are discharging their duties and Headmaster is not true and hence denied”</em>. The respondent No.4 refers to the order passed by the Full Bench of the Hon’ble Appellate Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 4014 of 2018. The Full Bench of the Hon’ble Appellate Division confirmed the order of stay passed by the Hon’ble Judge in Chamber and directed disposal on merit.

In the Affidavit in Opposition, it is stated that under the 2013 Rules, the direct appointees shall have preference over those who were nationalized and therefore, the direct appointees should be made Head Masters. It is also pointed out that on similar matters, the petitioners filed series of writ petition but there was no disclosure and therefore, the Rule and the Supplementary Rule should be discharged.

He submits that if the effective service period is reduced, as has been done by Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules, the petitioners’ entitlement under the 2013 Rules would be detrimentally affected. The learned Counsel submits that delegated legislations are framed to further the objective of the parent legislation. The learned Counsel in support refers to certain decisions of the Supreme Court of India. Taking us through these decisions, the learned Counsel submits that Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules, reducing the “effective service period by half” does not have objective basis and therefore, should be struck down. The learned Counsel referring to Rule 9(1) of the 2013 Rules, submit that due to the operation of Rule 9(1), the seniority of the petitioners would be affected seriously; the petitioners would always remain junior to whoever is appointed directly. This, the learned Counsel submits, is manifestly arbitrary and absurd. Since after nationalization, there is only scope for direct recruitment, the interpretation of Rule 9(1) would be that the petitioners would never be senior to the junior most appointee. The petitioners, as Headmasters, serving for more than 20 years would remain junior to any teacher directly recruited. According to the learned Counsel, if under the 2013 Rules, the effective service is reduced to half, then the revised service period should be taken into account; if that is taken into account, Rule 9(1) of the 2013 Rules cannot stand because this has the effect of “continuous reduction of length of service”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>According to the learned Counsel, Rule 9(1) of the 2013 Rules is manifestly unreasonable, takes away the petitioners’ vested rights and is vague; thus Rule 9(1) should be struck. The learned Counsel submits that for the reasons set out aforesaid, the Rule should be made absolute with appropriate direction upon the respondents.</span></p><p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">12.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">We have heard the learned Counsels at length.

This Division in exercise of powers under Article 102 of the Constitution can review the constitutionality of a primary legislation. If this can be done, the legality of a delegated legislation can always be subject to judicial scrutiny. This is the principle settled by the Hon’ble Appellate Division in series of cases. Delegated legislation can be struck down if: (a) the delegated legislation is void because the delegating statute is unconstitutional, (b) the delegated legislation offends the constitutional provisions, (c) the delegated legislation is ultra vires the delegating statute, or (d) the delegated legislation is arbitrary, unreasonable or contrary to any other statutory provisions. A delegated legislation or any provision therein may also be struck down if it is so vague that a reasonable interpretation is not possible.</span></p><p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 114%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 114%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">14.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 114%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The purpose of subordinate legislation is to carry into effect the existing law and not to <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">change it.

The respondents did not offer any explanation on the rationale of Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules. Regardless, our understanding is as follows: the teachers who are nationalized, shall cease to be private employees and shall be treated as Government employees. They shall be entitled to different Government facilities, including but not limited to pension benefits. We are mindful of the fact that the Government has nationalized hundreds of schools and in the process, affirmed the status of the employees and teachers of those schools as Government employees entitled to pension benefits and other benefits. If Rule 2(Ga) is was drafted differently to take account of the entire period of service prior to nationalization, then it would have had severe financial implications on the Government. Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules is therefore, in our view, the mechanism used to reduce the financial exposure and at the same time, provide benefits to the teachers. The learned Counsel for the petitioners submits that as a result of Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules, the petitioners’ “rights and entitlements” have been affected to their prejudice and therefore, Rule 2(Ga) should be struck down. Yes, it can be argued that the effect of Rule 2(Ga) is that the petitioners’ expectation to service benefits is affected; however, expectation is not synonymous to “rights and entitlement”. Loss of expectation of the petitioners cannot be a ground to strike down Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules.</span></p><p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 114%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 114%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">18.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 114%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Now, let us consider the legality of Rule 9 of the 2013 Rules.

In the meantime, the teacher who was nationalized would be working for 5 more years, as nationalized teacher and his total tenure would be 10 years. However, under Rule 9(1) of the 2013 Rules, the direct appointee shall be senior to the teacher who has been nationalized under the 2013 Rules despite the fact that his tenure of service is less than the tenure of service of the nationalized teacher. This is manifestly absurd, particularly when the teachers directly recruited and nationalized teachers are treated at par.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Furthermore, Rule 9(1) of the 2013 Rules provide </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 114%; font-family: TonnyBanglaMJ;">mivmwi wb‡qvMcÖvß me©‡kl e¨w³i wb‡¤œ D³ wkÿ‡Ki Ae¯’vb wba©vwiZ nB‡e|</span></u></strong><u> </u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 114%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">We fail to understand the logic behind this. <u>This means that the teacher who has been nationalized, irrespective of his service as nationalized teacher, would never be senior to the direct appointees, irrespective of the date of appointment</u>.

The interpretation is that a nationalized teacher would not be junior to the direct appointee, irrespective of the date of appointment of the latter; the nationalized teacher would be junior to the <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">direct appointee who was appointed immediately</span> prior to the appointment of the nationalized teacher. On the face of it, this interpretation seems sound; he who is appointed first should be senior. The problem arises because previous tenure of service in the private schools is recognized by the 2013 Rules. On the date when a nationalized teacher is appointed, he carries forward a deemed tenure of service. Under this interpretation, the deemed tenure of service recognized by first part of Rule 9(1) would cease to be recognized by the second part of Rule 9(1). The problem is illustrated by the following example. Y is a nationalized teacher with work experience of 10 years prior to his appointment under the 2013 Rules in say, 2014. His deemed length of service in 2014 i.e. on the date of his appointment, would be 5 years. Z is a direct appointee. Z is appointed immediately before Y. Z’s appointment is in 2013, exactly one year before Y’s appointment. In 2014, on the date of Y’s appointment, Z’s tenure of service would be 1 year. However, because of Rule 9(1) of the 2013 Rules, Y will be deemed to have been in service for 5 years and yet, Y will be regarded as junior to Z because of the following </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: TonnyBanglaMJ;">“<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">D³ Zvwi‡Li Ae¨ewnZ c~‡e© wb‡qvMwewai Aaxb wkÿK c‡` mivmwi wb‡qvMcÖvß me©‡kl e¨w³i wb‡¤œ D³ wkÿ‡Ki Ae¯’vb wba©vwiZ nB‡e|</strong></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> The quoted part of Rule 9(1) of the 2013 Rules, in our view, renders the first part of the Rule 9(1) being </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: TonnyBanglaMJ;">“<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">wkÿ‡Ki wb‡qvM cÖ`v‡bi ZvwiL nB‡Z Kvh©KiPvKzix Kv‡ji wfwË‡Z wkÿK c‡` Zvnvi †R¨ôZv MYbv Kiv nB‡e</strong>”</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> , redundant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It appears that the teachers who are nationalized are affected because their seniority would not be properly recognized.

After taking over possession of the said land, the said Noor Mohammad had been possessing the same by erecting dwelling house and started living therein; during Liberation War, the said Noor Mohammad along with his family left the said house and after liberation he did not come back to the said house and, as such, Government took over possession the same as abandoned property. Thereafter, Mr. Ataharul Hoque, the writ petitioner of the Writ Petition No.5329 of 2006 entered into possession of the said house on 01.05.1972 and started to live therein with his family. He by dint of possession filed an application to the concerned authority for allotting the said House No.3, Lane-11, Block-C, Section-10, Mirpur Housing Estate, Dhaka in his favour. On the basis of the said application the writ respondent No.2 of the Writ Petition No.5329 of 2006 issued a Demand Note on 18.01.1975 upon the applicant with a direction to deposit arrear rent from 01.05.1972 to 31.12.1975 at the rate of Tk.85/- per month amounting to Tk.2,720/- within 23.01.1975. As per direction of the writ respondent No.2 the writ petitioner deposited the said amount of Tk.2,720/- through Challan No.H/47 dated 23.01.1975 as arrear monthly rent of the said house and on the same date it was duly informed to the Executive Engineer, Housing Settlement, Mirpur Division, Segun Bagicha, Dhaka and on 29.01.1975 the same was also duly informed to the office of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Administrative Officer, Mohammadpur and Mirpur Housing Estate Area. Subsequently, the writ petitioner on 03.10.1982 deposited an amount of Tk.510/through Bangladesh Bank Chalan No.Uma/10 and on 29.04.1985 also deposited an amount of Tk.13,134.40 through Bangladesh Bank Chalan No.Jha-3/4 as rents for the said abandoned property. In this way the writ petitioner deposited total amount of Tk.16,364.40 as rents of the said house. Since the original allottee of the property in question had been untraceable and the property in question was uncared in 1972, the property was declared by the Government as abandoned property and it took over the possession in the property as abandoned. The writ petitioner of Writ Petition No.5329 of 2006 has been possessing the same as tenant under the Government since 1972. The Government included the said abandoned Building in the ‘Ka’ list of the Abandoned Buildings at Serial No.43 published in Gazette Notification dated 23.09.1986 at page No.9762 (58).

The such type of absence from the case property does not take away his right and title in respect of case property as he did not left the country, rather had been trying to release the property. Therefore, the Court of Settlement rightly found that Noor Mohammod never left Bangladesh. It was also found by the Court of Settlement that Noor Mohammod had applied for passport and on 24.09.1979 a passport was issued in the name of Noor Mohammod as a <span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt;">permanent resident of Bangladesh. This passport</span> proved that Noor Mohammod was a permanent resident of Bangladesh until death and lived in Bangladesh. He died on 10.02.1987 which has been clearly mentioned in a Death Certificate issued by the Local Commissioner and certificate issued from the concerned authority of the graveyard. Therefore, the Court of Settlement believed the prosecution story thoroughly examining the oral deposition and documentary evidence. The High Court Division without controverting the aforesaid unimpeachable evidence reversed the facts of finding of the Court of Settlement, as if, it is a Court of appeal which is not only beyond the jurisdiction under article 102 of the Constitution, rather, such exercise is colourable and fenciful which is deprecated by this Division. So, the High Court Division under article 102 could not act as a Court of appeal.</span></p><p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">This Division in the long line of catena has already held that the High Court Division only could interfere with the finding of the Court of Settlement, if could be shown that the tribunal had acted without jurisdiction or made findings upon no evidence or without considering any material evidence causing prejudice to a party or it had acted malafide or in violation of any principle of natural justice.

Regardless, our understanding is as follows: the teachers who are nationalized, shall cease to be private employees and shall be treated as Government employees.

We are mindful of the fact that the Government has nationalized hundreds of schools and in the process, affirmed the status of the employees and teachers of those schools as Government employees entitled to pension benefits and other benefits.

The petitioners joined their respective schools as teachers after obtaining the requisite educational qualifications. Subsequently, the petitioners had been promoted as Head Masters of their respective schools, further to the approvals of the concerned District Primary Education Officer. The petitioners have been discharging their functions to the full satisfaction of all concerned. Some of the petitioners were discharging the functions as Head Master from as early as 1990. Though the petitioners had been performing the functions as Head Master, unfortunately, the petitioners did not obtain Pay Scale relevant to the post of Head Masters. The petitioners nevertheless continued to serve as Head Masters of their respective schools. The Government decided to nationalize certain schools. All the schools in which the petitioners are Head Masters had been nationalized.

The 2013 Rules was framed by the Government without taking suggestions from the different stake holders, though such consultation process was required. When the 2013 Rules were available, it transpired that certain provisions cause extreme prejudice to the petitioners and takes away the vested rights. Being aggrieved, the petitioners moved this Division and obtained the Rule.

The respondent No.4 filed an Affidavit in Opposition. With regard to the Rule issuing order, the respondent No.4 states that Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules is legal; the petitioners had voluntarily joined knowing that their service tenure would be reduced and therefore, the petitioners are estopped form raising this issue. Furthermore, since the 2013 Rules were framed in accordance with the procedure laid down under the Primary School (Taking Over) Act 1974, there is no scope for this Division to interfere. In the Affidavit in Opposition, it is stated that the promotion to the post of Head Master can be made if the person has the requisite qualification. Furthermore, to be eligible for promotion to the post of Head Master, the person must be working as Assistant Teacher for 7 years from the date of enlistment in the MPO. After nationalization, the Government issued an order which states that there is no scope to promote Assistant Teachers to Head Masters. Through the Affidavit, it is pointed out that the documents submitted by the petitioners are under challenge and questionable and therefore, this Division should not intervene. Through the Affidavit, the respondent No.4 also points out <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“That the petitioners claim that they are discharging their duties and Headmaster is not true and hence denied”</em>. The respondent No.4 refers to the order passed by the Full Bench of the Hon’ble Appellate Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 4014 of 2018. The Full Bench of the Hon’ble Appellate Division confirmed the order of stay passed by the Hon’ble Judge in Chamber and directed disposal on merit.

In the Affidavit in Opposition, it is stated that under the 2013 Rules, the direct appointees shall have preference over those who were nationalized and therefore, the direct appointees should be made Head Masters. It is also pointed out that on similar matters, the petitioners filed series of writ petition but there was no disclosure and therefore, the Rule and the Supplementary Rule should be discharged.

He submits that if the effective service period is reduced, as has been done by Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules, the petitioners’ entitlement under the 2013 Rules would be detrimentally affected. The learned Counsel submits that delegated legislations are framed to further the objective of the parent legislation. The learned Counsel in support refers to certain decisions of the Supreme Court of India. Taking us through these decisions, the learned Counsel submits that Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules, reducing the “effective service period by half” does not have objective basis and therefore, should be struck down. The learned Counsel referring to Rule 9(1) of the 2013 Rules, submit that due to the operation of Rule 9(1), the seniority of the petitioners would be affected seriously; the petitioners would always remain junior to whoever is appointed directly. This, the learned Counsel submits, is manifestly arbitrary and absurd. Since after nationalization, there is only scope for direct recruitment, the interpretation of Rule 9(1) would be that the petitioners would never be senior to the junior most appointee. The petitioners, as Headmasters, serving for more than 20 years would remain junior to any teacher directly recruited. According to the learned Counsel, if under the 2013 Rules, the effective service is reduced to half, then the revised service period should be taken into account; if that is taken into account, Rule 9(1) of the 2013 Rules cannot stand because this has the effect of “continuous reduction of length of service”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>According to the learned Counsel, Rule 9(1) of the 2013 Rules is manifestly unreasonable, takes away the petitioners’ vested rights and is vague; thus Rule 9(1) should be struck. The learned Counsel submits that for the reasons set out aforesaid, the Rule should be made absolute with appropriate direction upon the respondents.</span></p><p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">We have heard the learned Counsels at length.

This Division in exercise of powers under Article 102 of the Constitution can review the constitutionality of a primary legislation. If this can be done, the legality of a delegated legislation can always be subject to judicial scrutiny. This is the principle settled by the Hon’ble Appellate Division in series of cases. Delegated legislation can be struck down if: (a) the delegated legislation is void because the delegating statute is unconstitutional, (b) <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">the delegated legislation offends the constitutional</span> provisions, (c) the delegated legislation is ultra vires the delegating statute, or (d) the delegated legislation is arbitrary, unreasonable or contrary to any other statutory provisions.

The respondents did not offer any explanation on the rationale of Rule 2(Ga) <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">of the 2013 Rules. Regardless, our understanding</span> is as follows: the teachers who are nationalized, shall cease to be private employees and shall be treated as Government employees. They shall be entitled to different Government facilities, including but not limited to pension benefits. We are mindful of the fact that the Government has nationalized hundreds of schools and in the process, affirmed the status of the employees and teachers of those schools as Government employees entitled to pension benefits and other benefits. If Rule 2(Ga) is was drafted differently to take account of the entire period of service prior to nationalization, then it would have had severe financial implications on the Government. Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules is therefore, in our view, the mechanism used to reduce the financial exposure and at the same time, provide benefits to the teachers. The learned Counsel for the petitioners submits that as a result of Rule 2(Ga) of the 2013 Rules, the petitioners’ “rights and entitlements” have been affected to their prejudice and therefore, Rule 2(Ga) should be struck down. Yes, it can be argued that the effect of Rule 2(Ga) is that the petitioners’ expectation to service benefits is <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">affected; however, expectation is not synonymous</span> to “rights and entitlement”.

The new direct recruit would not, immediately after his appointment, have </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: TonnyBanglaMJ;">PvKzixKvj </span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">of 5 years; the direct appointee must serve as a teacher for 5 years for him to have tenure of service of 5 years. In the meantime, the teacher who was nationalized would be working for 5 more years, as nationalized teacher and his total tenure would be 10 years. However, under Rule 9(1) of the 2013 Rules, the direct appointee shall be senior to the teacher who has been nationalized under the 2013 Rules despite the fact that his tenure of service is less than the tenure of service of the nationalized teacher. This is manifestly absurd, particularly when the teachers directly recruited and nationalized teachers are treated at par.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Furthermore, Rule 9(1) of the 2013 Rules provide </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: TonnyBanglaMJ;">mivmwi wb‡qvMcÖvß me©‡kl e¨w³i wb‡¤œ D³ wkÿ‡Ki Ae¯’vb wba©vwiZ nB‡e|</span></u></strong><u> </u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">We fail to understand the logic behind this. <u>This means that the teacher who has been nationalized, irrespective of his service as nationalized teacher, would never be senior to the direct appointees, irrespective of the date of appointment</u>.

The interpretation is that a nationalized teacher would not be junior to the direct appointee, irrespective of the date of appointment of the latter; the nationalized teacher would be junior to the direct appointee who was appointed immediately prior to the appointment of the nationalized teacher. On the face of it, this interpretation seems sound; he who is appointed first should be senior. The problem arises because previous tenure of service in the private schools is recognized by the 2013 Rules. On the date when a nationalized teacher is appointed, he carries forward a deemed tenure of service. Under this interpretation, the deemed tenure of service recognized by first part of Rule 9(1) would cease to be recognized by the second part of Rule 9(1). The problem is illustrated by the following example. Y is a nationalized teacher with work experience of 10 years prior to his appointment under the 2013 Rules in say, 2014. His deemed length of service in 2014 i.e. on the date of his appointment, would be 5 years. Z is a direct appointee. Z is appointed immediately before Y. Z’s appointment is in 2013, exactly one year before Y’s appointment. In 2014, on the date of Y’s appointment, Z’s tenure of service would be 1 year. However, because of Rule 9(1) of the 2013 Rules, Y will be deemed to have been in service for 5 years and yet, Y will be regarded as junior to Z because of the following </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: TonnyBanglaMJ;">“<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">D³ Zvwi‡Li Ae¨ewnZ c~‡e© wb‡qvMwewai Aaxb wkÿK c‡` mivmwi wb‡qvMcÖvß me©‡kl e¨w³i wb‡¤œ D³ wkÿ‡Ki Ae¯’vb wba©vwiZ nB‡e|</strong></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> The quoted part of Rule 9(1) of the 2013 Rules, in our view, renders the first part of the Rule 9(1) being “</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: TonnyBanglaMJ;">wkÿ‡Ki wb‡qvM cÖ`v‡bi ZvwiL nB‡Z Kvh©KiPvKzix Kv‡ji wfwË‡Z wkÿK c‡` Zvnvi †R¨ôZv MYbv Kiv nB‡e</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: TonnyBanglaMJ;">”</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> , redundant. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">17.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It appears that the teachers who are nationalized are affected because their seniority would not be properly recognized.

The learned Advocate<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>further submits that there is no satisfactory explanation from the side of the petitioners as to why the unusual delay of 3343 days occurred and it is a decided matter in our judicature that inasmuch as from the conduct of the petitioners it is apparent that they have preferred a review application before the appellate court after disposal of the appeal which is admittedly the wrong forum and that was chosen by the defendant-petitioner-applicants themselves, it cannot be treated sufficient cause within the meaning of section 05 of the Limitation Act.

Besides this; the ground of the application for condonation of delay as it appears is not proper to hold such a view that the mistake done by the plaintiff-appellant-petitioner was bonafide and she was diligent in filing the civil revision within time. Cause of delay as cited within the contents of the application under section 5 of the Limitation Act (IX of 1908) appears to be evasive and it is no doubt that only due to self-impression of the petitioner this delay of 2091 days occurred; which is not at all satisfactory.

It appears from the original Writ Petition that affidavit of the same was sworn on 05.10.2017. The petitioner served notice to the office of the Attorney General vide serial No.13476 dated 05.10.2017. From the cause list dated 05.10.2017 it appears that the same appeared as item No.70 in the cause list of the said Division Bench of the High Court Division on the same date, i.e. 05.10.2017. It is the usual practice of the Court that the Bench Officer, on receiving the writ petition, would post the petition in the cause list of the next working day and send the same to the press for publication through concerned officials. That is, in order to post the instant writ petition on 05.10.2017, concerned Bench Officer, at least, should have received the said writ petition on 04.10.2017 for communicating its number and names of the parties to the press for publishing the same in the cause list of the next date, that is, on 05.10.2017 keeping the petition in the custody of the Court. In such view of the matter, it is apparent that posting of the writ petition on 05.10.2017, that is, on the date of swearing affidavit and serving notice to the office of Attorney General, was unusual and result of manipulation and highhandedness.

It is to be mentioned here that Section 13(3) of Artha Rin Adalat Ain provides that if at any stage of the suit, the statement in the plaint of the plaintiff be admitted by the defendant out of his written statement or by any other means and the plaintiff submits a petition in the Court praying for such judgment or order as he is entitled to on the basis of such admission, the Court will pass suitable judgment or order without waiting for setting other points in issue existing among the plaintiff and the defendant. Here, in this case, prayer for decree was filed by the defendant not by the plaintiff. The law, as mentioned above, does not provide any provision to file such application by the defendant . Another important aspect of this case is that the defendant in its application (annexure-“B” to the writ petition) prayed for passing decree in following terms:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: SutonnyBanglaMJ; mso-bidi-font-family: SutonnyMJ;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">            </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Ò1| Dc‡iv³fv‡e 46140 eM©dzU (1g c¶ I nvivnvwifv‡e Rwgi g~j¨ mn †gvU g~j¨ 184,56,00,000/- (GKkZ Pzivwk †KvwU Qvcvboe j¶) UvKv nB‡Z FY I my` mn 126,00,00,000/- (GKkZ Qvweek †KvwU) XvKv FY mgb¡q nB‡e GB g‡g© †gvKÏgvwU wWμx nB‡e| ev`x evKx 48,56,00,000/- (AvU Pwj¬k †KvwU Qvcvboe j¶) UvKv Gg,Avi, †U«wWs Gi eiv e‡i wWμxi ZvwiL nB‡Z 30(wÎk) w`‡bi g‡a¨ †dir †`Iqvi wWμx nB‡e|</strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: SutonnyBanglaMJ; mso-bidi-font-family: SutonnyMJ;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">            </span>2| D³ F‡bi wecix‡Z ev`x e¨vs‡K RãK…Z eμx 8 Zjv, A_©¨vr 2,61,460 (`yB j¶ GKlwÆ nvRvi PvikZ lvU) eM©dzU †¯úm 20wU Kgb †¯úm mn 37, w`jKzkv evwbwR¨K GjvKvi f~wg mn eÜKK…Z m¤úwË GB weev`x Gg,Avi, †U«wWs †Kvs Gi eive‡i wWμxi `vex nB‡Z 30 (wÎk) w`‡bi g‡a¨ (AcvV¨) K‡i †`Iqvi wWμx nB‡e|Ó </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">18.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times-Roman',serif; mso-bidi-font-family: Times-Roman;">Maintainability of such prayer for decreeing the suit, at the instance of the defendant, regarding his claim in Artha Rin Suit and jurisdiction of </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">the Adalat to pass such decree in favour of the defendant was vital issue in the suits but the High Court Division did not allow the Adalat to consider such issue by commanding/dictating the Adalat to decree the suits. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">19.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Earlier the Adalat, on perusal of the <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">application as well as the agreement, particularly,</span> terms No. b,e,g,h and i of the same, rejected the said application.

It is not understood, how the High Court Division could direct the Adalat to decree the suits before setting aside the order No.19 dated 27.09.2017 and also before hearing of the National Bank Ltd. and Agrani Bank Ltd, the two plaintiffs of the said suit. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">21.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">From the ad-interim order passed in the said writ petition, it appears that the said Division Bench of the High Court Division directed Artha Rin Adalat to pass a decree for an amount of Tk.126 Crore in Artha Rin Suit No.382 of 2016 and Tk.10(ten) Crore in Artha Rin Suit No.1618 of 2016, that is, in total for a sum of Tk.136 crore and it also directed to return the rest of the sale proceeds amounting to Tk.48,56,00,000/- to the writ petitioner within 7 days after adjustment of the aforesaid loan amount and to redeem the rest of the mortgaged property. Even after final hearing of writ petition the defendant writ petitioner was not entitled to get such order since the High Court Division cannot dictate any Court to pass a decree mentioning the terms and conditions of the agreement, if any, without examining the validity of such agreement upon hearing the other party to the said agreement. Even the High Court Division itself did not bother to examine the alleged agreement nor as to whether the application filed by the defendant with the prayer quoted above was maintainable or not.

Though no Rule was issued in respect of the Artha Rin Suit No.1618 of 2016, the said Bench of the High Court Division also directed to decree the suit in respect Artha Rin Case No.1618 of 2016 as well, which was not only unprecedented but under no circumstance can be sustained in law.

Even the High Court Division did not bother to allow the Artha Rin Adalat to examine the witnesses to prove the alleged memorandum of understanding and to ascertain as to whether the same was genuine and lawful or not and the same was entertainable and enforceable in the Artha Rin Adalat or not. Perhaps this is the only case, where the defendant not being a bank or a financial institution obtained decree for Tk. 48,56,00,000/- after adjustment of the entire loan amount and got an order of redemption of mortgaged property without filing any suit in the competent court or making set off or counter claim, though not permissible in the Artha Adalat Ain.

That Bench of the High Court Division also directed him to appear before the Court in person on 12.05.2019 at 10.30 a.m. to give explanation with regard to non-compliance of the order passed by the High Court Division dated 05.10.2017 in Writ Petition No.13673 of 2017, when at the instance of the writ petitioner-respondent the said Rule was discharged as not being pressed, consequently, ad-interim direction given by the High Court Division became non-est. In fact, a gigantic fraud has been committed upon the Court inasmuch as the writ petitioner was active in concealing the facts having full knowledge of the fact that the interim order passed in Writ Petition No.13673 of 2017 does not exist. Having full knowledge the respondent resorted to such fraudulent attempt of misleading another Bench of the High Court Division only to harass and humiliate Chowdhury Mustaq Ahmed, the Managing Director of National Bank Ltd. bringing contempt petition against him. It is to be mentioned here that Mr. Md. Humayun Bashar, learned Advocate prepared both the writ petition and the contempt petition in his office and put his signatures in both the vokalatnamas. Said Humayun Bashar himself prayed for nonprosecution of the Rule issued in Writ Petition No.13673 of 2017 and got the order discharging the said Rule. Knowing full well about the said order discharging the Rule he prepared and filed the contempt petition on behalf of the contempt petitioner respondent No.1 and, thereby, deliberately committed fraud upon the Court.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">26.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">It is settled principle that the relief which cannot be granted in the Rule should not be granted in the interim prayer.

The main purpose of passing an interim order is to evolve a workable formula or the workable arrangement to the extent called for by the demands of the situation. It is well settled that an interim order merges with the final order and does not exist by itself. An interim order would be non-est in the eye of law when the Rule is discharged. It must, in such circumstances, take effect as if there were no interim order. Here in this case, the respondent hurriedly obtained the interim order and rushed to the Artha Rin Adalat and obtained the decrees as mentioned above.

The said order was non-est in the eye of law because the Rule issued in the said writ petition was discharged long before initiation of contempt proceeding.

Suppression of the fact of getting the Rule discharged and production of such non-est interim direction at the time of filing of the contempt petition bringing allegation of violation of the said non-est interim order and obtaining Rule on such misconceived contempt petition is tantamount to practising fraud upon the Court.

It is also an admitted position that the defendant-opposite parties are claiming their title and possession by dint of the disputed kabala deeds which are 06(six) in numbers and described in schedule ‘Ga’ of the plaint. I have come across from the copy of plaint that the plaintiff-petitioners instituted the original suit being Civil Suit No.210 of 2014 challenging the aforesaid title documents of the defendant-opposite parties. It is the positive contention within the pleadings of the plaintiffs that the defendants have created the forged kabala deeds in their names which were not acted upon and no possession was delivered in favour of the defendants by the plaintiff No.1 Hajera Begum. The further case of the petitioners is such that the sub-kabala deeds in the name of defendants are forged, collusive, without consideration, illegal and not binding upon the plaintiffs.

Subsequently, the ‘Ka’ schedule land has been transferred by the heirs of C.S. recorded tenant in favour of one Ibrahim and others by a registered sub-kabala dated 15.09.1950. The purchasers were 05(five) full brothers and the S.A. record of rights was correctly prepared in their names. The suit land by amicable partition among the brothers developed upon one brother namely Md. Khalil and subsequently Md. Khalil transferred the suit land in favour of the plaintiff No.1 Hajera Begum and two others. The owner of the land Md.

It is also an admitted position that the defendant-opposite parties are claiming their title and possession by dint of the disputed kabala deeds which are 06(six) in numbers and described in schedule ‘<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Ga’</strong> of the plaint. I have come across from the copy of plaint that the plaintiff-petitioners instituted the original suit being Civil Suit No.210 of 2014 challenging the aforesaid title documents of the defendant-opposite parties. It is the positive contention within the pleadings of the plaintiffs that the defendants have created the forged kabala deeds in their names which were not acted upon and no possession was delivered in favour of the defendants by the plaintiff No.1 Hajera Begum. The further case of the petitioners is such that the sub-kabala deeds in the name of defendants are forged, collusive, without consideration, illegal and not binding upon the plaintiffs. For cancellation of the said deeds, the original suit was instituted by their mother Hajera Begum, which is awaiting for disposal on merit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 24.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">12.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Having gone through the relevant papers I also find that the learned trial court during <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">disposal of the application for temporary injunction</span> rightly appraised the proposition of law as <span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt;">incorporated in the law of temporary injunction.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 24.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">13.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The provisions laid down in Order XXXIX rule 1/2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Act No.V of 1908) contemplates that the imperative points of determination for temporary injunction is: Firstly; as to whether the applicants have strong prima-facie arguable case with that of the opposite parties.

The series of papers which were produced from the side of the plaintiff-petitioners go to show that the plaintiff-petitioners in respect of the suit property have acquired a strong prima-facie case and on the contrary the defendants have totally failed to produce any paper showing their <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">bonafide</em> or prima-facie case in respect of the property described in the schedule of the plaint. The learned appellate court during disposal of the appeal was totally misconceived in holding the view that apparently the 06(six) sub-kabala deeds dated 11.09.1981 stands registered in favour of the defendants, which were executed by the plaintiff No.1 Hajera Begum. Apart from this; the learned appellate court also filed to appreciate that, it is a matter of evidence as to whether the plaintiff-petitioner Hajera Begum was in the know about the execution and registration of the deeds under challenge. Prior to disposal of the suit on merit, scanning the evidences adduced from the sides of the respective parties, there is no scope at this stage to draw such inference that the executant of the deeds, the plaintiff Hajera Begum knew about the transfer and its registration. Furthermore, she was in the know about the pre-emption cases, which were gone upto the Hon’ble Appellate Division. It is a fact that in respect of the kabala deeds there were 06(six) pre-emption miscellaneous cases by one Syed Azharul Kabir, but upto the Hon’ble Appellate Division the petitioner to that case Azharul Kabir failed and in that cases Hajera Begum was one of the opposite party. Nevertheless, the existence of Hajera Begum or her presence in the pre-emption miscellaneous cases is not a legal barrier to challenge the deeds as challenged by her in the present suit for cancellation of the instruments.</span></p><div style="mso-element: footnote-list;"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 24.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">15.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Be that as it may, I am constrained to hold such a view that the learned Additional District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Dhaka during disposal of the Miscellaneous Appeal No.01 of 2017 committed gross illegality and infirmity.

It is the duty of the prosecution to prove that the accused person is guilty of the offence, as charged, beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of which the Court is to deliver judgment holding either the accused guilty of the charge as framed or not guilty. Under the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Ain, 2000, the special tribunal constituted thereunder is the trial Court who shall frame charge under some specific provision of the said law considering the allegations and prima facie case as made out and thereafter shall come to a conclusion on examining the materials on record as to whether the accused is guilty or not of the charge as leveled against him. On trial if the Court/Tribunal, as the case may be, on consideration of materials on record, finds that the offence committed does not fall under the charge framed then the trial court can alter the charge into some other section of the said law under which the offence falls. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">  </span>. . .

Nurul Amin Baitha, son of late Abdus Samad of the same village before thirty years. Since marriage she used to stay with her husband at his house, at village Basuralga. During their wedlock they had two sons, two daughters and on the date of occurrence she was five months’ pregnant. Since marriage her husband used to demand dowry of Tk.50,000/- and on her failure to bring the same she was subjected to physical torture off and on. Prior to the date of occurrence the respondent No. 1 married Anjumanara Begum (respondent No. 2) as second wife. On 18.2.2005 corresponding to 6th Falgun, 1411 B.S., Friday, at around 4.00 p.m. Nurul Amin Baitha (Respondent No.1) embroiled in a quarrel with his wife Hasna Begum (deceased). At one stage of quarrel </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">when Hasna Begum asked Nurul Amin about the second marriage he became furious and again demanded Tk.50,000/- as dowry to be paid at once. On her refusal to pay the same, her husband along with Anjuara Begum, the 2nd wife (respondents No. 1 and 2 respectively) started inflicting fists and blows causing severe injuries upon the person of Hasna Begum. At one stage, finding her in critical condition, they called the village doctor Aminul Islam and on his advice Hasna Begum was taken to the ‘Nakla Health Complex’ at around 8 pm, where, she succumbed to the injuries on the next day, i.e. on 19.2.2005 at around 11.30 a.m. Then the respondents took the dead body back to the house of respondent No.1 and upon leaving the dead body at the courtyard of that house they fled away. The relatives of the deceased upon hearing about the occurrence reported the same to the police at Chandrakona Investigation Centre, whereupon the incident was recorded as General Diary (GDE) No.407 dated 19.2.2005. Thereafter on 26.2.2005 Md. Abdul Mannan (PW 2), younger brother of the deceased, filed a complaint petition in the Court of Magistrate (cognizance), Sherpur, narrating the above facts, which was referred to the local Police Station for inquiry. After inquiry and on perusal of the inquest report and the post mortem report, S.I. Amirul Islam of Chandrakona Investigation Centre (PW1), as informant, lodged the FIR on 5.4.2005 which was recorded as Nakla P.S. Case No. 04 dated 05.04.2005 corresponding to G.R.

Moreover, subsequent actions of the convicts as to bringing the dead body from the Thana Health Complex to the accused respondents’ house and fleeing away clearly indicate their involvement in the offence and as such the High Court Division committed error in converting the conviction from 11(Ka)/30 of the Ain, 2000 to section 302/34 of the Penal Code and thereby modifying the sentence from death penalty to life imprisonment is as such required to be interfered with.

Framing of charge is dealt with under Chapter XIX (sections 221 to 240) of the Code. Similarly other laws also deal with the same under specific provisions of each such law. It is the duty of the prosecution to prove that the accused person is guilty of the offence, as charged, beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of which the Court is to deliver judgment holding either the accused guilty of the charge as framed or not guilty. Under the Nari-OShishu Nirjatan Damon Ain, 2000, the special tribunal constituted thereunder is the trial Court who shall frame charge under some specific provision of the said law considering the allegations and prima facie case as made out and thereafter shall come to a conclusion on examining the materials on record as to whether the accused is guilty or not of the charge as leveled against him. On trial if the Court/Tribunal, as the case may be, on consideration of materials on record, finds that the offence committed does not fall under the charge framed then the trial court can alter the charge into some other section of the said law under which the offence falls. But the question is whether such conversion is permissible in a case where the charge has been framed by the tribunal under a special law to the provision under the Penal Code.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">16.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">The power of the appellate Court in case of appeal against conviction is provided under <span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt;">section 423(I)(b) of the Code.

Hence the power of the appellate Court is limited to decide whether the order of conviction and sentence was passed in accordance with law and whether the accused was or was not rightly convicted as charged. Thus in the case of conviction of an offence under the Nari O Shishu Nirjaton Daman Ain 2000 the appellate court is only to perform its functions within the purview of law under which the accused has been tried and convicted. The appellate Court cannot exercise its power in converting the charge from one provision of one particular law to another provision of another law, more particularly from a special law to general law. Conversion of charge by the appellate court is available under the Criminal Procedure Code. But under the Special Law like Nari-O-Shishu Nirjaton Damon Ain, 2000 no such power is given to the appellate Court. The offence described in the Ain 2000 is to be tried by the Tribunal established under section 26 of the said Ain. The tribunal, while discharging its functions, is to follow the procedure laid down in the said Ain and by section 25 of the said Ain only those provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code have been made applicable which are not contrary to the said Ain. Section 3 of the said Ain provides supremacy of the said Ain, 2000 over any other law in force for the time being.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">20.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; letter-spacing: -.3pt;">In the present case, tribunal framed charge</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;"> against the respondents under section 11(ka)/30 of the Ain 2000, and the Tribunal having found the aforesaid charges proved against them imposed death penalty upon them under the said provisions of law by judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 19.4.2010.

And, in order to do complete justice in the matter, we invoke our power under Article 104 of the Constitution and dispose of the appeal finally without sending the case back on remand for trial afresh by the concerned Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Gaibandha, under the Ain, 2000. Accordingly, we find the appellants guilty under section 7 of the said Ain and sentence each of them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 14 years and also to pay a fine of Taka 2,000 each in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 3 (three) months more.” </em>In the aforesaid case, this Division, accordingly, set aside the judgment and order of conviction and sentence of death passed under section 302/34 of the Penal Code which was confirmed by the High Court Division and thereby acquitted them of the charges brought under the said provision of the Penal Code but convicted and sentenced them under section 7 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000, as from the materials on record the offence committed by the accused persons were proved beyond reasonable doubt, upon exercising the power conferred under Article 104 of the Constitution.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">24.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">As we have discussed earlier that both, the tribunal as well as the High Court Division, found that the victim died because of the assaults inflicted by the accused persons and as such commission of the offence of murder has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt. The learned Deputy Attorney General also could not improve the case beyond that level which could bring the case within the purview of section 11(ka)/30 of the Ain 2000. This Division also on examination of the evidence adduced by PWs 1 to 7, the eye witness, and the materials on record along with the post mortem report, proved by PW.10, and as such we are also satisfied that the case of ’committing murder’ has been proved beyond reasonable doubt but the case of ’murder for dowry’ has not been proved as none of the PWs could prove the same. Thus we are of the view that the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Sherpur, committed illegality in passing the judgment and order of conviction and sentence of death under section 11(Ka)/30 of the said Ain of 2000 as the prosecution miserably failed to prove the charge of committing murder for dowry, and thereby causing serious miscarriage of justice. Rather the findings of the High Court Division in this respect appear to be in accordance with law. Thus the respondents are liable to be punished for the commission of such offence under Penal Code. Accordingly the finding of the High Court Division on this score appears to be correct. But the High Court Division was not right in converting the conviction under section 302/34 of the Penal Code from those of under section 11(ka)/30 of the Ain 2000, a special law, as it does not have that authority to do so unless charge is framed under section 302/34 of the Penal Code.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">25.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">It has already been discussed before that the trial Court is to frame charge against the accused person and read over the same to the accused person so that he/she can defend himself/herself. Side by side relying on the said charge the prosecution is to prove that the accused is guilty of offence as charged. Under section 27 of the Ain, 2000 the tribunal is not only empowered to frame charge it is also empowered to frame charge in respect of some other offences which are relevant for the purpose of proving the accused guilty in addition to the prima facie offence. Unless charge is framed and proved beyond all reasonable doubt by the prosecution the accused cannot be convicted. In the present case admittedly no charge was framed under section 302/34 of the Penal Code considering the nature of offence committed by the accused persons which the tribunal could frame under section 27 of this Ain along with section 11(Ka)/30 of the Ain 2000. From the above discussions, it is clear that it would not be improper to send the case down to the appropriate Court for framing charge under the appropriate provision of law and allow the accused person(s) to defend against such charge framed. But in this case, an exceptional circumstance appears which is, immediately after the commission of the offence the accused No.1(respondent No.1) is absconding and accused No.2(respondent No.2) after being arrested on 11.4.2005 and making statement under section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code, was enlarged on bail from the lower Court and since then she is also absconding and she did not appear for a single day before the Court of law meaning both the accused persons are fugitive from justice. A fugitive, who has been running away from justice, without surrendering before the Court of law in last 17(seventeen) years and having not challenged the verdicts of either of the Courts passed in absentia, by preferring appeal he/she cannot take advantage of any mistake either procedural or otherwise.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">26.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">All these aspects have not been considered by the High Court Division while passing the impugned judgment and order and without considering these aspects the High Court Division simply converted the conviction and modified the sentence from section 11(ka)/30 of the Ain 2000 to section 302/34 of the Penal Code. The statute has not entrusted the High Court Division to exercise such power of conversion of conviction. Because conversion of conviction from special law to a different law can only be done by the Appellate Division empowered under Article 104 of the Constitution to do ”complete justice“ in appropriate cases pending before it under Article 103 of the Constitution. The Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh is the supreme law of the land under which the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, being the apex Court, has been bestowed with such power under Article 104.
