Pursuant to the conditions of the Notifications of Awards, the petitioner furnished Bank Guarantee/Performance Security issued by the Standard Chartered Bank bearing Bank Guarantee Nos. 411020278783 dated 03.08.2015 and 411020278774 dated 03.08.2015 for an amount of €62,500.00 (Euro Sixty Two Thousand Five Hundred) each in the format proposed by the BMPCUL.

Pursuant to the Contracts, the Purchase Orders and the L/Cs, the petitioner procured all the required components and equipments from several different sources, including internationally reputed manufacturers, for the supply of goods and related services for Chilled Water Plant for BDP and DDP. Subsequently, there were various correspondences between the petitioner and the BMPCUL regarding the pre-shipment inspection (PSI) of the said goods and, eventually, on 14.04.2016, the petitioner sent a letter to the BMPCUL notifying that the said goods were ready for inspection with a request to perform the PSI tests through the BMPCUL’s appointed PSI company, Continental Inspection Co.

Upon inspection, the PSI company did not issue PSI certificate, nor did it issue any communication pertaining to any technical or other discrepancies. Thereafter, it came to the knowledge of the petitioner that the PSI company by sending a letter on 27.04.2016 to the BMPCUL pointed out some discrepancies about the Item No. 1.1 (Ice Thermal Storage Unit), Item No. 1.6 (Evaporative Condenser) and about the Motor. Notwithstanding the discrepancy raised by the PSI company, the BMPCUL’s PSI team, which includes a specialist from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), issued a clean pre-shipment inspection certificate on 29.04.2016 (“BMPCUL’s certificate”). Immediately after obtaining the BMPCUL’s certificate, the petitioner shipped the said goods to Bangladesh, which arrived at the Chittagong Port in June-2016 but the BMPCUL denied to accept the said goods due to non-conformity to the terms of the L/Cs with respect to the country of origin. It is stated that although the L/Cs stipulate at sight payment, subject to furnishing of a PSI certificate together with other documents, the BMPCUL’s bank, i.e. the Sonali Bank Ltd refused to clear the payment due under the L/Cs as per the BMPCUL’s instructions despite furnishing all the documents. The BMPCUL has been made aware of the petitioner’s ordeal as to incurring huge demurrage at the Chattogram Port at numerous times vide e-Mails, letters, phone-calls and face-to-face meetings in Dhaka. The petitioner has made numerous requests to the BMPCUL, both in writing and during meetings, to amend and extend the terms of the L/Cs and thereby amicably resolve the matter, but the BMPCUL has continuously and unreasonably rejected such requests although the shipped equipments met all material technical specifications as required under the Contracts, POs and the L/Cs, which have been certified in the BMPCUL’s Certificate. Subsequently, the BMPCUL sent a letter dated 18.06.2016 stating that the BMPCUL would extend the L/Cs only if the following conditions were met: (a) the petitioner would have to release shipped machineries from the Chattogram Sea Port at its own cost and liabilities and (b) payments due under the L/Cs will be made after a full year following successful installation of the plants. In response to the above conditions, the petitioner vide letter dated 29.06.2016 proposed some favorable payment terms for the BMPCUL. Since then, the BMPCUL did not attempt to resolve the issues regarding the country of origin in good faith, nor is the BMPCUL concerned about the rising cost of demurrages. More so, the BMPCUL has unreasonably refused to extend the term of the L/Cs and amend the appropriate clauses thereof, all of which have raised a ‘dispute’ between the petitioner and the BMPCUL. The petitioner has attempted and failed, at numerous times, to resolve the dispute through an amicable settlement. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l2 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">It is stated that in view of dispute as to the extension of the terms of the L/Cs and the amendment of the appropriate clauses, the petitioner had invoked the arbitration clause. It is further stated that the relevant clause of the Particular Conditions of Contract (PCC) empowers the BMPCUL to choose the law from among (i) the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Arbitration Rules 1976, (ii) the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), (iii) the Rules of Arbitration of the Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (ISCC) and (iv) the Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA). The petitioner had invoked the multi-option arbitration provision contained in GCC Clause 47.3 read with the relevant PCC clauses and intended to commence the arbitration proceedings by sending two notices of arbitration to the BMPCUL on 24.11.2016 and 05.12.2016 respectively. The BMPCUL, disregarding the petitioner’s request for arbitration, sent a letter under Memo No. PD/CWP(D)/LC-10/2013/46 dated 30.11.2016 informing the petitioner that the BMPCUL shall not allow the extension of the L/C validity and has decided to cancel the said contracts and the L/Cs.

Thereafter, by a letter dated 21.05.2018, the petitioner reiterated its intention to commence arbitration to resolve the dispute at the BMPCUL’s earliest convenience having appointed Mr. AM Amin Uddin, a Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, as one of the arbitrators, with a request to the BMPCUL to appoint its arbitrator within 30 (thirty) days of receipt of the letter, so that the two appointed-arbitrators may choose the third arbitrator who shall be Chairman of the arbitral tribunal. Then, the BMPCUL, vide its letter dated 25.06.2018, refused to appoint an arbitrator claiming that there is no dispute between the petitioner and the BMPCUL.

In addition to the PSI company’s inspection, a three-member team of the BMPCUL will inspect the Chilled Water Plant for BDP prior to shipment in the manufacturer’s workshop. All the related costs i.e. both-way air tickets, food, lodging, local transport and pocket money of at least USD 100.00 per day for each representative for 07 (seven) days will be borne by the supplier. The same representative will issue PSI certificate which will form part and parcel of the shipping documents for drawing payment. Advance copies of the shipping documents must be sent to the cited addresses at least 07 (seven) days before the expected date of arrival of the consignment at the destination of the Chattogram Sea Port, Bangladesh and the invoice should contain full information such as item, weight, measurement value etc. Bill of lading should indicate freight prepaid. L/C Nos. 033015010605 (“L/C 1”) and 033015010606 (“L/C 2”), both dated 01.09.2015, were issued against the Purchase Order (PO) 1 and the Purchase Order (PO) 2 respectively (collectively referred to as the “L/Cs”). However, the PSI company of the BMPCUL vide their report dated 27.04.2016 informed that the supplier did not provide any testing facility to its inspector at the time of inspection in Belgium. The supplier arranged only visual inspection to its inspector and its inspector conducted only visual inspection of the subject consignment in Belgium on 25.04.2016 for Item No. 1.1 (Ice Thermal Storage Unit) and Item No. 1.6 (Evaporative Condenser) and found the following discrepancies: (i) For Item No. 1.1 (Ice Thermal Storage Unit), its inspector found the country of origin to be Belgium; instead of Italy, (ii) For Item No. 1.6 (Evaporative Condenser), its inspector found its Model No. VSC-250; instead of VXC-C250 and the country of origin to be Belgium; instead of Italy and (iii) Motor was found by Siemens, Germany; instead of Baltimore Air Coil (BAC), Italy. And, as per the report of the PSI company dated 30.04.2016, it was also detected that (iv) For Item No: 1.2, Volume of the Refrigerant Receiver was found 2610 Ltr; instead of 3000 Ltr, (v) For Item No: 1.3 (Single Stage Reciprocating Compressor) running speed, capacity control, power consumption of motor and insulation protection (whether it is IP 23 or not) are not mentioned on the name-plate of the motor. It is alleged that the petitioner with ill-motive shipped discrepant machineries on 30.04.2016 without informing the BMPCUL and without obtaining PSI certificate from the PSI agent of the BMPCUL which is evidenced by the Bill of Lading provided by the carrier. Thereafter, the petitioner sent letter to the BMPCUL requesting for extension of L/C dated 24.05.2016.

The supplier company, thereafter, without resolving the discrepancies wrote letters on 01.06.2016 and 07.06.2016 having tried to explain the situation as to why the discrepancies arose, in an attempt to persuade the BMPCUL that the equipments shipped are of superior model and would be of the expected performance and earnestly requested the BMPCUL to accept the goods. The petitioner, without any legal authority, wrote a letter to the PSI company (Continental Inspection Company) on 08.06.2016 to issue PSI certificate.

Again, the supplier wrote a letter on 09.07.2016 for extension of L/Cs. Subsequently, several meetings were held for amicable settlement of the dispute with an aim to arrive at a conclusive decision between the BMPCUL and the supplier. Finally, the supplier by its letter dated 27.07.2016 confirmed the BMPCUL to take back the goods. It is claimed by the BMPCUL that as per the terms of the settlement, it provided all sorts of support as required for example; the BMPCUL, as per the request of the petitioner, wrote a letter to the Sonali Bank dated 27.07.2016 and the Sonali Bank accorded NOC on 28.07.2016; the petitioner wrote a letter to the BMPCUL for appointment of C&amp;F Agent for re-shipping purpose dated 31.07.2016 and, accordingly, the BMPCUL wrote a letter to the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports who accorded NOC on 01.08.2016, the BMPCUL wrote a letter to the Commissioner of Customs, Chattogram on 01.08.2016 and accorded their permission for re-shipment on 31.08.2018; Pursuant to the petitioner’s request, the BMPCUL wrote a letter to the customs authority for permission for taking back the goods by the petitioner on 01.08.2016. Thereafter, the BMPCUL wrote a letter to the petitioner’s C&amp;F Agent ‘Transmire’ on 01.08.2018, but the petitioner when requested for appointing ‘Oshin Enterprise’ as its C&amp;F Agent on 03.08.2016, the BMPCUL, as per the request of the petitioner, issued a letter of authorization to the new C&amp;F Agent (Oshin Enterprise) on 03.08.2016. In the meantime, an auction letter was issued by the customs authority on 31.07.2016 which was received on 08.08.2016 by the BMPCUL and the BMPCUL then sent a request letter to the customs authority to stop auction process on 08.08.2016. A request letter from the petitioner was received by the BMPCUL on 09.08.2016 for endorsement of shipping documents for taking back the entire consignments, the BMPCUL then sent a letter on 10.08.2016 to the Sonali Bank to endorse the documents for re-shipping. As per the request of the BMPCUL, the Sonali Bank endorsed the documents for re-shipping of the concerned goods vide letter dated 11.08.2016. When the customs authority again sent the letter dated 10.08.2016 for auction sale of the goods, the BMPCUL requested the customs authority to stop the auction sale vide the letter dated 23.08.2016. The petitioner further requested the BMPCUL to send a letter to the Bangladesh Bank for issuing NOC for re-shipping of the consignment on 31.08.2016 and the BMPCUL sent a request letter to the Sonali Bank to obtain the NOC from the Bangladesh Bank on 03.09.2016; the Sonali Bank requested the Bangladesh Bank for NOC for re-shipping vide letter dated 04.09.2016 and it accorded permission vide letters dated 19.09.2016 and 21.09.2016. Thereafter, the petitioner surprisingly, by taking a U-turn, sent a letter to the BMPCUL for amendment of the L/Cs on 29.09.2016, to which the BMPCUL replied on 26.10.2018. The petitioner sent a letter requesting the BMPCUL for extension of the L/Cs on 27.10.2016 and the petitioner also sent a letter to the BMPCUL to take steps to stop the auction sale on 31.10.2016 and the BMPCUL sent a letter for that purpose to the customs authority on 08.11.2016.

For avoiding the future legal complexities over this international purchase by the BMPCUL, while the BMPCUL at that point of time could have straight-a-way rejected the proposal of the petitioner on the plea of nonconformity to the terms of the L/Cs, this Court takes judicial notice of the conduct of the concerned officials of the BMPCUL that they agreed to accept the goods. Had the BMPCUL right-away cancelled the contract on the ground of admitted infraction of the terms of the contract, purchase orders and the L/Cs, the supplier (the petitioner) would not have insisted upon the BMPCUL for taking the matter to the arbitration. Another unusual fact also has caught sight of this Court that despite finding inconsistencies in the goods at the time of pre-shipment inspection by the appointed PSI company, on 29.04.2016 how did the specialist team issue the pre-shipment inspection certificate (PSI) in the following terms ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The discrete components, which form part of the Chilled Water Plant, have been physically verified and <u>are as mentioned in the purchase order.</u> At the time of <u>inspection it was found that the goods were ready for shipment</u>, which will be assembled at the BMPCUL site.’</em> (emphasis added) This Court also has taken judicial notice of the conduct of the supplier (petitioner) that when evidently there was a non-compliance to the terms of the L/Cs, how did the petitioner dare to take the risk of shipping the goods to the Chattogram Port. These are apparently some mysterious eventual facts, which require to be investigated by the high officials of the concerned regulatory/ controlling ministry of the country and, if any illegalities surface, disciplinary action against the delinquent should be taken as per the recommendation of the investigating authority. However, in reply to the proposal made by the BMPCUL vide letter dated 18.06.2016, when the petitioner made a counter offer with regard to the mode of payment and, ultimately, they failed to reach an agreement with regard to mode of payment, eventually, the petitioner requested the BMPCUL to assist the petitioner in taking back the goods to its country, so that it can re-ship the goods as per the terms and conditions of the L/C. In other words, in order to re-ship the goods upon assembling those from the country of origin being Italy to the BMPCUL, the petitioner agreed to take back the goods lying at the Chattogram Port, as evident from the petitioner’s letter dated 23.06.2016, which is quoted below; </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 112%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">“In order to provide an amicable settlement, it is hereby agreed that the shipped Ice Bank Tank and Condenser, as the purchaser do not accept the origin Belgium, although ice bank tanks were inspected and verified by <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">the BMPCUL inspection team in Belgium,</span> will be taken back to the manufacturer <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">Baltimore Company and <u>we will supply</u></span><u> the Ice Bank Tank and Condenser from Italy”.</u> (underlined by me)</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l2 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">The petitioner, thereafter, again wrote to the BMPCUL on 27.07.2016 in the following language; </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 112%; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">“I am writing to request that you permit us to reship the above-mentioned consignment back to Turkey.

It is the case of the petitioner that if the tenure of the L/Cs is not extended, there is no question of taking back the goods inasmuch as, in that case, the petitioner shall not be able to resupply the goods to the BMPCUL. This Court, thus, finds that since the BMPCUL has not rebutted the petitioner’s claim of reshipping the goods and since the BMPCUL had agreed with the petitioner to assist the petitioner in obtaining all the required papers and documents from the concerned State-Functionaries and statutory authorities, the issue as to whether refusal by the BMPCUL to extend the validity of the L/Cs in order to enable the petitioner to re-supply the goods was justified or not, should be adjudicated upon by the arbitration tribunal. In the light of the fact that the BMPCUL has unilaterally cancelled the contract having declined to extend the tenure of the L/Cs for enabling the petitioner to re-supply the goods, this Court is of the view that <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> there is existence of a dispute and there is no scope on the part of the BMPCUL to claim that the dispute has amicably been settled. Given the fact that it is the BMPCUL who had agreed with the petitioner to send back the goods and the petitioner had agreed thereto with a condition to resupply the goods to the petitioner as per the specification/terms and conditions of the original L/Cs, now, if the BMPCUL intends to claim that it had never agreed to take the goods afresh from the petitioner, that position itself amounts to a dispute, resolution of which can be done through adducing evidence before the arbitration. </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l2 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">27.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">To put the above rescript in a shorter and simpler version, all that this Court wishes to record here that the issue as to whether the BMPCUL had agreed with the petitioner only to send back the shipped-goods lying at Chattogram Port, or it had also agreed with the petitioner to take the goods from the petitioner afresh as per the specification of the original L/Cs, apparently remains unsettled between the petitioner and the BMPCUL. More importantly, since the contract has been cancelled by the BMPCUL without arriving at any consensus thereto, there should be an adjudication by the arbitration tribunal as to whether the BMPCUL has properly and lawfully cancelled the contract. While that is the scenario, this Court finds it difficult to concede to the argument advanced by the learned Advocate for the BMPCUL that the parties have amicably settled the dispute.

On the other hand, the petitioner’s case is that it does not disagree with the BMPCUL’s above position, but since the place of arbitration has not been mentioned either in the GCC or anywhere in the PCC, the Arbitration Act shall be applicable either in tandem with one of the above foreign Rules, if chosen by the BMPCUL in course of disposal of this cases, and if the BMPCUL remains adamant not to select a foreign Rules of Procedures, in that scenario, this Court may direct the parties to proceed with the arbitration under the Arbitration Act.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l2 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">30.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">At this juncture, I consider it pertinent to look at the general provisions regarding Amicable Settlement, Adjudication, Arbitration contained in the Contract, and the special provisions of the GCC, which have been placed in Section (Part) 4 of the Contract and have been regarded in the Contract as the PCC. </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 112%;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">General Conditions of Contract (GCC)</span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 112%; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">47.1- Amicable Settlement:</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 112%; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">The purchaser and the supplier shall use their best efforts to settle amicably all disputes arising out of or in connection with this Contract or its interpretation. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 112%; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">47.2-Adjudication :</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 112%; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">If the supplier/purchaser believe that amicable settlement of dispute is not possible between the two parties, the dispute shall be referred to the Adjudicator within 14 (fourteen) days of first written correspondence on the matter of disagreement;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 112%; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">The Adjudicator named in the PCC is jointly appointed by the parties.

But, this Court could not trace out any provisions as to the place or venue of arbitration anywhere in the four-corners of the GCC or PCC. As per the PCC sub-clause (a) of the GCC clause 47.3(b), the BMPCUL has been given the liberty to choose one Rules of Procedures out of the four foreign Rules of Procedures, but it does necessarily mean that if the BMPCUL names the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the venue of arbitration has to be at the office of the United Nations Office or if the BMPCUL opts for the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Rules, the place of arbitration needs to be in London and so on for the other Rules of procedures.

The Civil Courts of our country are well-competent to make a declaration in favour of/against this petitioner by examining the issue as to whether the Arbitration Act is applicable in the present scenario. Because, our Civil Courts are bestowed with ample power to adjudicate upon any civil dispute, including making a declaration as to whether a particular law is applicable for adjudication upon a dispute by any Court, or tribunal or quasi-judicial body. However, since in this case, this Court has already adjudicated upon the issue upon examining the relevant facts in connection with or arising out of the GCC &amp; PCC clauses and the relevant law, namely Sections 3 of the Arbitration Act, there is no need to approach the Civil Court for the said purpose. In the backdrop that the BMPCUL is purposefully refraining from choosing one foreign Rules of Procedures as well as selecting the venue of the arbitration leaving this foreign petitioner in limbo, therefore, ends of justice would be best served if a forum of adjudication for the petitioner’s grievance is declared by this Court, instead of pushing the petitioner to the Civil Court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">    </span></span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l2 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">37.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The third sub-issue is whether this Court is competent to compel the BMPCUL to opt for one of the Rules of Procedures for arbitration, out of the agreed four foreign Rules of Procedures and determine the venue of the arbitration.

Since (i) there is an “agreement to arbitrate” in the GCC Clause 47.3(a), (ii) the parties have not agreed to a seat of arbitration, (iii) the BMPCUL has failed to make any choice of Rules of Procedures and (iv) the governing law of the Contract is Bangladesh, this Court holds that it has jurisdiction under Section 12 of the Arbitration Act to impose upon the parties to fix/determine the place of arbitration to be Bangladesh and, accordingly, this Court is well competent to appoint an arbitrator from the respondent’s side.

When any of the circumstances set out in sub-Section (1) of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act would be found to have existed in an application under Section 7A of the Arbitration Act, this Court shall unhesitatingly pass the necessary  Order/s or Direction/s, but if this Court finds that the stated-facts do not attract the circumstances enumerated in sub-Section (1)  of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act, in that event, this Court has to be satisfied that whether the stated-circumstances fulfill the cardinal principles of granting interim Orders, namely, whether (i) there exists a <em>prima-facie</em> case, (ii) whether the balance of inconvenience is in favour of the applicant and (iii) whether, if the other party is not restrained, the applicant shall suffer irreparable loss and injury not commensurable in monetary terms. In the instant Section-7A application, being Arbitration Application No. 36 of 2016, two interim Orders and one direction upon the BMPCUL had been prayed for by the petitioner. One interim Order is sought for preservation of two contracts dated 04.08.2015 executed between the petitioner-company and the BMPCUL for supply of goods and related services for Chilled Water Plant for BDP and DDP valued at €1,250,000 (Euro One Million two Hundred and Fifty Thousand) collectively and the second interim Order is prayed for restraining the BMPCUL and the Standard Chartered Bank from encashment of the Bank Guarantee Nos. 411020278783 and 411020278774 both dated 03.08.2015 issued by the Standard Chartered Bank as the Performance Securities of the contracts. And the only direction which is sought for by the petitioner-company upon the BMPCUL is for compelling the BMPCUL to extend the tenure of the L/C in order to enable the petitioner-company to take back the goods from the Chattogram Port and, then, reship the goods as per the specifications of the original L/C.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin: 0in 2.7pt 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">52.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">With regard to the petitioner’s prayer for the interim Order for preservation of the contracts, this Court’s view is that there exists a <em>prima-facie</em> case of the petitioner-company to agitate before the arbitration tribunal as to whether the petitioner-company is entitled to complete the Contracts by re-shipping the goods after taking back the goods from the Chottagram Port. Because if the Contracts are not preserved, there is no point of formation of the arbitration tribunal.

So, there is no scope for the petitioner-company to make out a case seeking a declaration from this Court or from the civil Court or from the arbitration tribunal that BMPCUL’s request to the Standard Chartered Bank for encashment of the Bank Guarantee is illegal. When this Court is getting a clear picture about the nature of relationship between the BMPCUL and the Standard Chartered Bank, there remains hardly any chance for the Standard Chartered Bank or the petitioner-company to make an endeavour for making out a <em>prima-facie</em> case. In any event, the petitioner-company is not going to suffer a loss by encashment of the Bank Guarantee, which can not be compensated. Because if the petitioner-company succeeds in the arbitration tribunal, the BMPCUL would no longer ask for the new Bank Guarantees against these Contracts. More importantly, the Bank Guarantees have been issued under the ICC Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees, ICC Publication No. 758, which is the Biblic Rules for the Banks of all the member (signatory) countries. Since the said URDG 758 mandatorily requires the Banks to make instantaneous payment of the Bank Guarantees whenever is asked by the beneficiary of a Bank Guarantee, Bangladesh being a member country of the ICC, the Banks which are conducting banking business in Bangladesh are legally obliged to observe and obey the said laws and, accordingly, the Standard Chartered Bank is legally bound to encash the Bank Guarantees without getting involved in any dispute of the petitioner-company with the BMPCUL. It leads me to hold that there is no scope for this Court to stop encashment of the two Bank Guarantees by issuing any interim Order.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin: 0in 2.7pt 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">55.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">Now, remains prayer for issuance of Direction upon the BMPCUL for extension of L/C.
