Framing of charge is dealt with under Chapter XIX (sections 221 to 240) of the Code. Similarly other laws also deal with the same under specific provisions of each such law. It is the duty of the prosecution to prove that the accused person is guilty of the offence, as charged, beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of which the Court is to deliver judgment holding either the accused guilty of the charge as framed or not guilty. Under the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Ain, 2000, the special tribunal constituted thereunder is the trial Court who shall frame charge under some specific provision of the said law considering the allegations and prima facie case as made out and thereafter shall come to a conclusion on examining the materials on record as to whether the accused is guilty or not of the charge as leveled against him. On trial if the Court/Tribunal, as the case may be, on consideration of materials on record, finds that the offence committed does not fall under the charge framed then the trial court can alter the charge into some other section of the said law under which the offence falls. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">  </span>. . .

But the High Court Division, upon hearing the death reference under section 374 of the Criminal Procedure Code, held that ‘the finding of the tribunal was wrong as the prosecution failed to prove that murder was committed on demand of dowry’.

But the appellate court cannot, under such circumstances, convert the conviction and pass sentence, accordingly, under which charge has not been framed. It has no power to do so without framing charge on that particular provision of law and the same being read over to the accused person allowing him the opportunity to defend. The High Court Division/appellate Court finds that the prosecution miserably failed to prove the charge as framed under the law and rather the same should have been dealt with and disposed of under a different law, under which the offence committed appear to have been proved, the High Court Division or the appellate Court can send the case back to the appropriate Court for fresh trial upon framing appropriate charge, fixing specific time frame within which the case should be disposed of by the concerned Court. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                                               </span>. . .

Nurul Amin Baitha, son of late Abdus Samad of the same village before thirty years. Since marriage she used to stay with her husband at his house, at village Basuralga. During their wedlock they had two sons, two daughters and on the date of occurrence she was five months’ pregnant. Since marriage her husband used to demand dowry of Tk.50,000/- and on her failure to bring the same she was subjected to physical torture off and on. Prior to the date of occurrence the respondent No. 1 married Anjumanara Begum (respondent No. 2) as second wife. On 18.2.2005 corresponding to 6th Falgun, 1411 B.S., Friday, at around 4.00 p.m. Nurul Amin Baitha (Respondent No.1) embroiled in a quarrel with his wife Hasna Begum (deceased). At one stage of quarrel </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">when Hasna Begum asked Nurul Amin about the second marriage he became furious and again demanded Tk.50,000/- as dowry to be paid at once. On her refusal to pay the same, her husband along with Anjuara Begum, the 2nd wife (respondents No. 1 and 2 respectively) started inflicting fists and blows causing severe injuries upon the person of Hasna Begum. At one stage, finding her in critical condition, they called the village doctor Aminul Islam and on his advice Hasna Begum was taken to the ‘Nakla Health Complex’ at around 8 pm, where, she succumbed to the injuries on the next day, i.e. on 19.2.2005 at around 11.30 a.m. Then the respondents took the dead body back to the house of respondent No.1 and upon leaving the dead body at the courtyard of that house they fled away. The relatives of the deceased upon hearing about the occurrence reported the same to the police at Chandrakona Investigation Centre, whereupon the incident was recorded as General Diary (GDE) No.407 dated 19.2.2005. Thereafter on 26.2.2005 Md. Abdul Mannan (PW 2), younger brother of the deceased, filed a complaint petition in the Court of Magistrate (cognizance), Sherpur, narrating the above facts, which was referred to the local Police Station for inquiry. After inquiry and on perusal of the inquest report and the post mortem report, S.I. Amirul Islam of Chandrakona Investigation Centre (PW1), as informant, lodged the FIR on 5.4.2005 which was recorded as Nakla P.S. Case No. 04 dated 05.04.2005 corresponding to G.R.

Moreover, subsequent actions of the convicts as to bringing the dead body from the Thana Health Complex to the accused respondents’ house and fleeing away clearly indicate their involvement in the offence and as such the High Court Division committed error in converting the conviction from 11(Ka)/30 of the Ain, 2000 to section 302/34 of the Penal Code and thereby modifying the sentence from death penalty to life imprisonment is as such required to be interfered with. He next submits that the post mortem report and other evidence on record corroborated the injuries inflicted by the accused respondents on the person of the deceased and as such the trial Court rightly convicted the accused respondents under section 11(Ka) of the aforesaid Ain.

But the High Court Division disagreed with the said finding of the tribunal and came to the conclusion ”the prosecution has been successful in proving the death of the victim due to the assault inflicted by accused persons but failed to prove that the same was caused on demand of dowry”. Accordingly the High Court Division held that ’the conviction and sentence of the Tribunal under section 11(Ka)/30 of the Ain, 2000 suffers from legal infirmity. But since the murder of the victim was caused due to the assaults inflicted by the accused persons having been proved, the conviction and sentence is converted under section 302/34 of the Penal Code in place of section 11(ka) of the Ain, 2000 for ends of justice’ and accordingly passed the impugned judgment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">14.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">Thus commission of the offence of causing death being proved it is not at all necessary to make any comment on such findings of the High Court Division.

Framing of charge is dealt with under Chapter XIX (sections 221 to 240) of the Code. Similarly other laws also deal with the same under specific provisions of each such law. It is the duty of the prosecution to prove that the accused person is guilty of the offence, as charged, beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of which the Court is to deliver judgment holding either the accused guilty of the charge as framed or not guilty. Under the Nari-OShishu Nirjatan Damon Ain, 2000, the special tribunal constituted thereunder is the trial Court who shall frame charge under some specific provision of the said law considering the allegations and prima facie case as made out and thereafter shall come to a conclusion on examining the materials on record as to whether the accused is guilty or not of the charge as leveled against him. On trial if the Court/Tribunal, as the case may be, on consideration of materials on record, finds that the offence committed does not fall under the charge framed then the trial court can alter the charge into some other section of the said law under which the offence falls. But the question is whether such conversion is permissible in a case where the charge has been framed by the tribunal under a special law to the provision under the Penal Code.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">16.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">The power of the appellate Court in case of appeal against conviction is provided under <span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt;">section 423(I)(b) of the Code.

Hence the power of the appellate Court is limited to decide whether the order of conviction and sentence was passed in accordance with law and whether the accused was or was not rightly convicted as charged. Thus in the case of conviction of an offence under the Nari O Shishu Nirjaton Daman Ain 2000 the appellate court is only to perform its functions within the purview of law under which the accused has been tried and convicted. The appellate Court cannot exercise its power in converting the charge from one provision of one particular law to another provision of another law, more particularly from a special law to general law. Conversion of charge by the appellate court is available under the Criminal Procedure Code. But under the Special Law like Nari-O-Shishu Nirjaton Damon Ain, 2000 no such power is given to the appellate Court. The offence described in the Ain 2000 is to be tried by the Tribunal established under section 26 of the said Ain. The tribunal, while discharging its functions, is to follow the procedure laid down in the said Ain and by section 25 of the said Ain only those provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code have been made applicable which are not contrary to the said Ain.

Accordingly, we find the appellants guilty under section 7 of the said Ain and sentence each of them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 14 years and also to pay a fine of Taka 2,000 each in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 3 (three) months more.” </em>In the aforesaid case, this Division, accordingly, set aside the judgment and order of conviction and sentence of death passed under section 302/34 of the Penal Code which was confirmed by the High Court Division and thereby acquitted them of the charges brought under the said provision of the Penal Code but convicted and sentenced them under section 7 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000, as from the materials on record the offence committed by the accused persons were proved beyond reasonable doubt, upon exercising the power conferred under Article 104 of the Constitution.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">24.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">As we have discussed earlier that both, the tribunal as well as the High Court Division, found that the victim died because of the assaults inflicted by the accused persons and as such commission of the offence of murder has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt. The learned Deputy Attorney General also could not improve the case beyond that level which could bring the case within the purview of section 11(ka)/30 of the Ain 2000. This Division also on examination of the evidence adduced by PWs 1 to 7, the eye witness, and the materials on record along with the post mortem report, proved by PW.10, and as such we are also satisfied that the case of ’committing murder’ has been proved beyond reasonable doubt but the case of ’murder for dowry’ has not been proved as none of the PWs could prove the same. Thus we are of the view that the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Sherpur, committed illegality in passing the judgment and order of conviction and sentence of death under section 11(Ka)/30 of the said Ain of 2000 as the prosecution miserably failed to prove the charge of committing murder for dowry, and thereby causing serious miscarriage of justice. Rather the findings of the High Court Division in this respect appear to be in accordance with law. Thus the respondents are liable to be punished for the commission of such offence under Penal Code. Accordingly the finding of the High Court Division on this score appears to be correct. But the High Court Division was not right in converting the conviction under section 302/34 of the Penal Code from those of under section 11(ka)/30 of the Ain 2000, a special law, as it does not have that authority to do so unless charge is framed under section 302/34 of the Penal Code.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">25.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">It has already been discussed before that the trial Court is to frame charge against the accused person and read over the same to the accused person so that he/she can defend himself/herself. Side by side relying on the said charge the prosecution is to prove that the accused is guilty of offence as charged. Under section 27 of the Ain, 2000 the tribunal is not only empowered to frame charge it is also empowered to frame charge in respect of some other offences which are relevant for the purpose of proving the accused guilty in addition to the prima facie offence. Unless charge is framed and proved beyond all reasonable doubt by the prosecution the accused cannot be convicted. In the present case admittedly no charge was framed under section 302/34 of the Penal Code considering the nature of offence committed by the accused persons which the tribunal could frame under section 27 of this Ain along with section 11(Ka)/30 of the Ain 2000. From the above discussions, it is clear that it would not be improper to send the case down to the appropriate Court for framing charge under the appropriate provision of law and allow the accused person(s) to defend against such charge framed. But in this case, an exceptional circumstance appears which is, immediately after the commission of the offence the accused No.1(respondent No.1) is absconding and accused No.2(respondent No.2) after being arrested on 11.4.2005 and making statement under section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code, was enlarged on bail from the lower Court and since then she is also absconding and she did not appear for a single day before the Court of law meaning both the accused persons are fugitive from justice. A fugitive, who has been running away from justice, without surrendering before the Court of law in last 17(seventeen) years and having not challenged the verdicts of either of the Courts passed in absentia, by preferring appeal he/she cannot take advantage of any mistake either procedural or otherwise.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">26.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">All these aspects have not been considered by the High Court Division while passing the impugned judgment and order and without considering these aspects the High Court Division simply converted the conviction and modified the sentence from section 11(ka)/30 of the Ain 2000 to section 302/34 of the Penal Code. The statute has not entrusted the High Court Division to exercise such power of conversion of conviction. Because conversion of conviction from special law to a different law can only be done by the Appellate Division empowered under Article 104 of the Constitution to do ”complete justice“ in appropriate cases pending before it under Article 103 of the Constitution. The Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh is the supreme law of the land under which the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, being the apex Court, has been bestowed with such power under Article 104. In doing complete justice this Division is required to see that substantial justice should be and can be done on the basis of undisputed facts and evidences of the parties on record and the law. This jurisdiction of doing”complete justice” is not available to any other Court including the High Court Division.</span></p><p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; letter-spacing: -.3pt;"> </span></strong></p><div style="mso-element: footnote-list;"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><br clear="all"/><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><!--[endif]--><div id="ftn1" style="mso-element: footnote;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 110%; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><a href="file:///H:/Issue_%20October%202019%20(2)/Issue__October_19__Crl.%20P.%20495%20of%2015__Mirza%20Hussain%20Haider_J___AD___5.doc#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1;" title=""><strong><u><sub><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman Bold',serif; font-variant: small-caps;">CRIMINAL PETITION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL No.</span></sub></u></strong></a><strong><u><sub><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman Bold',serif; font-variant: small-caps;"> 495 of 2015.</span></sub></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">(From the judgment and order dated 17.05.2015 passed by the High Court Division in Death Reference No.22 of 2010).</span></p></div></div></div></div>
