While in detention, the Secretary of ACC issued a notice dated 18.02.2007 under sections 18 and 26 of the Act V of 2004 and served it upon him in prison asking him to submit the statement of wealth within 72 hours. Whereas all the Commissioners of ACC had resigned from office on 07.02.2007 and the Commission was reconstituted on 24.02.2007 and as such there was no Commission existing on 18.02.2007 within the meaning of section 3 read with section 5 of the Act. The Secretary issued the notice on his own without any satisfaction and decision of the Commission. It was a clear violation of section 26 of the Act. The authority on realising the error, tried to cover it up by inserting sub-section (2) in section 18 of the Act on 18.04.2004 by Ordinance No. 7 of 2007, which provides ex-post facto ratification of any acts done by the officials of ACC during the period from 07.02.2007 to 24.02.2007. But the question of jurisdiction goes to the root of the case. If any person acts beyond his authority and to the prejudice of any other person, such acts cannot be ratified or validated by post facto approval. The action would remain void. The notice dated 18.02.2017 issued by the Secretary of ACC was not issued on behalf of the Commission as envisaged under section 26 of the Act V of 2004, which provides that if the Commission is satisfied that a person has in his possession property beyond his legal/known source of income and acquired the same by illegal means, it can direct the person to submit descriptions of all his assets and liabilities by an order in writing. This section unmistakably provides that before issuance of such notice the Commission must be ‘satisfied’ that the person owns or is in possession of the property beyond his known legal source of income and has acquired it by illegal means. The satisfaction must be of the Commission itself, not of any other person or any of its officials. The relevant order to submit statement of wealth may be signed and sent by any of its officials, but the decision to issue such order must be taken by the Commission. For all the reasons the notice was without jurisdiction and void abinitio and initiation of the present case on the basis of such notice was also without jurisdiction.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">57.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Mr. Hossain as s second line of argument lastly submits that the PWD is a Government office having its distinct duty and functions. The ACC cannot delegate its distinct duty and functions to PWD to assess the value of the property belonged to an individual. It is not the duty of PWD to assess the value of such property. The conviction and sentence imposed upon the appellant on an imaginary assessment by an office, which is not legally authorized to do so, is also illegal and liable to be set aside.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">58.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Mr. Md. Khurshid Alam Khan, learned Advocate for the ACC on the other hand submits that the judgment passed in the case of Dr. Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir (ibid) having been reviewed in Mudud Ahmed vs the State and another 68 DLR (AD) 118 it has got no more referral value and cannot be considered for taking decision in any others case. Admittedly the appellant furnished a revised statement amending his earlier statement of wealth, which itself proved falsehood of the statement. This is good enough to convict him under section 26 (2) of the Act V of 2004. Mr. Khan refers to the relevant part of the impugned judgment as well as the evidence of PWs 1, 39, 49 and that of DW 1 and submits that it is apparent on the face of record that accused 2 Majeda Ahsan was a name lender to her husband. She was a simple housewife and whatever she owned/possessed actually belonged to her husband. Section 5(3) of the Ordinance, 1984 was incorporated for the purpose of maintaining the ceiling of land as prescribed in law and it is applicable for agricultural land in rural area only. But section 27 of the Act V of 2004 says that if a person in his own name or in the name of others holds property, which is disproportionate to his known/legal source of income and there are reasons to presume that such property is acquired by illegal means. He would be liable for commission of offence under the law and such property would be confiscated to the State. The latter being subsequent special law would prevail, especially when the subsequent special law is of criminal nature and its purpose is to combat corruption.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">59.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mr. Khan referring to State vs Faisal Morshed Khan and another 66 DLR (AD) 236 further submits that it has already been settled by our Appellate Division that “there may be a situation when there is no assessment of valuation by any competent authority of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Government exercising power on that behalf and in such a case, the Anti-Corruption Commission has no other option but to take the assistance of the PWD officials in making assessment of the valuation of any property. Therefore, it cannot be said that the assessment of valuation made by the PWD officials does not have any evidentiary value in all situations.” In the present case the ACC satisfactorily projected and established that the appellant was holding/possessing property in the name of his wife and son, which was beyond his known source of income. Now the onus of proof is squarely on him (appellant) to rebut the presumption of guilt under section 27 (2) of the Act V of the 2004 read with section 7(1) of the Act XL of 1958. But he failed even to show that the property disclosed in the revised statement was consistent to his known source of income. Referring to the evidence of DW 1 Mr. Khan further submits that when accused 1 admits that he himself purchased the apartment at Gulshan and the Mercedes Benz car for his wife, the question of shifting its ownership to accused 2 does not arise. This contention gets support also from the conduct of the co-accused themselves. Their properties were confederated long back in 2007, but they have not preferred any appeal against the judgment and order, so far it relates to confiscation of their properties, whereas the trial was held in their presence.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">60.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The learned Judge of the trial Court attentively, meticulously and intelligently discussed and considered each and every piece of evidence, discarded those which were unfounded, but accepted the credible evidences and arrived at a finding that the appellant was guilty of offence under the relevant provisions of law in respect of the confiscated properties, which is based on evidence and appears to be rational.

After bringing such allegation and framing of charge thereon by the Court if the person fails to prove the contrary, he would be liable for commission of the offence.

We should say it is impossible to comply with even for a free man. If a free man after getting sufficient and reasonable time files an statement of wealth, still there might be some unintentional mistakes, arithmetical and typographical error. If such notice recipient by a subsequent statement satisfactorily accounts that the mistakes were really unintentional and bonafide, why the ACC should be reluctant to accept it? This cannot be the purpose of law to prosecute a person taking advantage of some unintentional mistakes. But whether an amended/ supplementary/revised statement should be accepted by ACC, would depend on the fact and circumstance of a particular case. It cannot be mechanically accepted in each and every case as a routine work. In the present case, the notice was served upon the appellant in prison at a place away from home giving him only 72 hours to respond. This is correct that in the case of Moudud Ahmed (ibid) the observations of the Appellate Division made earlier in 62 DLR (AD) 290 as quoted above, has been held to be <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">obiter dicta</em>, but have not been overruled, set aside, discarded or deleted. <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Obiter dicta</em> are actually remarks/opinion of the Court having strong persuasive and academic value, but not a decisive factor or necessary part of the judgment passed on the case at hand. <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Obiter dicta</em> include, but are not limited to works introduced by way of illustration, or analogy or argument.

They furnished their respective statements of wealth stating the properties to be of their own. If the properties were disproportionate to their known/legal sources of income and acquired by illegal means, they were supposed to explain it during the trial held in their presence. At the same time the ACC was also to show and prove that the appellant acquired the said properties in <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">benami</em> by illegal means and it was disproportionate to his known/legal source of income as the ACC itself claimed so. The trial Judge did not convict the accused 2 and 4 even for abating the appellant in owning/possessing the properties in their <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">benami</em> and acquitted them honorably. The ACC did not challenge the said order of acquittal and thus accepted the verdict.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">90.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It further appears that learned Judge o the trial Court relied on the oral evidence of DW1<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>(appellant) and proceeded on the assumption that he himself that he himself purchased the flat, car and shares in the names of his wife and son. In so doing the learned Judge did not consider the above said documentary evidences, which speak of providing money from the account of the company and that the appellant was the Managing Director thereof. One’s oral evidence should not be considered in isolation and without keeping in mind his way of speaking. There are so many persons who sitting at the helm of affairs of a public office describe it as ‘his office’ or any duty performed by the office to have been done by him. It does never mean that any public office belongs to a private individual or to a particular public servant. Similarly we find Managing Director/Chief Executive of many companies, who describes the company as ‘his company’ and a procurement done by the company to have been procured by ‘him’. A company is always a different entity and a juristic person. The appellant being an individual and Managing Director of SBEL cannot merge into a single entity. We are, therefore, unable to accept that the appellant as an individual purchased the properties and is liable for owning/possessing the same in the names of wife and son, or for concealment of its value. This is correct that he failed to produce any decision of the company to lend money to accused 2 for purchasing the flat at Gulshan. If any money is illegally shifted from a company’s fund, it may at best constitute an offence of money laundering as defined in section 2 (Ttha) (Aa) of the Money Laundering Act, 2002 but cannot constitute an offence under section 27 of the Act V of 2004. It would also contribute in an illegality/irregularity under the Company Act and the other directors/share holders aggrieved thereby can raise the question in proper forum. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">91.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The learned Judge committed further wrong in interpreting the word ‘abetment’ holding that in the present case it did not occur before or during continuance of the occurrence. Actually an offence under section 27 of the Act V of 2004 continues so long the person sought to be prosecuted owns possesses the disproportionate property as defined therein. An abetment thereto also continues in the same way with his ownership/possession over the same. There is no scope to say after acquiring the disproportionate property, the time of occurrences comes to an end.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">92.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It is also to be kept in mind that evasion of income tax and offence of acquiring/ possessing/owning disproportionate property by illegal means as defined in section 27 of the Act V of 2004 are not the same. There might <span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt;">be some professionals/businessmen who legally</span> earn a lot of money, but pay less income tax. It is an offence of evasion of tax or suppression of facts under the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984. But if any public servant or and individual acquires property by illegal means, which is apparently disproportionate to his known/legal source of income and fails to satisfactorily account such property, an offence under section 27 of the Act V of 2004 would be committed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">93.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In the present case, the four items of properties upon which the appellant was convicted, were in the names of accused 2 and 4.
