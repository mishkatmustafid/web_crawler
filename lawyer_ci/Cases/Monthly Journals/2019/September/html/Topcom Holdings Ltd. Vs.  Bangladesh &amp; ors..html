Particularly, when any Court suggests that the substantive matter shall be heard on fast-track basis, the concerned Advocates should understand that while on the one side, the parties of the suit/case would get the aspired remedy, which would obviously include the interim relief, on the other, the Court would be able to reduce the number of backlog of cases. The learned Advocates should take into consideration the valuable time of the Courts that requires for adjudication upon the interim/interlocutory matters. Instead of compelling the Courts to spend time in dealing with interlocutory matters, if the learned Advocates extend their co-operation to dispose of the substantive matter, the Judiciary will be able, to some extent, to cope with the prevailing backlog. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">   </span>. . .(54)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Mr. Saifur Rashid with </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Ms. Zinia Amin, Advocates</span></p><p align="right" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: right; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">. . .For the Plaintiff</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Mr. Syed Hasan Zubair, Advocate </span></p><p align="right" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: right; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">. . .For the Defendant No. 2</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Mr. Ashadullah with</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Mst.

They submit that since the defendant no. 5 has paid off the freight in advance to the defendant no. 3, the outstanding 5% L/C money lying with the defendant no. 2 is the payment against the rice purchased by the defendant no. 2 from the defendant no. 5.

In order to adjudicate upon the issue as to whether there is a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie </em>arguable case, I would, at first, go for examination of the following issues; (i) whether the money lying with the defendant nos. 2 &amp; 8 is payment against L/C, and whether it is for payment of price of the rice purchased from the defendant no. 5 or the said money is for payment of freight to the defendant no. 3 by the defendant no. 5, (ii) whether the defendant nos. 2, 5 &amp; 8 have been impleaded as the defendants of the suit lawfully or illegally and (iii) whether the plaintiff is competent to claim lien over the money to be paid by the defendant no. 2 to the defendant no. 5 for purchasing the rice.

Admittedly, the money, which is currently lying with the defendant nos. 2 &amp; 8 is L/C money. Evidently, the disputes have arisen out of the charterparty dated 18.01.2018 executed between the plaintiff and the defendant no. 3 and, as per the claim of the plaintiff, the defendant no. 3 is responsible for making payment for using the vessel for a specified time inscribed in the charterparty. It has been contended by the plaintiff that since the plaintiff has not received the hire of the vessel from the defendant no. 3 for the period during which the vessel carried the cargos of the defendant no. 5, the defendant no. 5 should pay the hire to the plaintiff out of the money lying with defendant nos. 2 &amp; 8, as the same being the freight payment, the plaintiff has got lien over it. The plaintiff has sought to make out a case that the money lying with the defendant nos. 2 &amp; 8 is not only the payment against the price of the purchased-rice, but it also includes the freight payment. Per contra, it has been contended by the defendant no. 5 that it had hired the vessel from the defendant no. 3 only for a particular voyage to carry the rice from India to Bangladesh, and the defendant no. 3 had agreed to engage with the shipper (Indian company) only on the condition that before sailing out of the Indian Port, the defendant no. 3 must be paid off its freight payment in advance and, accordingly, the defendant no. 5 have paid off the freight in advance. The logic behind advance freight payment by the defendant no. 5 to the defendant no. 3 is that, since by the charterparty the plaintiff has given full authority to the defendant no. 3 to receive advance from any sub-charterer, the defendant no. 5 did not see any legal impediment to pay full freight in advance in enjoying the service of the vessel. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Following their above contentious arguments on this issue, I examined the relevant papers, namely (i) the template of the charterparty, i.e the Form NYPE/93 (as the original or photocopy of the charterparty dated 18.01.2018 has not been produced before this Court by the plaintiff), (ii) Fixture Note together with its four addenda and (iii) the Bill of Lading. Since all the above papers have been submitted by the plaintiff before this Court and the defendants are also not raising any question as to the authenticity of these papers, there is no impediment for me to rely on the same to come to a primary conclusion. It transpires that (a) the charterparty was sealed between the plaintiff and the defendant no. 3 and there is no mentioning of the names of the defendant nos. 2, 5 &amp; 8 in any connection, not to speak of stating them as the parties to the charterparty, (b) by condition no. 6 of the addendum no. 1 of the charterparty, the defendant no. 3 has been categorically authorised by the plaintiff to receive freight payment from any person during the tenure of the charterparty, (c) Bill of Lading was signed for and on behalf of the plaintiff and it states that the freight was paid in advance and the same was received on behalf of the plaintiff and (d) from the e-Mail sent by the defendant no. 3 on 10.05.2018 at 17:31:20+530 to the shipper it is evident that the defendant no. 3 has acknowledged receipt of Indian Rupees 2,31,17,663/-.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">21.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Therefore, without prejudicing this Court’s final findings of the fact to be arrived at upon taking evidence, I find that the defendant no. 5, following hiring the vessel from the defendant no. 3 for a voyage from Kandla Port of India to Chittagong Port of Bangladesh, has paid off freight payment in advance relying on the condition no. 6 of the first addendum to the Fixture Note to the defendant no. 3. Although it is an admitted position that the DG, Food of Bangladesh Government (defendant no. 2) is purchasing the rice from the Indian Government entity (defendant no. 5) on the basis of Costs, Insurance and Freight (CIF), but since <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> it appears that the defendant no. 5 has paid off the freight payment in advance as per the terms of the charterparty to the defendant no. 3, the primary view of this Court is that the money lying with the defendant nos. 2 &amp; 8 is the money for payment of price of the rice purchased by the Bangladesh Government from the defendant no. 5, not for making payment to the defendant no. 3. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">22.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Now, I need to see why the plaintiff has impleaded the defendant nos. 2, 5 &amp; 8 as the defendants in this suit, despite the plaintiff’s own admission that the defendant nos. 2, 5 &amp; 8 are not the parties to the contract (charterparty). The apparent reasons behind it, so far surfaced from the above discussions, are that the plaintiff believes and asserts that with this outstanding 5% L/C money, the defendant no. 5 would make the freight payment to the defendant no. 3 and since it is the belief of the plaintiff that as per clause 23 of the charterparty, he got lien over the freight payment, this money should be handed over/transferred to the plaintiff by the defendant nos. 2 &amp; 8, instead of letting the money to be remitted to the defendant no. 3 by the defendant no. 5. In other words, since this money would ultimately go to the Bank account of the defendant no. 3 through defendant nos. 2, 8 and 5, therefore, instead of handing over this money to the defendant no. 3, it should be transferred to the Bank account of the plaintiff and, as per the plaintiff, that is why the defendant nos. 2, 5 &amp; 8 are necessary parties to this suit. Although from the documents submitted before this Court, it primarily appears to this Court that the outstanding 5% L/C money is not going to be used for the purpose of making any payment to the defendant no. 3, however, until the claim of the advance payment of freight is required to be proved through examining the relevant witness in this Court by exhibiting the payment receipts/documents in presence of defendant no. 5, and since the source of finance of the defendant no.5 is the defendant no.2 through defendant no.8, I hold the view that the presence of these three defendants, namely, 2, 5 &amp; 8 are required in this suit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">23.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The above resolution leads me to take up the issue as to whether the plaintiff can claim ‘lien’ or ‘maritime lien’ over the outstanding 5% L/C money.

While all of the claims catalogued in Section 3(2) of our Admiralty Court Act can be easily termed as ‘maritime claims’, but only few of them are recognized as ‘maritime liens’ as per the national laws and the international laws of today. It is the established principle across the maritime world that the parties to the charterparty can not by agreement confer status of ‘maritime lien’ which is by nature a mere ‘maritime claim’. That is to say, although all ‘maritime liens’ are ‘maritime claims’, but all ‘maritime claims’ are not ‘maritime liens’. ‘Maritime lien’ is an important aspect of maritime law with the liability of contract that falls on ship and ships’ equipment. In other words, it is a privileged claim upon a ship for service rendered to, or injuries caused by the ship.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">37.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Apparently, in this suit there is a ‘maritime claim’ against the defendant no. 3 and, after completion of trial it would be clear as to whether there is any ‘maritime claim’ against the defendant no. 5.

In the case of Care Shipping corporation Vs Latin American Shipping Corporation, reported in (1983) 1 All E.R. 1121, the issue was whether the owner of the vessel can claim lien over the cargos and freight payment for recovery of his hire due to the sub-charterer and it was held that the lien on sub-freights conferred by clause 18 included a lien on any remuneration earned by the charterers from their employment of the vessel whether by way of voyage freight or time chartered hire. This cited case was purely with regard to retaining hire and freight; it was not a L/C money. So, the <em>ratio</em> laid down in this cited case is not applicable in this suit. In the case of Mareva Compania Naviera S.A. Vs International Bulk Carriers S.A., reported in (1975) Vol.2 Lloyd’s Rep. 509, C.A., the owner obtained an Order of injunction on the charterer’s money, which the charterer had received as hire from his sub-charterer. The money was lying in the charterer’s Bank account. More importantly, it was not the charterer’s money against the sale of goods, as is the case in the present suit.

In order to find the answer, I had to go through the relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act, 2001 (the Arbitration Act) and from a concurrent reading of the provisions of Sections 3 &amp; 7 of the Arbitration Act, it appears that the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Court on a dispute, which is required to be resolved through arbitration to be held in Bangladesh, has been made subservient to the provisions of the Arbitration Act; meaning that if any of the provisions of the Arbitration Act allows the Courts to entertain legal proceedings for adjudication upon a particular issue, only for that purpose the Courts are competent to hear and determine the said legal proceedings. Although the provisions of Section 3 of the Arbitration Act stipulates that the provisions of the Act would be applicable only for those arbitration agreement which contain that the place of arbitration is Bangladesh, but there being no ouster clause as to application of the Arbitration Act for foreign arbitration, our Courts sometimes in a fit case entertain legal proceedings only in aid of the foreign arbitration tribunal. It means that if our Court is satisfied that by entertaining a legal proceeding, the Court is not going to be trying any dispute which is pending before the foreign tribunal; rather the Court’s interference is needed for the time being to help the said tribunal, our Courts, in that scenario, finds it appropriate to entertain a legal proceeding.  In this suit, the charterparty stipulates that the seat of the arbitration would be either in New York in USA or London in UK and, that is why, the provisions of the Arbitration Act are apparently not applicable in this suit and, therefore, there is no legal bar for this Court to try this suit. However, had any of the defendants already been in the arbitration forum, in that scenario, upon an application by any party to the legal proceedings in this Admiralty Court, the Court might have halted the proceedings pending before it till disposal of the arbitration. Given the present scenario of the suit that none of the parties have approached the arbitration tribunal, this Court appears to be well competent to entertain and dispose of this suit.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">43.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In other words, since the Arbitration Act of Bangladesh does not prohibit trying this suit, and in view of the averments made by the plaintiff that the defendant no. 3, upon taking hire of the ship from the plaintiff, sent the vessel into Bangladeshi territory for delivery of the cargos on board the vessel, which is primarily supported by the documents submitted by the plaintiff, I find that the plaintiff has been able to make out a <em>prima facie</em> case of ‘maritime claim’ against the defendant no. 3 and, accordingly, I hold that this Court has the jurisdiction as per the provisions of Section 3(2)(h) and 3(5)(a) of the Admiralty Court Act to hear and determine the claim. However, in the event of decreeing the suit in favour of the plaintiff, whether the plaintiff would be able to execute the decree in Bangladesh in the context of presently having no property attached herein this country- is altogether a different issue. It may be that upon obtaining a decree, the plaintiff may wait to attach any money of the defendant no.3 to be available in future in Bangladesh through any transaction by the defendant no.3 with any person/company/Bank, or the plaintiff may try to execute the decree in a foreign country with whom Bangladesh has reciprocal arrangement for execution of decree.    </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">44.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Apparently, the better forum for the plaintiff is to approach the arbitration tribunal in New York or London inasmuch as the award of the aforesaid forum is executable in most of the countries of the world, including India, the country of the defendant no. 3.

A Letter of Credit is an irrevocable guarantee given by the issuing Bank (L/C opening Bank) to the negotiating Bank to the effect that upon receipt of the clean shipping documents from the side of the negotiating Bank, the specified amount of money as contained in the L/C shall be remitted without being influenced by any objection raised by any party, except the objection of fraud if it is alleged to have been committed by the seller with regard to the documents sent by him through the negotiating Bank. It is the globally-honoured practice that payment of the L/C money shall not be stopped by the issuing Bank except finding fraud with the documents inasmuch as it has serious implications in international trade. If the buyer has any objection with regard to the quality of goods or timeous performance, it should be dealt with as per the prevailing law of the country, but the buyer or his Bank (issuing Bank) must not retain the L/C money for the purpose of settling down the contractual issues between the buyer and the seller. Therefore, while it is the settled principle of law that a buyer or his Bank is not competent to withhold the payment of L/C, stopping the payment of L/C at the instance of a third party would be outright illegal. In this suit, there is no allegation of fraud against the seller (the defendant no. 5) in sending the clean shipping documents to the buyer (the defendant no. 2) and, therefore, the defendant nos. 2 &amp; 8 are legally bound to remit the L/C money to the defendant no. 5. In fact, in this suit there being no objection from the side of the buyer with regard to the goods, the buyer (defendant no. 2) and its Bank (the defendant no. 8) wish to send money to the seller (the defendant no. 5) at the earliest possible time. Therefore, the plaintiff, being not any party to the L/C or to the underlying contract to the L/C, is not competent to seek injunction upon the payment of L/C money.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">46.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It means that the plaintiff’s suit against the defendant no. 2, 5 &amp; 8 is though maintainable, temporary injunction cannot be granted upon the defendant nos. 2 &amp; 8 restraining them from transmitting the L/C money to the defendant no. 5.

Also, if injunction is granted/continued,</span> the loss that is going to be suffered by the defendant no. 5 is apparently grave having enormous impact in his business given that he would be a Bank-defaulter, not only to the Banks of his country, but also to the foreign Banks. Since there is no <em>prima facie</em> case in favour of the plaintiff and the balance of inconvenience is also not in favour of the plaintiff and, further, there would be irreparable loss and injury to the defendant no.5, if injunction is granted/continued and, more importantly, the subject matter of injunction being the L/C money in which the plaintiff does not have any apparent ownership, this Court is not inclined to grant temporary injunction or to continue/extend the interim injunction already granted. However, it is a well-settled principle that granting or vacating the temporary injunction is a discretionary power of any Court, and a discretionary power is required to be exercised only in favour of those litigants who come before the Courts with clean hands. I would now briefly check whether these defendants, particularly the defendant no. 5, have approached this Court with clean hands. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">48.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">From the Order Sheets of this suit, it transpires that the defendant no. 5 entered its appearance in this suit on 17.01.2019 only when this Court on 14.08.2018 had directed the defendant no. 2 to communicate with the defendant no. 3 through e-Mail asking him to appear before this Court.

Further, the defendant no.5 must submit some sort of security, which may be a Bank Guarantee to this Court or a bond to the defendant no. 2 or to the defendant no. 8 so that after trial of the suit, if it is surfaced that there was connivance of defendant no. 5 with defendant no. 3, the Bank Guarantee/bond may be used towards partial execution of the decree. However, the moment the defendant no. 3 would appear in this suit, all these three defendants shall be relieved of the above conditions. In view of this Court’s exercise of its discretionary power in favour of the defendant no. 5, it is expected that the defendant no. 5 shall show its bonafides in assisting this Court in effectively disposing of this suit either by depositing the above security or by producing the defendant no. 3 before this Court so that the conduct of the defendant no.5 of this suit does not appear to be dubious.   </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;

Particularly, when any Court suggests that the substantive matter shall be heard on fast-track basis, the concerned Advocates should understand that while on the one side, the parties of the suit/case would get the aspired remedy, which would obviously include the interim relief, on the other, the Court would be able to reduce the number of backlog of cases. The learned Advocates should take into consideration the valuable time of the Courts that requires for adjudication upon the interim/interlocutory matters. Instead of compelling the Courts to spend time in dealing with interlocutory matters, if the learned Advocates extend their co-operation to dispose of the substantive matter, the Judiciary will be able, to some extent, to cope with the prevailing backlog. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">55.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In this suit, after hearing the learned Advocate for the defendant no.5 on his application for vacating the Order of injunction, this Court had suggested that the suit shall be heard on priority basis by fixing the next date for framing issues. It was observed by this Court that if it surfaces upon examining the oral and documentary evidence that the suit is not maintainable against the defendant no. 5, then the suit would be proceeded only against the defendant no. 3. Had the learned Advocate conceded to the above suggestion of this Court, the defendant no.5 could have been permanently relieved of the hassle he is facing and on the other hand, this Court could have disposed of a substantive matter with the amount of time that required for disposing of these interim applications. Now, by getting the aspired relief in these applications, although the defendant no.5’s L/C money would be released subject to depositing the equivalent amount of security, he remains entangled with the suit.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 27.0pt; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Ed. </span></strong></p><div style="mso-element: footnote-list;"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><br clear="all"/><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><!--[endif]--><div id="ftn1" style="mso-element: footnote;"><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="file:///H:/2012/September%202012/Issue%20__September__19(2)__Admiralty%20__29%20of%2018_Muhammad%20Khurshid%20Alam%20Sarkar,%20J.__3.doc#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1;" title=""><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Admiralty Suit No. 29 of 2018</span></strong></a></p></div></div></div></div>
