It may be argued that BRAC Bank has not yet commenced its business, but the fact remains that after obtaining the no objection certificate and completion of registration, the BRAC Bank has proceeded with the opening of its office at Gulshan and fixed the date for it’s opening in a few days time. Thereby process of commencement of business has already started without satisfying the requirement.</p><p><strong><em>Professor Muzaffar Ahmed Vs Bangladesh Bank &amp; others, 20 BLD (HCD) 235.</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—17</strong></p><p>The High Court division will only decide the legality of the notice under section 17 of the Act on perusal of the notice only and on no other supporting or opposing materials.</p><p><strong><em>Md. Saful Alam alias Masudul Alam Chowdhury Vs Bangladesh Bank and others, 19 BLD (AD) 249.</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—17</strong></p><p>On a close reading of section 17 of the Act, as amended up-to-date it appears that since the said section is concerned with the subject matter of vacancy of the office of directors which is an additional occasion for vacancy other than those contained in the Companies Act, 1994 and since the entire scheme of the said Act is to bestow upon the Bangladesh Bank a strong regulatory power over the functioning and business of bank companies, it is enough if the offending director is intimated in a notice under section 17 of the Act that he has a personal liability to repay a loan of the kind described in section 17 and that on the date of notice the loan remains unliquidated upon expiry of the stipulated.. date of repayment of either the whole loan or an installment thereof. It is not necessary to describe in the notice the nature and number of document or documents on the basis of which the offending director is claimed by the lender Bank to be personally responsible for repayment of a loan or an installment. But if the offending debtor denies his personal liability to repay the loan in his written representation the Bangladesh Bank may send for the incriminating materials and confront the offending director with the same. It is before respondent No. 1 that the offending director will place all his grievances against the show cause notice and it is respondent No. I who will determine the relevance, genuineness, connection between the lender Bank’s documents and the loans in question and the liability or otherwise of the offending director.</p><p><strong><em>Md. Saiful Alam alias Masudul Alam Chowdhury Vs Bangladesh Bank and others, 19 BLD (AD) 249.</em></strong></p><p>Ref: 48D1R(AD)20; 45DLR(AD)20-Not applicable.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—17 </strong></p><p>In issuing the notices under section 17 of the Act the lender Bank acted neither as a substantive authority nor as a Court nor as a tribunal. It acted purely in an executive capacity under an authority granted by a statute if the show cause notice is issued by an unauthorised or if the allegations in the show cause notice on the face of it do not attract the mischief of section 17, a notice under section 17 can certainly be challenged in the writ jurisdiction and declared to have been issued without lawful authority and to be of no legal effect.</p><p><strong><em>Mr. A.S.F. Rahman and others Vs Bangladesh Bank and others, 20 BLD (AD) 32.</em></strong></p><p>Ref: Md. Saiful Alam alias Masudul Alam Chowdhury Vs. Bangladesh Bank and others, 19 BLD(1999)(AD)249—relied upon.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—17</strong></p><p>The High Court Division simply does not have the jurisdiction to decide the validity of a notice under section 17 of the Act upon adjudication of documents both sides. The offending director may have a very good case to show that he has no personal liability to the lender Bank at all. But it is not for the High Court Division to determine or even hint at the offending director’s personal liability or otherwise, except on admission, when the only us before it is whether the notice under section 17 of the Act is legal or not.</p><p><strong><em>Abdullah Ahsan Vs Bangladesh Bank and others, 20 BLD (AD)260.</em></strong></p><p>Ref: Md Saiful Alam @ Masudul Alam Chowdhury, Vs. Bangladesh Bank and others, 19 BLD (AD) 249 [C.P.529 of 1 9991—relied.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—46(2)</strong></p><p>In view of the existence of the report and recommendation it cannot be said that there was no material before the respondent No.1 to form the opinion concerning the appellant or that the said opinion was merely fanciful. So the requirement of formation of an opinion by the Bangladesh Bank has been made before directing a Director, Chairman or Chief Executive of a banking company to refrain from performing functions of his office during the pendency of the enquiry proceedings against him for his removal from office under section 46 of the Act. Such opinion must be formed on the basis of relevant materials on record and not fancifully without any such material nor on the basis of irrelevant materials.</p><p><strong><em>Abdur Rahim Chowdhury Vs Bangladesh Bank and others, 20 BLD (AD) 170.</em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Section—46 and 47</strong></p><p>Whether there was sufficient good reason to form an opinion cannot be looked into by the Court as that would be substituting the opinion of the Bangladesh Bank. The Court cannot accept the contention that the Bangladesh Bank could not have arrived at an opinion or satisfaction to suspend the petitioner on a single transaction.</p><p><strong><em>Abdur Rahim Chowdhury Vs Bangladesh Bank and others, 20 BLD (AD) 170.</em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Sections—64 and 65</strong></p><p>A relief to which one is not entitled to directly cannot be given to that person indirectly. The winding up of a bank can only be done as provided under sections 64 and 65 of the Bank Company Act 1991 and cannot be wound up at the instance of the writ petitioner in an indirect manner.

Professor Mozaffar Ahmed and others, 22 BLD(AD)41</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—144</strong></p><p><strong>Family</strong></p><p>It includes among others, ‘ ... any other persons dependent of such person.’ In the instant case ‘such person’ is BRAC and the rest of the subscribers are its dependents. In other words BRAC itself holds 99.97% of the shares in the BRAC Bank, the balance being subscribed and held by its employees and members of the governing body.</p><p><strong><em>Professor Muzaffar Ahmed Vs Bangladesh Bank &amp; others, 20 BLD(HCD)235</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Sections—144 and 121</strong></p><p><strong>Waiver of restriction</strong></p><p>Waiving the restriction imposed under section 14A regarding holding of not more than 10% shares by a person, company, members of a family, was published on 3 February, 2000, after the issuance of the Rule in this writ petition on 12.12.1999. By this gazette notification, an undue favouritism has been shown and discrimination has been made, in favour of BRAC Bank, only to remove its incapacity to operate, which the authority became aware of, after the issuance of the Rule in which the letter of ‘no objection’ itself and the registration of the bank and the certificate of incorporation have been challenged. Apparently, on the days the letter of ‘no objection’ was issued i.e., 4 April 1999 and the Bank was registered on 20 May, 1999, there was no waiver and BRAC Bank did not meet the initial requirement for incorporation.</p><p><strong><em>Professor Muzaffar Ahmed Vs Bangladesh Bank &amp; others, 20 BLD (HCD) 235.</em></strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
