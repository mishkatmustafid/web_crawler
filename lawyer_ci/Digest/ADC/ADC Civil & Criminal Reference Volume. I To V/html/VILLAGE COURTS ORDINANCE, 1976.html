Trial of the accused for offences falling under the schedule by the Magistrate and hearing of the appeal as done by the Sessions Judge are absolutely without jurisdiction. If a court has no jurisdiction to try a case, the question of either submitting to the jurisdiction or raising objection to its jurisdiction would not arise. Parties by their mutual consent can neither confer a jurisdiction which does not exist in law nor can take away a jurisdiction which so exists. Jurisdiction is a question of statute and not of consent.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"/><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;"><em style="box-sizing: border-box;">Dr. Joynal Abedin Vs.
