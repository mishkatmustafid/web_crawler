Hundreds of people were present in the place of occurrence and witnessed this occurrence. In the circumstances it was difficult to pinpoint specifically the role played by each and every accused. So it is most natural that there may occur some discrepancies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses as to the role played by the accused persons in this occurrence. While sifting the evidence of the prosecution witnesses the courts are to take into consideration the discrepancies also in their evidence, but for making some discrepant statements only their whole evidence should not be discarded and they also should not be treated as untrustworthy<em> Shafiul Azam Dafader-Vs.-The State 6 ALR (AD) 2015 (2)224.</em></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 9.6pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">The Appellate Division comments about the impugned judgment of the High Court Division.</span></strong></p><p class="Style11" style="margin-top: .25pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">The High Court Division, without making any discussion of any evidence at all and without adverting to the findings and decision and the reasoning thereof made by the appellate court below, set aside the judgment and decree of the appellate court below-the last court of fact.

In the present case the High Court Division set aside the judgment and decree of the appellate court below without making any discussion of the evidence on record and without giving any reasoning at all of doing so.
