It is the primary responsibility of the conducting police prosecutor or the public prosecutor to produce the witness in the case. There is nothing on record to show that any step was taken by the prosecution through the police officer to secure the attendance of any witness in the case.

The learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate before rejecting the report submitted by the police held a judicial enquiry through another Metropolitan Magistrate and on the basis of the police report as well as the judicial enquiry report took cognizance of the offence which is covered by section 190(1) of the Code and as such the proceeding cannot be quashed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Nurul Hoque and others vs State and another 4 BLC 74.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 173 and 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sessions Judge has no authority to direct the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence and such order of taking cognizance by the Magistrate is set aside but the proceeding against the petitioner cannot be quashed and hence the case is sent back to the learned Magistrate for taking steps for holding further investigation.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Hazi isakur Rahman vs State 4 BLC 524.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 179 and 180—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">As from the FIR it prima facie appears that the occurrence took place in Dhaka and then it continued and culminated in Sylhet and in such circumstances the respondent can maintain the case in Sylhet.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Anowara Begum vs Sultana Jeshmine Khan (Shoapa) and State 2 BLC 241</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 195(1)(a) and 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The learned Magistrate suo motu initiated a proceeding under section 188 of the Penal Code and took cognizance of the offence violating the provision of section 195(1)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure providing that no Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under sections 172 to 188 of the Penal Code, except on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned or of some other public servant to whom he is subordinate and hence there is illegality in initiating the proceeding against the petitioner and others and as such the proceedings are quashed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abdul Ahad @ Md Abdul Ahad vs State 5 BLC 598</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 195(1)(c)—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The allegation against the petitioner is the misappropriation of an amount of money withdrawn from the bank by preparing witnesses’ fictitious TA bills while performing administrative duties and such acts are not being a part of any judicial proceeding, the provision of section 195(1)(c) of the Code is not attracted.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abu Sufian Mia vs State 4 BLC 193</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 195(1)(c)—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section 195(1 )(c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure has reference only to a forged document and not to a copy of it.

As the offences under sections 323, 324 and 325 of the Penal Code can be compounded by the person or persons to whom the hurt is caused, the order of composition of the alleged offence suffers from legal infirmity and cannot operate as an acquittal of the accused persons as far as the second complainant is concerned and the doctrine of double jeopardy enunciated in section 403, CrPC is hardly applicable in this case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Nurul Islam and others vs Md Velon Mia and another 1 BLC 252</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 403(1) &amp; 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In view of the provisions of section 403(1) CrPC and Article 35 of the Constitution the rifle as recovered from the accused persons during investigation of the earlier dacoity case, ended in conviction, there cannot be any separate proceeding and the prosecution against the accused persons in the present case is incompetent which is liable to be quashed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abdur Rashid and others vs State 1 BLC 180</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 408—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A senior judicial officer should not have shown so much unwarranted agility in condoning the delay in filing the appeal without notifying the other side and thereby exercising his discretion not judicially but arbitrarily.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">This sort of hot haste conduct of the learned Sessions Judge cannot be approved of.

text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 426—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">While disposing of an application for bail in a pending criminal appeal the High Court Division would avoid writing out a long judgment by issuing a Rule and it is required to exercise its discretion judiciously in either granting or refusing bail at the time of the admission of appeal. In the cases where bail is not granted it is desirable that the appeal be disposed of as expeditiously as possible.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Hasimuddin &amp; another vs State 1 BLC (AD) 16</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 426—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bail in pending appeal— As the appellant Nos. 1 and 2 are full brothers and the appellant No. 3 who is more than 72 years old is their father and although there is allegation against the appellant Nos. 1 and 2 that they assaulted some of the PWs but there is contradiction in the evidence of PWs and in such facts and circumstances of the case the appellants are enlarged on bail for ends of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Noor Alam Fakir &amp; 2 others vs State 2 BLC 230</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 426—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bail in a pending appeal— It appears that convict petitioner No. 1 has been implicated in this case simply as an order giver and excepting this there is no other allegation against him.

In the present case, the cause of action arose on 19-1-96 and the petition of complaint was required to be filed within one month from 19-1-96 in compliance with clause (b) of section 141 of the Act which having not been done by the complainant the cognizance of the offence cannot be taken upon such complaint and hence the impugned proceeding is quashed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>SM Anwar Hossain vs Shafiul Alam (Chand) &amp; another 4 BLC (AD) 106</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In view of the provisions of section 3 of the Anti-Corruption Act, 1947 and paragraph 59 of the Anti-Corruption Manual the investigation held by an Assistant Inspector of the Bureau of the Anti- Corruption was not illegal and without jurisdiction as has been rightly found by the High Court Division as the investigation by an Assistant Inspector does not per se become without jurisdiction and a proceeding cannot also be quashed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abul Hossain (Md) vs State 4 BLC (AD) 122</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Unless the auditor under section 53 of the Wakf Ordinance held that a Mutwalli was guilty of breach of trust it would not make out a case of breach of trust on the vague allegations as to his failure to disburse the dues due to the beneficiaries.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Nazrul Islam Motlick vs Khowaj Au Biswas and another 4 BLC (AD) 239</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section 110 of Banking Companies Act, 1991 also provides that a Manager, Officer and other functionaries of the Banking Company are deemed to be public servants under section 21 of the Penal Code and hence the appellant and the respondent are public servants and the case has been rightly instituted in the Court of Special Judge against the respondent. Moreso, section 5 of Act II of 1947 speaks of the offences as mentioned in the schedule of the Act to be tried by Special Judges and in the schedule there are sections 403 and 477A of the Penal Code with which the accused has been charged for committing misconduct as a public servant.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>International Finance Investment and Commerce Bank Ltd vs Abdul Quayum and another 4 BLC (AD) 255.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Inherent jurisdiction can be exercised even after framing of charge against the accused on the ground that the allegation of facts even if true do not support the accusation or any other offence against him but while framing charge or exercising inherent jurisdiction mixed question of fact and law cannot be resolved in an abstract manner without the facts surfacing at the trial. As found by the learned Third Single Judge, materials exist which allegedly connect the petitioner with the allegations against him and it is only at the trial that the probative value of the evidence led by the prosecution will be examined, there is no ground for interference.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Moudud Ahmed vs State 1 BLC (AD) 30</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is well known that guilty intention as an ingredient of an offence is required to be proved by evidence and circumstances at the trial and this matter cannot be considered for quashing the proceeding under section 561 CrPC. It is enough that allegations are there in the petition of complaint constituting the alleged offence about which there is no doubt in the present case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Tamizul Haque vs Anisul Haque 1 BLC (AD) 169.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A prima facie case of abetment of the alleged offences against the petitioner has been disclosed in the petition of complaint and the provision of Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 has also made abetment of the alleged offences punishable, and as such the High Court Division rightly refused to quash the proceeding.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abul Hossain Abu vs State 1 BLC (AD) 173.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A criminal proceeding cannot be quashed on the basis of defence materials which are still not part of the materials for the prosecution. The High Court Division deviated from a well-known norm of disposal of an application for quashing criminal proceeding by taking into account the defence version of the case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Rahela Khatun vs Md Abul Hassan and others 1 BLC (AD) 176</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">On the allegation as made out in the FIR it has been prima facie made out that the accused petitioners were engaged in the production or adulteration of drug and medicine and as such a prima facie case has been made out against them. The question as to whether the persons were really engaged in manufacturing adulterated ampiciline at the relevant time is a matter to be decided on evidence at the time of trial and as such the question of quashing the proceeding does not arise.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Faziul Hoque Bhuiyan (Md) and others vs State 1 BLC (AD) 181</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It appears from the complaint-petition that from the very beginning of the marriage demands for money were being made and that Taka 50,000.00 was demanded as a dowry for the last time. Whether this demand constituted ‘dowry’ can be determined on evidence during trial and, as such, it is not a fit case for quashing the proceeding.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Lutfar Rahman (Md) vs Khadiza Khatoon and another 1 BLC (AD) 182</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Upon a plain reading of the petition of complaint it appears that a prima facie case of criminal offence has been clearly made out. In a proceeding under section 561A CrPC. the High Court Division has little scope to scrutinise the truth or otherwise of any document or other evidence which may be used as a defence in a criminal proceeding. The impugned judgment and order do not warrant any interference.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Shamol Chandra Das vs State and another 1 BLC (AD) 140</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">From a plain reading of the petition of complaint it is clear that the initial intention of cheating and the elements of criminal breach of trust have, very well, been alleged therein and, as such, on the face of these allegations it is difficult to say that no prima facie case has been alleged to have been committed by the petitioners under sections 406/420 of the Penal Code. The impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division do not suffer from any illegality. Seeking leave to appeal without appearing in the High Court Division is disapproved.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Habibur Rahman (Md) and another vs State, through the Deputy commissione, Narayanganj and another 1 BLC (AD) 146</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">When a prima facie case is made out and the case is at the trial stage the trial Court should be allowed to proceed with the case and prosecution should not be stifled. The High Court Division was correct that under the circumstances of the case inherent powers of the court could not be exercised for quashment of the case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Sayed Abu Zafar vs State and another 1 BLC (AD) 188</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;

Right to freedom of speech as enshrined by Article 39 of the Constitution is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest of the security of the State, public order, incitement to offence, etc. A democracy cannot thrive if the law of preventive detention is allowed to be used as the Damocles’ sword to stifle the voice of people working in the public field. The best course for administration is to set the appropriate law in motion in case of violation of any law. Hence, the alleged activities of the detenu as narrated in the grounds of detention do not constitute “prejudicial act” within the meaning of section 2(f) of the Act and as such the detention order is illegal and cannot be sustained.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Halima Farzana vs Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and others 4 BLC 189</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Article 49—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">As there is no scope for altering the conviction from one under clause 1(b) to clause 1(a) of the table of section 19 of the Act reducing the sentence on compassionate ground considering the age of the respondent who may approach the Government or the President, if so advised, for any relief that she may choose to pray.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>State vs Miss Eliadah McCord 2 BLC (AD) 1</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Article 53—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In view of the provisions of section 403(1) CrPC and Article 35 of the Constitution the rifle as recovered from the accused persons during investigation of the earlier dacoity case, ended in conviction, there cannot be any separate proceeding and the prosecution against the accused persons in the present case is incompetent which is liable to be quashed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abdur Rashid and others vs State 1 BLC 180.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Article 102—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The respondent No.1 did not have any authority to lease out the disputed land in favour of the petitioner relying on such wrong record and false report for which the submission that the petitioner acquired indefeasible title in the land in question by virtue of the lease deed and that the impugned Telex Message is without lawful authority cannot be accepted as the respondent No. 1 had no control and management of the land in question and as such the alleged delivery of possession of the land to the petitioner by Tahsilder is a mere paper transaction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Ansar Ali son of late Nawsher Ali vs State 3 BLC 68.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Article 105—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A review of a judgment is a serious step and reluctant resort to it is proper only where a glaring omission or patent mistake or like grave error has crept in earlier by judicial fallibility.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Munir Hossain vs State 1 BLC (AD) 82.</em></strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>

The learned Judges of the High Court Division while delivering earlier judgment did not take into consideration two leading decisions wherein it has been held that where an Act repeals an earlier Act, and a different intention appears, the repeal shall not affect any liability incurred or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against any enactment so repealed and hence the earlier judgment of the High Court Division was given “per incuriam”.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abul Kalam Khan vs Reaz Morshed and another 5 BLC 528.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 6—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">From the savings clause in section 29 (2)(3) of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishes Bidhan) Am, 1995 there is nothing in the language from which it can be concluded that only the cases pending for trial before any Special Tribunal or pending investigation under the Cruelty to Women (Deterrent Punishment) Ordinance, 1983 in its restricted meaning have been saved. If such restricted interpretation is accepted then the accused persons who have committed offence under such repealed enactment will get premium without facing trial which could not be intention of the legislature. The repealing Act does not indicate any intention of destroying the liability or penalty incurred under the repealing Act. In the repealing Act, there is specific mention of only cases which were under investigation or under trial but it does not appear from the repealing Act that the offences, which were committed under the repealed Act which are covered by section 6(b)(c) and (d) of the General Clauses Act, would be deemed to have been destroyed. Section 6 of the General Clauses Act will be applicable unless the new legislation manifests an intention incompatible with or contrary to the provisions of the section. Such incompatibility would have to be ascertained from a consideration of all the relevant provisions of the new law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abul Kalam Khan vs Reaz Morshed and another 5 BLC 528.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 6—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">An accused is to be tried in accordance with procedure prevailing on the day trial commenced and if the procedure is changed by the time trial commenced the accused cannot claim vested right to be tried in accordance with the provisions of the repealed procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Sultan Ahmed and others vs State 1 BLC 158.</em></strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>

It must be made clear that the law which we have declared has nevergranted absolute power either to the Government or to the President to make anorder of detention even in the circumstances mentioned in the judgment nor itis the law that the satisfaction upon which an order of detention is made isimmune from challenge. The power of the Supreme Court in making scrutiny ofexecutive acts never recedes to the background, as observed by the learnedJudge, so long as the Constitution remains operative. The maintenance of lawand order, public peace, public safety and security are undisputedly concerns ofthe State and the Government know best how to preserve them, but the Court'sconcern in a case of preventive detention is to see whether the person is beingdetained without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner.</p><p><b><i>Mostafizur Rahman vs Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary Ministryof Home Affairs and another 51 DLR 1</i></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Section 3—</b></p><p>Pendency of specific criminal cases and facts giving rise tosuch cases cannot be used as grounds of detention under this section. </p><p><b><i>Jahanara Begum vs State 46 DLR 107.</i></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Section 3—</b></p><p>An order of the District Magistrate for detention of aperson shall not remain in force for more than 30 days unless it is approved bythe Government.</p><p>An order of detention passed by the DistrictMagistrate/Additional District Magistrate for 30 days only does not requireapproval of the government.
