Since the offence under section 17 punishable under section 24 of the Securities and Exchange Ordinance entails imprisonment upto five years, no illegality was committed by CMM in passing an order of issuance of warrant of arrest against the accused persons.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Shainpukur Holding Ltd vs Security Exchange Commission 3 BLC 148.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 4(h)—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The word “report” in section 25 of the Securities and Exchange Ordinance 1969 instead of the word “complaint” signifies that cognizance of an offence under this Ordinance can be taken on the basis of a report and not on the basis of a “complaint” as defined in section 4(h) of the Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Shainpukur Holding Ltd vs Security Exchange Commission 3 BLC 148.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 4(p)—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The combined effect of section 4(p) of the Code and the Police Regulation No.207(c) is that when the officer-in-charge of a police station is absent</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">from the police station or unable from illness or other cause to perform his duties, the police officer present at the station-house who is next in rank to such officer can assume charge of the police station to exercise any of the functions of the officer-in-charge of that police station.

As the punishment has provided for the offences under section 19(1), 6(Kha), 22(Ga) and 25 of the Am of 1990 exceeds imprisonment for more than 5 years, the offences are only triable by the Court of Session and the contention that the case is not triable by the Court of Session is not sustainable and the proceedings are not liable to be quashed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Arjun Saha and ors vs State 5 BLC 416</em></strong></p><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 10 &amp; 13—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, Sessions Courts are functionally and institutionally separate from the executive organ but the magistrates are members of the administrative service being controlled by the District Magistrate who is also the Deputy Commissioner and controller of the District i.e. top of the administrative head of district but for implementation of the provisions of Articles 115 and 116 of the Constitution Magistrates performing judicial functions must be separated from administrative Magistrates and brought under the control of the Sessions Judge and through him of the Supreme Court for which the Code of Criminal Procedure is required to be amended immediately.

Any departure or deviation from the main story disclosed at the earliest recorded version may be looked upon with great suspicion. During the trial the prosecution has made a departure from the mainstream of the prosecution story as stated in the FIR and introduced an altogether new story of demanding chanda of Taka 5,000.00.

From the evidence of PW 4 it appears in cross- examination that accused appellant Feroj subsequently retracted the confession by a petition but now the law is settled that once the confessional statement was found correct and voluntary, subsequent retraction is no retraction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Saiful Islam (Md) alias Saiful &amp; another vs State 1 BLC 519</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 164-</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The confessing accused was arrested on 4-3-90 at 4-AM and produced before the Magistrate on 6-3-90 at 10 AM for recording confessional statement which shows that the accused was kept in custody for 54-1/2 hours after arrest without remand by a Magistrate and no explanation was given for such custody and as such the prolonged police custody immediately preceding the making of the confession is sufficient to treat it as involuntary.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Shaharul Islam alias Green vs State 1 BLC 524</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 164—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Both the appellants were not assured by the recording Magistrate that whether they made any confessional  statements or not they would not be sent back to the police custody but instead they would be sent to the judicial custody and ultimately they were sent to the police custody when the evidence of PWs. 5 and 6 shows that the confessing accused persons were assaulted by the police which comprehensively prove that the confessional statements were the outcome of a lingering fear having no evidentiary value.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Nil Ratan Biswas and others vs State 3 BLC 35</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 164 &amp; 342—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">After the confession the condemned-prisoner was sent to Munshiganj Sub-Jail.
