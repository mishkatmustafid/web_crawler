It is the primary responsibility of the conducting police prosecutor or the public prosecutor to produce the witness in the case. There is nothing on record to show that any step was taken by the prosecution through the police officer to secure the attendance of any witness in the case.

The learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate before rejecting the report submitted by the police held a judicial enquiry through another Metropolitan Magistrate and on the basis of the police report as well as the judicial enquiry report took cognizance of the offence which is covered by section 190(1) of the Code and as such the proceeding cannot be quashed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Nurul Hoque and others vs State and another 4 BLC 74.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 173 and 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sessions Judge has no authority to direct the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence and such order of taking cognizance by the Magistrate is set aside but the proceeding against the petitioner cannot be quashed and hence the case is sent back to the learned Magistrate for taking steps for holding further investigation.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Hazi isakur Rahman vs State 4 BLC 524.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 179 and 180—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">As from the FIR it prima facie appears that the occurrence took place in Dhaka and then it continued and culminated in Sylhet and in such circumstances the respondent can maintain the case in Sylhet.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Anowara Begum vs Sultana Jeshmine Khan (Shoapa) and State 2 BLC 241</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 195(1)(a) and 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The learned Magistrate suo motu initiated a proceeding under section 188 of the Penal Code and took cognizance of the offence violating the provision of section 195(1)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure providing that no Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under sections 172 to 188 of the Penal Code, except on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned or of some other public servant to whom he is subordinate and hence there is illegality in initiating the proceeding against the petitioner and others and as such the proceedings are quashed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abdul Ahad @ Md Abdul Ahad vs State 5 BLC 598</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 195(1)(c)—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The allegation against the petitioner is the misappropriation of an amount of money withdrawn from the bank by preparing witnesses’ fictitious TA bills while performing administrative duties and such acts are not being a part of any judicial proceeding, the provision of section 195(1)(c) of the Code is not attracted.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abu Sufian Mia vs State 4 BLC 193</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 195(1)(c)—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section 195(1 )(c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure has reference only to a forged document and not to a copy of it.
