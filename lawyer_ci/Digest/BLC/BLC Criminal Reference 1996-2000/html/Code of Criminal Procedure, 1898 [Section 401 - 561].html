As the offences under sections 323, 324 and 325 of the Penal Code can be compounded by the person or persons to whom the hurt is caused, the order of composition of the alleged offence suffers from legal infirmity and cannot operate as an acquittal of the accused persons as far as the second complainant is concerned and the doctrine of double jeopardy enunciated in section 403, CrPC is hardly applicable in this case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Nurul Islam and others vs Md Velon Mia and another 1 BLC 252</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 403(1) &amp; 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In view of the provisions of section 403(1) CrPC and Article 35 of the Constitution the rifle as recovered from the accused persons during investigation of the earlier dacoity case, ended in conviction, there cannot be any separate proceeding and the prosecution against the accused persons in the present case is incompetent which is liable to be quashed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abdur Rashid and others vs State 1 BLC 180</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 408—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A senior judicial officer should not have shown so much unwarranted agility in condoning the delay in filing the appeal without notifying the other side and thereby exercising his discretion not judicially but arbitrarily.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">This sort of hot haste conduct of the learned Sessions Judge cannot be approved of.

text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 426—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">While disposing of an application for bail in a pending criminal appeal the High Court Division would avoid writing out a long judgment by issuing a Rule and it is required to exercise its discretion judiciously in either granting or refusing bail at the time of the admission of appeal. In the cases where bail is not granted it is desirable that the appeal be disposed of as expeditiously as possible.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Hasimuddin &amp; another vs State 1 BLC (AD) 16</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 426—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bail in pending appeal— As the appellant Nos. 1 and 2 are full brothers and the appellant No. 3 who is more than 72 years old is their father and although there is allegation against the appellant Nos. 1 and 2 that they assaulted some of the PWs but there is contradiction in the evidence of PWs and in such facts and circumstances of the case the appellants are enlarged on bail for ends of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Noor Alam Fakir &amp; 2 others vs State 2 BLC 230</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 426—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bail in a pending appeal— It appears that convict petitioner No. 1 has been implicated in this case simply as an order giver and excepting this there is no other allegation against him. For which he is entitled to be released on bail.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Maharam Ali &amp; another vs State 2 BLC 401</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;

text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 438 and 439A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sessions Judges have been given revisional powers by section 439A of CrPC to make final orders but simultaneously their powers to make recommendation to the High Court Division for orders under section 438 has remained intact as the legislature has consciously kept section 438 alive even after the Sessions Judges have been invested with the powers under section 439A.</p><p style="text-align: justify;

text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 439—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is now well settled that merely because the Court deciding a revision against acquittal of the accused may arrive at a different conclusion on consideration of the evidence on record would not be justified in reversing the decision of the trial Court unless it is possible to demonstrate with certainty that none of the grounds upon which trial Court acquitted the accused is at all supportable, the same being manifestly wrong or perverse.</p><p style="text-align: justify;

text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 439A, 540 and 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It cannot be approved as a universal principle that a party who has been unsuccessful in revision under sections 439A, CrPC is totally debarred from invoking the inherent power under section 561A, CrPC but insofar as the instant cases are concerned the trial Magistrate upon appreciating the material facts was not satisfied with the prayer for recalling the prosecution witnesses for cross- examination and there are no illegalities in those orders which warrant the exercise of jurisdiction under section 561A, CrPC.</p><p style="text-align: justify;

text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 439A and 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The petitioner moved the Sessions Judge in revision and he having failed there has again filed an application before the High Court Division for quashing of the proceeding under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure which he is precluded by law as because there was no lack of jurisdiction by the Sessions Judge to dispose of the case nor there was any erroneous exercise of jurisdiction by the court concerned. So this is only a camouflage for filing a second revisional application.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>MA Mottalib vs Narayan Kumar Agarwala and others 3 BLC (AD) 62</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 439 and 417—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">When complainant has been given a limited right of appeal against an order of acquittal under the amended sub-section (2) of section 417, CrPC on the ground of error of law then informant should also be given the right of preferring appeal alike the complainant and such right of appeal should be on the grounds of error of fact as well as law and the revisional Court also shall have the power to convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction by amending the above provisions as there is no justification for restricting the appeal by the complainant only to the question of law after abolition of the jury trial long before.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Ali Akbar vs State and others 3 BLC 465</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 439A and 439—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The Sessions Judge is quite competent to decide and rectify any illegal order passed by the subordinate Courts in exercise of its revisional power under section 439A of the Code and as such the petitioners have no right to come straightaway to the High Court Division for vindication of their grievance bypassing the Sessions Judge.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Tajul Islam and others vs State and another 3 BLC 527</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 439A and 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The facts as alleged in the petition of complaint constitute a prinwi facie criminal intention of cheating and deception in the mind of the petitioner which is still continuing because of the nonpayment of any part of the amount alleged in the complaint-petition and all these are the matters for decision at the time of trial after taking evidences and that after exhausting the remedy under section 439A the jurisdiction under section 561A, CrPC cannot be invoked.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Kamal Hossain vs Zahid Hasan &amp; another 3 BLC 378</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 476 and 476B—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">All that the appellate Court, as expressed by section 476B of the Code, can do is to direct the withdrawal of the complaint if made by the trial Court or itself make the complaint which might have been made by the subordinate Court following the provision of section 476. Sending a case on remand by the appellate Court amounts to acting beyond jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Khizir Hayat Khan Eusuf Zai vs Major (Retd) Md Muqtadir Ali and others 4 BLC (AD) 100</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 476(1) &amp; 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The learned Special Judge considering the depositions of the petitioner and the concerned Magistrate given in the Special case in question and exercising its jurisdicti6n under section 476(1), CrPC recorded its finding and rightly made a complaint to the District Magistrate Jhalakati wherefrom the magistrate concerned rightly started a complaint case and took cognizance of the offence under sections 193/212 of the Penal Code and hance the petition under section 561A, CrPC is a misconceived one.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Masudur Rahman (Md) vs State 5 BLC 286</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 476(1) and 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">When the learned Special Judge considering the depositions of the petitioners as PW 6 and PW 10 and the concerned Magistrate as PW 9 given in the special case exercised his jurisdiction under section 476(1), CrPC and recorded his findings and rightly made a complaint to the District Magistrate whereupon the concerned Magistrate rightly took cognizance of the offence under sections 193/212 of the Penal Code and such offence is not dependent upon the acquittal or conviction of the original accused persons for whom the false evidence was given or sought to be screened from punishment and the learned Special Judge need not wait for forwarding a petition of complaint till conclusion of the trial to observe the effect of such deposition and hence the application for quashing the proceeding is misconceived.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Masudur Rahman Mollah and another vs State 5 BLC 145</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 488—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Provisions of the Ordinance have empowered the Court to entertain, try and dispose of any suit relating to five matters including maintenance but such power is not given to a Magistrate under section 488, CrPC but power of Magistrate has not been curtailed consequent to the establishment of the Family Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Rezaul Karim vs Rashida Begum and another 1 BLC 198</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 488(1)(3)—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In view of the provisions of section 16(3B) of the Family Courts Ordinance, 1985 the executing Court may direct for civil imprisonment once again for failure to pay money of the subsequent installments and this power can also be exercised as a Magistrate while dealing with cases under section 488(I)(3), CrPC.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Maksuda Akhter vs Md Serajul Islam 5 BLC 595</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 491—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Release of a girl from the judicial custody—Although the victim girl is neither an accused nor a witness in the criminal case but she is kept in judicial custody.
