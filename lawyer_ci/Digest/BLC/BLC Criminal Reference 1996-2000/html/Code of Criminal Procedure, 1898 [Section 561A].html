In the present case, the cause of action arose on 19-1-96 and the petition of complaint was required to be filed within one month from 19-1-96 in compliance with clause (b) of section 141 of the Act which having not been done by the complainant the cognizance of the offence cannot be taken upon such complaint and hence the impugned proceeding is quashed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>SM Anwar Hossain vs Shafiul Alam (Chand) &amp; another 4 BLC (AD) 106</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In view of the provisions of section 3 of the Anti-Corruption Act, 1947 and paragraph 59 of the Anti-Corruption Manual the investigation held by an Assistant Inspector of the Bureau of the Anti- Corruption was not illegal and without jurisdiction as has been rightly found by the High Court Division as the investigation by an Assistant Inspector does not per se become without jurisdiction and a proceeding cannot also be quashed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abul Hossain (Md) vs State 4 BLC (AD) 122</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Unless the auditor under section 53 of the Wakf Ordinance held that a Mutwalli was guilty of breach of trust it would not make out a case of breach of trust on the vague allegations as to his failure to disburse the dues due to the beneficiaries.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Nazrul Islam Motlick vs Khowaj Au Biswas and another 4 BLC (AD) 239</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section 110 of Banking Companies Act, 1991 also provides that a Manager, Officer and other functionaries of the Banking Company are deemed to be public servants under section 21 of the Penal Code and hence the appellant and the respondent are public servants and the case has been rightly instituted in the Court of Special Judge against the respondent. Moreso, section 5 of Act II of 1947 speaks of the offences as mentioned in the schedule of the Act to be tried by Special Judges and in the schedule there are sections 403 and 477A of the Penal Code with which the accused has been charged for committing misconduct as a public servant.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>International Finance Investment and Commerce Bank Ltd vs Abdul Quayum and another 4 BLC (AD) 255.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Inherent jurisdiction can be exercised even after framing of charge against the accused on the ground that the allegation of facts even if true do not support the accusation or any other offence against him but while framing charge or exercising inherent jurisdiction mixed question of fact and law cannot be resolved in an abstract manner without the facts surfacing at the trial. As found by the learned Third Single Judge, materials exist which allegedly connect the petitioner with the allegations against him and it is only at the trial that the probative value of the evidence led by the prosecution will be examined, there is no ground for interference.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Moudud Ahmed vs State 1 BLC (AD) 30</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is well known that guilty intention as an ingredient of an offence is required to be proved by evidence and circumstances at the trial and this matter cannot be considered for quashing the proceeding under section 561 CrPC. It is enough that allegations are there in the petition of complaint constituting the alleged offence about which there is no doubt in the present case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Tamizul Haque vs Anisul Haque 1 BLC (AD) 169.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A prima facie case of abetment of the alleged offences against the petitioner has been disclosed in the petition of complaint and the provision of Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 has also made abetment of the alleged offences punishable, and as such the High Court Division rightly refused to quash the proceeding.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abul Hossain Abu vs State 1 BLC (AD) 173.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A criminal proceeding cannot be quashed on the basis of defence materials which are still not part of the materials for the prosecution. The High Court Division deviated from a well-known norm of disposal of an application for quashing criminal proceeding by taking into account the defence version of the case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Rahela Khatun vs Md Abul Hassan and others 1 BLC (AD) 176</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">On the allegation as made out in the FIR it has been prima facie made out that the accused petitioners were engaged in the production or adulteration of drug and medicine and as such a prima facie case has been made out against them. The question as to whether the persons were really engaged in manufacturing adulterated ampiciline at the relevant time is a matter to be decided on evidence at the time of trial and as such the question of quashing the proceeding does not arise.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Faziul Hoque Bhuiyan (Md) and others vs State 1 BLC (AD) 181</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It appears from the complaint-petition that from the very beginning of the marriage demands for money were being made and that Taka 50,000.00 was demanded as a dowry for the last time. Whether this demand constituted ‘dowry’ can be determined on evidence during trial and, as such, it is not a fit case for quashing the proceeding.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Lutfar Rahman (Md) vs Khadiza Khatoon and another 1 BLC (AD) 182</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Upon a plain reading of the petition of complaint it appears that a prima facie case of criminal offence has been clearly made out. In a proceeding under section 561A CrPC. the High Court Division has little scope to scrutinise the truth or otherwise of any document or other evidence which may be used as a defence in a criminal proceeding. The impugned judgment and order do not warrant any interference.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Shamol Chandra Das vs State and another 1 BLC (AD) 140</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">From a plain reading of the petition of complaint it is clear that the initial intention of cheating and the elements of criminal breach of trust have, very well, been alleged therein and, as such, on the face of these allegations it is difficult to say that no prima facie case has been alleged to have been committed by the petitioners under sections 406/420 of the Penal Code. The impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division do not suffer from any illegality. Seeking leave to appeal without appearing in the High Court Division is disapproved.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Habibur Rahman (Md) and another vs State, through the Deputy commissione, Narayanganj and another 1 BLC (AD) 146</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">When a prima facie case is made out and the case is at the trial stage the trial Court should be allowed to proceed with the case and prosecution should not be stifled. The High Court Division was correct that under the circumstances of the case inherent powers of the court could not be exercised for quashment of the case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Sayed Abu Zafar vs State and another 1 BLC (AD) 188</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;
