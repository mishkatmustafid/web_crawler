Corroborative evidence is not an imperative component of judicial credence in every case of rape. Corroboration as a condition of judicial, reliance on the testimony of a victim of sex crime is not a requirement of law but merely a guidance of prudence under a given circumstances but not a requirement of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Harun-or Rashid and another vs State and another 5 BLC 524.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em><br clear="all" style="page-break-before: always;"/> </em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 4(c)—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The appellant was the prime kidnapper and he forcibly had sexual intercourse with Mahinur and that the other convicts are entitled to get the benefit of doubt as has been rightly found by the High Court Division as such finding is based on proper appreciation of evidence on record and hence no interference is warranted.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Bazlu Talukder vs State 5 BLC (AD) 159</em></strong></p><p><strong><br/> </strong></p><p><strong>Section 4(c)—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">As the PWs contradicted each other as to who accompanied the appellant Bazlu in kidnapping the girl aged 15 years who was raped by only one convict who is none other than Bazlu but the other convicts are full brother and bhaista of him and it is highly improbable that all those persons together would commit sexual intercourse on the girl when they are not professional or hardened criminals and hence other convicts are entitled to get benefit of doubt.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Bazlu Talukder and others vs State 1 BLC 261</em></strong></p><p><strong><br/> </strong></p><p><strong>Section 4(c)—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In a sex-offence case there is no legal bar in believing the sole testimony of the prosecutrix, nay, she must prima facie be believed, except in the rarest of rare cases where she is found unreliable the necessity of corroborative evidence will arise and that the legal custom of insisting on corroboration in every case or alternatively of stating the reason for waiving such corroboration is not applicable in our country and accordingly the appeal is dismissed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Jahangir Hossain vs State 1 BLC 292.</em></strong></p><p><strong><br/> </strong></p><p><strong>Section 9—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">As the FIR disclosed a prima facie case of abetment punishable under section 9 of the Ordinance, the Special Tribunal committed no illegality in framing charge against the appellant.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Anowara Begum vs Sultana Jesmine Khan (Shoapa) and State 2 BLC 241.</em></strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
