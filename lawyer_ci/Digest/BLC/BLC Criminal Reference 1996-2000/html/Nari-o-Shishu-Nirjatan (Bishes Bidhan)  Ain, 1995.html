It is held that as the case is now under trial and it is likely to be completed within a very short time and the gravity of the offence deserves not to enlarge the petitioner on bail but a direction was given to grant bail to the appellant if the trial is not concluded within a period of 3 months from this day.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Rashid Khan, son of Dildar Hossain alias Dilbar Hossain vs State 2 BLC 580.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 24—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishes Adalat, upon an application, cannot release the respondent No.1 from safe custody disrespecting the findings of the High Court Division.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Asgar Ali vs Anjuman Ara Mukta and another 5 BLC 363.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 24—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It appears that charge was framed on 27-4-97 against the appellant and his mother but not a single witness appeared in the Court and although the informant appeared in Court on several occasions but has not yet been examined as PW 1 which made it a case of deliberate attempt to delay the conclusion of the trial and hence the appellant is entitled to get the benefit of section 339C.
