Moreso, section 5 of Act II of 1947 speaks of the offences as mentioned in the schedule of the Act to be tried by Special Judges and in the schedule there are sections 403 and 477A of the Penal Code with which the accused has been charged for committing misconduct as a public servant.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>International Finance Investment and Commerce Bank Ltd vs Abdul Quayum and another 4 BLC (AD) 255.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 34—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Although under section 34 of the Penal Code, when a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone, in awarding punishment each of such persons may be sentenced to death if there is direct evidence of their criminal act in furtherance ci the common intention of all.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Khalil Mia vs State 4 BLC (AD) 223.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 34—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">There is no evidence whatsoever from the side of the prosecution that the accused- appellants attacked Momdel Hossain to kill him, rather it appears that the presence of deceased Momdel at the place of occurrence is accidental one and as such the prosecution has failed to prove the ingredient of section 34 of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>State vs Azharul Islam 3 BLC 382.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 34—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Under section 34 of the Penal Code, the essence of joint liability is to be found in the commonness of intention animating the accused in doing of criminal act in furtherance of such intention. The circumstances of this case patently show that the common intention of the four appellants was to cause the offence under section 325 read with 34 of the Penal Code and accordingly they are guilty under sections 325/34 instead of sections 302/34 of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>State vs Kowsar 1 BLC 455.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 34—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Common intention is a state of mind which may develop in the course of the transaction constituting the offence and may be gathered from the number and nature of injuries inflicted on the person of the victim when in the instant case as many as 13 injuries most of which were grievous in nature were caused as a result of frontal attack can be said to be a result of pre— concert. Although the convict-appellant Badal had no pistol or any weapon in his hands, but in a different manner he also prevented the victim either from fleeing away or warding off the attack and facilitated the consequent infliction of injuries resulting in his death.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>AKM Ataur Rahman Khan alias Badal and another vs State 5 BLC 508.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 34, 109 &amp; 302—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Under section 34 the two elements that constitute the crime are the common intention and the participation in the crime, while those in the case under section 149 are the common object and the participation in the unlawful assembly. Where the common object becomes equivalent to the common intention and where participation in the assembly is coupled with the participation in the crime then the two elements of both the constructive liabilities become the same. In such cases, no separate charge need be framed for each of them as laid down under section 233, CrPC and the conviction of the accused may be altered from one under sections 302/149 to that under sections 302/34 without there being a charge for the latter as provided under sections 236 and 237, CrPC.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>State vs Abdul Hye Miaji and others 1 BLC 125.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 34, 302 and 324—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In the absence of premeditated intention to kill, the injuries caused by the four accused persons are not being grievous in nature and the same has no contribution towards the cause of death for which they would not be guilty of the offence under section 302 of the Penal Code and accordingly, their conviction is altered from 302/34 of the Penal Code to that of under section 324 of the Penal Code and the sentence is reduced to the period already undergone.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Madris and others vs State 2 BLC 249.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 57 and 302—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sentence— Normal sentence under section 302 of the Penal Code is death but under some extenuating circumstances it may be imprisonment for life but such sentence can never be 30 years taking the aid of section 51 of the Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Farid Ali vs State 4 BLC 27.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 96 and 97—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">As there is no evidence of any aggression from the side of victim and even if there was any threatening behaviour from the victim, the person threatened could have used only that much of force which was proportionate to repel the attack. In the instant case it was a one-sided affair for which the contention that the action of the convict-appellant was in exercise of the right of private defence either of his body or property or the body and the property of others cannot be accepted.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>AKM Ataur Rahman Khan alias Badal and another vs State 5 BLC 508.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 96 and 302—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">After separating the chaff of falsehood from the grains of truth it is found that the prosecution has failed to prove their case against Wali and Khalil and the convict Sayed exercised his right of private defence for which he is entitled to get the benefit of section 96 of the Penal Code and they are found not guilty of the charge of murder.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Syedur Rahman and 2 others vs State 3 BLC 299.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Sections 141 and 143—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Hartal is an unlawful assembly if criminal force is applied in its favour or to oppose it—While a hartal is observed by an assembly of five or more persons and their associates without holding procession or picket it will not be an unlawful assembly but if any criminal force is applied to observe such hartal then the members of the unlawful assembly falling within the purview of the fifth clause to section 141 of Penal Code will be liable to be punished under section 143 of Penal Code.

The respondents have committed an offence punishable under section 166 of the Penal Code.
