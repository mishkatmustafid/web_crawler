Bangladesh and others, 21 BLD (HCD) 568.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—19(2)</strong></p><p>It cannot be said that barring a thrice- elected member of the Managing Committee to stand for election again till the lapse of 2 years since his last term expired, is an unreasonable restriction.</p><p><strong>Md. Abdus Sattar Vs. Bangladesh and others, 13 BLD(AD)103</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—86</strong></p><p>There is nothing in section 86 of the Ordinance to indicate that a past officer of a cooperative society cannot raise a dispute as regards his dismissal from service or as to any matter connected with his service, In that view of the matter, the dispute case filed by a past officer of the Insurance Company against his dismissal cannot be said to have been entertained by the Registrar without any lawful authority. A dispute, even if it relates to or touches a departmental disciplinary proceeding of a co-operative society, can be entertained by the Registrar for arbitration.</p><p><strong>Mr. Md. Giasuddin Vs. Bangladesh, 17 BLD (HCD) 538.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Sections—86, 87, 134(3)</strong></p><p><strong>Limitation Act, 1908, Section—5</strong></p><p>The prescribed period of limitation for filing appeal from an order passed under section 86 and 87 of the Co-operative Societies Ordinance, 1984 is one month from the date of knowledge of the decisions. Section 134(3) provides that section 5 of the Limitation Act shall not be made applicable to an appeal filed under Section 134(1). There is no reason to hold that because the petitioner could not file the appeal within prescribed period of limitation within 30 days due to devastating cyclone the petition ought to have been accepted by the learned District Judge on condonation of delay and the learned District Judge dis. missed the case illegally holding that the appeal before the appellate authority was time barred. When the Ordinance, a special enactment, excludes the application of section 5 of the Limitation Act for condonation of delay to an appeal it cannot be hold that the learned District Judge failed to exercise his jurisdiction vested under section 134(5) of the Ordinance in not condoning delay in filing the appeal. Where a special enactment expressly provides that for filing an appeal beyond period prescribed provision of Section 5 of the Limitation Act shall not be made applicable the appellate authority before whom the appeal lies has no power to condone delay by applying provision of section 5 of the Limitation Act for accepting the appeal.</p><p><strong>Afazuddin and others Vs. District Judge, Cox’s Bazar and others, 19 BLD(HCD)340.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Sections—86 and 87</strong></p><p><strong>Co-operative Societies Rules, 1987, Rules—133, 134 and 135</strong></p><p>Any dispute touching the business or affairs of a co-operative society is to be resolved in a manner as laid down in the provisions of the Ordinance and the Rules framed thereunder. In the absence of any application by any party to the arbitration for the dispute being withdrawn, the withdrawal of the dispute by the impugned memo on the direction from the concerned ministry is illegal and not sustainable in law.</p><p><strong>Abdul Malek Vs. District Co-operative Officer, Cox’s Bazar and others, 18 BLD (HCD) 277</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—134 and the Third Schedule</strong></p><p>Section 134 and the Third Schedule to the Ordinance do not provide .for any appeal against an order of the District Co-Operative Officer under Sections 18 (3) and 18 (4) of the Ordinance. In such state of affairs, it is procedurally absurd to ask the Appellant to go to a higher appellate forum to obtain a verdict on the jurisdictional error of the first appellate authority.</p><p><strong>Nani Gopal Barman Vs. Bangladesh and Others, 14 BLD (AD) 52.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—134(5)</strong></p><p>The District Judge has been empowered to entertain and hear an application at the instance of an aggrieved person against the decision of the appellate authority. The District Judge has thus been vested, with the power to revise the decision of the appellate authority on examination of the records of the proceedings of the dispute case and the appeal case if he finds that the appellate authority acted illegally or with material irregularity in deciding the appeal, causing miscarriage of justice. Under Section 134(5) there is hardly any scope for examination of witnesses or for production of fresh documents before the District Judge. The learned Additional District Judge acted illegally and with material irregularity in exercise of his jurisdiction in setting aside the order of the appellate authority on fresh evidence adduced before him instead of deciding the case on the basis of materials already placed before the appellate authority.</p><p><strong>Producers Milk Co-operative Union Ltd.

He is to see after examination of the records of the dispute case and appeal case whether the appellate authority acted illegally or with material irregularity in deciding the appeal causing miscarriage of justice. In a proceeding of this nature there is hardly any scope for examination of witnesses or production of documents afresh before him.</p><p><strong>Md. Lal Mia Vs.
