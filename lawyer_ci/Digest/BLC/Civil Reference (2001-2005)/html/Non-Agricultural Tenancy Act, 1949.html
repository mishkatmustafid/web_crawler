Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act was enacted for the first category of tenants and not for the second category. Section 85(2) of the Act speaks about the second category of tenants.</p><p>Since the lease-hold right in the land within the Dhanmondi Residential Area is transferable and heritable and yearly rent is payable to the Government, its owner is a non-agricultural tenant and not a “tenant” as mentioned in section 85(2) of the Act. An application under section 24 of the Nonagricultural Tenancy Act in respect of any land situated within Dhanmondi Residential Area is maintainable in law.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Dr. Ismat Mirza and others Vs Md.
