A tenant has no right to claim adjustment of any advance against monthly rent. Advance rent or any premium in any form being strictly prohibited by law, any agreement for advance or premium is evidently void and not enforceable. The remedy for the tenant in case of advance is to move the Rent Controller within six months of creation of the tenancy for getting an order of refund.</p><p><strong>Mymensingh Arya Dharma Gnan Prodaini Sava v. Sree Rabindra Narayan Paul, 22 BLD (HCD) 591.</strong></p><p>Ref: Shamsuddin Ahmed v. Moh. Hossain, 31 DLR(AD)155—relied.</p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Sections—18(5) and 19(1)</strong></p><p>Under Sub-section (1) of Section 19, a tenant is entitled to deposit his rent with the Rent Controller when the landlord has refused to accept the same after it was remitted to him within the specified period by postal money order in terms of Section 18 of the Ordinance. There is nothing in the ‘explanation’ to justify the view that there should be a prior personal tender of the rent to the landlord before remitting it by postal money order.</p><p>If Section 19(1) be read along with Section 18(5) of the Ordinance, it will be evident that in order to make a deposit under Subsection (1) of Section 19, the tenant is only to show that he remitted the Rent by Postal Money Order within the specified time and the landlord refused to accept it and the tenant’s prayer for deposit with the Rent Controller was made within a fortnight of the receipt of the undelivered rent sent through the postal authorities the landlord has refused to accept the within the specified period by postal of the Ordinance. There is nothing in that there should be a prior personal before remitting it by postal money.</p><p>The underlying object of this provision is to enable the tenants to fall back on the evidence of tender as preserved by the Rent Controller’s office for the purpose of subsequent determination of the question as to whether a tenant is a defaulter or not, should the landlord subsequently sue him for ejectment on the ground of default. This is for the protection of tenants and as such any ‘doubt’ regarding the meaning of the aforesaid provisions should be resolved in favour of the tenants for whose benefit it is intended.</p><p><strong>M/S.

Hassan Movies Ltd., 41 DLR(AD) 135- Cited.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Sections—18(5) and 19(1)</strong></p><p>If Section 19(1) be read along with Section 18(5) it becomes evident that a tenant is - ordinarily to pay rent within the time stipulated in the contract and in its absence by 15th day of the month next following for which rent becomes due. If the landlord refuses to accept rent sent through money order within the aforesaid period, the tenant becomes entitled under Section 19(1) (a) to deposit rent with the Rent Controller within a fortnight of the receipt of the undelivered rent. If the landlord fails to notify in writing his willingness to accept rent from the tenant, Clause (b) of Section 19(1) enables the tenant to deposit rent with the Rent Controller within 15 days from the stipulated date and in the absence of only such stipulation within 15 days from the 15th day of the month next following for which rent becomes payable.</p><p><strong>Atiqullah Vs. Mosammat Rahela Bib I4BLD(HCD)360</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Sections—18(S) and 19 (2)</strong></p><p>When a bonafide doubt or dispute arises as to who is entitled to receive the rent as per section 18 of the Ordinance, the rent may be deposited by the tenant within a fortnight of the date on which the rent becomes due or from the expiry of the time within which such rent is required to be paid under sub-section (5) of Section 18. The question of bonafide doubt or dispute as to who is entitled to receive rent pre-supposes a dispute as to the ownership of the premises. Unfounded plea of bonafide dispute will not entitle the tenant to invoke the provision of sub-section (2) of Section 19 of the Ordinance.</p><p>If after receipt of the notice of attornment from the plaintiff the defendant does not offer rent to the plaintiff and the latter does not refuse it, the deposit of rent in the House Rent Controller Case by impleading the transferee landlord will not save the tenant from default and ejectment.</p><p><strong>Abul Hossain Vs. Md. Islam, 15 BLD (AD)9.</strong></p><p>Ref: 4 BLD(AD) 280—Cited.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Sections—10(b) and 18(5)</strong></p><p><strong>Contract Act, 1872 (IX of 1872), Section—23</strong></p><p>Section 10(b) of the Ordinance prohibits the acceptance of money by way of advance rent by the land lord. This contravenes the positive statutory mandate as provided in section 10(b) of the Ordinance and renders the agreement for lease void under section 23 of the Contract Act. In view of the unenforceability of such an agreement the position is that the appellants are monthly tenants who are liable to ejectment if they make default in payment of rent. Even if the tenants become defaulters during the continuance of the suit, then they should be treated as a defaulters and they will not entitled to the benefit under section 18 (5) of the Ordinance.</p><p><strong>Md.
