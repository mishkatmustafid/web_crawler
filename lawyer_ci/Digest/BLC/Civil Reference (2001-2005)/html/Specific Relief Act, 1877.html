Such a question is to be decided in a separate suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sushil Kumer Paik &amp; Anr. Vs.

Therefore it cannot be said that the contract was mutually cancelled and the suit for specific performance of contract was not maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Major (Retd) Md.

The section provides for a summary procedure in order to discourage people to take law in their own hands however good their title may be, Even Government under the rule of law as enshrined in our Constitution has no power to dispossess a citizen from immovable property without due process of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M/S Shan Hosiery Vs.

It is not disputed that under the monthly lease agreement any kind of sublease was prohibited. Possession of the plaintiff as a monthly tenant was the constructive possession of her landlord, defendant No.1 If such monthly tenant allows someone as subleassee to enter into possession of the leased shop by infracting the terms of the lease, and without the consent of the landlord, the possession of such sub lessee cannot of the tenant, to be the constructive possession of the tenant for purpose of a suit under section 9 of Specific Relief Act. Because, in case of dispute, such tenant is not entitled to maintain a suit for ejectment of such sub lessee under the laws of monthly tenancy</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Jabun Nessa Zaman &amp; Ors Vs Hosneara Lili 9 BLT (HCD)-251</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-9</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The High Court Division in our view rightly found that the suit is maintainable inasmuch as the suit premises does not belong to Government. It further appears that the High Court Division found that the defendant Nos. 1-2 along with the ‘Gondas’ entered into the suit premises, drove away the employees and staffs of the plaintiff by beating them up and thereby dispossessed the plaintiff-respondents from the suit premises and this aspect has not been considered by the learned Subordinate Judge and as such the learned Subordinate Judge wrongly took the view that the suit was not filed within 6 (six) months of his possession and rejected the plaint on some extraneous consideration.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bangladesh Jatiya Samabaya Shilpa Samity Ltd Vs.

He paid the entire consideration money but the Kabala deed was not executed and registered but he was handed over possession in the suit land. While he was in possession by running a furniture business, he was dispossessed —Held: From the evidences of both the parties it is crystal clear like sunshine of broad daylight that the plaintiff while was running his furniture business in the suit hut, was dispossessed by the defendant on 19.9.1997. The suit having been filed within 2(two) months of the date of dispossession, the same was maintainable under Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Akram alias Akram Goldar Vs.Chandi Charan Mondal &amp; Ors 14 BLT (HCD)525</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-12 read with Limitation Act, 1908, Section-19</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section 19 of the Limitation Act provides that before the expiration of the period prescribed for a suit or application in respect of any property or right, an acknowledgement of liability, in respect of such property or right has been made in writing signed by the party against whom such property or right is claimed, or by some person through whom he derives title or liability, a fresh period of limitation shall he computed from the time when the acknowledgement was signed.

On the back of the stamp, out of the balance on 28.11.1979 she received in writing Taka 8,000.00 and on 12.12.1979 Taka 15,000.00 from the plaintiff in presence of the witnesses. It also appears that on 16.02.1982 said Amir Hossain by an ‘Ekrarnama’ exhibit 13 demitted the case of the plaintiff that the earnest money of Taka 37,000 was paid out of the money kept in him by the plaintiff that his name wrongly crept in the agreement that the plaintiff actually obtained the agreement, the plaintiff then paid the balance of the agreement, the plaintiff got possession and that he had no interest in the land under the agreement. Amir Hossain died in 1989. This ‘Ekrarnama’ was proved by PW.-5 younger brother of the plaintiff . He also testified that the plaintiff purchased the land and paid the entire consideration. Besides the evidence of the plaintiff as PW-1, PW-2 the scribe of the agreement also testified that the agreement executed between the plaintiff and Sharijan Nessa was written by him. But the defendant No.11 did not cross-examine them on the question who purchased the land. Moreover the defendants no.1 and 2 sons of said Sharijan Nessa have not come forward to contest the claim of the plaintiff. The petitioner as DW- 1 testified that if the plaintiff got an agreement from Sharijan Nessa that would not be effective in respect of his share. In the circumstances and on the above evidence the intention of the parties did not leave any doubt to sell the land to the plaintiff and the trail Court rightly exercised in discretion in decreeing specific performance of the agreement exhibit No. 3. The Court of appeal below therefore did not commit any error in accepting the agreement and affirming the decree for specific performance.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

As to the respondent the appellant expressed full confidence in him there is no scope for any doubt that these two persons had by fraud or by taking undue advantage got the agreement executed at a grossly inadequate price. With reference to the state of things existing at the date of the agreement — the consideration was not grossly inadequate.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Quazi Din Mohammad Vs Alhaj Arzan Ali &amp; Anr. 2BLT(AD)-175</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-27 clause-(b)</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Specific performance of a contract may be enforced against “any other person claiming under him by a title arising subsequently to the contract, except a transferee for value who has paid his money in good faith and without notice of the original contract”. The expression “under him” is referable to clause (a) of Section 27 i.e. either party to the contract. In view of the aforesaid provision of law as the defendant No.2 had acquired title to the property as regard which defendant No.1 earlier entered into an agreement for sale with the plaintiffs and as we have already held that defendant No. 2 failed to establish that he has purchased the property in question in good faith without notice of the original contract the High Court Division was quite correct in decreeing the suit against the defendants and in making direction to the defendant No. 2 to execute and register the kabala in favour of the plaintiffs.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Hajee Lal Mia Vs.

Such suit will be governed by Section 39 not by Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act. When such person is not a party to such decree, he does need to get the decree set aside or cancelled.

But the plaintiff was all along in possession of the land in dispute excepting the said admitted .30 acres land—the relief should be prayed under section 31 of the Specific Relief Act by way of rectification of the documents since the execution and registration is accepted and since the plaintiff and the defendant are parties in the deed itself.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Zainal Abedin Vs.

So, plaintiff was fully aware that property was enemy property and as such he did not acquire any title on the basis of the sale deed dated25.3.1985. The courts below on the above ground found that the plaintiff acquired no title. The courts below also found that Title Suit No.123 of 1990 was barred by limitation held The High Court Division held that the plaintiff acquired title by adverse possession.

As per provision of law on the publication of the gazette notification the property acquired vests in the Government and consequent thereupon Government becomes the owner of the property. The person whose property is acquired under the Act and consequent thereupon vests in the Government, he is not entitled to claim any interest in the land so acquired. In that view of the matter there was no scope for the plaintiffs, who have no interest of any kind in the land in suit, to seek for a declaration that they are entitled to get the property released.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Director of Housing and Settlement, Dhaka Vs.

But that Bashirullah Bepari transferred the sute property to Ledu Miah before expiry of the Stipulated Period of 6 years and Ledu Miah sold the Suit land along with other land to the Plaintiffs Opposite Parties by 4 Kabalas —Defendant-Petitioners obtained an Order of redemption of the suit land dated 25.9.1984 in Miscellaneous Case. As against the said order Ledu Miah preferred an appeal which was dismissed on 24.6.1986 and that the defendant No.1 Additional Divisional Commissioner also had affirmed the order of redemption by his order passed on 24.11.1991 in Miscellaneous Appeal No.104 of 1988 —The Plaintiffs came to know about all the developments relating to the suit land on 23.12.1991 and hence the suit for declaration that the order of the defendant No.1 dated 24.11.1991 is illegal, void, without jurisdiction, in operative and not binding upon the plaintiffs-Held: Scanning the evidence on record, it appears that the plaintiffs opposite parties as penditlite transferees cannot challenge the impugned judgment dated 24.11.1991 of the Additional Divisional Commissioner when their vendor invoked the jurisdiction and obtained the order. In such case their vendor could prefer appeal before the Board of land Administration or could file case before the court only on grounds of fraud and collusion but their vendors did take neither of the above courses. Thus his successors, who have no title and possession in the suit land, cannot challenge the impugned order dated 24.11.1991. Their suit is also hit by section 42 of the Specific Relief Act. The suit of the plaintiffs is also hit by section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act as they purchased the alleged suit land during the pendency of the proceedings and the decisions upon the predecessors of the plaintiffs are binding upon the plaintiff.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Abdul Aziz &amp; Ors Vs.

The trial court further discarded the evidence of the defendants with proper reasonings. Accordingly he decreed the suit—Lower appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Held : The High Court Division noticed that the lower appellate court while reversing the decision of the trial court did not apply its judicial mind to a consideration of the whole of the evidence in the case. The lower appellate court did neither consider all the material evidence taken into consideration by the trial court in their true perspective nor did it advert to all its reasoning. In the circumstances the High Court Division set aside the judgment of the lower appellate court and restored that of the trial court.

The suit being a suit for permanent injunction in which the question of title may be gone into incidentally but decision of title in a suit for permanent injunction ought not to have been the guiding principle. The Court cannot disentitle the plaintiff of a decree for permanent injunction if he can prove possession and in that view the plaintiff could not be evicted with force if continues to be in possession unless in due process of law and could exercise his right of possession restraining everybody including the real owners. In a suit for permanent injunction the Court need not enter into disputed title except to the extent that it would help the Court in finding which of the parties have prima facie title and exclusive possession.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Jobayer Hossain &amp; anr.

An order of mandatory injunction or mandatory ad interim injunction is an extreme harsh and highly discretionary order passed at the discretion of the Court to restore a situation existing on the date of filing of the suit or occurred after filing of the suit and in breach of any order of the Court.

It has earlier stated that possession by way of construction of shops and kutcha houses, three and six, in number respectively, no matter whether possession of Defendants were lawful or not but it became evident that Plaintiff got no possession in some portion of suit property. It is nowhere in plaint that Plaintiff had been threatened with dispossession on a particular portion of suit property and no evidence, as, came forth from the mouth of PW 1 and PW2 on which portion of suit property Plaintiff was threatened with dispossession.

The lower appellate after due, discussion, dismissed the appeal affirming the above findings. The High Court Division considering the above position and also on relying on the case of Rafizuddin vs. Molla Barman, reported in 43 BLD(AD) 215 where it has been held that, “In a simple suit for permanent injunction with regard to disputed land the relief is available to a person who is in possession. The court may require incidentally into the respective claims of the parties for determining whether the plaintiffs is in possession of a dispute property and entitled to specific relief of permanent injunction” and also relying on the case of Pasharuddin Mir vs. Ismail Mir and others (Supra) where it was held that “in a suit for permanent injunction there is no question of defect of parties.

Thus courts ordering the employer to retain the employee in his service do not restrain breaches of contract for personal service.
