The Societies Registration Act contains no limitation on investment to be made by a society. A society cannot be construed as a trust, and the provisions of the Trust Act have no manner of application in the functioning of a society. Therefore, the embargo in the Trust Act has no manner of application in the case of any society registered under the Societies Registration Act.

In the instant case, the creation, existence, validity and executability of the trust itself is being disputed, the trial court was correct in holding that if the Miscellaneous Case under section 74 of the Trusts Act is proceeded with, conflicting decisions may arise leading to serious complications. The Miscellaneous case was rightly stayed till the disposal of the Partition Suit.</p><p><strong>Khalid Hamidul Huq Vs.
