But there may be a rare case where the High Court Division may be justified in interfering even at the initial stage where the continuation of the proceeding is barred under any law or the F.I.R. or the petition of complaint does not disclose any offence—Cr.P.C.

In the instant case, no date or dates of the commission of the alleged offence having been mentioned in the charge, it is to be held that the provision of section 222 Cr.P.C. has not been complied with.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Nizamuddin Dhali Vs The State, 16BLD (HCD)580</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"> </p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Framing of charge</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">While taking cognizance of an offence under this Act the Bishesh Adalat will consider whether a prima facie case has been disclosed against the accused on perusal of the FIR, the charge-sheet and other materials on record. After hearing the prosecution and the accused the Bishesh Adalat will decide whether to frame charges or to discharge the accused—Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Special Provisions) Act, 1995(XVIII of 1995) Section—17</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Md.

In the present case the charge of misappropriation of money extended over a period of 2 years which vitiated the trial. The case was sent back on remand to the trial Court for holding trial according to law—Cr.P.C., Section.222(2), Proviso.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Ban Molla Vs.

The institution of a money suit for realisation of money in question from the petitioner does not also stand as a bar against the prosecution from proceeding with the trial of the case under section 420 of the Penal Code.

Normally such beating is to chastise the wife for unbecoming behavior. Such beating becomes excessive—when the wife provocates the husband.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;">It is true, mere absconsion of the accused after the occurrence is not sufficient to hold him guilty of the offence.

The chain of circumstances coupled with the medical evidence on record having been considered by the learned Judges of the High Court Division, we find that the circumstantial evidences admit of no other hypothesis than the guilt of the petitioner.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Gourango Kumar Shaha Vs The State, 17BLD(AD)120</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"> </p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Alibi—wife killing case</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Absence of plea of alibi</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the absence of any plea of alibi the evidence on record is found to be sufficient to hold that the appellant was at home in the fateful night with his deceased wife. Since the defence has failed to succeed in creating a reasonable belief by proving any circumstances that she could take her life by committing suicide the husband cannot absolve himself of the criminal liability for causing death to his deceased wife. The prosecution has been able to prove by evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the husband was with his deceased wife in the night of occurrence and the appellant caused the death of his wife by strangulation and as such the trial Court rightly convicted the appellant.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Abdus Salam Vs The State, 19BLD (HCD)98</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"> </p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Alibi</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Plea of alibi in a wife killing case</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a wife killing case it is very difficult to bring witnesses against the accused person.

The evidence of PW4 that appellant Shiplu was in the field has been contradicted by the evidence of PW 5, another hostile witness, who saw appellant Shiplu and appellant Khaleda coming out of the house soon after the occurrence.

The reason is that in such cases the accused persons have already satisfied the competent Court that there are no reasonable grounds for believing that they have committed the alleged offence.

It is also in the evidence of P.W.5 that the dying declaration through alleged to have been made by the deceased on query to her wife, Mobessera did not say that she reported the matter to P.W. 1 before going to Thana for lodging the F.LR. Moreover the daroga deposed that she did not state to him that her husband the victim told her the names of the accused persons or she saw them running away. These statements are also absent in the first information report.

In view of the provisions of section 404 of the Code no appeal shall lie from any judgment or order of a criminal Court except as provided by the Code.

The comment of the High Court Division that the petitioner rejected the petition of the Public Prosecutor for examining the recording Magistrate and the Police Officer who recorded the F.I.R. of the case “rather hastily”, was rather harsh and this could have been couched in a softer manner but nevertheless the expression of disappointment of the High Court Division on this score is natural in the circumstances of the case and the comments made in the impugned judgment, except being harsh, cannot for that matter attract the extreme measure of expungement.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Mr. Munshi Mohammad All Vs.

Therefore the power of the Government is pervasive over: (1) the establishment of a Court of Sessions, (2) appointment of a Judge of a Court of Sessions and (3) determination of the place or places where the Court of Sessions shall hold its sitting.

But no order by a criminal Court for attachment of the property under section 145 Cr.P.C. can validly be made.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(iii) Criminal prosecutions for breach of statutory rules of corporate bodies and preventive measures taken to maintain peace, where disputes as to immovable property are involved, do not stand on the same footing.

Once an information is brought to the notice of the Magistrate, he has to be satisfied that a dispute as to immovable property is likely to cause a breach of peace. Further proceedings which he starts are not proceedings in the interest of any private party but in the interest of public peace. It is highly doubtful if a proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. can properly be termed as a “criminal matter” within the meaning of section 56(e) of the Specific Relief Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Jobeda Khatun Vs.

The Investigation Officer lied in saying that the confessional statements of the accused were recorded on 6.2.1987 although the record shows that the confessions were recorded on 7.2.1987.

If on perusal of a “naraji petition” or a fresh complaint the Magistrate finds that the facts disclosed in the case constitute any offence under the law, it would be incumbent upon him to take cognizance and issue process.

Noncompliance with this requirement of law causes prejudice to the defence. The prosecution must not play hide and seek.

Each of the words has separate meanings and each word is attended with different consequences. When a proceeding is stopped either under section 249 or 339C of the Code, without pronouncing any judgment either of acquittal or of conviction and the accused is released, it does not operate either as a discharge or as acquittal of the accused, so as to attract in the latter case the protection of section 403 of the Code barring trial for the same offence once conviced or acquitted. Stoppage of a proceeding and release of the accused stand short of a discharge. It is half-way to discharge, but not discharge proper. It is certainly not an acquittal. The proceeding is not brought to a close. It does not fade into a past and closed transaction. The use of the words “further proceedings in respect of the trial shall stand stopped and the accused person released” in fact mean that the proceeding in question has come to a stop and the same proceeding can only be revived if the legislature gives sanction to it, but the words quoted do not mean that fresh proceeding cannot be started on the same allegations. A ‘fresh proceeding’ and ‘further proceedings in respect of the trial’ do not mean the same thing. The legal effect of the above quoted words in section 339C and the provisions of section 249 remain and the same proceeding can be revived by a legislative mandate or in the alternative a fresh proceeding can be instituted on the same allegations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is no legal bar for instituting a fresh prosecution on the self-same facts after a proceeding is stopped and accused released under Section 339C(4)</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Niamat Ali Sheikh and ors Vs Begum Enayetur Noor &amp; others 13BLD(AD)11</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ref:</strong> (1981) 33DLR (HCD)205 distingushed—Cited.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—265A</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A public prosecutor has the right to conduct every trial before a Court of Sessions.

These two sections indicate that when an accused is brought for trial before a Court of law the Court upon hearing the parties and on consideration of the record of the case and the documents may discharge the accused.

The notification regarding the attendance of the accused though once published in the newspapers by the Magistrate while the case was before him, cannot be held to be a sufficient compliance with the requirement of law as envisaged by section 27 (6) of the Special Powers Act.

It is, therefore, clear that the trial of the case on the expiry of 270 working days is without jurisdiction as the proceedings of the case stood stopped and a right of release accrued to the accused persons on the expiry of the specified and extended time as mentioned in sub-section (4) of section 339C of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Dr. Md.

By deleting subsection (3) of section 339C the grace period of thirty days was done away with and by substituting sub-section (4) of section 339C with a new sub-section (4), the proceedings can not be stopped now and the accused can now only obtain bail to the satisfaction of the Court concerned with the expiry of 360 days.

In the instant case, notification was issued but there was no compliance of paper notification as required under section 339B of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

It is also apparent that notification in the official gazette as required by the existing provision of section 339B(l) was published but there was no notification in any newspaper which was required under the law at the relevant time and inspite of that the Special Judge proceeded with the trial. This is a violation of the express provision of law as was existing at the relevant time and therefore the trial is vitiated for non-compliance of the requirement of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

The legislature created no such bar and that is the yard-sick with which the intention of the legislature is to be read (See S 339C, 403 Cr.P.C.)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Niamat Ali Sheikh and ors Vs Begum Enayetur Noor &amp; others 13BLD(AD)11</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ref:</strong> (1981) 33DLR (HCD)205 distingushed—Cited</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Repeal of section 339D Cr.P.C.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Act 42 of 1992 although was not given any retrospective effect, but inspite of repeal of section 339D (provision of revival of a stopped proceeding), provision was made in section 6 of the new Act for application of section 339D, as if it was not repealed, when, before the coming into force of the new Act on 1st of November, 1992, a proceeding was already stopped under the unamended provision of sub-section (4) of section 339C. If a proceeding is now stopped after the coming into force of the new Act either by the High Court Division or by the Appellate Division, the prosecution will now have only corresponding right of revival of the proceeding under the repealed provision of section 339D Cr.P.C. In such a case, the accused will be scot free and no proceeding can be continued against him without a fresh complaint or FLR. Under unamended provision of subsection (4) of section 339C, the accused did not enjoy an unqualified right or privilege of stoppage of proceeding and release if the trial could not be completed within 270 days. The new Act has effected a change in the procedural law but it has not affected any vested right of the accused and the prosecution. The right of the accused for stoppage and release was fettered and chained with the prosecution’s right to revive the case. By necessary intendment the new Act will be retrospective in operation in so far as sub-section (4) of Section 339C of the new Act is concerned.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In view of repeal of sub-section (4) of section 339C Cr.P.C. followed by reenactment of the said sub-section, the new procedural law will be applicable in all pending cases although instituted when the old pro-vision was in force.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Wadud Vs.

Since than she has been staying in a prison house except for a few days when she came out therefrom on getting ad-interim bail from the High Court Division. It is entirely unacceptable that a young girl who is an innocent victim of the alleged offence should remain in an wholesome atmosphere of a Jail for an indefinite period. The young girl cannot be allowed to walk away from the prison house of her own, because she had no independent place to stay. The welfare of the girl, should be deciding factor in such a situation.

There is no inherent power of the High Court Division or the court of Sessions to grant bail at any stage.

Therefore, if he is allowed anticipatory bail then upon furnishing bond he will subject himself really to one form of custody. If the prayer is rejected or adinterim bail is allowed, but is subsequently cancelled, then the matter ends there and does not entail the consequence that he has to given into the police or jail custody.

Section 497 of the Code is a procedural law and the accused having alleged to have committed a substantive offence of murder his liberty is curtailed and as such the argument with regard to violation of fundamental right cannot be accepted in the facts of the instant case as law permits of such arrest and detention in custody.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs Faisal Alam Ansari, 20BLD(AD)289</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—497(1)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under sub-section (1) of section 497 of the Code an accused may not be released on bail if there appears reasonable grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life.

It is well-settled that the basic conception of the word ‘bail’ is release of a person from the custody of police and delivery into the hands of sureties, who undertake to produce him in Court whenever required to do so. An accused person is said, at common law, to be admitted to bail, when he is released from the custody of the officers of the Court and is entrusted to the custody of persons known as his sureties who are bound to produce him to answer, at a specified time and place, the charge against him and who in default of so doing are liable to forfeit such sum as is specified when bail is granted. <strong><em>[Per A.T.M.

The ordinary law is that a person accused of a non-bailable offence must appear before the Court taking cognizance for making a prayer for bail.

Section 110 of Bank Companies Act, 1991 also provides that a Manager, Officer and other functionaries of the banking company are deemed to be public servants under Section 21 of the Penal Code.

Hazi Md Mohsin vs State 40 DLR 431.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2(b)—</strong>Corporations other than the statutory Corporations are those associations or bodies constituted of private individuals incorporated or registered under provisions of the Companies Act or any other law.<br/>Body corporate includes both statutory Corporation and other corporation or company private or public. But in the above provision of section 2(b) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act “Body Corporate” has been used to mean corporation other than “Statutory Corporation”. So Master Industries Limited is a body corporate as mentioned in the aforesaid provision of section 2(b) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1958. Therefore, we are of the view that the petitioner as Managing Director of Master Industries Limited is a “public servant”. Khorshed Alam vs Azizur Rahman 48 DLR 36.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Power of Special Judge— Creation of new Districts or Sessions Divisions does not require fresh Notifications as to Senior Special Judges. When a public functionary is found to have been acting in a particular capacity in normal course the Court may presume that he has been duly empowered to act in that capacity. Mozahar Ali Howlader vs Lal Miah Talukder 44 DLR (AD) 250.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 4</strong>—The Special Judge has power to take cognizance of an offence even when the police submits final report. No direction for filing supplementary charge-sheet was necessary in the present case. Mahbubur Rahman vs State 44 DLR 342.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 4—</strong>There is no denial as to the issuance of the letter for sanction of trial. There is also no denial that the required sanction has neither been received nor refused within sixty days. In such view the sanction be deemed to have been accorded. Atiquzzaman Khan vs State 57 DLR (AD) 100.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 4</strong>—Court is to record the reasons for discharging the accused under section 241 A of the Code, but no such reasons are required to be recorded in farming charge against the accused as per provisions of section 242 of the Code. The Special Judge framed charge against the accused- petitioner after hearing both the parties and being satisfied that there was ground for framing of charge. No illegality in framing of charge against the accused-petitioner and there is no ground of setting aside the impugned order. Amanullah vs State 62 DLR 382</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sections 4-6</strong>—Under provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act a Special Judge can initiate a proceeding under two conditions namely, on a complaint or on a police report. Matiur Rahman vs State 40 DLR 385.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 4(1)—</strong>There are authorities which have found it improper for an enquiry to be held against a person by a person belonging to the same department. In the present case it cannot be said that the Special Judge has acted with sound discretion in asking the ASP to hold an enquiry when admittedly officers much above him have been made accused in the case. The Additional Attorney- General submitted that since the Deputy Commissioner and Superintendent of Police were already transferred there was no reason to apprehend that the ASP would not be able to hold an influence free enquiry. It is difficult to accept the submission of the learned Additional Attorney-General, for, it is not necessary to be personally present to influence an enquiry. Abdur Rahim vs State 49 DLR (AD) 51.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 4(1) and 6(5)—</strong>Clear intention of the law is that sanction will be required not for taking cognizance but for starting prosecution of the accused. Abdur Gafur vs State 48 DLR 90.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 4(3)—</strong>The wider territorial jurisdiction of the Divisional Special Judge has not conferred upon him any higher authority than that of the Senior Special Judge. In relation to the Senior Special Judge, the Divisional Special Judge is like any other Special Judge—power of taking cognizance of offence has not been given to him. State vs Divisional Special Judge Khulna Division 44 DLR (AD) 215.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 4(3) &amp; 10(3)</strong><strong>―</strong>High Court Division may transfer a case pending in the court of any Special Judge to the court of another Special Judge irrespective of the territorial limits of either of the two Special Judges. But the jurisdiction of transfer of a case by the Senior Special Judge is limited within his district. The two sections have therefore no conflict. State vs Divisional Special Judge, Khulna Division 44 DLR (AD) 215.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 5(1) and 6(5)—</strong>The case being exclusively triable by the Special Judge, any evidence taken by the Metropolitan Magistrate has no value in the eye of law. Such evidence should, therefore, be disregarded. Mohor Ranjan Pal vs State 50 DLR 163.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5(6)—</strong>The CID committed no error of law in holding further investigation as per provision of section 173 (3B) of the CrPC. Had further investigation been done after the case record was transmitted to the Senior Special Judge after taking cognizance of the offence or passing any order whatsoever then permission of the Special Judge would have been necessary. The police had the power to hold further investigation as per provision of section 173 (3B) of the Code as the provision of this section is in no way derogatory to the provision of sub-section 5(6) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958. Abdus Samad Khan vs State 50 DLR 143.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6</strong>—Withdrawal from the prosecution is subject to consent by the trial Judge and when the accused persons are still absconding the discretion ought not to have been exercised. Sreemati Prativa Rani Dey (Tirtha) vs Dr Mohammad Yousuf Chittagong Medical College 52 DLR (AD) 8.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>Section 6</strong>—Reference to High Court Division—Provi ns of the Criminal Procedure Code will apply to the occedings of the Court of Special Judge only f&amp; the purpose of hearing and disposal of a special case. Transfer of a case from one Special Judge to another Special Judge does not appear to MI within the ovision for hearing and disposal of a case. State vs Divisional Special Judge, Khulna Division 44 DLR (AD) 215.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6-—</strong>Provisious of section 339C and D shall apply to the roceeding before the Court of Special Judge. This legal position has also been accepted by the legislauwe by alacting Act No. XIII of 1987. AHM Kamaluddin vs State 43 DLR 294.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6</strong>—Accused is a public servant— Order of sanction to prosecute him submitted in court along with charge-sheet—Court of trial perused the sanction order and noted “seen” thereon, but omitted to mention it either in Order- sheet or in the Judgment—Witnesses including the Investigation Officer remained silent about it while deposing. The trial is not vitiated by illegality in spite of the omission on he part of the prosecution to refer to the evidence as to the order of sanction since the trial is found to have been held by the Court on perusal of the order of sanction. Liakat Ali vs State 42 DLR (AD) 30.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6</strong>—Section 339C and 339D(b) of the Code are inconsistent with the provision of section 8 of the Ordinance and due to this inconsistency these two provisions 339C and 339D(b) are not applicable in the cases revived under the Ordinance. “Working days” of the Court as provided in section 339D(b) cannot be brought into the ambit of section 8 of the Ordinance. The provisions of section 8 provided that trial of such cases must be concluded within two years from the date of commencement of the Ordinance. In the present case it appears that the case was revived on 17-2- 87 and in view of the provision of section 8 the trial ought to have been concluded within 20-1- 87. But the trial Court failed to conclude the trial within that period and when the petitioner approached the Court for stopping the proceeding his prayer was rejected applying the section 339D(b). But in view of the above the provision of section 339D(b) has no manner of application. Abdul Nur Mehedi vs State 46 DLR 303.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(1B)—</strong>The period of one year is available in section 234 of the Code of Criminal Procedure but it is absent in section 6(IB) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act and thereby in view of the provision laid down in section 6(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 section 6(1 B) excludes the application of section 234 which relates to the period of the commission of the alleged offence. Habibur Rahman Molla vs State 61 DLR 1.<br/><br/><strong>Section 6(5</strong>)—The imperative language of the provision, “the Special Judge shall, immediately on receipt of the complaint”, leaves no manner of doubt that before any step is taken the Special Judge has to address the Government in case of sanction not being accompanied with a petition of complaint.<br/>It is true that in a case under the Act a Special Judge may, where he deems if necessary, order an investigation by any officer in whose jurisdiction, the offence was wholly or partly committed. This step also, however, cannot be taken without complying being that the Government may not give any sanction to prosecute at all. Abdur Rahim vs State 49 DLR (AD) 51.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>Special Judge is required to solicit required Government sanction on the basis of the complaint petition before passing any order on the complaint petition.<br/>Order dated 17-2-92 and all the subsequent orders passed by the learned Senior Special Judge and Sessions Judge Cox’s Bazar, in Special Case No.1 of 1992 are quashed. Learned Special Judge may solicit Government sanction as required under sub-section 5 of section 6 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, if he is satisfied with the allegations made in the complaint petition. Tarani Mohan Gosh vs State 50 DLR 575.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>Public Servant—Sanction for Prosecution—Every public servant who committed an offence under the Criminal Law Amendment Act enjoys a protection by way of sanction for prosecution. Since the Government in this case withheld sanction the Senior Special Judge rightly passed order refusing to take cognizance against the accused. Fakir Tariqul Islam vs State 49 DLR 419.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)</strong>―No sanction for prosecution would be necessary when the accused ceased to be a public servants Saheb All Miah vs State 46 DLR 238.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)</strong><strong>―</strong>If sanction as required under section 6(5) Criminal Law Amendment Act 1958 is not accorded by the government or is deemed not to have been so accorded as per proviso to sub-section 5 of section 6 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1958, the Court shall have no jurisdiction to hold a trial against a public servant. Niranjan Deb vs State 47 DLR 458.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)</strong><strong>―</strong>In the present case petitioner No.1 has not been accused of any offence committed in course of discharge of his duties as Government pleader but in respect of an offence in a different capacity as managing trustee of a public trust. So there is no question of obtaining sanction in respect of such an offence. Santosh Bhusan Das vs State 47 DLR 519.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)</strong><strong>―</strong>The question whether the public servant concerned should be prosecuted or not is entirely within the jurisdiction of the appropriate Government. The Special Judge has no say in the matter. It is not for him to decide whether a prima facie case has been made out against the public servant or not. For the present we find no contrary opinion to the requirement of complying with the proviso to section 6(5) if any petition of complaint is not accompanied by sanction as required. The imperative language of the proviso, “the Special Judge shall, immediately on receipt of the complaint” leaves no manner of doubt that before any step is taken the Special Judge has to address the Government in case of sanction not being accompanied with a petition of complaint. Abdur Rahim vs State 48 DLR (AD) 167.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>It is not necessary to personally represent to influence an enquiry by a subordinate Junior Officer. There are authorities which have found it improper to hold an enquiry against a person by a person belonging to the same department (29 CrLJ 1928, 1958). Abdur Rahim vs State 48 DLR (AD) 167.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)-</strong>The Special Judge has no power to try the accused under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 without obtaining proper sanction for prosecution of the accused persons from the appropriate authority. Eman Ali Mallik vs State 52 DLR 335.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>The sanction order seems to be too mechanical and is no sanction in the eye of law. Absence of sanction cuts at the very root of the prosecution affecting jurisdiction of the court and this defect is not curable. Syed Mustafizur Rahman vs State 53 DLR 125.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(IA)—</strong>ln view of this amended section there was no necessity of further publication of the notification in any daily. Atiquzzaman Khan vs State 57 DLR (AL)) 100.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>The minimum requirement of this section appears to be that the authority while according sanction must have the facts of the case in order to take a decision as to whether it should accord any sanction for the prosecution. M Mojibul Haque vs DG. Bangladesh Bureau of Anti-Corruption 55 DLR 24<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>4f the accused has ceased to be a public servant at the time when the court took cognisance, no sanction of the Government is necessary to proceed against him. Fokrul Alam Chowdhury vs State 57 DLR 727.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>Respondent Nos. 5 and 6 committed the offence under section 409 of the Penal Code in their personal capacity and not in their official capacity as a police officer and, as such, the sanction in the present case was not at all necessary under section 6(5) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act. Salauddin Ahmed vs Principal Secretary, Office of the Hon’ble Prime Minister 57 DLR 730.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)</strong><strong>―</strong>Taking of cognizance by the Special Judge against the accused amounted to prosecuting him and this prosecution of a public servant cannot be done without the previous sanction of the Government. The Special Judge was directed to comply with the provision for sanction and then pass appropriate order in respect of prosecuting the petitioner. Md Arab Ali vs State 42 DLR 524.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)</strong><strong>―</strong>Meaning of taking cognizance of offence—Stage of determination of guilt when reaches under section 176 CrPC—difference between “prosecuted” without prior sanction under section 6(5) and “taking cognizance” without prior approval. Matiur Rahman vs State 40 DLR 385.<br/><br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>Where facts are not referred to on the face of the sanction nor is it proved by extraneous evidence that they were placed before the sanctioning authority, the sanction is invalid and the trial Court would not be a court of competent jurisdiction. Abdul Hakim vs State 45 DLR 352.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)-</strong>It is not necessary in the case as the accused ceased to be a public servant when the Court took cognizance of his offence and framed charge. HM Ershad vs State 45 DLR 533.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8—</strong>The High Court Division rightly acquitted the accused in view of the provision of section 8 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act as the trial having not been concluded within the period of 2 years it was without jurisdiction. State vs Md Minhazuddin Khan 51 DLR (AD) 142.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8(a)</strong><strong>―</strong>The proceeding before the Divisional Special Judge having not been concluded within the statutory period of 2 years from the date of commencement of the Act (20187) further proceeding of the case be stopped and the petitioner released. Sardar Abdul Haque vs State 46 DLR 515.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 8(a)—</strong>When trial of the case did not commence as no charge was framed against the accused persons. There was no question of concluding the trial within 270 working days by the Special Judge.<br/>Proceedings of a Special case cannot be stopped under the provisions of section 8(a) of the Criminal Law Amendment (Amendment) Act 1987 after the expiry of two years from the date of coming into force of that Act on 20-1-87 in a case in which trial did not commence by framing charge against the accused or 270 working days did not expire after framing of the charge and before coming into force of the said Act. Mozibul Haque vs State 48 DLR 146.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8(a)</strong><strong>―</strong>As the language of he section speaks, not about conclusion of trial but about conclusion of the proceeding, the Special Judge had no option but to conclude the proceedings within 2 years. Yunus Molla vs State 48 DLR 273.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8(a)—</strong>Where the charge has been framed under section 409 of the Penal Code and section 5(2) of Act II of 1947, and in the absence of any provision for revival of the case on the expiry of the period of 2 years provided in section 8(a) of the Criminal Law Amendment (Amendment) Act there was no legal authority to revive the case under the provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Nur Israil Talukder vs State 52 DLR (AD) 51.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 9—</strong>In imposing fine of Taka 300 the Trying Court violated the mandatory provision of section 9 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 by imposing a token fine which is much less than the amount misappropriated. Nizamuddin Dhali vs State 48 DLR 507.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 9—</strong>In case of criminal breach of trust by public servant the sentence of fine is not only compulsory but it should not be less than the amount misappropriated. AMA Wajedul Islam vs State 45 DLR 243.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 10—</strong>The accused-petitioner who remained absent due to non-service of processes upon him cannot be legally treated as an absconder. Eklimur Reza Khan vs State 59 DLR 7.<br/><br/><strong>Section 10—</strong>The expression ‘এই বিধিমালার অধীন’refers to the Emergency Powers Rules as a whole. It cannot mean and refer to Rule 10 only; otherwise the expression would have been ‘উক্ত বিধির অধীন’i.e. under the aforesaid Rule. Anti-Corruption Commission vs Barrister Nazmul Huda 60 DLR (AD) 57.<br/> <br/><strong>Secton 10</strong>―The language of Rule 11(3) admits of no ambiguity and therefore, there is hardly any scope for interpretation. The intention of the law makers is manifested in the express words used in sub-rule 3 leaving no scope to doubt that such power of granting bail by the appellate Court has been taken away by express provisions.

In that view of the matter we find that the conviction and sentence imposed upon the appellant under section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1980 do not suffer from any illegality. We sustain the conviction and sentence not on the reasoning given by the learned Judges of the High Court Division in 40 DLR 360 but on the ground that the word “dowry” in section 4 is not to be read in terms of the definition of the word “dowry” in section 2 but in its ordinary sense.

The correct principle in respect of the evidence of persons falling in the category of interested, interrelated and partisan witnesses is that it must be closely and critically scrutinized. It should not be accepted on its face value. Since interested witnesses may have a motive of falsely implicating the accused persons, their evidence has to cross the hurdle of critical appreciation. As their evidence cannot be thrown out mechanically because of their interestedness, so their evidence cannot be accepted mechanically without a critical examination.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The rule that the evidence of interested witnesses requires corroboration is not an inflexible one. It is a rule of caution rather than a rule of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The High Court was obviously wrong in holding that no corroboration was necessary in this case and failed to scrutinise the evidence of interested eye-witnesses with infirmities in their evidence. It is unsafe to rely on such evidence for sustaining a conviction on a capital charge without corroboration, either circumstantial or ocular. <strong>(Per. Mustafa Kamal, J delivering the majority judgment)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is no rule of law that if independent witnesses are not available in a case, a conviction cannot be sustained on the evidence of eye witnesses who are relations and partisan witnesses. If found to be trustworthy, conviction can be based on the evidence of such interested witnesses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When both the parties are equally powerful and divided in two hostile groups, at the present day no body likes to involve himself in a group rivalry between two strong factions of people. In such a case, it is indeed difficult for the prosecution to examine independent witnesses as the villagers would be reluctant to side with any of the parties who had longstanding enmity and rivalry between them. Furthermore, the witnesses as well as the accused being interrelated amongst themselves and enemically disposed of towards one another, it was difficult for the prosecution to examine independent witnesses. Moreover, it does not appear from the record that any independent witness who had seen the occurrence &amp; was withheld by the prosecution to find fault with it. <strong>(Per Latifur Rahman,.J-delivering dissenting judgment)</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Nowabul Alam and others Vs The State, 15BLD(AD)54</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Section—8</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abscondence of the accused</strong>—Abscondence of the accused during the trial may be a circumstance for giving rise to an adverse presumption against him and but it can never be the sole basis of conviction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The court acted illegally in putting the burden of disproving the charge upon the accused person.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Abdus Salam Vs.

Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of a victim of sex crime is not a requirement of law but merely a guidance of prudence under given circumstances. The rule is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a conviction. The testimony of the victim of sexual assault is vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessite looking for corroboration of her statement, the Court should find no difficulty in acting on the testimony of a victim of sex crime alone to convict an accused where her testimony inspires confidence and is found to be reliable.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Al Amin Vs.

If the evidence of the victim of a sexual offence does not suffer from any basic infirmity and “probabilities factor” does not render it unworthy of credence there is no reason to insist on corroboration to the evidence of the prosecutrix. Law does not require that the evidence of the prosecutrix requires corroboration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a sex offence case there is no legal bar in believing the sole testimony of the prosecutrix, nay, she must prima facie be believed, except in a rarest of rare cases where she is found unreliable.

Law in every country is very stringent in dealing with a narcotic drug because of its disastrous potential on social, national and international life. In these contexts the Appellate Division took the view that if a substance which is commercially accepted as ‘hereoin’ contains what is chemically called ‘diacetylmorphine’ the whole substance is to be treated as ‘heroin’ for the purpose of the Act. The law intends to punish dealer of the narcotic irrespective of whether it is in the purest form or not.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case, since it has been proved that the seized packets contained ‘heroin’, the whole of the contents must be treated heroin for the purpose of punishment. It is necessary for the prosecution to prove the “actual and real heroin content” for the purpose of a conviction under 1(b) of the Table of section 19. The High Court Division was wrong to ignore the real perspectives of the act and took an erroneous view that the purpose of the law is only to punish the preparation, carrying and dealing etc. of ‘laboratory heroin’ and not the stuff which was being clandestinely carried by the accused taking great personal risk under a remote control system managed by the captains of the crime sitting across the seas.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the circumstances of the case there was no scope for altering the conviction from one under Clause 1(b) to Clause 1(a) of the Table and consequently there could not be any question of reduction of sentence on compassionate grounds as was done by the High Court Division.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

Without taking further steps in the matter the Court resorted to the provision of section 20(5)(Kha) by publishing a notification in the daily It, directing the accused to appear before the Court within 30 days of such publication. Since there was no material before the Court to be satisfied that the accused was avoiding arrest and he was concealing himself from appearing in the Court and his attendance or arrest could not be secured at an early date, the impugned notification in the newspaper was in clear violation of section 20(5)(Kha) of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The intention of the legislature in making the provision for publishing the notification in question in at least one daily news paper under section 20(5) (Kha) is obviously to indicate a widely circulated national daily and not a district based daily newspaper with a very limited circulation.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Belayet Howlader Vs.

On receipt of the said notice the appellant in order to avoid payment fraudulently informed the complainant through a lawyer on 4.1.1996 that he had lost the cheque written in the complainants name and made a GD Entry in that behalf. The cause of action for prosecution will arise under clause (c) of the proviso to section 138 on the failure of the appellant to pay the amount within 15 days of the receipt of the notice of the complainant. Relying on the complainant’s own case it is contended on behalf of the appellant the accused-appellant must be fixed with notice for payment at least from 4.1.1996 and after the expiry of 15 days from that date i.e; from 19.1.1996 the cause of action should be taken to have arisen due to non-payment within the said period and complaint was required to be filed within one month from 19.1.1996 in compliance with clause (b) of section 141 of the Act. Admittedly the petition of complaint was filed long after that date i.e., on 18.4.1996 and thus cognizance could not be taken upon such complaint. The subsequent allegations will not save the limitation because the requirement under the law is that the complaint has to be filed within one month of the date on which the cause of action arises under clause (c) of the proviso to section 138 of the Act and hence the impugned proceeding is quashed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>S.M.

Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act is for dishonour of a cheque simpliciter for insufficiency of fund whereas an offence under section 420 of the Penal Code is for cheating a person. The two offences are two distinct offences under two different laws.

It means that if two or more persons intentionally do a thing jointly, it is just the same as if each of them had done it individually ‘Common intention’ within the meaning of this section pre-supposes a prior concert. There must be a prior meeting of the minds leading to a pre-arranged plan to commit an offence. The common intention to commit the offence invites the application of section 34 of the Penal Code. In offences involving physical violence, the presence of the accused at the scene of the occurrence renders him liable on the principle of joint liability but where the offence consists of diverse acts and it may be committed at different times, the presence of the accused at the scene of the occurrence is not necessary.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

Neither in sub-section (2) nor in sub-section (3), there is any provision of passing the order with a condition that the order will come in to force on the date of service of the order upon the detenu. Rather, it has been clearly stated that “no such order shall remain in force for more than thirty days after making thereof.” An order is made on the date it is signed. In the instant case, the order was signed on 24.6.99. There is no scope of passing any order under sub-section (2) or (3) of section 3 of the Act with a qualification that it will come in the force on the date of service of the order upon the detenu.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Md Mosharaf Hossain@ Mash Vs Govt. of Bangladesh and ors, 20BLD (HCD)412</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Section—3(3)</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Extension of detention</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The liberty of the citizens being a precious possession, it should not be denied, curtailed or otherwise circumscribed by any authority without any legal and reasonable basis.

There must be a nexus between the grounds mentioned in the order of detention and the grounds of detention supplied to the detenu.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case, in the ground of detention the purpose of detention was to prevent the detenu from committing an act prejudicial to law and order whereas in the order of detention there was an added purpose of preventing the detenu from committing acts prejudicial to economic and financial interest of the State. From this it follows that the detaining authority itself was not certain as to what prejudicial act or acts the detenu was likely to commit. This in turn suggests lack of proper application of mind of the detaining authority in arriving at the necessary “satisfaction” within the meaning of section 3 (1) of the Special Powers Act, which is an indispensable prerequisite for curtailing the liberty of a citizen guaranteed by the Constitution. It is the constitutional duty of the High Court Division to satisfy itself that the essential prerequisite regarding “satisfaction” for passing the order of detention has been meticulously and carefully fulfilled and in case of any omission to fulfil the above requirement the order of detention must be held to be without lawful authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mere availability of materials for coming to a reasonable satisfaction by the detaining authority that the activities of the detenu were “pre-judicial acts” as defined in section 2(t) of the Special Powers Act does not make the order of detention ipso facto lawful if the detaining authority fails to pass the order of detention and prepare and furnish the grounds of detention after strictly complying with the requirements of the various provisions of the Act.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Dr. Dhiman Chowdhury Vs.

The detenu or any person interested in him at once acquires a right to move the Court to institute an enquiry. Although there is no specific provision in the Special Powers Act, 1974 to serve the order of detention upon the detenu, it is essential that the order of detention must be served upon him for enabling him to know under what order and under what law he was being detained.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 4 of the Special Powers Act provides that the order of detention passed under section 3 of the Special Powers Act shall be executed as provided in section 80 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. So, section 4 of the Special Powers Act, 1974 has to be read with section 80 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and these 2 sections read together make it abundantly clear that an order of detention passed under section 3 of the Special Powers Act must be served upon the detenu.

This power of the Magistrate is subject to the discretion exercisable by the Special Tribunal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since no allegation was made against the petitioner in the F.I.R. and no evidence could be collected against him during investigation and the police recommended for his discharge, the learned Magistrate was within his competence to discharge the accused petitioner despite the fact that the case was triable exclusively by the Special Tribunal.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Narayan Chandra Das Vs.

An offence under section 342 of the Penal Code is not included in the schedule of the Act and cannot be basis of conviction as the same is a non schedule offence. Hence the High Court Division acted wrongly and without jurisdiction in convicting the appellants under section 342 of the Penal Code when the same is not triable by the Special Tribunal at all. The alteration of conviction from a schedule offence to an offence which is only referable under Penal Code is not legally permissible.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Abdur Rahman and others Vs The State, 19BLD(AD)4</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Section—30</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (V of 1898)</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Section—339C</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is an unnecessary delay in holding the trial and there is no certainty when the witnesses will turn up and when the trial can concluded.
