Since the legislature has purposely, consciously and clearly made this provision for trial of different offences by the Anti-Terrorism Tribunal, no different meaning can be attributed to it while dealing with the question of quashing a proceeding in exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Division</p><p>The language of the statute is depository and reservoir of the legislative intent. In order to ascertain and discover the intention the of the legislature, statute must be considered as whole to grasp its true meaning. Where the statute is clear it needs no interpretation. If it is ambiguous of the legislature is to be looked into. The Court is to interpret on the basis of the language and intent and not to enter deep into the matter. The plain meaning of the statute indicates that the offences defined under section 2(ka) to 2(Chha) is to be tried and can be tried alongwith the offences under the Penal Code and the general law of the land. The Tribunal at the time of framing charge shall consider whether the offences under the Anti-Terrorism Act and under the general law of the country is separable or not.<strong><em><br/><br/>Md.
