Normally such beating is to chastise the wife for unbecoming behavior. Such beating becomes excessive—when the wife provocates the husband.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;">It is true, mere absconsion of the accused after the occurrence is not sufficient to hold him guilty of the offence.

The chain of circumstances coupled with the medical evidence on record having been considered by the learned Judges of the High Court Division, we find that the circumstantial evidences admit of no other hypothesis than the guilt of the petitioner.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Gourango Kumar Shaha Vs The State, 17BLD(AD)120</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"> </p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Alibi—wife killing case</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Absence of plea of alibi</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the absence of any plea of alibi the evidence on record is found to be sufficient to hold that the appellant was at home in the fateful night with his deceased wife. Since the defence has failed to succeed in creating a reasonable belief by proving any circumstances that she could take her life by committing suicide the husband cannot absolve himself of the criminal liability for causing death to his deceased wife. The prosecution has been able to prove by evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the husband was with his deceased wife in the night of occurrence and the appellant caused the death of his wife by strangulation and as such the trial Court rightly convicted the appellant.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Abdus Salam Vs The State, 19BLD (HCD)98</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"> </p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Alibi</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Plea of alibi in a wife killing case</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a wife killing case it is very difficult to bring witnesses against the accused person. The evidence of PW4 has got to be taken in the light of this situation. The evidence of PW4 that appellant Shiplu was in the field has been contradicted by the evidence of PW 5, another hostile witness, who saw appellant Shiplu and appellant Khaleda coming out of the house soon after the occurrence.
