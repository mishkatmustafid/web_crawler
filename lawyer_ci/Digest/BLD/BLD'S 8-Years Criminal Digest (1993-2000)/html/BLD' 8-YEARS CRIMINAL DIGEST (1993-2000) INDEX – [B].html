The reason is that in such cases the accused persons have already satisfied the competent Court that there are no reasonable grounds for believing that they have committed the alleged offence. The Appellate Division held that as a measure of punishment bail should not be refused in such a case. Bail is granted to the appellants. Cr.P.C.

The respondent has not been granted bail upon these considerations but upon the view that there are no reasonable grounds for believing that she has been guilty of the offence alleged.

Therefore, if he is allowed anticipatory bail then upon furnishing bond he will subject himself really to one form of custody. If the prayer is rejected or adinterim bail is allowed but is subsequently cancelled, then the matter ends there and does not entail the consequence that he has to be given to the police or jail custody. His position cannot be worse than before the refusal of his prayer for/or cancellation of anticipatory bail— Cr.P.C Sections—496, 497 and 498</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>K.M.
