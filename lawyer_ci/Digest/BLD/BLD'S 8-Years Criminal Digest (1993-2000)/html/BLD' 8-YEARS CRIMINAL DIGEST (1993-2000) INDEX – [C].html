But in the instant case the cross-examination that was made by the defence only established the presence of the accused persons and their participation in the occurrence. It is really unfortunate that the learned Judges of the High Court Division discarded the evidence of the eye-witnesses and other corroborative evidence on record without any discussion and consideration of any of the testimony of the witnesses. It is very unfortunate that in a criminal appeal such method has been adopted in a very perfunctory manner by the learned Judges of the High Court Division.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Mahmudul Islam @ Ratan Vs The State, 20 BLD(AD)249</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"> </p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Criminal trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the evidence of PW4 and the inquest report it appears that Biswajit did riot commit suicide rather somebody killed him and then tried to hang the dead body in the cowshed in a sitting position.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Gulzar Biswas and others Vs The State, 20 BLD(HCD)550</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"> </p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the judgment of the trial Court it is found that the learned Sessions Judge has not properly assessed the evidence of the case and failed to consider the gross discrepancies, contradictions and omissions as well as admissions of the PWs on vital points and as such it is not safe to maintain the, order of conviction and sentence on the evidence on record of the case.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Shaheb Ali Munshi and another Vs The State, 20 BLD(HCD) 148</em></strong></p><p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><strong><em> </em> <br/></strong></p><p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><strong>CULPABLE HOMICIDE</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> Culpable homicide</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mere killing of a person or mere causing person’s death is not murder, culpable homicide or even any criminal offence but it so when caused with certain guilty knowledge.

The young girl cannot be allowed to walk away from the prison house of her own, because she had no independent place to stay. The welfare of the girl, should be deciding factor in such a situation. The appellant produced a certificate from the school where the girl was reading which corroborates the statements of the appellant that his daughter was a minor at the relevant time. The radiologist’s opinion also supports the appellants case. From the above circumstances and having considered all aspects of the matter it will be fit and proper and in the best interest of the girl if she is released from custody and given to the care of her father—Cr.P.C.S.491</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Bashu Deb Chatterjee Vs Umme Salma and another, 19 BLD (AD) 137.</em></strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
