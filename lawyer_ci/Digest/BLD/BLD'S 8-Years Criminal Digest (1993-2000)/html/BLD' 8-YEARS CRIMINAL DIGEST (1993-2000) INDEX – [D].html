These two sections indicate that when an accused is brought for trial before a Court of law, the Court upon hearing the parties and on consideration of the record of the case and the documents may discharge the accused. These two sections have nothing to do with quashing of a proceeding. Section 561A is an independent inherent power of the High Court Division and this power can be exercised in case of abuse of the process of Court and for securing the ends of justice and or to give effect to any order under the Code.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Latifa Akhter and ors vs. The State and another, 19BLD (AD)20</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"> </p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Discharge</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The prosecution case as set out in the petition of complaint discloses prima facie ingredients of the offence alleged.
