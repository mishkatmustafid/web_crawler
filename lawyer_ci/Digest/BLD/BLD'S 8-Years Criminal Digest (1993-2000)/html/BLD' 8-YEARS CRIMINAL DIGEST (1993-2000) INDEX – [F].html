The Court is entitled to note the conflict between the first recorded version of the prosecution case and the story that is made out in course of the trial.

So, the delay of 15 hours in lodging the FIR is, no doubt, inordinate and in the absence of any explantion for such inordinate delay, it is very difficult to accept the genuineness of the FIR in question.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Aslam Jahangir Vs.
