Since the offence in question is punishable with imprisonment upto 5 years there is no illegality in passing an order of issuance of warrant of arrest against the accused-persons.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Shainpukur Holding Ltd.

The Court cannot also impose any fine upon any witness or direct him to pay any compensation to the accused. A Tribunal constituted under section 26 of the Special Powers Act is required to follow the provisions of section 476 Cr.

The police have no authority to arrest and prosecute any person directly for the alleged violation of the provisions of the Act. The police can act in aid of the excise authority only when called upon to do so.

Although time limit for completing investigation has been fixed in section 18 of the Act, no provision has been made as to what legal consequences shall follow if the investigation is not completed within the specified time.
