In such a case, to give credit to the girl for her statement is to assume that she must have been born before her mother. It will have to be assumed further that the mother is an enemy of her daughter and the mother was falsely claiming her to be a minor and further that the welfare of the victim girl would be safe and better in her own hands than in the hands of her parents. In a case like this, it is difficult to appreciate how can a ward’s statement be preferred to that of his or her parents when the question is about his or her age.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Khairunnessa Vs.
