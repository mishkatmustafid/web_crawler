Since the offence in question is punishable with imprisonment upto 5 years there is no illegality in passing an order of issuance of warrant of arrest against the accused-persons.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shainpukur Holding Ltd.

In the instant case the signing of the petition of complaint by and examination under section 200 Cr.P.C. of Anisul Hoque on behalf of his father Shamsul Haque were thus perfectly valid and proper.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Tamizul Haque Vs.

Such provisions have been made so that the perpetrators of specified crimes are brought to book and are not suppressed by the persons knowing about them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

In the instant case cognizance was taken on the basis of extracts of a report submitted by an enquiry committee and not on the basis of any report submitted by the Executive Director who merely presented the extracts of that report before the C.M.M.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shainpukur Holding Limited Vs.

Before such cognizance there is no proceeding that may be quashed under section 561A Cr. P. C.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Quashing of a proceeding can be made even at the initial stage just upon taking of cognizance by the Magistrate when facts and circumstances of a case justify it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mubashwir Ali and others Vs.

This Judge is none else than the Sessions Judge which is an office. Section 9(2) of the Code gives the Government the power to direct at what place or places the Court of Sessions shall hold its sitting. Therefore the power of the Government is pervasive over: (1) the establishment of a Court of Sessions, (2) appointment of a Judge of a Court of Sessions and (3) determination of the place or places where the Court of Sessions shall hold its sitting. This is a flexible power and cannot be restricted to particular situations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sayeed Farook Rahman Vs The Sessions Judge of the Court of Sessions, Dhaka and others, I 7BLD(AD)177</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—9(2)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a special order to try a particular case at a particular place the original place of sitting continues to remain the place of sitting of the Court of Sessions and the new place indicated in the special order is meant for trial of oniy that case or class of cases which the special order specifically provides.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sayeed Farook Rahman Vs The Sessions Judge of the Court of Sessions, Dhaka and others, 17BLD(AD)177</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ref:</strong> AIR 1988 (SC) 1838 Cited.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—18(2)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Appointment of Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrates</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">When Government allocated function under sub-section (7A) of section 167 Cr.P.C. to the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and he passed the impugned order of revival, such an order cannot be held to be illegal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Government of Bangladesh Vs.

Dhaka, are mainly judicial functions in addition to some administrative works, which are incidental to the post and therefore the post of C.M.M.

In passing an order of detention touching the liberty of a person, the Magistrate should apply his judicial mind into the facts and circumstances of the case in determining whether circumstances of the case really call for a detention in police custody.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Faruk Mahajan and others Vs The State, 17BLD(HCD)15</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—87 and 88</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Proclamation for an absconding person and attachment of his property</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under section 87 the Magistrate is competent to publish a written proclamation requiring the accused to appear before him in connection with a case within a specified time when he has reason to believe that the person against whom a warrant has been issued by him has absconded or is concealing himself so that the warrant cannot be executed. The prerequisites for the publication of a proclamation are the issuance of an warrant and absconsion or concealment of the accused to evade the execution of the warrant.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Attachment under section 88 Cr. P. C. of the property, moveable or immovable, or both, belonging to the proclaimed person can be made only after the order of proclamation issued under section 87 of the Code has been duly made. In the absence of any material for invocation of the provisions of sections 87 or 88 Cr.P.C. the order of proclamation and attachment is illegal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Maulana M.

But before according permission, the Sessions Judge is to satisfy himself that the Police Officer or Anti Corruption Officer is investigating on an alleged crime and is not merely fishing for information to harass, intimidate or coerce innocent persons. In the present case, there being a specific information in respect of alleged defalcation of a huge amount of money by several importers in collusion with Bank officials and in the face of reference that Bank’s own investigation has revealed that there has been a defalcation, the impugned order of the Sessions Judge directing the Bank to deposit to the Bureau of AntiCorruption, Chittagong all connected records regarding the removal of goods imported on obtaining loan from the said Bank, which were pledged with the Bank, calls for no interference.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Messrs Hamidia Oil Mills Vs.

But there is no provision for seizure of such document for facilitating an investigation when no such case is pending before any Court. The learned Sessions Judge committed an illegality in passing the impugned order according permission to the police to seize records from the Bank’s custody without finding a prima facie case.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Arab Bangladesh Bank Ltd.

Once an information is brought to the notice of the Magistrate, he has to be satisfied that a dispute as to immovable property is likely to cause a breach of peace. Further proceedings which he starts are not proceedings in the interest of any private party but in the interest of public peace.

Moreover, there is no independent evidence to corroborate the same. The confessional statement appears to be exculpatory indicating no active part in the occurrence by the confessing accused and as such the same cannot be used against its maker.

This finds support from his statement under section 342 of the Code wherein he stated that he was several betean and he was in dying condition. It further finds support from the evidence of P.W. 29 Md. Mosharaf Hossain, Magistrate 1<sup>st</sup> Class who recorded dying declaration of accused Abdul All at 9-35 at night on the written requisition of Dr. M.A. Mannan at Sarail Upazilla Health Complex exhibit 24. From a reading of the deposition of P.W. 29 who recorded dying declaration it appears that the injuries of accused Abdul Ali were serious for which he gave a dying declaration on the day before the confessional statement by another Magistrate-cum T.N.O. was recorded. It is mysterious that although he was in the Thana Health Complex at 9-35 P.M. at night for recording dying declaration that is no discharge certificate from the Hospital and there is nothing on record that he was taken to police station and then to the Court on next day and under what condition. This depicts a picture that reflects high handedness of the investigating agency in this case. In such view of the matter exhibit 10, has been procured from its maker accused Abdul Ali condemed prisoner, by physical torture, threat and intimidation. This is partinent to note that in the confessional statement he did not implicate himself with the murder of Paritosh rather he stated that it was Razzaque who gave the blow and he further stated that no valuables were taken away from the boat.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs Md.

In the instant case the learned Magistrate having not warned the confessing accused in terms of this mandatory provision of law, the confessional statement must be kept out of consideration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the order sheet of the Upazila Magistrate it is seen that in reply to his requisition the Superintendent of Mymensingh Jail reported that the two appellants were admitted in the jail hospital for treatment on 8.2.1987 with multiple injuries on their person. They were admitted in hospital on the following day of recording of their confessional statements. The Investigation Officer lied in saying that the confessional statements of the accused were recorded on 6.2.1987 although the record shows that the confessions were recorded on 7.2.1987. Under these circumstances it is not unreasonable to hold that the confessions were extracted by subjecting the appellants to physical tortures.
