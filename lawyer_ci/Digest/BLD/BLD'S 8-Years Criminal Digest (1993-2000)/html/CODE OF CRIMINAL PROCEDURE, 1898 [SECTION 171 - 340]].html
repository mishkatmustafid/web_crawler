If on perusal of a “naraji petition” or a fresh complaint the Magistrate finds that the facts disclosed in the case constitute any offence under the law, it would be incumbent upon him to take cognizance and issue process. But in the instant case the Magistrate did not as yet take cognizance and did not exhaust the procedures as laid down in Chapter XVI of the Code and as such the criminal revision before the Sessions Judge was obviously premature.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Nurul Hoque Vs.

Since the Tribunal could not agree with the opinion of the Investigating Officer and took cognizance of the case on the basis of materials before him, the learned Tribunal acted within his competence. No exception can be taken to it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bilkish Miah Vs.

Noncompliance with this requirement of law causes prejudice to the defence. The prosecution must not play hide and seek. However when the copies of statements under sections 161 and 164 of the Code are supplied to the accused before hearing under section 265B Cr.P.C. the defect is cured.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Major (Retd) Baziul Huda Vs The State, 20BLD (AD)236</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—173(3B)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Further investigation by the police</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In view of the fact that suspected accused Kashem, husband of victim Majeda and accused Sadek Ali were left out of indictment by the investigating officer, although evidence of their complicity was forthcoming, the High Court Division ordered for holding further investigation into their case by the police and to submit its report to the Magistrat in due course.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

But the Magistrate has no power to direct further investigation in respect of accused persons against whom the police has already submitted charge sheet.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the name of a further investigation the police has no power to scrap the earlier investigation or cancel the charge sheet in order to submit a final report in respect of an accused against whom a charge sheet has earlier been submitted</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Golam Mostafa and others Vs.

It is a continuity of the offence and in such circumstances the Tribunal at Syihet has not committed any illegality in taking cognizance of the offence and in framing charge.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Anowara Begum Vs Most.

Accordingly the Court before which the instant case is pending has got the jurisdiction to try it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdus Sattar Vs.

In such view of the matfer, it is to be held that there was a valid sanction for prosecution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Dr. Taslima Nasreen Vs.

Sanction obtained in the case under Section 196 Cr.P.C does not do away with the requirement of law as ordained by proviso to section 188 of the Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When the complaint is lodged at the instance of the Government there is no bar for the Court in taking cognizance of the offence. But in view of the proviso to section 188 Cr.P. C. inspite of due cognizance of the case, the Court is unable to try it without the sanction from the Government. This sanction can, however, be accorded by the Government even after cognizance has been taken.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Dr. Taslima Nasrin Vs. Md.

Therefore, no notice to the accused is necessary in such a case for holding further enquiry u/s 436 Cr,P.C. An accused can be discharged only when a charge has been framed and such a discharge could be made under sections 209,253 or 259 Cr.P.C. In such a case a notice upon the accused persons would be necessary for holding further enquiry. An order of discharge can now be made under the amended provision of Section 241A Cr.P.C.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sirajuddowla and others Vs.

The High Court Division also noticed from the records of the C.M.M. Court that, in fact, processes of warrant of arrest were not issued at all against the accused persons.

When evidence is admitted on a distinct criminal offence beyond the charge framed, there is no way but to infer that the accused persons have been misled and prejudiced in their defence, because the accused understood a charge which was different from the one they were required to meet at the trial.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Kamala and others Vs.

But an absentee accused should not be readily assumed to be an absconder without due inquiry and notice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Failure to appear’ as contemplated by section 339B(2) Cr.P.C. means default or neglect on the part of the accused to appear in Court.

Each of the words has separate meanings and each word is attended with different consequences. When a proceeding is stopped either under section 249 or 339C of the Code, without pronouncing any judgment either of acquittal or of conviction and the accused is released, it does not operate either as a discharge or as acquittal of the accused, so as to attract in the latter case the protection of section 403 of the Code barring trial for the same offence once conviced or acquitted. Stoppage of a proceeding and release of the accused stand short of a discharge. It is half-way to discharge, but not discharge proper. It is certainly not an acquittal. The proceeding is not brought to a close. It does not fade into a past and closed transaction. The use of the words “further proceedings in respect of the trial shall stand stopped and the accused person released” in fact mean that the proceeding in question has come to a stop and the same proceeding can only be revived if the legislature gives sanction to it, but the words quoted do not mean that fresh proceeding cannot be started on the same allegations. A ‘fresh proceeding’ and ‘further proceedings in respect of the trial’ do not mean the same thing. The legal effect of the above quoted words in section 339C and the provisions of section 249 remain and the same proceeding can be revived by a legislative mandate or in the alternative a fresh proceeding can be instituted on the same allegations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is no legal bar for instituting a fresh prosecution on the self-same facts after a proceeding is stopped and accused released under Section 339C(4)</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Niamat Ali Sheikh and ors Vs Begum Enayetur Noor &amp; others 13BLD(AD)11</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ref:</strong> (1981) 33DLR (HCD)205 distingushed—Cited.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—265A</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A public prosecutor has the right to conduct every trial before a Court of Sessions.

These two sections indicate that when an accused is brought for trial before a Court of law the Court upon hearing the parties and on consideration of the record of the case and the documents may discharge the accused. These two sections have nothing to do with quashing of a proceeding.

This is a violation of the express provision of law as was existing at the relevant time and therefore the trial is vitiated for non-compliance of the requirement of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

Legislative exercises are meant to energise and activate the criminal Courts in the disposal of cases and are not meant to give any false hope to the accused that the arms of law will not reach them at all once the sitpulated period is over.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Niamat Ali Sheikh and ors Vs Begum Enayetur Noor &amp; others 13BLD(AD)11</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ref:</strong> (1981) 33DLR (HCD)205 distingushed—Cited</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—339C</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This section required the trial Court to conclude the trial within the statutory period from the date the case was received by it and not from the date of framing of the charges.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 339C of the Code being a procedural law and having repealed altogether by Act XLII of 1992, the accused petitioners will now be governed by the new procedural law which does not provide for stoppage of the proceedings and release of the accused persons. Failure to conclude the trial within the stated statutory period would only provide a ground for bail.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Master Giasuddin and others Vs The State, 17BLD(AD)35</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sections—339C(4) &amp; 339D</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Proceeding stopped and accused released thereafter—whether congnizance should or should not be taken on the revival of proceeding.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Held:</strong> It depends on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.

The legislature created no such bar and that is the yard-sick with which the intention of the legislature is to be read (See S 339C, 403 Cr.P.C.)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Niamat Ali Sheikh and ors Vs Begum Enayetur Noor &amp; others 13BLD(AD)11</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ref:</strong> (1981) 33DLR (HCD)205 distingushed—Cited</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Repeal of section 339D Cr.P.C.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Act 42 of 1992 although was not given any retrospective effect, but inspite of repeal of section 339D (provision of revival of a stopped proceeding), provision was made in section 6 of the new Act for application of section 339D, as if it was not repealed, when, before the coming into force of the new Act on 1st of November, 1992, a proceeding was already stopped under the unamended provision of sub-section (4) of section 339C. If a proceeding is now stopped after the coming into force of the new Act either by the High Court Division or by the Appellate Division, the prosecution will now have only corresponding right of revival of the proceeding under the repealed provision of section 339D Cr.P.C. In such a case, the accused will be scot free and no proceeding can be continued against him without a fresh complaint or FLR. Under unamended provision of subsection (4) of section 339C, the accused did not enjoy an unqualified right or privilege of stoppage of proceeding and release if the trial could not be completed within 270 days. The new Act has effected a change in the procedural law but it has not affected any vested right of the accused and the prosecution. The right of the accused for stoppage and release was fettered and chained with the prosecution’s right to revive the case. By necessary intendment the new Act will be retrospective in operation in so far as sub-section (4) of Section 339C of the new Act is concerned.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In view of repeal of sub-section (4) of section 339C Cr.P.C. followed by reenactment of the said sub-section, the new procedural law will be applicable in all pending cases although instituted when the old pro-vision was in force.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Wadud Vs.
