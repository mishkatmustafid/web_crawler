Parade, this vital fact must be brought to the notice of the accused while examining him under section 342 of the Code. Non-mentioning of the vital fact while examining him under section 342 of the Code has deprived him of the opportunity to offer his explanation to the matter and the same has seriously prejudiced him and the trial stands vitiated on that score.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

Since the accused-appellant was not given any opportunity to explain the circumstances, the order of conviction appears to have been vitiated and it is liable set aside.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Nurul Islam alias Nur Islam Vs The State, 18BLD(HCD)695</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—342</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 342 of the requires that all incriminating piece of evidence and circumstances appearing against the accused must be brought to his notice so that he may offer his explanation thereto. The exercise under section 342 of the Code is not an idle formality but a legal necessity affording a valuable right to the accused and as such a definite duty is cast upon the trial Court to see that the provision of section 342 is duly complied with.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The casual and irresponsible manner in which the accused appellants have been examined under section 342 of the Code clearly betrays a sense of total lack of application of a judicial mind and judicial responsibility on the part of the learned Special Judge and the same has definitely prejudiced the appellants.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Alauddin Khan Pathan and others Vs The State, 19BLD(HCD)74</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ref:</strong> AIR 1936(P.C) 253, 41DLR 64, 50 DLR 17—Cited</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—342</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This provision of law is intended for the benefit of the accused, the trial court is under an obligation to properly comply with the requirement of law so as to avoid any possible prejudice to the accused on this count.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Al-haj Nurul Islam Chowdhury and another Vs The State, 20BLD(HCD)168</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—342</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The trial Court should draw the attention of the accused to the main incriminating evidence against him, particularly the confessional statement, while examining him under section 342 Cr.P.C. But mere omission to specifically draw the attention of the accused to such evidence does not always prejudice him.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When the accused did not retract his confession either by application from jail or by directly filing such application in the Court at any time, no grievance on the unsubstantiated allegations of inducement and torture can be entertained at the last stage of the trial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mezanur Rahman and others Vs.

Since attention was not drawn while the appellant was examined under section 342 of the Code either to his confessional statement or to the statement of Dulal, the appellant is obviously prejudiced and as such the trial stands vitiated. Such defect is not curable under section 537 of the Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abu Jamal and others Vs The State,19BLD(HCD)411</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—342</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Children Act, 1974 (XXXIX of 1974)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—2(f)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to section 2(f) of the Act a child means a person under the age of 16 years. In the instant case the appellant was a regular student of Class IX at the time of commission of the offence and he was aged about 14 years when the Court examined him under section 342 of the Code and as such the trial is without jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md Shamim Vs The State, 19BLD (HCD)542</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sections—366 and 369</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The delivery of judgment means the pronouncement of judgment within the meaning of section 366 of the Code while the provision of signing of judgment is contained in section 367 thereof. Section 369 of the Code provides that once a judgment is delivered and signed a finality is attached to it. The Criminal Court has no authority whatsoever to review its judgment and to make any alteration or correction therein except correcting clerical mistakes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is the universal practice of the High Courts of the sub-continent that judgments are dictated and delivered in the open Court and the verdict of the Court is made known to all concerned right at the moment of its pronouncement. Thereafter judgments are transcribed and signed by the Presiding Judge or Judges, Between the delivery of the judgment and the signing of the same, there invariably intervenes a time gap which varies from case to case depending on the size of the judgment and the time consumed for transcription of the same and other incidental factors and in the process there emerges a time gap. Just because a judgment has not been formally signed after its transcription by mechanical devices but it has duly been delivered in the open Court, it cannot be conceived that the Court can still review its judgment by way of rehearing the matter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Moniruzzaman alias Muhammad Maniruzzaman Vs.

If the trial Court is swayed by the oratory of the lawyer of a party to the case and without properly analysing the evidence on record in the context of the case of the prosecution and defence, arrives at any finding on consideration of irrelevant matters assigning artificial reasons, then those reasons are likely to be manifestly wrong and perverse and decision arrived at on the basis of such reasons may result in failure of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Dulal Miah alias Dulal alias Nurun Nabi Vs Ruhul Amin and others, 18BLD (HCD)485</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sections—367 and 424</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">While disposing of a criminal appeal, the appellate Court is required to formulate the points for determination, the decisions thereon and the reasons for the decisions. This necessarily implies that the appellate court must consider at least the material evidence of the case and arrive at his independent findings on all material points at issue. Mere saying that it concurred with the findings of the trial Court without referring to the material evidence on record is not sufficient to meet the requirements of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Yasin Mollah and another Vs The State, 20BLD(HCD)493</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—369</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Judgment in a criminal case</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a criminal case a judgment means a judgment of conviction or acquittal. Every order passed in a criminal case cannot, therefore, be termed as a judgment. So, an order dismissing a criminal revision for default is not a judgment within the meaning of section 369 of the Code. In the absence of any specific bar in the Code of Criminal Procedure, a petitioner, whose revisional application has been dismissed for default and not on merit, is not debarred from a filing second revisional application to challenge an illegal order.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Anowar Hossain and others Vs.

In such a case although the death sentence has not been awarded by the Sessions Judge himself, the execution of sentence of death passed by the Special Martial Law Court having not reached its finality for non- execution, the Sessions Judge is under a legal obligation to follow the provision of section 374 of the Code as he is required to follow in the case of sentence of death passed by him in the trial held by himself.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Baset and another Vs.

It does not contemplate issuance of any notice to the complainant, because after the complaint case has ended in conviction, the State comes to the picture as it is the duty of the State to execute the verdict of conviction and sentence imposed upon the accused.
