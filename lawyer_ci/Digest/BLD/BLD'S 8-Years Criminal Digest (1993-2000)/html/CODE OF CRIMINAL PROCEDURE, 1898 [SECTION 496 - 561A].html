There is no inherent power of the High Court Division or the court of Sessions to grant bail at any stage. Therefore status in life, affluence or otherwise are irrelevant while considering the prayer for granting anticipatory bail.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>K. M.

Therefore, if he is allowed anticipatory bail then upon furnishing bond he will subject himself really to one form of custody. If the prayer is rejected or adinterim bail is allowed, but is subsequently cancelled, then the matter ends there and does not entail the consequence that he has to given into the police or jail custody. His position cannot be worse than before the refusal of his prayer for br cancellation of anticipatory bail.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>K. M.

This power cannot be exercised in each and every case as a substitute to the exercise of such power by the court below. A person cannot be enlarged on anticipatory bail how high so ever he may be unless conditions for granting such bail are satisfied.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case the petitioner has not been able to make out a case of unnecessary harassment and humiliation in the hands of police and as such he is not entitled to anticipatory bail.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

A man with a high social standing ranks equal before a Court of law with a man sleeping rough on the pavement in front of the Curzon Hall. No one is entitled to claim a privilege for himself nor can he claim preferential treatment in a Court of law on account of his wealth or status. So, innocence simpliciter is not a ground for anticipatory bail. However high one may be one must have respect for the Courts and should not hesitate to appear before a Magistrate on the ground of one’s standing in the society. <strong><em>[per Syed Amirul Islam, J]</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

It is well-settled that the basic conception of the word ‘bail’ is release of a person from the custody of police and delivery into the hands of sureties, who undertake to produce him in Court whenever required to do so. An accused person is said, at common law, to be admitted to bail, when he is released from the custody of the officers of the Court and is entrusted to the custody of persons known as his sureties who are bound to produce him to answer, at a specified time and place, the charge against him and who in default of so doing are liable to forfeit such sum as is specified when bail is granted. <strong><em>[Per A.T.M.

The ordinary law is that a person accused of a non-bailable offence must appear before the Court taking cognizance for making a prayer for bail. The prayer can be made when he is arrested or detained with or without warrant and is brought before the said Court.

The order of conviction and sentence was assailed on the ground that it was practically a case of no evidence and the impugned judgment suffered from basic infirmities. Since section 5 of the Limitation Act has not been made applicable to Special Powers Act cases, there was no scope for condonation of delay in the appeal as a result of which the convict was left with no remedy for vindication of his legitimate grievances. By invoking inherent power of the Court under section 561A Cr.P.C. the High Court Division converted the memo of appeal into a memo of revision for examining the legality and propriety of the impugned order of conviction for securing the ends of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sohel Ahmed Chowdhury Vs.

Section 110 of Bank Companies Act, 1991 also provides that a Manager, Officer and other functionaries of the banking company are deemed to be public servants under Section 21 of the Penal Code.
