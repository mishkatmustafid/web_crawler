In the instant case the Court gave necessary directions to the relevant authorities for taking appropriate steps against those who are responsible for colossal negligence of duty leading to immense sufferings to innocent citizens.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

Whether or not the accused person had such a reasonable opportunity is a question of fact to be decided in each case upon case records and no hard and fact formula can be laid down to settle the criteria in advance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Article—104</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Appellate Division’s inherent power under Article 104 of the Constitution to do complete justice is exercised on an appeal from a decision of the High Court Division only. To suggest that a Leave Petition may be filed under Article 103 challenging the Sessions Judge’s decision itself tantamounts to legislation which is not contemplated by law and this arises out of utter misconception of the provisions of sections 439, 439A and 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Md.
