In that view of the matter we find that the conviction and sentence imposed upon the appellant under section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1980 do not suffer from any illegality. We sustain the conviction and sentence not on the reasoning given by the learned Judges of the High Court Division in 40 DLR 360 but on the ground that the word “dowry” in section 4 is not to be read in terms of the definition of the word “dowry” in section 2 but in its ordinary sense.
