The correct principle in respect of the evidence of persons falling in the category of interested, interrelated and partisan witnesses is that it must be closely and critically scrutinized. It should not be accepted on its face value. Since interested witnesses may have a motive of falsely implicating the accused persons, their evidence has to cross the hurdle of critical appreciation. As their evidence cannot be thrown out mechanically because of their interestedness, so their evidence cannot be accepted mechanically without a critical examination.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The rule that the evidence of interested witnesses requires corroboration is not an inflexible one. It is a rule of caution rather than a rule of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The High Court was obviously wrong in holding that no corroboration was necessary in this case and failed to scrutinise the evidence of interested eye-witnesses with infirmities in their evidence. It is unsafe to rely on such evidence for sustaining a conviction on a capital charge without corroboration, either circumstantial or ocular. <strong>(Per. Mustafa Kamal, J delivering the majority judgment)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is no rule of law that if independent witnesses are not available in a case, a conviction cannot be sustained on the evidence of eye witnesses who are relations and partisan witnesses. If found to be trustworthy, conviction can be based on the evidence of such interested witnesses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When both the parties are equally powerful and divided in two hostile groups, at the present day no body likes to involve himself in a group rivalry between two strong factions of people. In such a case, it is indeed difficult for the prosecution to examine independent witnesses as the villagers would be reluctant to side with any of the parties who had longstanding enmity and rivalry between them. Furthermore, the witnesses as well as the accused being interrelated amongst themselves and enemically disposed of towards one another, it was difficult for the prosecution to examine independent witnesses. Moreover, it does not appear from the record that any independent witness who had seen the occurrence &amp; was withheld by the prosecution to find fault with it. <strong>(Per Latifur Rahman,.J-delivering dissenting judgment)</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Nowabul Alam and others Vs The State, 15BLD(AD)54</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Section—8</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abscondence of the accused</strong>—Abscondence of the accused during the trial may be a circumstance for giving rise to an adverse presumption against him and but it can never be the sole basis of conviction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The court acted illegally in putting the burden of disproving the charge upon the accused person.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Abdus Salam Vs.

The learned Special Judge was wrong in convicting the appellant simply on the ground that he was absconding and did not appear to face the trial or to refute the charges</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Md.

It is unsafe to base conviction of an accused on his extra-judicial confession alone. The value of such confession as evidence depends on the veracity of the witnesses to whom it is made. In a case of such confession material corroboration of evidence of unimpeachable character is required.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case there is no ocular evidence of the occurrence except the testimony of P.W.8 Md. Habibur Rahman who also did not disclose the name of the condemned prisoner to the P.W. 1 informant, or to anybody after the killing or also at the time of lodging the first information report. Although it has been stated by some of the witnesses that condemned prisoner Hasen Ali made extra-judicial confession admitting the killing of the victim the allegation of making the extra- judicial confession has become, uncertain and without any corroboration and as such it is unsafe to base a conviction on the basis of the said extra judicial confession.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

It can only be taken into consideration against the co-accused if corroborated by some other independent evidence. This section applies to confession made by an accused affecting himself and his co-accused in a joint trial for the same offence and not the statement whereby he does not admit his guilt</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Abdul Gafur and others, Vs.

In the instant case, there being no substantive evidence, either direct or circumstantial, implicating the appellant in the alleged murder or in the abetment of the same except as to some evidence about the motive of the offence, the High Court Division was wrong in treating the confessional statement of the co-accused as substantive evidence and treating the evidence of P.Ws. 4 and 7 as corroboration thereof.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Ustar Ali Vs.

The second dying declaration being nearer to death, the High Court Division believed the same and acted on it. Moreover, P.Ws 4 and 7 in clear terms mentioned the inflicting of injuries by the appellants on the person of the deceased, which is supported by the medical evidence. The High Court Division ought not to have rejected the evidence of these two witnesses merely on the ground that they were not disinterested witnesses, notwithstanding the fact that the defence failed to shaken their credibility in cross-examination.

In the instant case the dying declaration was duly recorded by a competent Magistrate who proved the same before the Court. The dying declaration was recorded on 22.5.1989 and the victim died on 15.6.1989. The intestine of the victim came out and he was operated upon immediately. Thereafter on the requisition of hospital authority the dying declaration was recorded by a competent Magistrate which shows critical condition of the victim. Moreover the victim himself corroborated, it by saying that he could not speak further and there- fore merely because the victim died some days after recording the dying declaration will not render the dying declaration inadmissible under section 32 of the Act.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>The State Vs Akkel Ali and ors, 20 BLD(HCD)484</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Section—80</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Memorandum by Magistrate conducting</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>TI.

The prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and the accused has no obligation to account for the death of the victim for which he is placed on trial. But when the murder of the wife of the appellant takes place in his house while she was living with him in the same house, the accused owes a duty to explain as to how his wife has met with her death.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Ali Hossain Vs.

If the manner of the incident is not proved, the prosecution must necessarily fail, no matter, whether the defence version of the case has not been proved either.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In order to bring a case within the ambit of section 106 of the Evidence Act, ‘special knowledge” of relevant facts must be attributed to the accused persons in respect of commission of the offence.

The rule is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a conviction.

If the evidence of the victim of a sexual offence does not suffer from any basic infirmity and “probabilities factor” does not render it unworthy of credence there is no reason to insist on corroboration to the evidence of the prosecutrix.

The necessity of corroborative evidence will arise and that the legal custom of insisting on corroboration in every case or alternatively of stating the reason for waiving such corroboration is not applicable in our country.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Jahangir Hossain Vs The State, 16BLD (HCD)238</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Evidence—False in part, may not be false in entirity</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In our country there is a tendency in the witness to exaggerate, embroider and also to falsely implicate some persons in addition to the real offenders. But even then the Court is to scan the evidence carefully so as to come to a correct decision as to which part of the evidence is acceptable and which part is to be rejected. Only when it becomes impossible to separate the truth from the falsehood, the Court will be justified in rejecting the entire evidence.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Masum and others Vs.

So, the persistent evidence of the public witnesses regarding denial of their presence at the time of alleged recovery in no way can be cured by the official witnesses (police personnel) who are none but interested in this case.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Aslam Jahangir Vs The State, 20 BLD (HCD) 426.</em></strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
