The extent and limit of the said power will have to be determined by examining the terms of the regulations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A judgment, sentence or order of a Martial Law Court is merely tentative in nature so long it is not reviewed and an accused can not be said to have derived any vested right from such an order or judgment. All proceedings of the Special Martial Law Courts (as in the present cases) were to be submitted to the C.M.L.A. for review.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Upon a plain reading of the regulation, it can not be doubted that the reviewing authority, among others, has the power to ‘vary’ a judgment, even if it is of acquittal. The word ‘vary’ in regulation 3(4) includes the power to convert a judgment/order of acquittal into one of conviction.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Helaluddin Ahmed @ Swapan Vs.
