Law in every country is very stringent in dealing with a narcotic drug because of its disastrous potential on social, national and international life. In these contexts the Appellate Division took the view that if a substance which is commercially accepted as ‘hereoin’ contains what is chemically called ‘diacetylmorphine’ the whole substance is to be treated as ‘heroin’ for the purpose of the Act. The law intends to punish dealer of the narcotic irrespective of whether it is in the purest form or not.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case, since it has been proved that the seized packets contained ‘heroin’, the whole of the contents must be treated heroin for the purpose of punishment. It is necessary for the prosecution to prove the “actual and real heroin content” for the purpose of a conviction under 1(b) of the Table of section 19. The High Court Division was wrong to ignore the real perspectives of the act and took an erroneous view that the purpose of the law is only to punish the preparation, carrying and dealing etc. of ‘laboratory heroin’ and not the stuff which was being clandestinely carried by the accused taking great personal risk under a remote control system managed by the captains of the crime sitting across the seas.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the circumstances of the case there was no scope for altering the conviction from one under Clause 1(b) to Clause 1(a) of the Table and consequently there could not be any question of reduction of sentence on compassionate grounds as was done by the High Court Division.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>The State Vs.
