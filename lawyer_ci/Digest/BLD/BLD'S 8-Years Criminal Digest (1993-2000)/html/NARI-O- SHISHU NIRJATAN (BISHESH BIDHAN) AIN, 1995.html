Regarding investigation, time limit has been fixed in section 18 of the Act without making any provision as to what legal consequences shall follow if the investigation is not completed within the specified time. So in this regard the provisions of section 167(5) Cr.P.C. as amended by Act XLII of 1992 shall be applicable and the accused is entitled to bail in suitable cases.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Md. Anwar Hossain Vs. The State, 18 BLD(HCD)18</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Section—20(5)(Ka)(Kha)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The trial Court issued processes for arrest of the accused and for proclamation and attachment of his properties but the service return of the said processes was yet to be received by the Court. Without taking further steps in the matter the Court resorted to the provision of section 20(5)(Kha) by publishing a notification in the daily It, directing the accused to appear before the Court within 30 days of such publication. Since there was no material before the Court to be satisfied that the accused was avoiding arrest and he was concealing himself from appearing in the Court and his attendance or arrest could not be secured at an early date, the impugned notification in the newspaper was in clear violation of section 20(5)(Kha) of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The intention of the legislature in making the provision for publishing the notification in question in at least one daily news paper under section 20(5) (Kha) is obviously to indicate a widely circulated national daily and not a district based daily newspaper with a very limited circulation.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Belayet Howlader Vs.

Though on medical examination of the victim no sign of rape was found and though no mark of violence was noticed on the body of the victim, in view of the entire evidence on record it appears that the victim was raped by the appellants. So, the learned Judge committed no illegality in convicting the appellant under section 6(3) of Nari-O-Shisu Nirjatan (Bishes Bidhan) Ain, 1995.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Badal and another Vs The State, 19BLD (HCD)527</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Section—9(Kha) and 14</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">For bringing accusation of kidnapping a woman for accomplishment of one of the purposes as mentioned in section 9 of the Act or to put a person on trial to answer the accusation of kidnapping a woman for one of the purposes mentioned in the section there must be kidnapping of a woman for one of the purposes or in other words there must be kidnapping with a mind to accomplish one of the purposes mentioned in the section.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Framing of charge against the petitioners under sections 9(Kha) and 14 of the Am is not legal and as such the continuation of the proceedings of Nari-O-Shishu Case would amount to harassment to the petitioners and that also would amount to an abuse of the process of Court.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Younus Ali &amp; 3 others Vs.
