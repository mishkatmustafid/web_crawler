The drawer of the cheque is obliged to make the payment within 15 days of the receipt of the said notice failing which the cause of action for prosecution will arise under clause (c).</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>S.M.

On receipt of the said notice the appellant in order to avoid payment fraudulently informed the complainant through a lawyer on 4.1.1996 that he had lost the cheque written in the complainants name and made a GD Entry in that behalf. The cause of action for prosecution will arise under clause (c) of the proviso to section 138 on the failure of the appellant to pay the amount within 15 days of the receipt of the notice of the complainant. Relying on the complainant’s own case it is contended on behalf of the appellant the accused-appellant must be fixed with notice for payment at least from 4.1.1996 and after the expiry of 15 days from that date i.e; from 19.1.1996 the cause of action should be taken to have arisen due to non-payment within the said period and complaint was required to be filed within one month from 19.1.1996 in compliance with clause (b) of section 141 of the Act. Admittedly the petition of complaint was filed long after that date i.e., on 18.4.1996 and thus cognizance could not be taken upon such complaint. The subsequent allegations will not save the limitation because the requirement under the law is that the complaint has to be filed within one month of the date on which the cause of action arises under clause (c) of the proviso to section 138 of the Act and hence the impugned proceeding is quashed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>S.M.

Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act is for dishonour of a cheque simpliciter for insufficiency of fund whereas an offence under section 420 of the Penal Code is for cheating a person. The two offences are two distinct offences under two different laws. The rule of law about the peremptory application of the special law in preference to the general law for trial of an offence under section 420 of the Penal Code has no application in the instant case. The learned Magistrate committed no illegality in taking cognizance of the case under section 420 of the Penal Code. The institution of a money suit for realisation of the money in question does not debar the prosecution from proceeding with the criminal case.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Md.
