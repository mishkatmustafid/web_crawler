There is no such law in the instant case and as such the petitioner cannot be said to perform public duty and called a public servant.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Md Matiur Rahman Vs The State, 19BLD(HCD)607</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Ref:</strong> 30DLR(SC)127; PLD1964 Dhaka 330; A1R1957(SC)13 and A1R1918 Lahore 1 52—distinguishable</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Section—34</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Common Intention</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This section-does not create any distinct offence. It is intended to meet a case where the members of a party acted in furtherance of the common intention of all but it was difficult to prove exactly the part played by each of them. It means that if two or more persons intentionally do a thing jointly, it is just the same as if each of them had done it individually ‘Common intention’ within the meaning of this section pre-supposes a prior concert. There must be a prior meeting of the minds leading to a pre-arranged plan to commit an offence. The common intention to commit the offence invites the application of section 34 of the Penal Code. In offences involving physical violence, the presence of the accused at the scene of the occurrence renders him liable on the principle of joint liability but where the offence consists of diverse acts and it may be committed at different times, the presence of the accused at the scene of the occurrence is not necessary.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

Before application of this section to a case, it must be shown: (a) a criminal act was done by several persons, (b) all the accused intended the commission of the offence and (c) the criminal act was done in furtherance of the common intention of all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Abul Kalam Azad Vs.

Section 34 of the Penal Code involves a direct overt act on the part of the accused sharing a ‘common intention’ with others for the commission of an offence while section 149 of the Penal Code is essentially a vicarious liability for being a member of an unlawful assembly with the ‘common object’ of committing the offences. These two offences are of different nature.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Abu Talukder Vs The State, 19BLD (HCD)225</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Sections—34 and 149</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Common intention is an intention to commit the crime actually committed and each accused person can be convicted if he shared the common intention. The common intention contemplated by this section is anterior to the commission of the crime and it does not refer to the time when the offence is actually committed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A person cannot be found guilty under section 148 of the Penal Code unless he carried with him a dangerous weapon. A general statement that the accused persons were armed with dangerous weapons like dhal, katra, lathi and sorki is not sufficient to warrant a conviction under this section.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Nurul Haque Matbar and others Vs.

In such a situation when he is faced with assaults from his rival party it is not unnatural that he would strike a decisive blow to defend himself and to free himself from the clutches of his adversaries. In the instant case, accused Ruhul Amin gave only one knife blow to deceased Moktar Ali and then ran away. The attending circumstances indicate that he gave the knife blow only to free himself from the grip of deceased Moktar Ali and ran away for safety. This conduct of the accused satisfies the legal requirement of the right of private defence. The accused can not be said to have exceeded the right of self-defence.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Ruhul Amin Mondal Vs.

This decision does not contemplate holding of any procession or picket or any activity or activities to implement the decision. But if an assembly of five or more persons takes the decision to observe hartal to be participated by the people at large so that their common object is to compel others obviously by show of criminal force to do what they are not legally bound to do, then the said assembly must be an unlawful assembly according to fifth clause of section 141 of the Penal Code and the members of that unlawful assembly are liable to be punished under section 143 of the Penal Code. Consequently the processions or other activities in support of or to force such hartal shall be unlawful assemblies. Similarly every assembly of five persons or more to protest or to oppose hartal shall be an unlawful assembly. Activities of the members of these assemblies shall be cognizable offences according to their behaviour under the relevant sections contained in Chapter VIII of the Penal Code.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

Mere dishonouring of the cheques itself is not an ingredient of cheating.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Mohiuddin Md Abdul Kader Vs The State and another, 20BLD(HCD)499</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;">19BLD(HCD)46 1—relied</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Sections—441/447</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Criminal trespass</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It provides that whoever enters into or upon property in the possession of another with intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property, or having lawfully entered into or upon such property, unlawfully remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or annoy any such person, or with intent to commit an offence, is said to commit “criminal trespass”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case the dominant intention of the appellant was to annoy the complainant who was in possession of the case land. The complainant might not be present at the time of the illegal entry but he came to the scene thereafter and opposed the appellant who, despite his protest, carried on the work of construction. So the ingredients of section 441/447 of the Penal Code have been well-established.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mohammad Ali Member Vs Abdul Fazul Mia Md.

Moreover, in the absence of any finding by the trial Court on the intention or the object of the illegal trespass of the accused, conviction of the accused under sections 447 or 448 of the Penal Code is not maintainable in law.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Md.

The imposition of 4 years rigorous imprisonment under section 471 of the Penal Code is not sustainable in law.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Abul Hossain Mollah alias Abu Mollah Vs The State, 17BLD(AD)170</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Section—493</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A mere promise of marriage made by the accused to a woman or to her guardian intending never to fulfil his promise does not warrant a conclusion that a false belief was caused in her mind that she was the lawfully married wife of the accused.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Makhan alias Putu Vs.

In the instant case, since the alleged offending imputation was made at a press conference by a person who has not been made an accused in the case and the matter was earlier published in other newspapers and the present publication was made in good faith, the offending publication per see satisfies the requirement of Ninth Exception to section 499 of the Penal Code and as such further continuation of the impugned proceeding amounts tà an abuse of the process of the Court and the same is quashed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Syed Mohammad Afzal Hossain Vs.

The privilege enjoyed by the lawyer is only a qualified privilege and he will not come within the bounds of the offence of defamation unless and until there is an “express malice” or malice in fact on his or her part.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">An Advocate is entitled to special protection, when is called in question in respect of defamatory statements made by him or her in course of his or her duties as an Advocate.
