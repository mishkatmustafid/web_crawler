The word ‘shall’ in the section indicates that the directions stated in the section must be strictly followed, more so in view of section 25A of the Security and Exchange Ordinance, which lays down that upon the accused lies the burden of proving that he had not contravened any provision of the Ordinance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The burden of proof is neither as heavy as that upon the prosecution nor so onerous and that it is not higher than the burden which rests upon a plaintiff or defendant in civil proceeding.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Aba Tayeb, Chairman Vs.
