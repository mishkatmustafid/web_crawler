The detaining authority making return to the rule is to place all relevant facts before the Court. Where the respondents do not file any return, the Court cannot satisfy itself as to the justification of detention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the absence of any return by the respondents, the appellant’s contention that the grounds were served on the detenu beyond the statutory period prescribed in section 8 of the Special Powers Act and that the detenu was deprived of his right to make an effective representation before the advisory board remain unchallenged. The Court drew an inference against the respondents and held the order of detention illegal and without lawful authority.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Md Shameem Vs.

Neither in sub-section (2) nor in sub-section (3), there is any provision of passing the order with a condition that the order will come in to force on the date of service of the order upon the detenu. Rather, it has been clearly stated that “no such order shall remain in force for more than thirty days after making thereof.” An order is made on the date it is signed. In the instant case, the order was signed on 24.6.99. There is no scope of passing any order under sub-section (2) or (3) of section 3 of the Act with a qualification that it will come in the force on the date of service of the order upon the detenu.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Md Mosharaf Hossain@ Mash Vs Govt. of Bangladesh and ors, 20BLD (HCD)412</em></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Section—3(3)</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong>Extension of detention</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The liberty of the citizens being a precious possession, it should not be denied, curtailed or otherwise circumscribed by any authority without any legal and reasonable basis. The order of extension of detention must be made with proper application of mind of the detaining authority and it must not be a mechanical routine work by the office staff made much ahead of the date of expiry of detention.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Mrs. Samirannesa Vs.

In a case of preventive detention, it is now well- settled that the grounds served on the detenu must be sufficient to enable him to make an effective representation to the appropriate authority against his detention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When the detenu is a foreign national, the Government instead of detaining him for preventing him from doing prejudicial acts, could better direct him to remove himself from Bangladesh.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Shahidul Alam Vs.

There must be a nexus between the grounds mentioned in the order of detention and the grounds of detention supplied to the detenu.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case, in the ground of detention the purpose of detention was to prevent the detenu from committing an act prejudicial to law and order whereas in the order of detention there was an added purpose of preventing the detenu from committing acts prejudicial to economic and financial interest of the State. From this it follows that the detaining authority itself was not certain as to what prejudicial act or acts the detenu was likely to commit. This in turn suggests lack of proper application of mind of the detaining authority in arriving at the necessary “satisfaction” within the meaning of section 3 (1) of the Special Powers Act, which is an indispensable prerequisite for curtailing the liberty of a citizen guaranteed by the Constitution. It is the constitutional duty of the High Court Division to satisfy itself that the essential prerequisite regarding “satisfaction” for passing the order of detention has been meticulously and carefully fulfilled and in case of any omission to fulfil the above requirement the order of detention must be held to be without lawful authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mere availability of materials for coming to a reasonable satisfaction by the detaining authority that the activities of the detenu were “pre-judicial acts” as defined in section 2(t) of the Special Powers Act does not make the order of detention ipso facto lawful if the detaining authority fails to pass the order of detention and prepare and furnish the grounds of detention after strictly complying with the requirements of the various provisions of the Act.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Dr. Dhiman Chowdhury Vs.

The Government has, however, independent of the order of the District Magistrate, the power to issue an order of detention under section 3(l)(a) of the Special Powers Act, 1974</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;">In the instant case, the initial order of detention passed by the District Magistrate being for 30 days, any extension of the said period of detention upon approval by the Government is not contemplated under section 3(3) of the Act.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>Yeasmin Akhter Vs.

The detenu or any person interested in him at once acquires a right to move the Court to institute an enquiry. Although there is no specific provision in the Special Powers Act, 1974 to serve the order of detention upon the detenu, it is essential that the order of detention must be served upon him for enabling him to know under what order and under what law he was being detained.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 4 of the Special Powers Act provides that the order of detention passed under section 3 of the Special Powers Act shall be executed as provided in section 80 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. So, section 4 of the Special Powers Act, 1974 has to be read with section 80 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and these 2 sections read together make it abundantly clear that an order of detention passed under section 3 of the Special Powers Act must be served upon the detenu. Non-service of the order of detention upon the detenu renders the detention order illegal.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;"><strong><em>M.A. Hashem Vs.

In the instant case, there being no special mark in the cattle-heads to brand them as Indian and similar cattle-heads being available in the local market and the cattle-heads having been seized in Bangladesh at a distance of 5 miles of from the International border, the appellants cannot be held liable for smuggling.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The sale of seized-bullocks only one day after these were seized, even before the investigation of the case started, and without the permission of the Court, is uncalled for and disapproved.
