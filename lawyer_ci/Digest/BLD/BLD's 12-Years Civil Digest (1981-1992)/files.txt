Appeal lies only against those orders which are enumerated in Order 43 Rule I C.P.C. Section 96 C.P.C. provides for appeal against original decree. Revision lies against non-appealable orders. Previously revision against non- appealable order lay only in the High Court Division. In case of an appealable order passed by a Subordinate Judge, an appeal shall lie to the District Judge where the value of the original suit in which or in any proceeding arising out of which the order was made did not exceed Tk 20,000,00 and to the High Court in any other case. It cannot be conceived that a Court which cannot exercise jurisdiction over a matter in appeal was intended to exercise its revisional jurisdiction. It appears to be inconsistent with the scheme of the Code of Civil Procedure and Civil Courts Act to invest the District Judge with concurrent revisional jurisdiction in a matter here no appeal lies before the District Judge. Hitherto the District Judge had no revisional jurisdiction, only the High Court Division had revisional jurisdiction. Section 1 15(2) has invested the District Judge with rvisional jurisdiction. In the circumstances e contention of concurrent jurisdiction apars to be inconsistent. The District Judge’s revisional jurisdiction under section 115(2) is restricted by his appellate jurisdiction as provided under section 21(1) of the Civil Courts Act. In other words, the District Judge can exercise revisional jurisdiction under section 115(2) only in respect of those cases here the value of the subject-matter does not exceed Tk. 20,000.00. In all other cases, it is High Court Division which exercises restriction under section 115(1). Apart from section 115(3) the High Court Division, may under section 115(1) exercise its revisional jurisdiction in any case and its jurisdiction is not controlled by sub-section (2) of section 115. In the instant case the suit has been valued at Tk. 1, 00,000.00. For the reasons stated above in was held that the District Judge had no jurisdiction to entertain a revisional application under section 115(2) against the impugned order passed by the learned Subordinate Judge. The instant revisional application was found to be maintainable and competent—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Order 43 Rule 1—Civil Courts Act, 1887 LXII of 1887) Ss. 3, 6, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20 and 21.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Nurul Islam and others Vs.

The High Court Division in appropriate cases should interfere with the order of the subordinate Court refusing to consolidate suits as the principle of consolidation in no way conflicts with the purpose of section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. On the contrary, it ‘preserves and promotes it. Certain meaning of statute must not be imputed to the legislature to create situation leading to an absurd result and offending against common sense. On the contrary, it is the duty of the judiciary to give, as far as possible, an interpretation of law which inspires confidence in all responsible manners.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The words, ‘shall not proceed occurring in any suit” in section 10 C.P.C. are intended to bar separate trial -of any suit in which the matter in issue was also directly and substantially in issue in the previously instituted suit by the same parties in the same Court.

An application under Article 102 might involve civil disputes, criminal allegations, constitutional issues and administrative orders emanating from different authorities of the state and the Government and local authorities. If it is assumed that the power of the Court to review its judgment under the Code of Civil Procedure would be applicable in an application under Article 102 of the Constitution only when such application involves civil disputes between the parties in question, in such circumstances, it would lead to compartmentalizing the discretionary prerogatives and extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court under one specific provision of Article 102 of the Constitution, which could not be intended by the founding framers of the Constitution. The proceeding under Article 102 must be taken as a self-explanatory, self-contained, complete single proceeding which might be civil or criminal in nature involving constitutional or administrative issues from time to time. When a proceeding under Article 102 has no permanent and over-all bearing of a civil pro- ceding, any particular case from such proceeding which involves civil disputes cannot be selected for the purpose of invoking the powers under the Code of Civil Procedure to review judgments and orders. That would lead to fragmentation of an otherwise unified exhaustive proceeding under Article 102.

(Para-48)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Few Constitutions have such a Preamble. Its amenability is rightly protected which can only be done by the people at a referendum. In Indian jurisdiction, the contention that Preamble should be regarded as ‘guiding star’ has been repelled (1950 S.C.R. 88(120, 198). Nor it has been regarded as a source of any substantive power (A.I.R.1960 (SC)845. [Para-501</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is needless to pursue the point further because it has been noticed already that in our Constitution the Preamble can only be altered by the People because our Constitution has proceeded from the people and it is not a rhetorical flourish. Our Constitution is not the result of the process of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 though we have taken inspiration from the wisdom of the past. Our is an ‘autochthonous’ Constitution.

As to the use of the preamble of a statute, it cannot be used to modify the language of the statute if it is clear, plain and unambiguous giving one and one meaning. But if the language is not clear and the words used therein indicate or are capable of bearing more than one meaning, then the meaning which is nearest to the purpose of the statute is to be preferred.

In a unitary State there can be more than one Appellate Court like the High Court, but both in a unitary and in a federal State there must be one Court having full plenary power over the whole State ...

Afzal, J(dissentin):</u></strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The question, however, is whether any other law’ in sub-article (2) of Article 7 would take in a law amending the Constitution itself enacted under the constituent power, in as much the same way as an ordinary law enacted under the ordinary legislative power. Mr. Ahmed contends that whether constituent or legislative, Parliament derives the power from the Constitution and in exercise of that power enacts an Act of Parliament in both cases and by definition, ‘law’ means any Act etc (Art. 152); therefore there is no reason why a law amending the Constitution should have any higher status and be not subjected to Art. 7 for examining its legitimacy as any other law. Mr. Ahmed has not referred to any authority in support of his proposition. It becomes difficult to agree with him having regard to the views expressed by Judges and jurists as to the position and quality of a law which is enacted under the constituent power of a Parliament even though it is a derivative power and further the position of constitutional law in relation to ordinary law made under ordinary legislative process.

When such a question is agitated before the Court, the Court is first to see the provisions of the law as well as the provisions of the Constitution. The nature of the proceeding and the purpose of the Act are to be considered to see the jurisdictional infirmity of the order complained. When the challenge is from an order of a Court Martial set up under the Army Act to enforce the military law, the jurisdiction to interfere is narrower that in the case of other Court or Tribunal. It is consistent not only with the maintenance of strict discipline demanded from the Defence Force, but also to the constitutional protection given to the laws relating to the disciplined force, and also their action from any challenge in the Court. The first protection is given under Article 45, and the second in Article 102(5). Under the former, the law is protected, and under the latter the action under the law is protected. Keeping all these factors in view, all that can be said is the ground on which a decision of a Court Martial set up under the Army Act can be ch1- lenged by habeas corpus position will be analogous to one available under sub-article (5) of Article 102 of the Constitution.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Jamil Huq V.

If the Court is constituted properly and the offence is cognizable then the proceedings of such a Court cannot be interfered on the ground of procedural irregularities. But the refusal of writ in no manner suggests the approval of the findings because they are essentially questions of fact which are exclusively within the jurisdiction of the trial and appellate Court and a writ Court will not interfere with the findings unless it can be shown that the accused had been convicted without any evidence at all. The writ jurisdiction will be attracted if the proceedings are coram non judice or malafide and the writ of habeas corpus will be available for securing release of the prisoner who has been committed by a Court Martial in such circumstances—Army Act. 1952; S. 133.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Jamil Huq Vs.

In other matters appeal will lie to the Appellate Division only when it grants leave to appeal. By practice this does not interfere with a finding of fact, more so with a concurrent finding of the High Court Division and the trial Court. It would not normally reappraise or review evidence or enter into the credibility of the evidence with a view to substitute its own opinion for that of the High Court Division or even when it strongly feels that a different view is possible. Interference by the Appellate Division is exceptional and that is why the provision for special leave. For promoting the cause of justice, for doing complete justice and for prevention of miscarriage of justice, the power of the Appellate Division is very wide, overriding, and exceptional and is not encumbered by any technicality. It, however, exercises this power sparingly and only in furtherance of the cause of justice, and in this regard, it is guided by its own practice and precedents, [Per M.H. Rahman, J.J</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abu Taher Chowdhury and others Vs.

The power has been conferred by the Constitution which also provides how the exercise of this power will be regulated. Article 105 provides that the Parliament may enact law as to how the power will be exercised or this Court may make rule for its exercise.So far, no Act of Parliament has been passed as mentioned in the Article, the Court has not framed any rule, but has adopted the rules which were made under similar provisions for review in the Constitution of Pakistan, 1962. In practice the Court also regards the provisions of Order 47 Rule I C.P.C. for the purpose of reviewing its judgment, though these provisions are not binding upon it. As a matter of practice and rule the Appellate Division proceeds to review a judgment pronounced earlier by it upon an application for review by an aggrieved party. Prior to hearing a review petition the Court has to be satisfied that grounds for review as mentioned in Order XXVIof the Rules of the Supreme Court exist. The power to review is derived from the Constitution and as such this power cannot be restricted in any manner whatsoever excepting by what has been provided in the Constitution itself. There is mention of an Act of Parliament and rules of the Court itself. Neither the Parliament nor the Court has up till now made any provision against exercising the power suo motu. Since the power to review has been conferred by the Constitution, nothing can, negative this power if the Court wants to exercise it of its own. The expression “doing complete justice” as occurs in Article 104 of the Constitution are of great significance. Their importance cannot be whittled down nor can the Court give up a fraction of this power. It is a great power with which the Court has been armed. For the reasons set forth above, it must be held that the Appellate Division has the power to review its judgment acting suo motu.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Mahbubur Rahman Sikder and others Vs.

Hossain, C.J:</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The Court’s mentioned in Article 109 is to be looked at in the context in which it has been used. The Court Martial set up under the Army Act is at best a military Tribunal and not a Court as contemplated under Article 109 of the Constitution. Article 114 only enables the Parliament to set up Courts with jurisdiction not equal or superior to the Supreme Court, and the word ‘subordinate’ has been used in this sense in this Article, neither in the Constitution, nor in any other law, this is any provisions to make a Court Martial set up under the Army Act subordinate to the High Court Division under Article 109.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per B.H. Chowdhury, J:</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is not correct to suggest that the Court Martial is a Court which is amenable to the supervisory or superintending jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Article 109 of the Constitution. These Courts, namely, the Courts Martial are creation of the Army Act and these are all ad-hoc Courts unlike the Courts as understood in the common parlance. These are ad-hoc Courts and they are convened as and when necessity arises. Thenecessary supervisory hierarchy has been created by the Army Act itself and both the Constitution and the law have cautiously kept those Courts out of the ambit of the civil Courts.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Jamil Huq Vs.

Admittedly the petitioner was not given any opportunity to show cause as required under Article 135(2) of the Constitution before taking the impugned action. Thus apparently the impugned notification appears to have been made in violation of the aforesaid Article. It has been argued by the learned Attorney General that since there was neither any post nor appointment as Professor of Medicine, the question of the petitioner’s removal does not arise. Although there was no sanctioned post of Professor of Medicine of IPGMR, by appointing the petitioner as Professor of Medicine in 1967 was the post was created and consequently the relationship of master and servant between the Government and the petitioner was established by such appointment and the petitioner continues to hold that post. Since admittedly, the petitioner never received any extra remuneration for the post. there does not appear any necessity of financial sanction; besides for creating a civil post, payment of remuneration is not an essential precondition.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Dr. Nurul Islam Vs.

Chowdhury, J:</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It does not need citation of any authority that the power to frame a Constitution is a primary power whereas a power to amend a rigid Constitution is a derivative power derived from the Constitution and subject at least to the limitation imposed by prescribed procedure. Secondly, laws made under a rigid Constitution, as also the amendment of such a Constitution can be ultra vires if they contravene the limitations put on the law making or amending power by the Constitution, for the Constitution is the touch stone of validity of the exercise of the powers conferred by it. But no provision of the Constitution can be ultra vires because there is no touch stone outside the Constitution by which the validity of a provision of the Constitution can be judged. [Para 145]</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The term amendment implies such an addition or change within the lines of the original instrument as will effect an improvement or better carry out the purpose for which it was formed. [Para 192]</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The people accepted the Constitution which is baptised by the blood of the martyrs. That Constitution promises ‘economic and social justice in a society in which ‘the rule of law, fundamental human right and freedom, equality and justice’ are assured and declared. Call it by any a name — basic feature or whatever but that is the fabric of the Constitution which cannot be dismantled by an authority created by the Constitution itself, namely, the Parliament. Necessarily, the amendment passed by the Parliament is to be tested as against Article 7. Because the amending power is but a power given by the Constitution to Parliament, it is a higher power than any other given by the Constitution to Parliament, but nevertheless it is a power within and not outside the Constitution. [Para 1951</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Now, some of the features are basic features of the Constitution and they are not amenable by the amending power of the Parliament. In the scheme of Article 7 and therefore of the Constitution the structural pillars of the Parliament and the Judiciary are basic and fundamental. It is inconceivable that by its amending power the Parliarment can deprive itself wholly or partly of the plenary legislative power over the entire Republic the Constitutional scheme if follow carefully reveals that these basic features are unamendable and unalterable [Para 255, 256].</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per S. Ahmed, J:</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">‘Amendment’ of a statute may have various meanings depending upon its context. Dictionary meaning of the word ‘amendment is change for the purpose of effecting improvement or removing any defect ... the word ‘amendment’ or ‘amend’ has been used in different places to mean different things; so it is the context by referring to which the actual meaning of the word ‘amendment’ can be ascertained. My conclusion is that the word ‘amendment’ is a change or alteration, for the purpose of bringing in improvement in the statute to make it more effective and meaningful, but it does not mean its abrogation or destruction or a change resulting in the loss of its original identity and character. In the case of amendment of a constitutional provision “amendment” should be that which accords with the intention of the makers of the Constitution. [Para 334, 336]</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Article 142, before it was amended by the First Amendment Act, 1973 provided that any provision of the Constitution ‘may be amended or repealed by an Act of Parliament’...It appears that by this amendment of Article 142 only the words ‘by way of addition, alteration, substitution or repeal’ have been brought in for the words ‘amended or repealed. There does not appear to be any substantial change and by this substitution only different kinds of amendments have been indicated. (Para 338)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">There is no dispute that the Constitution stands on certain fundamental principles which are its structural pillars and if those pillars are demolished or damaged the whole Constitutional edifice will fall down. It is by construing the Constitutional provisions that these pillars are to be identified. Implied limitation on the amending power is also to be gathered from the Constitution itself including its preamble ... Main objection to the doctrine of basic structure is that it is uncertain in nature and is based on unfounded fear. But in reality basic structures of the Constitution are clearly identifiable. ‘Sovereignty’ belongs to the people and it is a basic structure of the Constitution Supremacy of the Constitution, is the solemn expression of the people.. Democracy, Republican Government, ‘Unitary State, Separation of Powers, Independence of the Judiciary, Fundamental Rights are basic structures of the Constitution. There is no dispute about their identity. By amending the Constitution the Republic cannot be replaced by monarchy, democracy by oligarchy or the judiciary cannot be abolished, although there is no express bar to the amending power given in the Constitution. Principle of separation of powers means that the sovereign authority is equally distributed among the three organs and as such one organ can not destroy the others. These are the structural pillars of the Constitution and they stand beyond any change by amendatory process. (Para 376, 377).</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">..As to implied limitation on the amending power it is inherent in the word ‘amendment’ in Art. 142 and is also deducible from the entire scheme of the Constitution. Amendment of the Constitution means change or alteration for improvement or make it effective or meaningful and not - elimination or abrogation. Amendment is subject to the retention of the basic structures The Court therefore has power to undo amendment if it transgresses its limit and alters a basic structure of the Constitution. [Para 378]</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per M.H. Rahman, J:</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The people of Bangladesh adopted, en— acted and gave to themselves the Constitution pledging in clear terms in the preamble “that it shall be a fundamental aim of the State release through the democratic process a se cialist society, free from exploitation—a ciety in which the rule of law, fundament4 human rights and freedom, equality and justice, political, economic and social, will secured for all citizens” ... the Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978 made the Prea along with Articles 8, 48, 56, 5, 80, 92A entrenched provision in the Constitution The Preamble has become the touchstone I’ assaying the worth or the validity of amendment that may be passed in accord with clause (I) of Art. 142. When the Parliament cannot by itself amend the Preamble cannot indirectly by amending a provision the Constitution impair or destroy the fu mental aim of our society.(Para 388)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The provisions contained in Part VI the Supreme Court are not entrenched provisions and they can be amended by the leg lecture under Art. 142. But if any amendment causes any serious impairment of the of and the functions of the Supreme Court in makers of the Constitution devised as t kingpin for securing the rule of law to all ‘zens, then the validity of such an amendment will be examined on the touchstone of t Preamble. (Para 391)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The doctrine of basic structure is o growing point in the constitutional jurisprudence. It has developed in a climate w1 the executive, commanding an over majority in the legislature; pets snap amendment of the Constitution passed with any public opinion, without sending the Bill to any select committee and without giving sufficient time to the members of the Parliament for deliberation on the Bill for amendment. . .The doctrine of basic structure is a new one and appears to be an extension of the principle of judicial review... It may take some time before the doctrine of basic structure gets acceptance from the superior Courts of the countries where constitutionalism is prevailing. (Para 435, 438, 439)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per A.T.M. Afzal, J:</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">According to dictionary meaning, to “amend”, inter alia, means, to “free from faults”, correct, rectify. reform, make alteration, to repair. to better and surpass, For the purpose of this issue the word “amendment” will be understood in the sense of “alteration” as was understood by the majority judgment in Kessavananda’s case in regard to Parliament’s power to amend the basic structure and framework of the Constitution.(Para 529)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It will be seen, in the first place, that there is no substantive limitation on the power of the Parliament to amend any provision of the Constitution as may be found under Art. V of the Constitution of the USA... The limitation which is provided in Art. 142 relates only to procedure for amendment and not substantive in the sense that no article is beyond the purview of amendment. (Para 530)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sub-art. (I) shows that any provision of the Constitution may be amended by way of addition, alteration, substitution or repeal by Act of Parliament. Any provision evidently includes all provisions. The language is clear and suffers from no ambiguity. Any provision could not mean some provision. This clear language amply indicates the wide sweep and plenitude of power of the Parliament to amend any provision of the Constitution. It is difficult, therefore, to conceive, as contended by the appellants, that there are some provisions called “basic” which are not amenable to the amendatory process... It is significant that the article opens with a Non-obstante</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">used in a provision to indicate that, that provision should prevail despite any-thing to the contrary in the provision mentioned in such Non-obstante Clause... in the presence of such a clause in Art. 142, it is difficult to sustain the contention of the appellants that some provisions containing basic features are unamendable or that the amendment of any provision has to stand the test of validity under Art.7(Para 534,535)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The “basic feature” theory does not appeal to reason on two fundamental grounds. The first is that it is inconceivable that the makers of theConstitution had decided on all matters for all people of all ages without leaving any option to the future generation. Secondly, if it is right that they wanted the so- called “basic features” to be permanent features of the Constitution there was nothing to prevent them from making such a provision in the Constitution itself. On the other hand, it has been noticed that the makers placed no limitation whatsoever in the matter of amendment of the Constitution except providing for some special procedure in Art. 142. Further after the incorporation of sub-art. (IA) providing for a more difficult procedure of referendum in case of amendment of the provisions mentioned therein, the contention as to further essential features, becomes all the more difficult to accept. (Para 536)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">All the provisions of the Constitution are essential and no distinction can be made between essential and non-essential feature from the point of view of amendment unless the makers of the Constitution make it expressly clear in the Constitution itself. If the positive power of amendment of the Constitution in Art. 142 is restricted by raising the wall of essential feature, the clear intention of the Constitution-makers will be nullified and that would lead to destruction of the Constitution by paving the way for extra constitutional or revolutionary changes. (Para537)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The power to amend any provision of the Constitution by way of addition, alteration,</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Green Paper or White Paper, without eliciting Clause. A Non-obstante Clause is usuallysubstitution or repeal is found to be unlimited except as provided in Art. 142 itself. But there is a limitation inherent in the word “amend” or “amendment” which may be said to be a built-in limitation... Whatever meaning those words may bear, this, in my, opinion, cannot be disputed that they can never mean, to ‘destroy’ or ‘abrogate’,. It is significant that under Art.l42 any provision of the Constitution may be repealed but there is no conferment of power to repeal the Constitution itself as are to be found in the then Constitution of Pakistan of 1956 and the Constitution of Ceylon... Therefore in exercise of the power under Art. 142 the Constitution cannot be destroyed or abrogated. The destruction of the Constitution will be the result if any of its “structural pillars”, that is, the three organs of the Government. Executive, Legislature and Judiciary are destroyed. The result will also be the same if any of these organs is emasculated and castrated in such a manner as would make the Constitution unworkable.(Para 562)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Anwar Hossain Chowdhury Vs.

The High Court Division exercised plenary power for giving directions and orders to any person or authority including any person performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic irrespective of consideration of residence location. It exercises plenary power because I is the integral part of the Supreme Court Bangladesh.(Para 138)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The amended sub-article(5) has disri - structural balance that was carefully erec in Part VI of the Constitution:.. If sub-article (5) attempted to create two new sets of Courts by a device terming them as “permane Benches” and the “Bench at the permanei seat” then... the least that can be said is that is hit by Article 114 which enables the legislature for setting up subordinate Courts of law but such must not be of co-ordil3ate jurisdiction or compete with Article 44 Sub-article (5) has clearly destroyed the structural pill of the Constitution as given in Article 94 and thus has violated the mandate of the Constitution and further brought itself within the mischief of the provision in Article 7(2). (Para 139,140, 141)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Now this impugned amendment Act has violated directly two Articles, namely, Articles 102 and 44 and without amending expressly the other Articles of Chapter I and II of Part VI(Articles 94 to 116). it has disrupted the provisions in relation to the judiciary given in Article 94 because it has added some alien concept by way of introducing Permanent Benches” conferring specifically Jurisdiction, power and functions” of the High Court Division, thereby creating seven Courts in the name of permanent Benches. This has been done indirectly because it could not be done directly... It has disrupted the constitutional fabric of Article 102 by introducing territorial concept thereby creating innumerable difficulties and incongruities.

Thus the basic structural pillar, that is judiciary, has been destroyed and plenary judicial power of the Republic vested in the High Court Division has been taken away. (para 257)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The amended Article 100 is ultra vires because it has destroyed the essential limb of the judiciary, namely, of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh by setting up rival Courts to the High Court Division in the name of permanent Benches conferring full jurisdictions, powers and functions of the High Court Division.(Para 259)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per S. Ahmed,J:</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The concept of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh consisting of both the Appellate Division and’ the High Court Division is a unique one and it has been so devised as to keep the Supreme Court, the highest judicial organ of the State, in line with Article I which provides that “Bangladesh is a unitary, independent, sovereign Republic”. ..This integrated Supreme Court is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution, it cannot be damaged directly or indirectly.., the High Court Division as an integral part of the Supreme Court is headed by the Chief Justice of the country and its territorial jurisdiction is all over the Republic...The unitary character of the State has been reflected in the field of judiciary, one of the three State organs, by creating an integrated Supreme Court. Once this integrity is damaged, affected or broken, more High Courts than one are likely to be created either directly or indirectly under the garb of permanent Benches making them independent of each other. Creation of more permanent seats than one is not permissible if the Supreme Court is to continue as an integrated judicial organ of the State at the apex. (Para 361, 362)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Looking at the impugned Article and other relevant Articles, it is found that by the impugned Article the High Court Division has been denuded of its power and jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution over a large part of the country... Because of the territorial divisions for the jurisdiction of the Benches and the High Court Division in the permanent seat, which have no common authority over them all, writs issued by them will be limited in operation in their respective areas only. As to Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court Division, it cannot be assigned to any of the areas for the territorial waters do not belong to any district but belong to the Republic and in case the cause of action of a case under Admiralty jurisdiction arises in the territorial waters, none of the Benches and the High Court Division in the permanent seat shall have jurisdiction thereon. High Court Division’s power to transfer any case from one subordinate Court to another or to withdraw it to itself under Article 110 has been negative; at best this power now may be exercised by the six Benches and the High Court Division sitting in the permanent seat over their respective subordinate Courts. Similar is the case with superintendence and control over subordinate Courts under Article 109. As to the binding effect of judgment under Article 111, the judgment of one Bench or Court is not binding upon another Bench /Court and the Courts subordinate to it; as such conflicting decisions are quite likely. As to the Supreme Court as the only Court of record under Article 108, it is not clear how many such Courts of Records have now resulted from the amendment (f-. 27c)The High Court Division as an integral part of the Supreme Court has lost its original character as well as most of its territorial jurisdiction. Seven judicial bodies, by whatever name they are called, Benches or Courts, are, to all intents and purposes, independent Courts having no relation with each other except a thin link through the Chief Justice... The “High Court Division” sitting in the permanent seat is not the original High Court Division with jurisdiction over the whole of the Republic, it is a Court with limited territorial jurisdiction—that is, the jurisdiction over what is called the “residuary area” in clause(5) of the impugned Article…High Court Division as contemplated in the unlamented Article is no longer in existence and as such the Supreme Court, one of the basic structures of the Constitution, ha been badly damaged, if not destroyed altogether. (Para 378)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per M. H. Rahman, J:</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In part VI of the Constitution the scheme of the judiciary has been delineated. Art. 94 provides for the establishment of a Supreme Court comprising the Appellate Division and the High Court Division. The functions of the two Divisions are different, but the two together form the Supreme Court, a single Court, having plenary power over the whole Country. (Para 390)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">From the content and circumstances in which the amendment was made one may assume that its object was merely to provide a basis for setting up some permanent Benches</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is not clear why second half of clause (5) was not included in the Bill... The private member’s contribution was the last straw on the camel’s back. The High Court Division lost its resonance and its plenary jurisdiction was totally undermined. (Para 405)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In this case we are concerned with only one basic feature, the rule of law, marked out as one of the fundamental aims of our society in the Preamble. The validity of the impugned amendment may be examined, with or without resorting to the doctrine of basic feature, on the touchstone of the Preamble itself. (Para443) One of the fundamental aims of our society is to secure the rule of law for all citizens -l and in furtherance of that aim Part VI and other provisions were incorporated in the Constitution. Now by the impugned amendment that structure of rule of law has been badly impaired, and as a result the High Court Division has fallen into sixes and sevens—six at the seats of the permanent Benches and seven at the permanent seat of the Supreme Court. (Para 456)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The reasoning’s of the decisions reported in 17 DLR(SC) 384 and the two Allahabad cases, AIR 1972 All 200(F.B) and AIR 1977 488(F.B.) might have been a complete answer to the appellants’ contentions as to mutilations of the High Court Division’s power ‘ jurisdiction had there been no concept of con fining the High Court Division within the residual area as in Art. 100(5). Because of the last part of Clause (5), the High Court Division has been left high and dry. It has lost ñ valency as an integral limb of the Supreme Court... It has been faint-heartedly argued t1c the High Court Division sitting in the permanent seat shall have all kinds of areas of juris-4 diction that are not assigned to the permanent, Benches. This submission has got no force the term “area” has been mentioned in Article 100 three times always meaning a territorial area and the six notifications-shows that to areas are zilla areas. The term “area” cannot be extended to mean jurisdiction. (Para 474)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It appears that uncertainties loomed large even in the minds of the Judges not to speak of the minds of the lay public. The learned Attorney General’s remark that no difficulty will arise for any litigant if he gets prop legal advice is rather far fetching. I am, however, striking down the amendment not ground of uncertainties or irreconcilability of the existing provisions with the amended provisions as such but on the ground of the amendment’s irreconcilability with the rule of law, as envisaged in the Preamble, and in furtherance of which Arts 27, 31, 32, 44, 94 to I IA were particularly incorporated in the Constitution.

Afzal, J (dissenting):</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The entire argument on behalf of the appellants rests on an assumption... that by assigning the areas to the permanent Benches and leaving the residue to the High Court Division sitting at the permanent seat, the jurisdiction of the Judges sitting on those benches has been limited to the areas thus assigned (territorially limited) and as such they have ceased to be Judges of the High Court Division exercising plenary power through out the Republic as envisaged under the Constitution. If this assumption or interpretation is correct, I shall have no hesitation to accept the argument... that the High Court Division, a structural pillar of the Constitution, has ceased to exist and the impugned amendment has passed a sentence of death upon the Supreme Court... I have given full consideration to all the learned arguments. but I remain convinced that the assumption or interpretation made by them is wrong and not tenable in law. (Para572)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The plenary jurisdiction which is vested in the Judges of the High, Court Division under Arts. 101 and 102 has remained unaffected and the provisions of amended Art. 100, particularly that of sub-art. (5) read with Rule (4) of the impugned Rules merely provide for the places from where and the manner in which such jurisdiction is to be exercised. The limitation of territory under sub art. (5) is meant to operate not on the jurisdiction of the Court or of its Judges, but on the manner of its exercise. (Para 573)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">According to the appellants.. .Bangladesh has been parcelled out into seven mutually exclusive divisions by such assignment and the Judges sitting in these divisions are Judges of regional Courts with territorially limited jurisdiction. ..This view wills inevitably he in conflict with all the relevant articles of chapter 1 Part VI... It will be seen that sub-art. (5) read with Rule (4) amounts to no more than a statutory allocation of the category of cases arising from the respective areas to each of the permanent Benches and it does not in any manner limit or affect the plenary power of the Judges of these Benches as are vested in them as Judges of the High Court Division under the Constitution. (Para 577)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is clear that in matters of exercise of judicial power, the High Court Divisions has been treated separately in the Constitution and the impugned amendment is but only an extension of such treatment. What is important to remember is that no article of Chapter I has been amended (except 107(3) which is consequential) and is must be presumed that the integrity of the Supreme Court/High Court Division with its unlimited territorial jurisdiction has not been impaired the High Court Division has remained one as before and therefore the impugned amendment has to be construed in harmony with all other provisions of Chapter I.

Bangla- r desh, 1989 BLD(Spl)1</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Article — 142</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Clause (5) of the impugned Art. 100 has</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">been challenged on a number of grounds. One is that an essential legislative power, in this</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">case, the power of amendment of a constitutional provision, was delegatcd by the Parliament to the President to assign the area in relation to which each permanent Bench shall have jurisdiction. This power, it is contended, shall be exercised by the amending body, namely, the Parliament by following a special procedure and that clause (5) under which Parliament relinquished its power to the President is void. Learned Counsels for the appellants have cited a number of decisions in support of this contention. Of them decisions of the Privy Council in the two Canadian cases, “Attorney General of Nova Scotia (1951) SCR Canada 31, and the Initiative &amp; Referendum case, AIR 1919 PC 145:1919 AC 935—have been discussed in connection with the question as to implied limitation. In the former, the Canadian Legislature and the Nova Scotia (Provincial) Legislature proceeded to transfer their legislative powers to each other but the Privy Council ruled that such delegation of legislative powers was not permissible under the B.N.A. Act 1867. In the latter, a proposed Bill of the Legislature of Manitoba by which its legislative power was sought to be vested in a separate body was held invalid on the same ground. In Pakistan, the first case of such a nature is Sobho Gyan Chandani V. Crown PLD 1952 FC 29. In that case the Federal Legislature after promulgating the Public Safety Ordinance. 1949, delegated to the Government the power of extending its life year by year. This delegation of legislative power was held to be ultra vires and it was held that after the expiry of one year the Ordinance died its natural death. Similar views were taken by the Supreme Court in the case of F.Q. Chowdhury v. Abdul Huq, 18 DLR(SC)69 which has been discussed by me in an earlier paragraph. It appears that the essential legislative work under clause (5) is not the assignment of areas of jurisdiction for the Benches but what jurisdiction would he transfer to the Benches. This has been done by this clause and it has been provided that whatever jurisdiction, power and function the High Court Division got would be the power, function and jurisdiction of the Benches. This jurisdiction, power and function were given by the amending body itself and, the President was given authority to assign the area for each Bench the seat of which was also fixed by this body. Assignment of the area does not fall within the essential legislative power of the amending body. (Para-366) It is difficult to see how the principles enunciated in the aforesaid cases are applicable to the facts of the present case. It is well- settled that a legislature cannot part with its essential legislative function and invest another agency with the same but within the framework of the legislation it can entrust subordinate functions to other agencies. This will be clear from the quotation reproduced above from the judgment in the Initiative Referendum case. I have already found in connection with issue no III that sub-art. (5) neither limits the plenary jurisdiction of the High Court Division nor puts territorial limitation to the jurisdiction of the Judges sitting in the permanent Benches. I have also found that the assigning of area by the President read with Rule (4) of the Rules is meant only for regulating the manner of exercise of jurisdiction by the permanent Benches by allocation of cases arising from the respective assigned areas to the concerned Benches. The assigning of areas left to the Chief Executive is no part of the legislative function and it is only a ministerial act. It will be seen that similar power has been given to the Governor under Art. 198 of the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan for assigning the area in .relation to which each Benches shall exercise jurisdiction vested in the High Court. Sub-art. (5), therefore, cannot be said to be ultra vires. (Para 620)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>An war Flossain Chowdhurv Vs.

He has refuted the argument that inclusion of other subjects in the Bill had misled the legislators. It appears that the long title of the Bill was closely followed by a detailed statement as to the subject-matter of the Bill specifically naming the Articles of the Constitution which were proposed to be amended and in which manner. There is hardly anything to indicate that members of the Parliament were in confusion or misled as to the nature and scope of the Bill.

(Para 411)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The learned Attorney General without seriously disputing the procedural requirement for an amendment has submitted that the long title of the Bill contained clear indication as to the amendment of some provisions of the Constitution, and the omission of details in the long title of the Bill did not create any confusion in the minds of the legislature because the long title was immediately followed by clear statements as to the subject matters of the Bill and as to the articles of the Constitution that were proposed to be amended. Before us there is no affirmed statement, giving sufficient particulars, as to whether any member of the Parliament made any objection on the ground that he was confused because of the lack of details in the long title. Had the aggrieved person been a member of the Parliament then the matter would have al led for closer scrutiny. The purpose for the long title is to give a notice to the members of the Parliament and there is nothing on record m show that any member of the Parliament felt aggrieved or misled for the long title not being really a long one. Therefore, I reject the appellants’ objection as to the non compliance of procedural requirement in passing the impugned amendment.(Para 415)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Since the provisions of art. 142 provide for a special procedure for amendment of the Constitution itself there can be no doubt that the conditions of law-making” as described</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">by the Privy Council in the Bribery Commissioners case must be strictly complied with.

The argument that •the bill for amendment should be ‘a mono-provision’ bill has, therefore, no basis in the language of he relevant clause. Nor there is any basis fr the submission that the long title must mention expressly the articles sought to be amended. Neither the Bengali version nor the English version of clause (1) tothe proviso can be construed to mean that specific articles, are required to be mentioned in the long title. The learned Attorney-General has pointed out rightly that unlike the provision under art. 82(1) of the Ceylonese Constitution which requires the specific mention of the ‘provision’ to be amended in the long title of the bill, there is no such requirement in our provision. The requirement in our case only is that it must be mentioned in the long title that a provisions of the Constitution will be amended. In my opinion it will be sufficient compliance with law if it is expressly mentioned in the long title that a provision or certain provision of the Constitution will be amended. This reference to the Constitution in the long title of the bill will put the legislators on guard and they are expected to go through the bill to find out what are the provisions that are going to be amended under the bill.

The High Court Division further concurred with the finding of the trial Court that the plaintiffs failed to prove that defendants collusively created the impugned kabala. S. Ahmed, J upheld the decision of the High Court Division and F. Munim, J concurred with S. Ahmed, J. R. Islam, J held that the kabala was invalid for noncompliance of the requirement of section 4 and also held that the kabala was a product of conspiracy and fraud. B.H. Chowdhury, J did not render any opinion as to the necessity of complying with the provision of section 4, but held that the kabala was spurious.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per R. Islam, J</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In view of the certificate granted by the Special Bench under Article 58 of the Constitution and the order of the Supreme Court staying operation of the judgment and order of the Special Bench, I find it difficult to appreciate the view taken by the learned Judges of the High Court Division that section 4 having been declared ultra vires of the Con- situation, the requirement of production of prior permission from the competent authority was no longer required, and in the absence of such requirement of law validity of the impugned kabala was not lost.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The finality of the judgment of the Special Bench in Chittaranjan Sutar’s case was subject to the decision in the appeal preferred by the Government of East Pakistan on the basis of the certificate granted by the Special Bench under Art. 58 of the Constitution. Beside that the operation of the judgment and order of the Special Bench having been stayed by the Supreme Court on July 3, 1965, the declaration made in the judgment became ineffective. Consequently sections 4 and 6 of the Ordinance continued to be operative.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Since section 4 as substituted by Ordinance X of 1964 was declared ultra vires of the Constitution it means that section 4 (new) never came into existence This state in the statute brings in another consequence, that is the provision of law which was repealed or substituted by the statutory provision declared ultra vires, automatically became revived.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">When an amendatory provision proves unconstitutional, the amended provision stands wholly unaffected. That being the position section 4 as obtaining in Ordinance I of 1964 before its substitution by Ordinance X of’ 1964 remained unaffected, as if section 4 (old) continued to he operative.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Whatever restrictions the section (sec. 4 old) imposed on the registration of transfer deeds by the members of the minority .community could not be termed unreasonable as contemplated in the Thirteenth Fundamental Right. Section 4 (original) is harmless, and there is nothing in the section to be in conflict with the Fundamental Rights. Section 4 (new) has been rightly found by the Special Bench to have no relation to the object of the legislation, that Ordinance I of 1964 as promulgated on 12.2.1964, and it was in excess of the object and the prevailing circumstances did not warrant the restriction.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Chittaranjan Sutar V.

But to impose a legal restriction on transfer of their property for an indefinite period extending over years cannot be said to be the object of the Ordinance. Since sections 2 and 5 of the Ordinance could provide adequate remedy to the members of the minority community affected by the civil disturbance of January, 1964 legal restrictions on transfer of their property as contemplated in sections 4 and 6 of the Ordinance are found to be inconsistent with Fundamental Rights 13 and 15 are void abinitio and as such these sections did not revive when the Fundamental Rights were suspended. Nor were these sections re-enacted during the period when the Emergency continued.

Chowdhury,J (R. Islam. J concurring)</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Art.5(b) i.e in three parts, the first part deals with collaboration, the second part deals with the ideology of Pakistan, and the third part deals with the support of the elements inimical to the liberation struggle or creation of Bangladesh. Three definite concepts have been introduced in clause(b). It will be absurd that while collaboration will be offensive if it is performed in the exercise of powers or in the discharge of duties hut conduct or activities exhibiting support to the ideology of Pakistan ol. conduct in support to the elements inimical to the liberation struggle are to be performed in private capacity. The title of P.O. 67 of 1972 is “the Government of Bangladesh (Services Screening) Order” and the preamble shows that all the persons who are in the service of Bangladesh are within it and since the object of the enactment is to make the Government institution free from corrupt persons, collaborators, officials and other employees wedded to the ideology of Pakistan, all activities of such persons must be performed in the exercise of powers or in the discharge of duties.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Obaidullah Vs. Vice-Chancellor, University of Dacca.

Hossain, CJ (dissenting)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">These three clauses cover three kinds of conduct on the part of the officer concerned. First is that in the exercise of his power or, in discharge of his official duties, if he does any act which assists, aids or supports against the liberation struggle or creation of Bangladesh whereas the second clause is regarding conduct which celibates faith in and support to the ideology of Pakistan, and the third to the conduct which supports the elements inimical to the liberation struggle or creation of Bangladesh and in particular occupation forces of Pakistan. The second and third clauses, if read in the context of the first clause, clearly indicate that they are separate and distinct, inasmuch as the offence in the first clause could only be done as an officer in the discharge of his duties or exercise of power, whereas the offences in clauses two and three, the conduct manifested by the officer need not be in the discharge of his duties or exercise of hi powers. I, therefore find that the three clauses ye been used disjunctively and to cover three distinct categories of purposes. For the second and third clauses there is no need of exhibition of collaboration in the discharge of duty or exercise of power. But the act or conduct of an officer coming within the first clause, it is to be manifested either in the exercise of power or in the discharge duties. I am re-informed in reading the clauses disjunctively, because these the clauses are separated first by the word and secondly by the word ‘conduct’ at tl beginning of each of the three clauses. If they are read conjunctively then the word con— duct’ in second and third clauses become tautologies or superfluous. But if they are read disjunctively all the three clauses fit in grammatically and semantically For the pw pose the Article is directed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Registrar, University of Dacca Vs.

Such notification is included for other class of persons and can have no manner of application when it involves the question of assessment of the assessee who is a Judge of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. The reason is that the Constitution came into force on the 16th December, 1972 and the President’s Order No.21 of 1973 was promulgated in pursuance of paragraph 3 of the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution read with Article 147 which settled the terms and conditions of ser ice t the Judges of the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the terms and conditions of service of a Supreme Court Judge were sanctioned by constitutional provision and the P.O. 21 of 1973b having the backing of constitutional provision achieved the status of sub—constitutional legislation and such constitutional legislation cannot he displaced by notification in exercise of the powers confirmed by sub-section (1) of Section 60 of the Income Tax Act which is a statutory law but no notification under such law controls the sub-constitutional legislation.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>The Commissioner of Taxes Vs.

Munim, J:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Since neither the impugned provisions nor the Act nor the rules containing them provide any principle or guideline for the exercise of discretion by the Government when it proposes to retire a Government servant from amongst a group of government servants similarly situated and holding similar jobs, there invariably exists scope far arbitrary exercise of such discretion. What is of importance and consequence to the Government servant concerned, who is proposed to be retired, is that the discretion of the relevant authority must be seen to have been exercised on some such principles as are discernible in Fundamental Rule 56, Note 2, East Bengal .Service Rule and Rule 3 of the Bangladesh Public Servants Retirement Rules, 1973. Where such basis has been provided by the enunciation of such principles, whether under the Act or rules made under an Act or even in the note to such rules regarding the retirement of government servants, the concerned authority before exercising its discretion, has to conform to the principles so provided therein ... The omission of such basis in the Public Servants (Retirement) Rules, 1975 leaves scope to the concerned authority to arbitrarily retire a Government servant who has completed 25 years of service. The existence of such principles as are found in the Rules of 1973 would have provided a complete answer to any challenge to their constitutionality, inspite of the expression “without assigning any reason’ used in section 9(2) of the Act. In such a case the authority concerned would have remained free, so as not to disclose any reason in the retirement order, but if its action in retiring a Government servant was challenged as arbitrary, as has been done by the appellant in the present case, them authority could have disclosed before the Court the basis of its action.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per F. Munim, J:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The minimum principle or guideline as has been provided in service rules as appear from the cases cited in the judgment is that of public interest or the interest of public service. If either the impugned Act or the rules made there under provided such principle, the minimum requirement of law as showing the existence of some guideline for the exercise of discretion in retiring a Government servant, who has completed 25 years of service, would, be satisfied, thus making it immune from any challenge on the ground of d crimination violative of Arts. 27 and 29 of Constitution. In the absence of such a guide line either in the Act or the rules from there under, section 9(2) of Act XII of 19 suffers from unconstitutionality and the I pugned action based on it is open to the chalenge as being discriminatory and in violatof the equality provisions of the Constitution</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Ref: A.I.R.

Termination of service before his superannuation is undoubtedly removal if not termed as ‘dismissal’.. It is true that the (impugned) order does not contain any stigma, but the very fact that the appellant was selected out of a number of persons similarly placed, and consequently he has been deprived not only from continuing in the employment for the remaining period of his term of service but also from some of the service benefits accrued to him, makes out a case of punishment. In effect, whatever may be the phraseology used in terminating the service, it is punishment imposed on him, for it not only destroys his right to the post held by him, but also inevitably carries with it a stigma. Such a termination is ‘removal’ within the meaning of Article 135 of the Constitution. Therefore the statute or rule providing a mode of terminating service at the discretion of the authority without complying with impugned action having been taken against the appellant without issuing any notice upon him or giving him an opportunity of being heard before taking the impugned action, the impugned notification is violative of Article 1 35 of the Constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Ref: A.I.R.1958 (SC) 36; A.I.R. 1954 (SC) 369; A.I.R.1964 (SC) 600; A.I.R.1975 (SC) l487 —Cited.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per S.

Subject to these limitations, the discretion of the Government in such a matter is absolute.

The bank as per terms of the mortgage deed can fall upon the mortgaged property only when the primary security, namely the demand promissory note and deed of hypothecation fall short to satisfy the outstanding demand of the bank. In the face of clear recital in the deed in question I find it difficult to accept the contention of the appellant that the mortgage in this case falls under the category of primary or principal security. The deed as drawn up clearly falls in the category of collateral anxiliary in as much as some immovable properties are being offered as collateral or auxiliary or additional security for the vcash credit facility and the stamp duty is chargeable under clause (c) of Article 40.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per R. Islam J (dissenting)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The question involved in this case is whether the mortgage deed in question is a collateral security in relation to the security by way of the Demand Promissory note and the Deed of hypothecation, both the securities being in favour of the same lender and in respect of the same loan. Purpose of a collateral security is necessarily the same as that of a primary security i.e. repayment of loan. If a loan can be taken by executing a demand promissory note or a deed of hypothecation of goods as the only security, there is no reason why such documents cannot constitute a primary security when subsequent additional security is called for hold that the mortgage deed in question is a collateral/auxiliary security and chargeable under clause (c) of Article4O.

The object of the executor is to propound the will for the benefit of those who take the interest of the will. It is in substance not a personal action. In substance, probate means copy of the will certified under the seal of the Court of a competent jurisdiction that a grant of administration to the estate of the testator has been made. In the absence of any executor an universal or residuary legatee can apply for letters of administration and what the Court grants in such a case is also a copy of the will certified under the seal of the Court stating that the will is duly approved and an authority given to administer the estate of the deceased according to the direction. In either of the case the purpose of the grant is to administer the estate of the deceased according to the provision of the will. A plain reading of sections 102, 23 and 235 lead to the conclusion that the residuary legatee may also continue the proceeding and section 222 would not be an impediment to the continuation of the probate proceeding.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Khitindora Chandra Bhattacharya and another Vs.

Section 299 not only makes every order passed by a District Judge appealable to the High Court, but also makes the appeal to be in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, applicable to appeals.

Instead, he made au enquiry and attempted to evaluate the claim of each candidate which the High Court rightly described as arrogating to himself the functions of the civil Court. Such action on the part of the Administrator is not authorised by law. [Majority view : Per B.H.

The remarks are unfair. The Administrator, in discharging his functions is required to decide the question of succession. In such a case he is not required to refer the parties to the Civil Court for determination of competency to the mutwalliship—If in such a case the Administrator instead of deciding the question of succession as contemplated under section 51, passed an order under section 43 in favour of one of the two persons to act as Mutwalli for a specified period, and thereby driving the parties to the civil Court for adjudication, in that case, he would be failing in his duties as conferred under the Wakfs Ordinance, 1961.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>[Minority View : Per R.
