The co-operative society needs the acquired land—the need to state the precise public purpose in the body of the notice is imperative—If no specific public purpose is stated then the right given to object to the acquisition challenging the public purpose stated is rendered nugatory and illusory—Sinceno property acquired under the Ordinance shall be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it is acquired, without the prior approval of the Government, if the public purpose is left completely vague and unspecified, then this will give a handle to the requiring body to use the acquired property in any manner it deems fit.</p><p><strong><em>Sankar Gopal Chatterjee and others Vs.
