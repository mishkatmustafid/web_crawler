The resolution of the Board dated April 13, 1989, does not also show that these terms are volatile of any of the provisions of the Ordinance or detrimental to public interest.</p><p>The right to get approval to recognition is not an absolute one, but subject to approval of the Government. The Government may exercise such discretion either by according or withholding the approval.</p><p>The power conferred by section 12(I)(c) is strictly limited. The Government can no doubt ‘prohibit the doing of anything proposed to be done” by the Board, but it can do so only if it is of opinion that the doing of the act would not be in conformity with the provisions of the Ordinance or in any way against public interest.</p><p><strong><em>Dr. A.B.M.
