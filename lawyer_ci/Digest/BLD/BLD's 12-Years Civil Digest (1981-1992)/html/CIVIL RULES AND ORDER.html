On Rule 466(2) C.J. Choudhury, observed in the case reported in 15 DLR 99 as follows:</p><p>“This Rule contemplates that if, on the date fixed, any important order is passed this order is to be signed by the pleader and endeavor should be made to get the signature f the pleader. But if an order is passed on an off date, in a case not appearing in the cause or on a date not fixed for a case, it is still more incumbent on the Court to see that the order is communicated,”</p><p>An order of the Court affecting one of the pillars of the suit, namely place of trial, cannot be meant for communication to the Pleader Commission only—It was meant for communication to all the parties involved— Since the Court order was not communicated and the course of the suit took an adverse turn to the prejudice of the defendant behind his back and without his knowledge, the suit was rightly restored by the High Court Division.</p><p><strong><em>M.A. Wahab and another Vs.
