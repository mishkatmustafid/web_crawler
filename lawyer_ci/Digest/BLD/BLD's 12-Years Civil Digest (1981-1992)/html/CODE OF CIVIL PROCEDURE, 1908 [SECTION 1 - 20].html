Appeal lies only against those orders which are enumerated in Order 43 Rule I C.P.C. Section 96 C.P.C. provides for appeal against original decree. Revision lies against non-appealable orders. Previously revision against non- appealable order lay only in the High Court Division. In case of an appealable order passed by a Subordinate Judge, an appeal shall lie to the District Judge where the value of the original suit in which or in any proceeding arising out of which the order was made did not exceed Tk 20,000,00 and to the High Court in any other case. It cannot be conceived that a Court which cannot exercise jurisdiction over a matter in appeal was intended to exercise its revisional jurisdiction. It appears to be inconsistent with the scheme of the Code of Civil Procedure and Civil Courts Act to invest the District Judge with concurrent revisional jurisdiction in a matter here no appeal lies before the District Judge. Hitherto the District Judge had no revisional jurisdiction, only the High Court Division had revisional jurisdiction. Section 1 15(2) has invested the District Judge with rvisional jurisdiction. In the circumstances e contention of concurrent jurisdiction apars to be inconsistent. The District Judge’s revisional jurisdiction under section 115(2) is restricted by his appellate jurisdiction as provided under section 21(1) of the Civil Courts Act. In other words, the District Judge can exercise revisional jurisdiction under section 115(2) only in respect of those cases here the value of the subject-matter does not exceed Tk. 20,000.00. In all other cases, it is High Court Division which exercises restriction under section 115(1). Apart from section 115(3) the High Court Division, may under section 115(1) exercise its revisional jurisdiction in any case and its jurisdiction is not controlled by sub-section (2) of section 115. In the instant case the suit has been valued at Tk. 1, 00,000.00. For the reasons stated above in was held that the District Judge had no jurisdiction to entertain a revisional application under section 115(2) against the impugned order passed by the learned Subordinate Judge. The instant revisional application was found to be maintainable and competent—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Order 43 Rule 1—Civil Courts Act, 1887 LXII of 1887) Ss. 3, 6, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20 and 21.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Nurul Islam and others Vs.

The object of consolidation is to avoid multiplicity of litigations between the same parties whenever the matter in issue is substantially or directly the same. The High Court Division in appropriate cases should interfere with the order of the subordinate Court refusing to consolidate suits as the principle of consolidation in no way conflicts with the purpose of section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. On the contrary, it ‘preserves and promotes it. Certain meaning of statute must not be imputed to the legislature to create situation leading to an absurd result and offending against common sense. On the contrary, it is the duty of the judiciary to give, as far as possible, an interpretation of law which inspires confidence in all responsible manners.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The words, ‘shall not proceed occurring in any suit” in section 10 C.P.C. are intended to bar separate trial -of any suit in which the matter in issue was also directly and substantially in issue in the previously instituted suit by the same parties in the same Court. But those words do not apply to simultaneous hearing of later and earlier suits after consolidation of the two suits inasmuch as the matter in issue in both the suits being directly and substantially the same.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Rezaul Karim Vs.
