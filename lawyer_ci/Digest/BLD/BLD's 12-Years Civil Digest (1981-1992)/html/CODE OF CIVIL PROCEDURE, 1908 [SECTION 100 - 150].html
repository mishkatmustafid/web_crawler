It invests the High Court Division with wide power not only to go into the question of law but also to the question of fact, in search of fact and to make scrutiny and analyse and if necessary to assess evidence for itself for its own satisfaction, to see to what extent such failure of justice has been perpetrated.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The plaintiff must not make any departure from the earlier pleadings made in the plaint to bring into existence any new claim or raise any new ground or plea which are quite inconsistent, incongruous or a departure from the earlier stand or pleas. The Court will not allow either party from making any departure from the earlier pleadings set forth in the plaint or written statements. Plaint and written statement are the foundation of the claim of the plaintiff and the defendant; any deviation from the earlier stand would surely land the other side into serious dislocation and by Order 6 Rule 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the same has been prohibited.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Bangladesh Vs.

If it is assumed that the power of the Court to review its judgment under the Code of Civil Procedure would be applicable in an application under Article 102 of the Constitution only when such application involves civil disputes between the parties in question, in such circumstances, it would lead to compartmentalizing the discretionary prerogatives and extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court under one specific provision of Article 102 of the Constitution, which could not be intended by the founding framers of the Constitution. The proceeding under Article 102 must be taken as a self-explanatory, self-contained, complete single proceeding which might be civil or criminal in nature involving constitutional or administrative issues from time to time. When a proceeding under Article 102 has no permanent and over-all bearing of a civil pro- ceding, any particular case from such proceeding which involves civil disputes cannot be selected for the purpose of invoking the powers under the Code of Civil Procedure to review judgments and orders.

If a proceeding involves the assertion or enforcement of a civil right, it is a civil proceeding. The provisions of the Code, other than the specially excepted ones, shall apply in the exercise of the High Courts jurisdiction in a civil matter, whatever may be the nature of that jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Civil proceeding is a process for recovery of individual right or redress of individual wrong, inclusive, in its proper legal sense, of suits by the Crown. Whether a proceeding is civil or not depends on the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding and its object, and not on the mode adopted or the forum provided for the enforcement of the right. A proceeding which deals with a right of a civil nature does not cease to be so merely because the right is sought to be enforced by having recourse to the writ jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Khapaiz Bittahini Co-operative Society Ltd.
