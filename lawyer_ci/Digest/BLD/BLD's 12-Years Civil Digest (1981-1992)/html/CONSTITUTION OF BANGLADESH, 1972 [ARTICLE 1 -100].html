(Para-48)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Few Constitutions have such a Preamble. Its amenability is rightly protected which can only be done by the people at a referendum. In Indian jurisdiction, the contention that Preamble should be regarded as ‘guiding star’ has been repelled (1950 S.C.R. 88(120, 198). Nor it has been regarded as a source of any substantive power (A.I.R.1960 (SC)845. [Para-501</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is needless to pursue the point further because it has been noticed already that in our Constitution the Preamble can only be altered by the People because our Constitution has proceeded from the people and it is not a rhetorical flourish. Our Constitution is not the result of the process of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 though we have taken inspiration from the wisdom of the past. Our is an ‘autochthonous’ Constitution.

Ahmed, J:</span></strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">There is no dispute that the Preamble is a part of the Constitution. As to the use of the preamble of a statute, it cannot be used to modify the language of the statute if it is clear, plain and unambiguous giving one and one meaning. But if the language is not clear and the words used therein indicate or are capable of bearing more than one meaning, then the meaning which is nearest to the purpose of the statute is to be preferred.

In a unitary State there can be more than one Appellate Court like the High Court, but both in a unitary and in a federal State there must be one Court having full plenary power over the whole State ... Our founding fathers devised a composite Supreme court to emphasise the oneness of the country.

(Para— 340)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">An amendment of the Constitution is not included in law within the meaning of Article 7 in the same way as it is not law in Article 26.

(Para — 423)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><u>Per A.T.M. Afzal, J(dissentin):</u></strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The question, however, is whether any other law’ in sub-article (2) of Article 7 would take in a law amending the Constitution itself enacted under the constituent power, in as much the same way as an ordinary law enacted under the ordinary legislative power. Mr. Ahmed contends that whether constituent or legislative, Parliament derives the power from the Constitution and in exercise of that power enacts an Act of Parliament in both cases and by definition, ‘law’ means any Act etc (Art. 152); therefore there is no reason why a law amending the Constitution should have any higher status and be not subjected to Art. 7 for examining its legitimacy as any other law. Mr. Ahmed has not referred to any authority in support of his proposition. It becomes difficult to agree with him having regard to the views expressed by Judges and jurists as to the position and quality of a law which is enacted under the constituent power of a Parliament even though it is a derivative power and further the position of constitutional law in relation to ordinary law made under ordinary legislative process.
