When such a question is agitated before the Court, the Court is first to see the provisions of the law as well as the provisions of the Constitution. The nature of the proceeding and the purpose of the Act are to be considered to see the jurisdictional infirmity of the order complained. When the challenge is from an order of a Court Martial set up under the Army Act to enforce the military law, the jurisdiction to interfere is narrower that in the case of other Court or Tribunal. It is consistent not only with the maintenance of strict discipline demanded from the Defence Force, but also to the constitutional protection given to the laws relating to the disciplined force, and also their action from any challenge in the Court. The first protection is given under Article 45, and the second in Article 102(5). Under the former, the law is protected, and under the latter the action under the law is protected. Keeping all these factors in view, all that can be said is the ground on which a decision of a Court Martial set up under the Army Act can be ch1- lenged by habeas corpus position will be analogous to one available under sub-article (5) of Article 102 of the Constitution.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Jamil Huq V.

If the Court is constituted properly and the offence is cognizable then the proceedings of such a Court cannot be interfered on the ground of procedural irregularities. But the refusal of writ in no manner suggests the approval of the findings because they are essentially questions of fact which are exclusively within the jurisdiction of the trial and appellate Court and a writ Court will not interfere with the findings unless it can be shown that the accused had been convicted without any evidence at all. The writ jurisdiction will be attracted if the proceedings are coram non judice or malafide and the writ of habeas corpus will be available for securing release of the prisoner who has been committed by a Court Martial in such circumstances—Army Act. 1952; S. 133.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Jamil Huq Vs.

In other matters appeal will lie to the Appellate Division only when it grants leave to appeal. By practice this does not interfere with a finding of fact, more so with a concurrent finding of the High Court Division and the trial Court. It would not normally reappraise or review evidence or enter into the credibility of the evidence with a view to substitute its own opinion for that of the High Court Division or even when it strongly feels that a different view is possible. Interference by the Appellate Division is exceptional and that is why the provision for special leave. For promoting the cause of justice, for doing complete justice and for prevention of miscarriage of justice, the power of the Appellate Division is very wide, overriding, and exceptional and is not encumbered by any technicality. It, however, exercises this power sparingly and only in furtherance of the cause of justice, and in this regard, it is guided by its own practice and precedents, [Per M.H. Rahman, J.J</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abu Taher Chowdhury and others Vs.

The power has been conferred by the Constitution which also provides how the exercise of this power will be regulated. Article 105 provides that the Parliament may enact law as to how the power will be exercised or this Court may make rule for its exercise.So far, no Act of Parliament has been passed as mentioned in the Article, the Court has not framed any rule, but has adopted the rules which were made under similar provisions for review in the Constitution of Pakistan, 1962. In practice the Court also regards the provisions of Order 47 Rule I C.P.C. for the purpose of reviewing its judgment, though these provisions are not binding upon it. As a matter of practice and rule the Appellate Division proceeds to review a judgment pronounced earlier by it upon an application for review by an aggrieved party. Prior to hearing a review petition the Court has to be satisfied that grounds for review as mentioned in Order XXVIof the Rules of the Supreme Court exist. The power to review is derived from the Constitution and as such this power cannot be restricted in any manner whatsoever excepting by what has been provided in the Constitution itself. There is mention of an Act of Parliament and rules of the Court itself. Neither the Parliament nor the Court has up till now made any provision against exercising the power suo motu. Since the power to review has been conferred by the Constitution, nothing can, negative this power if the Court wants to exercise it of its own. The expression “doing complete justice” as occurs in Article 104 of the Constitution are of great significance. Their importance cannot be whittled down nor can the Court give up a fraction of this power. It is a great power with which the Court has been armed. For the reasons set forth above, it must be held that the Appellate Division has the power to review its judgment acting suo motu.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Mahbubur Rahman Sikder and others Vs.

Hossain, C.J:</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The Court’s mentioned in Article 109 is to be looked at in the context in which it has been used. The Court Martial set up under the Army Act is at best a military Tribunal and not a Court as contemplated under Article 109 of the Constitution. Article 114 only enables the Parliament to set up Courts with jurisdiction not equal or superior to the Supreme Court, and the word ‘subordinate’ has been used in this sense in this Article, neither in the Constitution, nor in any other law, this is any provisions to make a Court Martial set up under the Army Act subordinate to the High Court Division under Article 109.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per B.H.

These Courts, namely, the Courts Martial are creation of the Army Act and these are all ad-hoc Courts unlike the Courts as understood in the common parlance. These are ad-hoc Courts and they are convened as and when necessity arises. Thenecessary supervisory hierarchy has been created by the Army Act itself and both the Constitution and the law have cautiously kept those Courts out of the ambit of the civil Courts.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Jamil Huq Vs.
