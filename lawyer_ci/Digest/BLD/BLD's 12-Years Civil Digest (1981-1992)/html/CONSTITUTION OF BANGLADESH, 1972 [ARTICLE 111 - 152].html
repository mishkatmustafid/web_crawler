Admittedly the petitioner was not given any opportunity to show cause as required under Article 135(2) of the Constitution before taking the impugned action. Thus apparently the impugned notification appears to have been made in violation of the aforesaid Article. It has been argued by the learned Attorney General that since there was neither any post nor appointment as Professor of Medicine, the question of the petitioner’s removal does not arise. Although there was no sanctioned post of Professor of Medicine of IPGMR, by appointing the petitioner as Professor of Medicine in 1967 was the post was created and consequently the relationship of master and servant between the Government and the petitioner was established by such appointment and the petitioner continues to hold that post. Since admittedly, the petitioner never received any extra remuneration for the post. there does not appear any necessity of financial sanction; besides for creating a civil post, payment of remuneration is not an essential precondition.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Dr. Nurul Islam Vs.

Chowdhury, J:</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It does not need citation of any authority that the power to frame a Constitution is a primary power whereas a power to amend a rigid Constitution is a derivative power derived from the Constitution and subject at least to the limitation imposed by prescribed procedure. Secondly, laws made under a rigid Constitution, as also the amendment of such a Constitution can be ultra vires if they contravene the limitations put on the law making or amending power by the Constitution, for the Constitution is the touch stone of validity of the exercise of the powers conferred by it. But no provision of the Constitution can be ultra vires because there is no touch stone outside the Constitution by which the validity of a provision of the Constitution can be judged. [Para 145]</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The term amendment implies such an addition or change within the lines of the original instrument as will effect an improvement or better carry out the purpose for which it was formed. [Para 192]</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The people accepted the Constitution which is baptised by the blood of the martyrs. That Constitution promises ‘economic and social justice in a society in which ‘the rule of law, fundamental human right and freedom, equality and justice’ are assured and declared. Call it by any a name — basic feature or whatever but that is the fabric of the Constitution which cannot be dismantled by an authority created by the Constitution itself, namely, the Parliament. Necessarily, the amendment passed by the Parliament is to be tested as against Article 7. Because the amending power is but a power given by the Constitution to Parliament, it is a higher power than any other given by the Constitution to Parliament, but nevertheless it is a power within and not outside the Constitution. [Para 1951</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Now, some of the features are basic features of the Constitution and they are not amenable by the amending power of the Parliament. In the scheme of Article 7 and therefore of the Constitution the structural pillars of the Parliament and the Judiciary are basic and fundamental. It is inconceivable that by its amending power the Parliarment can deprive itself wholly or partly of the plenary legislative power over the entire Republic the Constitutional scheme if follow carefully reveals that these basic features are unamendable and unalterable [Para 255, 256].</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per S. Ahmed, J:</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">‘Amendment’ of a statute may have various meanings depending upon its context. Dictionary meaning of the word ‘amendment is change for the purpose of effecting improvement or removing any defect ... the word ‘amendment’ or ‘amend’ has been used in different places to mean different things; so it is the context by referring to which the actual meaning of the word ‘amendment’ can be ascertained. My conclusion is that the word ‘amendment’ is a change or alteration, for the purpose of bringing in improvement in the statute to make it more effective and meaningful, but it does not mean its abrogation or destruction or a change resulting in the loss of its original identity and character. In the case of amendment of a constitutional provision “amendment” should be that which accords with the intention of the makers of the Constitution. [Para 334, 336]</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Article 142, before it was amended by the First Amendment Act, 1973 provided that any provision of the Constitution ‘may be amended or repealed by an Act of Parliament’...It appears that by this amendment of Article 142 only the words ‘by way of addition, alteration, substitution or repeal’ have been brought in for the words ‘amended or repealed. There does not appear to be any substantial change and by this substitution only different kinds of amendments have been indicated. (Para 338)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">There is no dispute that the Constitution stands on certain fundamental principles which are its structural pillars and if those pillars are demolished or damaged the whole Constitutional edifice will fall down. It is by construing the Constitutional provisions that these pillars are to be identified. Implied limitation on the amending power is also to be gathered from the Constitution itself including its preamble ... Main objection to the doctrine of basic structure is that it is uncertain in nature and is based on unfounded fear. But in reality basic structures of the Constitution are clearly identifiable. ‘Sovereignty’ belongs to the people and it is a basic structure of the Constitution Supremacy of the Constitution, is the solemn expression of the people.. Democracy, Republican Government, ‘Unitary State, Separation of Powers, Independence of the Judiciary, Fundamental Rights are basic structures of the Constitution. There is no dispute about their identity. By amending the Constitution the Republic cannot be replaced by monarchy, democracy by oligarchy or the judiciary cannot be abolished, although there is no express bar to the amending power given in the Constitution. Principle of separation of powers means that the sovereign authority is equally distributed among the three organs and as such one organ can not destroy the others. These are the structural pillars of the Constitution and they stand beyond any change by amendatory process. (Para 376, 377).</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">..As to implied limitation on the amending power it is inherent in the word ‘amendment’ in Art. 142 and is also deducible from the entire scheme of the Constitution. Amendment of the Constitution means change or alteration for improvement or make it effective or meaningful and not - elimination or abrogation. Amendment is subject to the retention of the basic structures The Court therefore has power to undo amendment if it transgresses its limit and alters a basic structure of the Constitution. [Para 378]</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per M.H. Rahman, J:</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The people of Bangladesh adopted, en— acted and gave to themselves the Constitution pledging in clear terms in the preamble “that it shall be a fundamental aim of the State release through the democratic process a se cialist society, free from exploitation—a ciety in which the rule of law, fundament4 human rights and freedom, equality and justice, political, economic and social, will secured for all citizens” ... the Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978 made the Prea along with Articles 8, 48, 56, 5, 80, 92A entrenched provision in the Constitution The Preamble has become the touchstone I’ assaying the worth or the validity of amendment that may be passed in accord with clause (I) of Art. 142. When the Parliament cannot by itself amend the Preamble cannot indirectly by amending a provision the Constitution impair or destroy the fu mental aim of our society.(Para 388)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The provisions contained in Part VI the Supreme Court are not entrenched provisions and they can be amended by the leg lecture under Art. 142. But if any amendment causes any serious impairment of the of and the functions of the Supreme Court in makers of the Constitution devised as t kingpin for securing the rule of law to all ‘zens, then the validity of such an amendment will be examined on the touchstone of t Preamble. (Para 391)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The doctrine of basic structure is o growing point in the constitutional jurisprudence. It has developed in a climate w1 the executive, commanding an over majority in the legislature; pets snap amendment of the Constitution passed with any public opinion, without sending the Bill to any select committee and without giving sufficient time to the members of the Parliament for deliberation on the Bill for amendment. . .The doctrine of basic structure is a new one and appears to be an extension of the principle of judicial review... It may take some time before the doctrine of basic structure gets acceptance from the superior Courts of the countries where constitutionalism is prevailing. (Para 435, 438, 439)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per A.T.M. Afzal, J:</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">According to dictionary meaning, to “amend”, inter alia, means, to “free from faults”, correct, rectify. reform, make alteration, to repair. to better and surpass, For the purpose of this issue the word “amendment” will be understood in the sense of “alteration” as was understood by the majority judgment in Kessavananda’s case in regard to Parliament’s power to amend the basic structure and framework of the Constitution.(Para 529)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It will be seen, in the first place, that there is no substantive limitation on the power of the Parliament to amend any provision of the Constitution as may be found under Art. V of the Constitution of the USA... The limitation which is provided in Art. 142 relates only to procedure for amendment and not substantive in the sense that no article is beyond the purview of amendment. (Para 530)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sub-art. (I) shows that any provision of the Constitution may be amended by way of addition, alteration, substitution or repeal by Act of Parliament. Any provision evidently includes all provisions. The language is clear and suffers from no ambiguity. Any provision could not mean some provision. This clear language amply indicates the wide sweep and plenitude of power of the Parliament to amend any provision of the Constitution. It is difficult, therefore, to conceive, as contended by the appellants, that there are some provisions called “basic” which are not amenable to the amendatory process... It is significant that the article opens with a Non-obstante</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">used in a provision to indicate that, that provision should prevail despite any-thing to the contrary in the provision mentioned in such Non-obstante Clause... in the presence of such a clause in Art. 142, it is difficult to sustain the contention of the appellants that some provisions containing basic features are unamendable or that the amendment of any provision has to stand the test of validity under Art.7(Para 534,535)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The “basic feature” theory does not appeal to reason on two fundamental grounds. The first is that it is inconceivable that the makers of theConstitution had decided on all matters for all people of all ages without leaving any option to the future generation. Secondly, if it is right that they wanted the so- called “basic features” to be permanent features of the Constitution there was nothing to prevent them from making such a provision in the Constitution itself. On the other hand, it has been noticed that the makers placed no limitation whatsoever in the matter of amendment of the Constitution except providing for some special procedure in Art. 142. Further after the incorporation of sub-art. (IA) providing for a more difficult procedure of referendum in case of amendment of the provisions mentioned therein, the contention as to further essential features, becomes all the more difficult to accept. (Para 536)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">All the provisions of the Constitution are essential and no distinction can be made between essential and non-essential feature from the point of view of amendment unless the makers of the Constitution make it expressly clear in the Constitution itself. If the positive power of amendment of the Constitution in Art. 142 is restricted by raising the wall of essential feature, the clear intention of the Constitution-makers will be nullified and that would lead to destruction of the Constitution by paving the way for extra constitutional or revolutionary changes. (Para537)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The power to amend any provision of the Constitution by way of addition, alteration,</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Green Paper or White Paper, without eliciting Clause. A Non-obstante Clause is usuallysubstitution or repeal is found to be unlimited except as provided in Art. 142 itself. But there is a limitation inherent in the word “amend” or “amendment” which may be said to be a built-in limitation... Whatever meaning those words may bear, this, in my, opinion, cannot be disputed that they can never mean, to ‘destroy’ or ‘abrogate’,. It is significant that under Art.l42 any provision of the Constitution may be repealed but there is no conferment of power to repeal the Constitution itself as are to be found in the then Constitution of Pakistan of 1956 and the Constitution of Ceylon... Therefore in exercise of the power under Art. 142 the Constitution cannot be destroyed or abrogated. The destruction of the Constitution will be the result if any of its “structural pillars”, that is, the three organs of the Government. Executive, Legislature and Judiciary are destroyed. The result will also be the same if any of these organs is emasculated and castrated in such a manner as would make the Constitution unworkable.(Para 562)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Anwar Hossain Chowdhury Vs.

If sub-article (5) attempted to create two new sets of Courts by a device terming them as “permane Benches” and the “Bench at the permanei seat” then... the least that can be said is that is hit by Article 114 which enables the legislature for setting up subordinate Courts of law but such must not be of co-ordil3ate jurisdiction or compete with Article 44 Sub-article (5) has clearly destroyed the structural pill of the Constitution as given in Article 94 and thus has violated the mandate of the Constitution and further brought itself within the mischief of the provision in Article 7(2).

This has been done indirectly because it could not be done directly... It has disrupted the constitutional fabric of Article 102 by introducing territorial concept thereby creating innumerable difficulties and incongruities.

(para 257)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The amended Article 100 is ultra vires because it has destroyed the essential limb of the judiciary, namely, of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh by setting up rival Courts to the High Court Division in the name of permanent Benches conferring full jurisdictions, powers and functions of the High Court Division.(Para 259)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per S. Ahmed,J:</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The concept of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh consisting of both the Appellate Division and’ the High Court Division is a unique one and it has been so devised as to keep the Supreme Court, the highest judicial organ of the State, in line with Article I which provides that “Bangladesh is a unitary, independent, sovereign Republic”. ..This integrated Supreme Court is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution, it cannot be damaged directly or indirectly.., the High Court Division as an integral part of the Supreme Court is headed by the Chief Justice of the country and its territorial jurisdiction is all over the Republic...The unitary character of the State has been reflected in the field of judiciary, one of the three State organs, by creating an integrated Supreme Court. Once this integrity is damaged, affected or broken, more High Courts than one are likely to be created either directly or indirectly under the garb of permanent Benches making them independent of each other. Creation of more permanent seats than one is not permissible if the Supreme Court is to continue as an integrated judicial organ of the State at the apex. (Para 361, 362)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Looking at the impugned Article and other relevant Articles, it is found that by the impugned Article the High Court Division has been denuded of its power and jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution over a large part of the country... Because of the territorial divisions for the jurisdiction of the Benches and the High Court Division in the permanent seat, which have no common authority over them all, writs issued by them will be limited in operation in their respective areas only. As to Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court Division, it cannot be assigned to any of the areas for the territorial waters do not belong to any district but belong to the Republic and in case the cause of action of a case under Admiralty jurisdiction arises in the territorial waters, none of the Benches and the High Court Division in the permanent seat shall have jurisdiction thereon. High Court Division’s power to transfer any case from one subordinate Court to another or to withdraw it to itself under Article 110 has been negative; at best this power now may be exercised by the six Benches and the High Court Division sitting in the permanent seat over their respective subordinate Courts. Similar is the case with superintendence and control over subordinate Courts under Article 109. As to the binding effect of judgment under Article 111, the judgment of one Bench or Court is not binding upon another Bench /Court and the Courts subordinate to it; as such conflicting decisions are quite likely. As to the Supreme Court as the only Court of record under Article 108, it is not clear how many such Courts of Records have now resulted from the amendment (f-. 27c)The High Court Division as an integral part of the Supreme Court has lost its original character as well as most of its territorial jurisdiction. Seven judicial bodies, by whatever name they are called, Benches or Courts, are, to all intents and purposes, independent Courts having no relation with each other except a thin link through the Chief Justice... The “High Court Division” sitting in the permanent seat is not the original High Court Division with jurisdiction over the whole of the Republic, it is a Court with limited territorial jurisdiction—that is, the jurisdiction over what is called the “residuary area” in clause(5) of the impugned Article…High Court Division as contemplated in the unlamented Article is no longer in existence and as such the Supreme Court, one of the basic structures of the Constitution, ha been badly damaged, if not destroyed altogether. (Para 378)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per M. H. Rahman, J:</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In part VI of the Constitution the scheme of the judiciary has been delineated. Art. 94 provides for the establishment of a Supreme Court comprising the Appellate Division and the High Court Division. The functions of the two Divisions are different, but the two together form the Supreme Court, a single Court, having plenary power over the whole Country. (Para 390)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">From the content and circumstances in which the amendment was made one may assume that its object was merely to provide a basis for setting up some permanent Benches</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is not clear why second half of clause (5) was not included in the Bill... The private member’s contribution was the last straw on the camel’s back. The High Court Division lost its resonance and its plenary jurisdiction was totally undermined. (Para 405)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In this case we are concerned with only one basic feature, the rule of law, marked out as one of the fundamental aims of our society in the Preamble. The validity of the impugned amendment may be examined, with or without resorting to the doctrine of basic feature, on the touchstone of the Preamble itself. (Para443) One of the fundamental aims of our society is to secure the rule of law for all citizens -l and in furtherance of that aim Part VI and other provisions were incorporated in the Constitution. Now by the impugned amendment that structure of rule of law has been badly impaired, and as a result the High Court Division has fallen into sixes and sevens—six at the seats of the permanent Benches and seven at the permanent seat of the Supreme Court. (Para 456)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The reasoning’s of the decisions reported in 17 DLR(SC) 384 and the two Allahabad cases, AIR 1972 All 200(F.B) and AIR 1977 488(F.B.) might have been a complete answer to the appellants’ contentions as to mutilations of the High Court Division’s power ‘ jurisdiction had there been no concept of con fining the High Court Division within the residual area as in Art. 100(5). Because of the last part of Clause (5), the High Court Division has been left high and dry. It has lost ñ valency as an integral limb of the Supreme Court... It has been faint-heartedly argued t1c the High Court Division sitting in the permanent seat shall have all kinds of areas of juris-4 diction that are not assigned to the permanent, Benches. This submission has got no force the term “area” has been mentioned in Article 100 three times always meaning a territorial area and the six notifications-shows that to areas are zilla areas. The term “area” cannot be extended to mean jurisdiction. (Para 474)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It appears that uncertainties loomed large even in the minds of the Judges not to speak of the minds of the lay public. The learned Attorney General’s remark that no difficulty will arise for any litigant if he gets prop legal advice is rather far fetching. I am, however, striking down the amendment not ground of uncertainties or irreconcilability of the existing provisions with the amended provisions as such but on the ground of the amendment’s irreconcilability with the rule of law, as envisaged in the Preamble, and in furtherance of which Arts 27, 31, 32, 44, 94 to I IA were particularly incorporated in the Constitution.

Afzal, J (dissenting):</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The entire argument on behalf of the appellants rests on an assumption... that by assigning the areas to the permanent Benches and leaving the residue to the High Court Division sitting at the permanent seat, the jurisdiction of the Judges sitting on those benches has been limited to the areas thus assigned (territorially limited) and as such they have ceased to be Judges of the High Court Division exercising plenary power through out the Republic as envisaged under the Constitution. If this assumption or interpretation is correct, I shall have no hesitation to accept the argument... that the High Court Division, a structural pillar of the Constitution, has ceased to exist and the impugned amendment has passed a sentence of death upon the Supreme Court... I have given full consideration to all the learned arguments. but I remain convinced that the assumption or interpretation made by them is wrong and not tenable in law. (Para572)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The plenary jurisdiction which is vested in the Judges of the High, Court Division under Arts. 101 and 102 has remained unaffected and the provisions of amended Art. 100, particularly that of sub-art. (5) read with Rule (4) of the impugned Rules merely provide for the places from where and the manner in which such jurisdiction is to be exercised. The limitation of territory under sub art. (5) is meant to operate not on the jurisdiction of the Court or of its Judges, but on the manner of its exercise. (Para 573)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">According to the appellants.. .Bangladesh has been parcelled out into seven mutually exclusive divisions by such assignment and the Judges sitting in these divisions are Judges of regional Courts with territorially limited jurisdiction. ..This view wills inevitably he in conflict with all the relevant articles of chapter 1 Part VI... It will be seen that sub-art. (5) read with Rule (4) amounts to no more than a statutory allocation of the category of cases arising from the respective areas to each of the permanent Benches and it does not in any manner limit or affect the plenary power of the Judges of these Benches as are vested in them as Judges of the High Court Division under the Constitution. (Para 577)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is clear that in matters of exercise of judicial power, the High Court Divisions has been treated separately in the Constitution and the impugned amendment is but only an extension of such treatment. What is important to remember is that no article of Chapter I has been amended (except 107(3) which is consequential) and is must be presumed that the integrity of the Supreme Court/High Court Division with its unlimited territorial jurisdiction has not been impaired the High Court Division has remained one as before and therefore the impugned amendment has to be construed in harmony with all other provisions of Chapter I.

One is that an essential legislative power, in this</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">case, the power of amendment of a constitutional provision, was delegatcd by the Parliament to the President to assign the area in relation to which each permanent Bench shall have jurisdiction. This power, it is contended, shall be exercised by the amending body, namely, the Parliament by following a special procedure and that clause (5) under which Parliament relinquished its power to the President is void. Learned Counsels for the appellants have cited a number of decisions in support of this contention. Of them decisions of the Privy Council in the two Canadian cases, “Attorney General of Nova Scotia (1951) SCR Canada 31, and the Initiative &amp; Referendum case, AIR 1919 PC 145:1919 AC 935—have been discussed in connection with the question as to implied limitation. In the former, the Canadian Legislature and the Nova Scotia (Provincial) Legislature proceeded to transfer their legislative powers to each other but the Privy Council ruled that such delegation of legislative powers was not permissible under the B.N.A. Act 1867. In the latter, a proposed Bill of the Legislature of Manitoba by which its legislative power was sought to be vested in a separate body was held invalid on the same ground. In Pakistan, the first case of such a nature is Sobho Gyan Chandani V. Crown PLD 1952 FC 29. In that case the Federal Legislature after promulgating the Public Safety Ordinance. 1949, delegated to the Government the power of extending its life year by year. This delegation of legislative power was held to be ultra vires and it was held that after the expiry of one year the Ordinance died its natural death. Similar views were taken by the Supreme Court in the case of F.Q. Chowdhury v. Abdul Huq, 18 DLR(SC)69 which has been discussed by me in an earlier paragraph. It appears that the essential legislative work under clause (5) is not the assignment of areas of jurisdiction for the Benches but what jurisdiction would he transfer to the Benches. This has been done by this clause and it has been provided that whatever jurisdiction, power and function the High Court Division got would be the power, function and jurisdiction of the Benches. This jurisdiction, power and function were given by the amending body itself and, the President was given authority to assign the area for each Bench the seat of which was also fixed by this body. Assignment of the area does not fall within the essential legislative power of the amending body. (Para-366) It is difficult to see how the principles enunciated in the aforesaid cases are applicable to the facts of the present case. It is well- settled that a legislature cannot part with its essential legislative function and invest another agency with the same but within the framework of the legislation it can entrust subordinate functions to other agencies. This will be clear from the quotation reproduced above from the judgment in the Initiative Referendum case. I have already found in connection with issue no III that sub-art. (5) neither limits the plenary jurisdiction of the High Court Division nor puts territorial limitation to the jurisdiction of the Judges sitting in the permanent Benches. I have also found that the assigning of area by the President read with Rule (4) of the Rules is meant only for regulating the manner of exercise of jurisdiction by the permanent Benches by allocation of cases arising from the respective assigned areas to the concerned Benches. The assigning of areas left to the Chief Executive is no part of the legislative function and it is only a ministerial act. It will be seen that similar power has been given to the Governor under Art. 198 of the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan for assigning the area in .relation to which each Benches shall exercise jurisdiction vested in the High Court. Sub-art. (5), therefore, cannot be said to be ultra vires. (Para 620)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>An war Flossain Chowdhurv Vs.

It appears that the long title of the Bill was closely followed by a detailed statement as to the subject-matter of the Bill specifically naming the Articles of the Constitution which were proposed to be amended and in which manner.

(Para 411)</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The learned Attorney General without seriously disputing the procedural requirement for an amendment has submitted that the long title of the Bill contained clear indication as to the amendment of some provisions of the Constitution, and the omission of details in the long title of the Bill did not create any confusion in the minds of the legislature because the long title was immediately followed by clear statements as to the subject matters of the Bill and as to the articles of the Constitution that were proposed to be amended. Before us there is no affirmed statement, giving sufficient particulars, as to whether any member of the Parliament made any objection on the ground that he was confused because of the lack of details in the long title. Had the aggrieved person been a member of the Parliament then the matter would have al led for closer scrutiny. The purpose for the long title is to give a notice to the members of the Parliament and there is nothing on record m show that any member of the Parliament felt aggrieved or misled for the long title not being really a long one.

Nor there is any basis fr the submission that the long title must mention expressly the articles sought to be amended. Neither the Bengali version nor the English version of clause (1) tothe proviso can be construed to mean that specific articles, are required to be mentioned in the long title. The learned Attorney-General has pointed out rightly that unlike the provision under art. 82(1) of the Ceylonese Constitution which requires the specific mention of the ‘provision’ to be amended in the long title of the bill, there is no such requirement in our provision. The requirement in our case only is that it must be mentioned in the long title that a provisions of the Constitution will be amended. In my opinion it will be sufficient compliance with law if it is expressly mentioned in the long title that a provision or certain provision of the Constitution will be amended. This reference to the Constitution in the long title of the bill will put the legislators on guard and they are expected to go through the bill to find out what are the provisions that are going to be amended under the bill. There can thus be no question of stealth or concealment in passing the amending Act.

The learned Attorney-General has pointed our rightly that unlike the provision under alt 82(1) of the Ceylonese Constitution which requires the specific mention of the ‘provision’ to be amended in the long title of the bill, there is no such requirement in our provision. The requirement in our case only is that it must be mentioned in the long title that a provisions of the Constitution will be amended. In my opinion, it will be sufficient compliance with law if it is expressly mentioned in the long title that a provision certain provision of the Constitution will be amended. This reference to the Constitution in the long title of the bill will put the legislators on guard and they are expected to go through the bill to find out what are the provisions that are going to be amended under the bill. There can thus be no question of stealth or concealment in passing the amending Act.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Anwar Hossain Chowdhury Vs.

The salary income of the Judges of the Supreme Court is exempted from taxation by Presidents Order No. 21 of 1973 and it cannot be included for the purpose of taxation while computing total income. But the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes while asessing the income of the assessee by the misapplication of a notification (No. S.R.O.440/ L/76 dated 18.12.76 vide item No. iii) issued under section 60 of the Income Tax Act, 1922, erroneously included the salary income of the Judge while computing the total income. Such notification is included for other class of persons and can have no manner of application when it involves the question of assessment of the assessee who is a Judge of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. For, the reason is that the Constitution came into force on the 16th December, 1972 and the President’s Order No.21 of 1973 was promulgated in pursuance of paragraph 3 of the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution read with Article 147 which settled the terms and conditions of service of the Judge’s of the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the terms and conditions of service of a Supreme Court Judge are sanctioned by constitutional provision and the P.O. 21 of 1973 having the backing of constitutional provision achieved the status of sub-constitutional legislation and such sub-constitutional legislation cannot be displaced by notification in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section( I) of section 60 of the Income Tax Act (XI of 1922), which is a statutory law and no notification under such law controls the sub-constitutional legislation — Income Tax Act, 1922 (XI of 1922) S. 60.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>The Commissioner of Taxes Vs.
