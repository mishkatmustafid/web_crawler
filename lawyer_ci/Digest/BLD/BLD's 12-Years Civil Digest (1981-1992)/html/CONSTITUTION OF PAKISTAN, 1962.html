The High Court Division further concurred with the finding of the trial Court that the plaintiffs failed to prove that defendants collusively created the impugned kabala. S. Ahmed, J upheld the decision of the High Court Division and F. Munim, J concurred with S. Ahmed, J. R. Islam, J held that the kabala was invalid for noncompliance of the requirement of section 4 and also held that the kabala was a product of conspiracy and fraud. B.H. Chowdhury, J did not render any opinion as to the necessity of complying with the provision of section 4, but held that the kabala was spurious.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per R. Islam, J</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In view of the certificate granted by the Special Bench under Article 58 of the Constitution and the order of the Supreme Court staying operation of the judgment and order of the Special Bench, I find it difficult to appreciate the view taken by the learned Judges of the High Court Division that section 4 having been declared ultra vires of the Con- situation, the requirement of production of prior permission from the competent authority was no longer required, and in the absence of such requirement of law validity of the impugned kabala was not lost.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The finality of the judgment of the Special Bench in Chittaranjan Sutar’s case was subject to the decision in the appeal preferred by the Government of East Pakistan on the basis of the certificate granted by the Special Bench under Art. 58 of the Constitution. Beside that the operation of the judgment and order of the Special Bench having been stayed by the Supreme Court on July 3, 1965, the declaration made in the judgment became ineffective. Consequently sections 4 and 6 of the Ordinance continued to be operative.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Since section 4 as substituted by Ordinance X of 1964 was declared ultra vires of the Constitution it means that section 4 (new) never came into existence This state in the statute brings in another consequence, that is the provision of law which was repealed or substituted by the statutory provision declared ultra vires, automatically became revived.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">When an amendatory provision proves unconstitutional, the amended provision stands wholly unaffected. That being the position section 4 as obtaining in Ordinance I of 1964 before its substitution by Ordinance X of’ 1964 remained unaffected, as if section 4 (old) continued to he operative.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Whatever restrictions the section (sec. 4 old) imposed on the registration of transfer deeds by the members of the minority .community could not be termed unreasonable as contemplated in the Thirteenth Fundamental Right. Section 4 (original) is harmless, and there is nothing in the section to be in conflict with the Fundamental Rights. Section 4 (new) has been rightly found by the Special Bench to have no relation to the object of the legislation, that Ordinance I of 1964 as promulgated on 12.2.1964, and it was in excess of the object and the prevailing circumstances did not warrant the restriction.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Chittaranjan Sutar V. Secretary, Judicial Department, Government of East Pakistan, 17 DLR 451; Frost V. State Corporation commission, (1929) 278 Us 515, ref</em></strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per S. Ahmed, J</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The Ordinance was intended to provide speedy rehabilitation of persons affected by communal disturbance in January, 1964 and for the protection of their property during the disturbed period. But to impose a legal restriction on transfer of their property for an indefinite period extending over years cannot be said to be the object of the Ordinance. Since sections 2 and 5 of the Ordinance could provide adequate remedy to the members of the minority community affected by the civil disturbance of January, 1964 legal restrictions on transfer of their property as contemplated in sections 4 and 6 of the Ordinance are found to be inconsistent with Fundamental Rights 13 and 15 are void abinitio and as such these sections did not revive when the Fundamental Rights were suspended. Nor were these sections re-enacted during the period when the Emergency continued. The doctrine of eclipse is not applicable to Ordinance I of 1964.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Ful Chand Das and others Vs.
