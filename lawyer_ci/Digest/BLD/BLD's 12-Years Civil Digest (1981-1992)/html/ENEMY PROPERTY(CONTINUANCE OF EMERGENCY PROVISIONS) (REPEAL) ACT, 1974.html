(Rev) in the absence of prior approval as required under circular dated 23rd May, 1977, had no authority to execute the document in question on behalf of the Government.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The Memo dated 13.8.73 read with Annexure — “F” along with all other circulars on this subject leave no room for doubt that the A.D.C. (Rev) vas properly and duly authorised under the law by the Government to execute and register the deed of settlement on behalf of the Government. Therefore, the alleged absence of prior approval of the Government seems to be absent in the present case in any case.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is found that the view taken by the High Court Division that the A.D.C. could not make the transfer in question without the prior approval of the Government and as such the settlement made by him on 9.10.79 in favour of the appellants was void and without jurisdiction cannot be sustained and that it ought to have declared that the impugned Government order was passed without lawful authority.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Muzaffar All and another Vs.

Could the decree be executed against the property in question ? As on that date the Ordinance was in full operation the decree was evidently inexecutable. Now when ca1use 2(b) refers to the previous operation of the Ordinance the qualifying term ‘previous’ used be-fore the word ‘operation’ refers to the inexecutability of the decree due to the operation of the Ordinance. The legislative intent, as it appears from this clause, would show that the repeal was not intended to remove the inexecutahility of the decree in the present case.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per B.H.
