Chowdhury,J (R. Islam. J concurring)</strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Art.5(b) i.e in three parts, the first part deals with collaboration, the second part deals with the ideology of Pakistan, and the third part deals with the support of the elements inimical to the liberation struggle or creation of Bangladesh. Three definite concepts have been introduced in clause(b). It will be absurd that while collaboration will be offensive if it is performed in the exercise of powers or in the discharge of duties hut conduct or activities exhibiting support to the ideology of Pakistan ol. conduct in support to the elements inimical to the liberation struggle are to be performed in private capacity. The title of P.O. 67 of 1972 is “the Government of Bangladesh (Services Screening) Order” and the preamble shows that all the persons who are in the service of Bangladesh are within it and since the object of the enactment is to make the Government institution free from corrupt persons, collaborators, officials and other employees wedded to the ideology of Pakistan, all activities of such persons must be performed in the exercise of powers or in the discharge of duties.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Obaidullah Vs. Vice-Chancellor, University of Dacca. W.P.336 of 1974 (unreported), approved.</em></strong></p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per K. Hossain, CJ (dissenting)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">These three clauses cover three kinds of conduct on the part of the officer concerned. First is that in the exercise of his power or, in discharge of his official duties, if he does any act which assists, aids or supports against the liberation struggle or creation of Bangladesh whereas the second clause is regarding conduct which celibates faith in and support to the ideology of Pakistan, and the third to the conduct which supports the elements inimical to the liberation struggle or creation of Bangladesh and in particular occupation forces of Pakistan. The second and third clauses, if read in the context of the first clause, clearly indicate that they are separate and distinct, inasmuch as the offence in the first clause could only be done as an officer in the discharge of his duties or exercise of power, whereas the offences in clauses two and three, the conduct manifested by the officer need not be in the discharge of his duties or exercise of hi powers. I, therefore find that the three clauses ye been used disjunctively and to cover three distinct categories of purposes. For the second and third clauses there is no need of exhibition of collaboration in the discharge of duty or exercise of power. But the act or conduct of an officer coming within the first clause, it is to be manifested either in the exercise of power or in the discharge duties. I am re-informed in reading the clauses disjunctively, because these the clauses are separated first by the word and secondly by the word ‘conduct’ at tl beginning of each of the three clauses. If they are read conjunctively then the word con— duct’ in second and third clauses become tautologies or superfluous. But if they are read disjunctively all the three clauses fit in grammatically and semantically For the pw pose the Article is directed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Registrar, University of Dacca Vs.
