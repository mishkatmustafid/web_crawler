Notice of every writ petition shall be served on all parties directly affected. Proviso to this Rule is that if at the hearing of the writ petition it appears to the Court that any person who desires to be heard is a proper person he may be heard irrespective of whether he has been served with a notice or not. Rule 9 provides that the Court may order service of notice of the writ petition upon a person who, in its opinion, ought to have been served with a-notice of such petition but who has not been so served, These two Rules show that the Court may while hearing a writ petition or even before such hearing order a person to be added as party to the writ petition.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Md.
