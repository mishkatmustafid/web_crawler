The salary income of the Judges of Supreme Court is exempted from taxation by President’s Order No. 21 of 1973 and it cannot be included for the purpose of taxation while computing total income. But the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes while assessing the income of the assessee by the misapplication of a notification (SRO. Nq. 440/ L/176 dated 18.12.76 vide item No. iii) issued under section 60 of the Income Tax Act, 1922 erroneously included the salary income of the Judge while computing the total income. Such notification is included for other class of persons and can have no manner of application when it involves the question of assessment of the assessee who is a Judge of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. The reason is that the Constitution came into force on the 16th December, 1972 and the President’s Order No.21 of 1973 was promulgated in pursuance of paragraph 3 of the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution read with Article 147 which settled the terms and conditions of ser ice t the Judges of the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the terms and conditions of service of a Supreme Court Judge were sanctioned by constitutional provision and the P.O. 21 of 1973b having the backing of constitutional provision achieved the status of sub—constitutional legislation and such constitutional legislation cannot he displaced by notification in exercise of the powers confirmed by sub-section (1) of Section 60 of the Income Tax Act which is a statutory law but no notification under such law controls the sub-constitutional legislation.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>The Commissioner of Taxes Vs.

Where the High Court finds that there is no evidence to support the finding of fact of the Tribunal, or finding of the Tribunal is so unreasonable or perverse that no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevant law could have arrived at it, then in such circumstances, there would arise a question of law which can be agitated before the High Court Division. The question of the applicability of a section of the Act to a particular set of facts or its construction is always a question of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Mackinon Mackenzie and Company (Pakistan) Ltd.
