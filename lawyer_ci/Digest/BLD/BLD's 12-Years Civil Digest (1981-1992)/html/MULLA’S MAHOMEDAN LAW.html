[Majority per B.H. Chowdhury, J (Munim, CJ and Masud, J, concurring]</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Valid marriage between the parents is the essential precondition of legitimacy—If such a marriage is disproved, no amount of acknowledgement shall make the child legitimate it must be borne in mind that acknowledgement’ in Mohammadan Law is no substitute for adoption in Hindu Law or Roman Law—under the Mohammadan Law relationship by consanguinity is prerequisite for legitimacy and the latter is dependent upon’ a valid marriage of the parents—If Amir Au had acknowledged the defendant as his son, then he knew better who was defendant’s mother but that woman not being any of his three wives, the defendant is not his legitimate son——The learned Single Judge is found to have rightly refused interference with the findings of the Court below which stand on a solid basis..</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Khorshed Alam alias Shah Alam Vs.
