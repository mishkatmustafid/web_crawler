The provision of 23 of the Nonagricultural Tenancy Act prohibiting transfer of nonagricultural tenancy without a registered document shall not apply to gifts of immovable property by a Muslim. A valid gift of immovable property with building and structures inter vivos can be made under the Muslim Law by oral gift. According to Muslim Law an oral gift is complete as soon as the declaration of gift and the delivery of possession is given by the donor to the donee. When these essential conditions are complied with, the gift becomes perfectly valid and if a written deed is executed afterwards and registered, the oral gift would be valid notwithstanding the latter instrument of gift.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Alhaj Aklima Khatun and another Vs.
