It does not properly define the expression ‘the property of the firm’.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In paragraph 2 section 14 a legal fiction has been created. Though property acquired with money belonging to the firm may not have been acquired for the firm, yet, by a legal fiction, the said property is “deemed to have been acquired for the firm, unless the contrary intention appears.”</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The legal fiction creates only a rebuttable presumption. Even when the purchase money is money belonging to the firm, that fact itself is not decisive.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Whether the disputed property is or is not a partnership property. Would depend upon the intention of the partners as the second paragraph of section 14 specifically lays down,. Evidence is admissible to show that a contrary intention governed the transaction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The contrary intention may justifiably be gathered from (a) the purpose for which the property was acquired; and (b) the mode in which it has been dealt with. These two considerations, it appears, are germane to the determination of contrary intention.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">When the suit properties are net partnership properties, the bar of section 69(2) of the Partnership Act is not attracted.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Where properties were acquired by them jointly for their own benefit and not for the benefit of the partnership and therefore, under section 14 of the Partnership Act read with Section 45 of the Transfer of Property Act, the properties in suit were not partnership properties.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Mahbubul Alam chowdhury and others Vs.

This point is now well- settled that the retirement of the partner is not effective unless and until other partners agree to discharge him of possible liability and a public notice is given under section 72.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Liability of a partner—Where the creditors are not notified of dissolution any ackriowledgement made and by ex-partner shall be binding on the Firm and its partners.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Md.
