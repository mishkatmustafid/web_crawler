The method of appointment by advertisement in the daily newspapers to hold public auction for selecting the highest bidder at such auction for appointment has been laid down in circulars and these are provided in the circulars in detail. Reading the provisions Of Rule 80 as a whole, we nowhere find the prohibition to hold public auction for the purpose of selecting stevedores and handling contractors.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority Vs.
