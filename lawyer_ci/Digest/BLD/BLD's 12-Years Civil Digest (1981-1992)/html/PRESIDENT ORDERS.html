Whereas President’s Order No.67 of 1972 does not contain any such express words. Rather the statute has been drafted in clear language to cover those persons who are still ‘exhibiting” faith in Pakistan ideology or “manifesting” ardour, or zeal “amounting” to collaboration etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is only a mental makeup of certain persons whose conduct “exhibiting”, “manifesting”, “amounting to collaboration’ etc. which have been the subject matter of the enactment that they are liable to be thrown out. It is not the activity which was performed in the past or immediate past which had been made offence under another special statute, e.g., President’s Order No.8 of 1972. On the other hand by making President’s Order No.8 of 1972 retrospective a person who has aided, abetted, participated, issued statement were brought within its ambit but not the persons whose conduct or activity in the discharge of their duties “manifesting” exhibiting” etc. are within it. Later class of people does come within President’s Order No.67 of 1972 if such mental make up is still continuing.”</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per B.H.
