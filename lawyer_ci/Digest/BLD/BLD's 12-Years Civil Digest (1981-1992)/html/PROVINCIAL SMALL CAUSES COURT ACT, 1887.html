No question of giving consent to the sub-lease arises—When tenancy in favour of defendent No. I was terminated the sub-lease in favour of defendant No.2 cannot subsist—It would be merely a legalistic approach to say that the defendent No.2 became a trespasser and a Suit for eviction did not lie against him—Technicalities of law may sometimes prove to be of great value in winning even, a bad case, but when the very bottom of a case is struck off, no one can hope to score. Victory on such technicalities alone.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Tajabunnessa and others Vs.
