Munim, J:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Since neither the impugned provisions nor the Act nor the rules containing them provide any principle or guideline for the exercise of discretion by the Government when it proposes to retire a Government servant from amongst a group of government servants similarly situated and holding similar jobs, there invariably exists scope far arbitrary exercise of such discretion. What is of importance and consequence to the Government servant concerned, who is proposed to be retired, is that the discretion of the relevant authority must be seen to have been exercised on some such principles as are discernible in Fundamental Rule 56, Note 2, East Bengal .Service Rule and Rule 3 of the Bangladesh Public Servants Retirement Rules, 1973. Where such basis has been provided by the enunciation of such principles, whether under the Act or rules made under an Act or even in the note to such rules regarding the retirement of government servants, the concerned authority before exercising its discretion, has to conform to the principles so provided therein ... The omission of such basis in the Public Servants (Retirement) Rules, 1975 leaves scope to the concerned authority to arbitrarily retire a Government servant who has completed 25 years of service. The existence of such principles as are found in the Rules of 1973 would have provided a complete answer to any challenge to their constitutionality, inspite of the expression “without assigning any reason’ used in section 9(2) of the Act. In such a case the authority concerned would have remained free, so as not to disclose any reason in the retirement order, but if its action in retiring a Government servant was challenged as arbitrary, as has been done by the appellant in the present case, them authority could have disclosed before the Court the basis of its action.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per F. Munim, J:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The minimum principle or guideline as has been provided in service rules as appear from the cases cited in the judgment is that of public interest or the interest of public service. If either the impugned Act or the rules made there under provided such principle, the minimum requirement of law as showing the existence of some guideline for the exercise of discretion in retiring a Government servant, who has completed 25 years of service, would, be satisfied, thus making it immune from any challenge on the ground of d crimination violative of Arts. 27 and 29 of Constitution. In the absence of such a guide line either in the Act or the rules from there under, section 9(2) of Act XII of 19 suffers from unconstitutionality and the I pugned action based on it is open to the chalenge as being discriminatory and in violatof the equality provisions of the Constitution</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Ref: A.I.R.

Termination of service before his superannuation is undoubtedly removal if not termed as ‘dismissal’.. It is true that the (impugned) order does not contain any stigma, but the very fact that the appellant was selected out of a number of persons similarly placed, and consequently he has been deprived not only from continuing in the employment for the remaining period of his term of service but also from some of the service benefits accrued to him, makes out a case of punishment. In effect, whatever may be the phraseology used in terminating the service, it is punishment imposed on him, for it not only destroys his right to the post held by him, but also inevitably carries with it a stigma. Such a termination is ‘removal’ within the meaning of Article 135 of the Constitution. Therefore the statute or rule providing a mode of terminating service at the discretion of the authority without complying with impugned action having been taken against the appellant without issuing any notice upon him or giving him an opportunity of being heard before taking the impugned action, the impugned notification is violative of Article 1 35 of the Constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Ref: A.I.R.1958 (SC) 36; A.I.R. 1954 (SC) 369; A.I.R.1964 (SC) 600; A.I.R.1975 (SC) l487 —Cited.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per S.

Subject to these limitations, the discretion of the Government in such a matter is absolute.
