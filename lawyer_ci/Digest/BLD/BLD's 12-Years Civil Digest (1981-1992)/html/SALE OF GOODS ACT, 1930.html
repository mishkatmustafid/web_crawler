Contract—Property in goods passes to the buyer on shipment unless parties intend otherwise.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The normal incidence of an FOB. contract is that property in goods passes to the buyer on shipment; (ii) the parties, however, may intend that property shall pass at a subsequent time, as for example, on payment of price and charges and on such event property shall pass at such subsequent time: (iii) intention is a question of fact and it has to gathered from the facts and circumstances of each case; (IV) the mere fact that an F.O.B. contract provides for handing over of bills of lading against payment does not justify a presumption that property is to pass on payment: (V) a retention of the bills of lading by the seller should not be construed in a manner which is inconsistent with commercial practice. Any such retention should be regarded in conjunction with the object of securing the purchase price of the goods only, that is to say, property should be construed to pass on shipment subject to unpaid seller’s lien.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Bismillah Oil Mills Vs.
