Appellants challenged the title of the respondents contending that the decree was fraudulently obtained. The finding of the S.C. Court in substance has established that respondents succeeded in proving the relationship of landlord and tenant. But the S.C. Court proceeded to examine the paramount title of the respondents and held that the decree for specific performance was fraudulently obtainedand therefore the respondents did not acquire title to the suit premises and dismissed the suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The S.C.C. Judge had no jurisdiction to go into the question of paramount title and in doing so to set aside the decree of a Civil Court obtained by the predecessor of the plaintiff in a suit for specific performance of contract. The Small Causes Court has no jurisdiction to go into the question of title, except incidentally.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Sudhangshu Kuinar Chowdhury and another Vs.
