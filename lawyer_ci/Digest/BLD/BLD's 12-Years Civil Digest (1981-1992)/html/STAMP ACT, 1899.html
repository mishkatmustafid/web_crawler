The bank as per terms of the mortgage deed can fall upon the mortgaged property only when the primary security, namely the demand promissory note and deed of hypothecation fall short to satisfy the outstanding demand of the bank. In the face of clear recital in the deed in question I find it difficult to accept the contention of the appellant that the mortgage in this case falls under the category of primary or principal security. The deed as drawn up clearly falls in the category of collateral anxiliary in as much as some immovable properties are being offered as collateral or auxiliary or additional security for the vcash credit facility and the stamp duty is chargeable under clause (c) of Article 40.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Per R. Islam J (dissenting)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The question involved in this case is whether the mortgage deed in question is a collateral security in relation to the security by way of the Demand Promissory note and the Deed of hypothecation, both the securities being in favour of the same lender and in respect of the same loan. Purpose of a collateral security is necessarily the same as that of a primary security i.e. repayment of loan. If a loan can be taken by executing a demand promissory note or a deed of hypothecation of goods as the only security, there is no reason why such documents cannot constitute a primary security when subsequent additional security is called for hold that the mortgage deed in question is a collateral/auxiliary security and chargeable under clause (c) of Article4O.
