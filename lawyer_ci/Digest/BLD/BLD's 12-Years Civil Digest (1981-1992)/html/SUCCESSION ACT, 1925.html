The object of the executor is to propound the will for the benefit of those who take the interest of the will. It is in substance not a personal action. In substance, probate means copy of the will certified under the seal of the Court of a competent jurisdiction that a grant of administration to the estate of the testator has been made. In the absence of any executor an universal or residuary legatee can apply for letters of administration and what the Court grants in such a case is also a copy of the will certified under the seal of the Court stating that the will is duly approved and an authority given to administer the estate of the deceased according to the direction. In either of the case the purpose of the grant is to administer the estate of the deceased according to the provision of the will. A plain reading of sections 102, 23 and 235 lead to the conclusion that the residuary legatee may also continue the proceeding and section 222 would not be an impediment to the continuation of the probate proceeding.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Khitindora Chandra Bhattacharya and another Vs.
