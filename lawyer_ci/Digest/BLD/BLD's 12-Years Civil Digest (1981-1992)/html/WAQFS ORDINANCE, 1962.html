When this claim was challenged by Altaf Mia, a cousin of Anwar Hossain, it was the duty of the Administrator to make an appointment in terms of section 43 for a specified period thereby leaving the parties for adjudication of the dispute by a civil Court. Instead, he made au enquiry and attempted to evaluate the claim of each candidate which the High Court rightly described as arrogating to himself the functions of the civil Court. Such action on the part of the Administrator is not authorised by law. [Majority view : Per B.H.

The remarks are unfair. The Administrator, in discharging his functions is required to decide the question of succession. In such a case he is not required to refer the parties to the Civil Court for determination of competency to the mutwalliship—If in such a case the Administrator instead of deciding the question of succession as contemplated under section 51, passed an order under section 43 in favour of one of the two persons to act as Mutwalli for a specified period, and thereby driving the parties to the civil Court for adjudication, in that case, he would be failing in his duties as conferred under the Wakfs Ordinance, 1961.</p><p style="margin-right: -.2in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>[Minority View : Per R.
