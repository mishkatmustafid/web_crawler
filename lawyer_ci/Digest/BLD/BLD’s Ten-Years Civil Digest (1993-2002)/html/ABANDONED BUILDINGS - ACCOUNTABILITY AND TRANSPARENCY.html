The essence of the matter is that the owner must receive back possession of the property actually and effectively from those who took it over as abandoned properties. The actual and effective restoration or transfer may take place either by physical delivery of possession or by other appropriate means. The words “other appropriate means” in the context in which they have been used cannot but mean an effective restoration or transfer to the owners by means other than delivery of possession, i,e., a handing over of possession by another appropriate means which is akin or similar to delivery of possession—Abandoned Properties.

It has been found by the Court of Settlement that the predecessor of interest of the petitioners died here in 1982 leaving behind the petitioners as his heirs who have inherited the said house as successor-in- interest and he continuously lived in this country and paid income tax of his business till his death. The government most illegally declared the case property as abandoned property—Bangladesh Abandoned Property (Control, Management and Disposal) Order, 1972 (P.O. 16 of 1972), Article—2.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bibi Zarina and others Vs.

But in the instant case the question of abatement is not relevant since no such case was made out in the writ petition—Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982 (11 of 1982), Section-12.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Subash Chandra Das and others Vs.

P.O. 90 of 1972 provides for abatement only of suits and other legal proceedings in which the legality or otherwise of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act or any amendment made thereto or for acquisition of any property made there under is called in question. Both the Orders aim at abatement of a suit and there is no inconsistency or mutual exclusiveness between the two. Partial abatement of a suit has not been contemplated under P.O. 90 of 1972.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bangladesh Vs.

If abatement is not set aside the applicant is deprived to the opportunity of proving his case only on account of his culpable negligence or lack of vigilance. Refusal to condone delay may result a meritorious matter being thrown out without any hearing. It is ordinarily always desirable that delay is condoned and substitution is allowed so as to decide a case on merit upon hearing the parties unless there are deliberate negligence on the part of the applicant—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Order XXII Rule 9(2)(3).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Kader Mondal &amp; ors.

Absorption is a mechanism by which surplus employees are taken in and assimilated in the service. The appellant’s terms and conditions of service are to be guided and regulated by Section 6(1) of the Ordinance of 1985 under which his appointment was made. Therefore, the notification for absorbing the appellant’s contract service on a permanent basis is evidently illegal and without any lawful authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lt.
