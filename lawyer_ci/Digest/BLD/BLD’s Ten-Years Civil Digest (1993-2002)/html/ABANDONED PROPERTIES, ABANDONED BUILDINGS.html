VII OF 1977)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paragraph—6(2)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is clear from a reading of sub-paragraph (2) th it intended to confer a benefit upon those owners of abandoned properties who in pursuance of a judgment of a Court of law have actually and effectively received back the possession of the property either by delivery of possession or by other appropriate means in .pursuance of such judgment. The essence of the matter is that the owner must receive back possession of the property actually and effectively from those who took it over as abandoned properties. The actual and effective restoration or transfer may take place either by physical delivery of possession or by other appropriate means. The words “other appropriate means” in the context in which they have been used cannot but mean an effective restoration or transfer to the owners by means other than delivery of possession, i,e., a handing over of possession by another appropriate means which is akin or similar to delivery of possession.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Bangladesh Italian Marble Works Ltd. and anr.

It has been found by the Court of Settlement that the predecessor of interest of the petitioners died here in 1982 leaving behind the petitioners as his heirs who have inherited the said house as successor-in interest and he continuously lived in this country and paid income tax of his business till his death. The government most illegally declared the case property as abandoned property.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Bibi Zarina and others Vs Government of Bangladesh and others, 2O BLD (HCD) 164.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Article—2(1)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">When it is proved that the alleged owner of the property was not present in Bangladesh during the relevant period, his whereabouts were not known and he ceased to occupy, supervise or manage the property in person, such a property easily comes within the definition of abandoned property as envisaged in Article 2(1) of P.O. No. 16 of 1972.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Bangladesh vs. Md. Suruzzamal and others, 15 BLD (AD) 146.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ref: MIs.

So, the disputed house did not come within the definition of ‘abandoned property’ of the case property as defined in Article 2 of P.O. No. 16 of 1972 and as such the enlistment as abandoned property in the ‘Kha’ list of abandoned property is without lawful authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Masuda Anowar Vs Bangladesh and another, 17 BLD (HCD) 427.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Articles—2(1), 14 and 24</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Abandoned Property has been defined in Article 2(1) of P. 0. 16 of 1972 wherein it has been said that if a person ceased to occupy or manage in person his property the same is an abandoned property. Article 14 of P.O. 16 of 1972 clearly speaks that any property vested in the Government under the Order shall be exempt from all legal processes and Article 24 speaks that anything done or any action taken or any order passed under the Order shall not be called in question in any court. Hence, from the definition of abandoned property and on the basis of the averment of the plaintiff himself when he failed to manage and supervise the property in any manner the property vested in the Government as an abandoned property. Therefore, the High Court Division was correct in holding that the suit was filed for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession is not maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Syed Afzal Nowab Vs G.

Where a statute requires a notice to be given before taking action, service of notice on the concerned party becomes mandatory.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Mrs. Jebon Nahar and others Vs.

The new sub-rule 4A of Rule 10 neither says that it will have retrospective effect nor is there any authority in President’s Order 16 of 1972 to make rules with retrospective effect. Therefore, the auction sale having taken place before the insertion of the new sub-rule 4A, the sale would be governed by the law as it existed then as sub-rule 4.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is a matter of construction whether the execution of a further contract is a condition of the contract or a mere expression of a desire of the parties as to the manner in which the transaction already agreed to will go through. In the former case, there is no enforceable contract either because the condition is nullified or because the law does not recognizes a’ contract to enter into a contract. In the latter case, there is a binding contract and the reference to the mere formal contract may be ignored. In such cases, refusal to execute formal contract cannot give rise to an action for breach of contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>United Commercial Bank Ltd. v.

Firstly, the tender procedure was continuing and it was not concluded. Secondly, during the pendency of the suit this amended Rule came into force and thirdly, the plaintiff being a lawful lessee in the premises participated in the auction and subsequently offered the highest bid money to the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 for purchasing the same. The sale by tender was not concluded and the tender procedure was continuing and during pendency of the suit this amended Rule (4A) came into force, the plaintiff is entitled to have the benefit of this amended Rule, although it was not given any retrospective effect. The plaintiff is claiming a right to purchase the property in the instant suit and during pendency of the suit by operation of law such right was given to him and as such he is entitled to have that right, although the Suit was filed earlier.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>M/s United Commercial Bank Ltd.
