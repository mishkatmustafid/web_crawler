It is not the case of the petitioner that he was not paid compensation or that his compensation money was not deposited within one year from the date of decision to acquire under section 5 or the proviso to section 4(3)(b) of the Ordinance. As such he has no business to enquire when the requiring body paid the amount of compensation to the Government.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Md.

If after meeting the requirement of the specified purpose, for which acquisition was made, there remains any excess land, it is open to the Government to decide as to whether the requiring body will be allowed to use the same for any public purpose other than from the one for which it was acquired.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>M.

Under this section no obligation has been placed on the requiring body to deposit compensation within six months from the date of decision for acquisition.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The expression “compensation has not been paid or deposited within 6 (six) months from the date of decision” for acquisition in sub-section (1) of section 12 is to be understood with reference to section 10 of the Ordinance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the absence of any material or averment to show that no compensation was paid under sub- section (1) of section 10 and there being no occasion for deposit of compensation in the Public Account under sub-section (2) of Section 10, the question of abatement does not arise. It is only in case of noncompliance of the provisions of Section 10 the question of abatement or revocation of the acquisition proceeding arises.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Reading Sections 8,9,10,12 and 15 of the Ordinance together, it is clear that abatement will take place if the acquiring authority fails to “pay” or “deposit” compensation in terms of section 10 within one year from the date of decision of the Government made under section 5 of the Ordinance. The requiring body is, therefore, required to deposit the compensation money before the expiry of one year from the date of decision of the Government.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Land Administration Vs.

But in the instant case the question of abatement under section 12 of the Ordinance is not relevant in as much as there was no averment in the Writ Petition that no compensation was paid under subsection (1) of section 10 or deposit made in the Public Account of the Republic as per provision of sub-section (2) of section 10.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Subash Chandra Das and others Vs Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Land Administration and Land Reforms, Government of the People s Republic of Bangladesh and others, 16 BLD (AD) 119.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—17 Sub-Section 1</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sub-Section I of Section 17 of the Ordinance provides that no property acquired by the Government shall, without prior approval of the Government, be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was acquired.

The impugned notification being made by the Government the appellants’ representation to the Inspector General of Police cannot be conceived to have been made to any higher administrative authority and as such the appellants are entitled to file application against the impugned notification straightway to the Administrative Tribunal within 6 months under Second proviso to Section 4(2) of the act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Md.

No benefit under section 14 of the Limitation Act for enlargement of limitation can thus be claimed in respect of filing application before the tribunal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is clear from the wording of the second proviso to sub-section (2) of section 4 of the Administrative Tribunal Act that the legislative intendment behind this provision is to exclude the proceedings governed by the Administrative Tribunal Act from the operation of the benefit conferred by sub-section (2) of section 29 of the Limitation Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The petitioner cannot, therefore, have the benefit of section 14 of the Limitation Act while computing the period of limitation in filing his application before the Administrative Tribunal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Abul Bashar Vs Investment Corporation of Bangladesh and another, 20 BLD (AD) 294.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ref: Md.

There appears to be no rule making the provision of Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure inapplicable to the original civil jurisdiction of the High Court Division, namely its admiralty jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Order I Rule’ 10(2) of the Code permits addition of a third party nature of its claim, if its presence is necessary in order to dispose of the suit completely and for adjudication of all the questions involved in the suit between the parties in order to avoiding multiplicity of proceedings and conflict of decisions. Questions involved in the suit means not merely the questions involved in the suit as originally framed. Similarly the Court has power to add not only those persons who were necessary parties on the date of the suit but also persons who subsequently become necessary parties.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Doon Valley Rice Ltd. vs. MV YUE YANG and others, 19BLD (HCD) 471</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ref: 43DLR322; 46 DLR (AD) 185; Yusuf Miah vs. Barbar Milhelinsen Agencies pte.

Declaration of general average arising out of jettison of cargo cannot be said to be damage to goods caused due to negligence or misconduct or breach of duty or breach of contract by ship owner, master or crew within the meaning of section 6 of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861. Under section 6 of the Act, a suit for declaration is not maintainable and that a suit for declaration that declaration of general average arising out of jettison is not amenable to the jurisdiction of an Admiralty Court under section 6 of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Sadharan Bima Corporation Vs M V BIRBA and others, 20 BLD (AD) 184.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ref: M/s.
