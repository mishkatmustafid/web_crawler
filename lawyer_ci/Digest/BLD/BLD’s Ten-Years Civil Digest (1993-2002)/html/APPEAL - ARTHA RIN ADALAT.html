Clause 14 is an arbitration clause stipulating not only that the parties shall submit all their disputes to arbitration but also that the arbitration shall be “in accordance with, and subject to the provisions of Arbitration Act. 1950”.

The arbitration “is in accordance with, and subject to the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1950” and as such parties do not have to travel far to look out for the venue beyond the Arbitration Act, 1950 itself.

Such contract does not offend the main provision of section 28 of the Act because the local Courts still retain the jurisdiction to decide the lis between the parties. [Per Mustafa Kamal, J.]—Contract Act, 1872 (IX of 1872), Section—28, Exception 1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bangladesh Air Service (Pvt.) Ltd. Vs.

Exception (1) to section 28 of the Contract Act, however, enacts a saving clause in favour of the contract to refer to arbitration any dispute that may arise between the parties. Hence arbitration clause is protected by Exception (1) to section 28 of the Contract Act. [Per Latifur Rahman, J.]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bangladesh Air Service (Pvt.) Ltd.
