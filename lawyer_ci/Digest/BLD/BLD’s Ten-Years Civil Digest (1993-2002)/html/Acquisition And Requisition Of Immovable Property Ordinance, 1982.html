But action taken for serving a public purpose must be shown to be not merely that this specific result will be reached as a final end, but that the public has itself a direct interest in it.</p><p><strong><em>Md. Masudul Hussain Vs The Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka &amp;ors, 15BLD (HCD) 493.</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—3</strong></p><p>Conclusion of an agreement between the requisitioning authority and the requiring body is a sine quo non for the exercise of power under section 3 of the Ordinance for publication of the preliminary notice of acquisition of property. When there is no material to show that the person or the body for whom the property was sought to be acquired has already entered into an agreement with the Government before issuing notice of acquisition under section 3 of the Ordinance, the purported order of acquisition is not legal.</p><p><strong><em>Md.

It is not the case of the petitioner that he was not paid compensation or that his compensation money was not deposited within one year from the date of decision to acquire under section 5 or the proviso to section 4(3)(b) of the Ordinance. As such he has no business to enquire when the requiring body paid the amount of compensation to the Government.</p><p><strong><em>Md.

If after meeting the requirement of the specified purpose, for which acquisition was made, there remains any excess land, it is open to the Government to decide as to whether the requiring body will be allowed to use the same for any public purpose other than from the one for which it was acquired.</p><p><strong><em>M.

Under this section no obligation has been placed on the requiring body to deposit compensation within six months from the date of decision for acquisition.</p><p>The expression “compensation has not been paid or deposited within 6 (six) months from the date of decision” for acquisition in sub-section (1) of section 12 is to be understood with reference to section 10 of the Ordinance.</p><p>In the absence of any material or averment to show that no compensation was paid under sub- section (1) of section 10 and there being no occasion for deposit of compensation in the Public Account under sub-section (2) of Section 10, the question of abatement does not arise. It is only in case of noncompliance of the provisions of Section 10 the question of abatement or revocation of the acquisition proceeding arises.</p><p>Reading Sections 8,9,10,12 and 15 of the Ordinance together, it is clear that abatement will take place if the acquiring authority fails to “pay” or “deposit” compensation in terms of section 10 within one year from the date of decision of the Government made under section 5 of the Ordinance. The requiring body is, therefore, required to deposit the compensation money before the expiry of one year from the date of decision of the Government.</p><p><strong><em>Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Land Administration Vs.

But in the instant case the question of abatement under section 12 of the Ordinance is not relevant in as much as there was no averment in the Writ Petition that no compensation was paid under subsection (1) of section 10 or deposit made in the Public Account of the Republic as per provision of sub-section (2) of section 10.</p><p><strong><em>Subash Chandra Das and others Vs Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Land Administration and Land Reforms, Government of the People s Republic of Bangladesh and others, 16 BLD (AD) 119.</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—17 Sub-Section I</strong></p><p>Sub-Section I of Section 17 of the Ordinance provides that no property acquired by the Government shall, without prior approval of the Government, be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was acquired. The Ordinance coming into force on 13.4.82 and having not being given retrospective operation, cannot hit the contract earlier concluded with the Plaintiff.</p><p><strong><em>Pronab Kumar Chakraborty and Others Vs.

In the absence of any special period of limitation prescribed in the Ordinance for preferring an appeal before the Arbitration Appellate Tribunal, the general law of limitation comes into play and as such section 5 of the Limitation Act may be restored to in such cases.</p><p><strong><em>Govt. of Bangladesh Vs District Judge, Dhaka and Arbitration Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka and others, 17 BLD (HCD) 448.</em></strong></p><p>Ref: 43 DLR (AD) 28; 6 BLD (AD) 180— Cited.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Sections—34(1) (4)</strong></p><p>An award made by the Arbitrator is appealable under Section 34(1) of the Ordinance: Sub-section 4 of Section 34 of the Ordinance gives finality to the decision of the Arbitration Appellate Tribunal as in such cases it acts as a Court deciding the rights of the parties to receive compensation.</p><p><strong><em>Bangladesh vs. Md.
