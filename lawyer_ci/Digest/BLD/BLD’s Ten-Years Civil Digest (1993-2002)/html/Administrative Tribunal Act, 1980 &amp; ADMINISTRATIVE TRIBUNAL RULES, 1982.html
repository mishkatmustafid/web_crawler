The expression action taken in relation to him as a person in the service of Republic” includes the order of transfer. Thus, the remedy against the order of his transfer lies before the Administrative Tribunal. The application under Article 102 of the Constitution is not maintainable in law.</p><p><strong><em>Md.

The impugned notification being made by the Government the appellants’ representation to the Inspector General of Police cannot be conceived to have been made to any higher administrative authority and as such the appellants are entitled to file application against the impugned notification straightway to the Administrative Tribunal within 6 months under Second proviso to Section 4(2) of the act.</p><p><strong><em>Md.

Mr. Hasan Mahmud Khondker and others, 16 BLD(AD)147</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—4(2)</strong></p><p>Section 4(2) of the Act provides that after making of decision by a higher administrative authority under any law for the time being in force a case may be filed by an aggrieved person in the ‘Service of the Republic’ before the Administrative Tribunal within 6 months there from.</p><p>In the instant case, the petitioner preferred appeal under Rule 17 of the Rules and as such he was required to file the case before the Administrative Tribunal within 6 months of the dismissal of his appeal. The case filed beyond the period of 6 months is thus barred by limitation.</p><p><strong><em>Md. Osman Gani Vs.

Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 in the Second proviso to sub-section (2) of section 4 of the Administrative Tribunal Act contains clear provision prescribing special limitation for filing application before tribunal and as such the law is being special law with clear legislative intent. No benefit under section 14 of the Limitation Act for enlargement of limitation can thus be claimed in respect of filing application before the tribunal.</p><p>It is clear from the wording of the second proviso to sub-section (2) of section 4 of the Administrative Tribunal Act that the legislative intendment behind this provision is to exclude the proceedings governed by the Administrative Tribunal Act from the operation of the benefit conferred by sub-section (2) of section 29 of the Limitation Act.</p><p>The petitioner cannot, therefore, have the benefit of section 14 of the Limitation Act while computing the period of limitation in filing his application before the Administrative Tribunal.</p><p><strong><em>Abul Bashar Vs Investment Corporation of Bangladesh and another, 20 BLD (AD) 294.</em></strong></p><p>Ref: Md.

Merely because of the adaptation of the said Civilian Employees in Defence Services (Classification, Control, Appeal) Rules, 1961, by the Board, for the disciplinary matters of the employees of the said Board, the said employees do not become members of the defence services or members of services in connection with the defence.</p><p>The expression “person in the Defence Service of Bangladesh” as mentioned in subsection (-) of Section 4 of the Administrative Tribunal Act does not include the petitioners who were employees of the Ordinance Factories Board (that is government servants serving under the Ordinance Factories Board).</p><p><strong><em>Serajul Islam Thakur and ors.

The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, including those of Order 1. Except as referred to in the Act and the Rules do not seem to. apply to the Tribunal. But still then as a general rule it cannot be disputed that all necessary parties must be impleaded in a case so that a tribunal may effectually adjudicate on all matters before it.</p><p>As the appellants are claiming their confirmation in the post of A.S.Ps. and they are seeking relief against the Government alone it is for the Government to refute the same and to protect the interest of other employees and as such it cannot be said that the case is bad for defect of parties for not impleading respondent Nos. 1 — 15. Respondent Nos. 1—15 nevertheless are aggrieved’ person within the meaning of section 6(2) of the Act in that the order of the Tribunal was likely to be prejudicial to them in the matter of seniority. Their right of appeal cannot, therefore, be denied.</p><p><strong><em>Md. Abdul Mannan and ors Vs.

The Administrative Tribunal has no power to grant interim relief in respect of a case pending before it for final adjudication.</p><p><strong><em>Kamrul Hasan vs. Bangladesh and others, 16 BLD (AD) 35</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908)</u></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>The word ‘rehearing’, meaning of</strong></p><p>A rehearing is a new proceeding and it implies the hearing by the same tribunal which heard the matter before. It is an accepted principle of procedure that prior notice for rehearing is to be given to the parties who were present at the time of the hearing of the matter earlier.
