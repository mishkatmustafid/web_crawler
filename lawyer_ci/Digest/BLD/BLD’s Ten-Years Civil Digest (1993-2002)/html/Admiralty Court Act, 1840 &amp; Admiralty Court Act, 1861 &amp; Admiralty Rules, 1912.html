The warrantee as to date of delivery of goods given in the charter party forms part of the Bill of Lading and is therefore binding between the parties.</p><p>It is now well-settled that damages suffered by the consignee on account of delay in delivery arising out of breach of contract of carriage comes within the purview of section 6 of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861. But all sorts of damages are not recoverable, in case of any breach of contract resulting in damages, the quantum of damages can only be decided at the time of trial on taking evidence.</p><p><strong><em>Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation Vs M.T.

Unless the goods in question are carried into any port of Bangladesh, section 6 of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861 cannot be made applicable and as such the plaint is liable to be returned.</p><p><strong><em>National Steel Industries Limited Vs M.
