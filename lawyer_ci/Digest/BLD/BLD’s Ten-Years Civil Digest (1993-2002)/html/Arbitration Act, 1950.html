Clause 14 is an arbitration clause stipulating not only that the parties shall submit all their disputes to arbitration but also that the arbitration shall be “in accordance with, and subject to the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1950”.

Ltd. vs. British Airways PLC, 17 BLD (AD) 249</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Bangladesh Courts and English Law</strong></p><p>It is true that Bangladesh Courts often follow the English Law when there is no municipal law on the subject, as in the field of Marine Insurance, but in the English Arbitration Act, 1950, the procedural law includes the forum for administration of the procedure and it is a poor defence to say that clause 14 has not settled the venue of arbitration. If the arbitration “is in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1950”, the parties do not have to travel far to look out for the venue beyond the Arbitration Act, 1950.
