In both the cases deposit of 50% of the decreetal amount is necessary. Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not applicable in such a situation for enabling the petitioner to avoid the statutory requirement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Md.

Because it is only such a financial institution which is entitled to institute a suit before the Adalat for realisation of any advance made to any party as a loan. The Artha Rin Adalat is a civil Court of defined nature and limited jurisdictional and it does not enjoy all the powers of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Kazi Jawaherul Islam (K.J.

Artha Rin Adalat act is a special law which has been designed for deciding only those cases which are for recovery of loans from the borrowers. In the instant case, the petitioner has not borrowed any money from the Bank and as such the Artha Rin Ada- tat acted illegally and without jurisdiction in trying and decreeing the suit<strong>. </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Md.

The option is with the financial institution either to bring a suit under Section 5(1) of the Act or to take recourse to the special procedures provided in the relevant law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case the Corporation having already brought the proceedings’ under Article 27 of P.O.No 7 of 1973; this proceeding cannot be transferred to the Artha Rin Adalat, which has jurisdiction to try a suit and not a proceeding under Article 27 of P.O.

In the instant case the suit has been filed not for realisation of any loan money from the defendant who was admittedly not a loanee, but he misappropriated the bank’s money.

Admittedly, the opposite parties are not financial institutions for which the Adalat under the provisions of Artha Rin Adalat Act cannot legally pass any order as to how the suits filed under general law would proceed simultaneously or otherwise with suits filed in Adalat under the provisions of Artha Rin Adalat Act and as such the Adalat acted beyond its jurisdiction conferred by section 5 of the Act for which the impugned order are amenable to revisional jurisdiction under section 115 of the Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>United Commercial Bank Limited Vs Messrs.

Section 5(5) of the Act provides that the Artha Rin Adalat will follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure in so far as these are not contrary to the provisions of the Act. The Artha Rin Adalat is a special forum of limited jurisdiction and it is not an ordinary civil court.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Sultan Alam @ S.A. Badal Vs.

Section 5(5) of the Act makes the Code of Civil Procedure applicable to the proceedings of the Artha Rin Adalat, but only if the Adalat Act does not contain anything different. In fact, this Act has made several significant departures from the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Artha Rin Adalat Act contains four different kinds of subject matters, namely (i) jurisdictional matter setting out the parameter and boundaries of the Special Court set up under the special legislation (Section 5(1) read with Section 2(ka) and (Kha) (ii) establishment of the Special Court and its administration (Sections 4 and 5(2) and 3); (iii) the procedural provisions (Sections 5(4),(5) (5ka) (6)and 6); and (iv) substantive rights. (Right of appeal under Section 7)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Artha Rin Adalat is not a full-fledged Civil Court with all the powers and jurisdiction of a Civil Court. It is a Civil Court of a defined and limited jurisdiction. The Artha Rin Adalat Am does not give the Artha Rin Adalat any jurisdiction to adjudicate upon any matter other than that provided in Section 5(1) of the Act. A defendant, therefore, cannot claim a set-off or counter-claim in a suit filed under the Adalat Act as Rule 6 of Order 8 is inconsistent with the jurisdictional provision of the Adalat Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The High Court Division has no jurisdiction to entertain an application under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure against any interlocutory order passed by the Artha Rin Adalat.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Sultana Jute Mills Ltd. and others Vs.

No special procedure has been provided for trial of Artha Rin Suits under the said Am. But to expedite disposal of those suits certain provisions have been made and power to file an application under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code and prefer appeal before the High Court Division have been given subject to deposit of half (½) of the decretal dues. Under sub-section (4) of section 5 of the Am Artha Rin Adalat is deemed to be a civil court and under sub-section (5) of section 5 Adalat is regulated by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure unless there is anything contrary in the Am. On going through the provisions of the Am we do not find any provision therein which is contrary to the provision of Order 9 Rule 9 of the Code. Unless the order of dismissal for default is allowed to be set aside the plaintiff bank would suffer loss and the borrower would be benefited. It is not the intention of Am to deprive a financial institution from realisation of its just dues from the borrower though there is sufficient reason for non-appearance of the plaintiff financial institution in Court on the date of hearing of the suit.

Sub-section (5) of section 5 thereof makes the provisions of the said Code applicable, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the conduct of proceedings in an Artha Rin Adalat. Order 9, Rule 9 is an integral part of the Code. There is no specific bar to an application under Order 9 Rule 9 in the cases under the Act.

Section 6 of the Act enjoins for payment of at least half of the decreetal amount for filing an appeal from the decree passed by an Artha Rin Adalat. While Section 5 confers upon the Artha Rin Adalat exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide any suit for recovery of loan by a financial institution, Section 7 provides the forum for appeal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 6 of the Land Reforms Ordinance, 1984 provides that land used as homestead in the rural area is exempt from all legal processes including sale and the owner of such land cannot be dispossessed or evicted therefrom by any means by any office, Court or any other authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the preamble of the Land Reforms Ordinance, 1984 it is seen that this Ordinance was promulgated for the purpose of reform of the law relating to land tenure, land holding and land transfer with a view to maximising the production and for ensuring better relationships between the land owners and the bargaders. Read in the light of the preamble it is held that Section 6 of the Land Reforms Ordinance does not exclude the jurisdiction of Artha Rin Adalat, a creature of a subsequent Act and special legislation for quick recovery of money from loanees by financial institutions and as such execution of a decree passed by an Artha Rin Adalat by way of sale of the mortgaged property, including a homestead, is not barred under the law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Messers Rabeya Oil Mills Vs Janata Bank and another, 16 BLD (HCD) 301.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br/> <strong>Sections—5, 6, 7 and 8</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A combined reading of sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Am makes it abundantly clear that the Adalat Ain special Courts for prompt realization of loans by financial institutions and such a Court is a civil court only for limited purposes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A revisional application under section 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure against any Interlocutory order passed by an Artha Rin Adalat is not maintainable in law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Belayet Hossan vs. Bank Indosuez, 18 BLD (HCD) 291.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ref: 14 BLD (AD) 195 46 DLR (AD) 174—Cited.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br/> <strong>Section—6</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Interlocutory Order</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Interlocutory order passed by the Artha Rin Adalat is not amenable to revisional jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Iftekhar Afzal Vs Pubali Bank Ltd.

Section 7 prescribes two conditions to be satisfied by an appellant—one the appeal must be preferred within 30 days from the date of the decree and the other, no appeal shall be entertained unless half of the decretal amount is deposited in the court making the decree. Section 7 of the Am nowhere speaks about bank guarantee. The expression 5Tf used in sub-section (2) of section 7 of the Act cannot be construed to be “Bank Guarantee”.
