But the Constitution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on November, 1972 and came into force on the 16th December 1972 with the disqualification clause under reference as it is. No necessity of constitutional amendment in respect of Article 66(2) (c) of the Constitution was ever felt in keeping with the spirit of Article 2B of the P0 149 of 1972—Bangladesh Citizenship (Temporary Provisions) Order, 1972, (P 0 149 of 1972), Article—2B.</p><p><strong>Md Abdul Halim Vs Mr. Md Abul Hasan Chowdhury Kaiser &amp; Others, 21 BLD (HCD) 391</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Citizenship</strong></p><p>Clause (c) requires to give an ordinary meaning and to do otherwise would amount to violating the language and expression used therein. Article 66(2)(c) should therefore be construed to mean that a citizen of Bangladesh is permitted to acquire a citizenship of a foreign State as provided under Article 2B(2) of the P0 149 of 1972. But if a person is found to be a citizen of Bangladesh as well as a citizen of any foreign State either on the date when he files nomination paper for the Parliamentary election or if such person acquires citizenship of a foreign state after he was elected as a member of parliament, he becomes disqualified to contest the election or to continue as a member of the Parliament—Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972, Article—66(2)(c)</p><p><strong>Md Abdul Halim Vs Mr. Md Abul Hasan Chowdhury Kaiser &amp; Others, 21 BLD (HCD) 391.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong><u style="text-underline: thick;">CLAIM BY THIRD PARTY</u></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Claim by third party—</strong>Where a third party has claimed property under attachment in execution of a decree and filed an application under the provision of law, it becomes the duty of the court to investigate the claim.

It was also not formed with petitioner Nos. 2-5 as nominee-directors. The petitioner-company was still seeking the permission of Bangladesh Bank to include them in its Board of Directors. When the petitioner company was not formed at all with petitioner Nos.2-5 as its directors, there is no question of acquiring any fundamental right to continue with petitioner Nos. 2-5 as its directors. Besides the petitioner company was formed in 1995 after the "ARTHIK PROTISTHAN AIN 1993, was enacted on 30.9.93. It was already governed by the restrictions imposed by section 25(3) of the said Act.

No person other than a retiring director or a nominee director shall be eligible for election to the office of the director at any General Meeting unless he is recommended by the directors. This will not apply if a member has left at the office a notice in writing under his hand or under the hand of such agent signifying his assent to his candidature at least 7 clears days before the meeting. I am unable to agree that the word ‘recommendation’ occurring in Article connotes mere scrutiny without any authority to choose. I take the simple dictionary meaning of the word ‘recommendation’. I mean speaking favourably of a person for the purpose of election. Yet I hold that the appeal must fail because the appellants have no locus standi to maintain the appeal not being themselves aggrieved by the election.
