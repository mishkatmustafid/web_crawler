The phrase to appear and answer the appeal’ admits of one simple construction, requiring the respondents to appear on the day fixed for hearing of the appeal under rule 16(2) and answer the points raised by the appellants in support of their appeal. So, rule 12 does not, in any way, empower and/or authorise the appellate Court either to allow a respondent to file a written statement for the first time in appeal or to accept such written statement—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908),Order XLI Rule 12.</p><p>Narayan Chandra Saha and another Vs.
