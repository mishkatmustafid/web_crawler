It is something which is given to bind the contract as an earnest or token of good faith and as a guarantee that the giver will fulfill his part of the contract.</p><p>The Privy Council characterised ‘earnest money’ as a part of the purchase price when the transaction goes forward. Earnest money is usually forfeited when the transaction falls through by reason of the fault or failure of the vendee. Earnest money to bind a contract must follow and not precede the contract. When there is no meeting of minds of the parties consensus an idem, there cannot be any question of earnest money.</p><p>In the instant case, the earnest of 2% sent by the plaintiffs was an earnest for their proposal as asked for by the defendant and not an earnest as consideration in part of any agreement. It was demanded as a token of the bonafide of the proposal of the plaintiffs which they complied with. Therefore, it is clear that encashment of the Bank draft by the defendant. whether it was legal/proper, cannot be construed as an acceptance of an earnest money forming part of consideration for the agreement.

In case where the tender is accepted the money is also not encashed and the deposit remains as security money to be adjusted against final bills. This is the normal practice followed in case of a public tender. In case of a single private tender the question of encashment does not arise unless the proposal is accepted. The encashment of the earnest money is itself a vital proof indicating that the offer was accepted. [Per Latifur Rahman.
