Any person professing any faith is entitled to bring a suit for the purposes enumerated in section 5 of the Ordinance. A Hindu wife is therefore entitled to bring a suit for maintenance in the Family Court—Family Court Ordinance, 1985 (XVIII of 1985), Sections-3 and 5.</p><p><strong>Nirmal Kanti Das Vs.

Rekha appeared before the trial Court and expressed her willingness to live with her mother who was divorced long ago by petitioner Abdur Razzaque. Abdur Razzaque had already taken a second wife and he did not take any care of his minor daughter nor did he pay any maintenance to her so far except giving her small gifts at times. Considering the welfare of the child, the High Court Division was right in refusing to the petitioner the custody of Rekha-- Guardian and Wards Act, 1890 (VIII of 1890), Section -25.</p><p><strong>Abdur Razzaque Sarder Vs.

Bombay Municipal Corporation (1985) 3 S.C.C. 454 that “Article 37 provides that the directive principles, though not enforceable by any Court, are nevertheless fundamental in the Governance of the country. The principles contained in Articles 39(a) and 41 must be regarded as equally fundamental in the understanding and interpretation of the meaning and content of fundamental rights. If there is an obligation upon the State to secure to the citizens an adequate means of livelihood and the right to work, it would be sheer pedantry to exclude the right to livelihood from the content of the right to life. The State may not, by affirmative actions, be compellable to provide adequate means of livelihood or work to the citizens. But any person, who is deprived of his right to livelihood except according to just and fair procedure established by law, can challenge the deprivation as offending the right to live conferred by Article 21—Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972, Articles —27, 30 and 32.</p><p><strong>Ain 0 Salish Kendra (ASK) &amp; ors.
