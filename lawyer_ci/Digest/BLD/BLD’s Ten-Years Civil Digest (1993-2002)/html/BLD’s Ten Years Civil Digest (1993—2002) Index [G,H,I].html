The distinction between ‘Hiba’ (gift) and ‘Ariyat’ in Muslim Law stems from some basic distinctions between the concept of property in English Law and Muslim Law. In the instant case, the alleged deed of gift is found to be not a gift of the corpus but a gift of the usufructs for life in favour of the wife of the donor and this is permissible under the Muslim Law as it stands today in the subcontinent.</p><p><strong>Rabjel Mondal Vs.

The purpose of iddat after divorce is four fold, first, to allow the parties to reconciliate and to give the divorce a go by in the cases of Talaq Ahsan or Talaq Hasan, secondly, to ascertain whether the woman is carrying any offspring of her husband in the womb or not, so that the legitimacy of the child remains beyond dispute, thirdly, to prevent re-marriage of the woman during the period of iddat in order not to forestall reconciliation and to avoid future controversies on legitimacy and fourthly. to make arrangements for the maintenance of the woman during the period of iddat.</p><p><strong>Md.

They abstained from opposing the express ruling of commentators of great antiquity and high authority because they were not qualified to do so. A person who ventures to interpret the Holy Quran (1) shall be a Muttaqi (2) must have a wide knowledge of Hadith in connection with the Prophet’ s(s) interpretation of the Holy Quran and with the statements of his sahabis (companions) and their successive companions (3) have a knowledge about those parts of the Holy Quran which have been repealed or substituted (4) have a knowledge about the significance of each Ayat (5) have a knowledge about Ilmul Kirat (6) have a profound knowledge of the Arabic language, grammar, diction etc. as the H61y Quran was revealed in the Arabic language (7) must have a thorough knowledge of all the major commentaries and works of different Schools of thought, (8) must be a faqih and other qualifications as well, not necessarily limited to and special preserves of Ulemas.</p><p><strong>Md.
