Chapter—IT of Part—VI of the Constitution allots a separate and distinct existence of judicial service and magistrates exercising judicial function. Under Article 109 the High Court Division of the Supreme Court has been vested with the powers of superintendence and control over all courts and tribunals subordinate to it.

(Judicial) Cadre as if it is a civil service was not only within the contemplation of Article 136, but was also violative of the constitutional scheme. Amalgamation is possible and permissible between allied services. Judicial service may be amalgamated with judicial magistrates pursuing a judicial career all the way. But as oil and. water cannot mix, the judicial and civil administrative executive services are nonamalgarnable. [Per Mustafa Kamal ,CJ. 1— Constitute of Bangladesh, 1972, Article-136.</p><p><strong>Secretary, Ministry of Finance Vs. Mr. Md. Masdar Hossain, 20 BLD (AD) 104.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Judicial service</strong></p><p>As per Article 152(1) of the Constitution ‘judicial service’ means a service comprising persons holding judicial posts not being posts superior to that of District Judge. It appears that a person holding judicial post from Assistant Judge to that of a District Judge belongs to judicial service. Chapter II of Part VI of the Constitution deals with subordinate courts. Articles 115, 116 and 1 16A speak of persons employed in ‘judicial service’ and ‘magistrates exercising judicial functions’. It is clear that the members of the judicial service and the magistrates exercising judicial functions exercise judicial power of the State as distinct and separate from executive power and other cadre services of the State. Article 1 16A also contemplates that the members of the judicial service and magistrate exercising judicial functions shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. It is to be borne in min1 that judicial functions is distinct from other functions as visualized in the Constitution itself.

The nature and character of their function are different. Article 22 has emphasized on separation of the judiciary from the executive. Sub-paragraph (6) of paragraph 6 of the Transitional and Temporary Provisions of the Fourth Schedule mandates compliance of Chapter II of Part VI of the Constitution which in effect requires all concerned to maintain, preserve and protect the independence of the judiciary and also to enhance the separation of the judiciary from the executive and preserve the then arrangement as a temporary and transitional one—Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972, Articles—22, 133, 137 and 140, Part IV, Chapter II, Para—6(6)</p><p><strong>Secretary, Ministry of Finance and others Vs Mr. Md.

Article 133 cannot be invoked for the judicial officers—Judicial officials are not persons in the service of the Republic for the purpose of Article 133 and hence rules regarding their appointment and conditions of service cannot be framed under Article 133.</p><p><strong>Secretary, Ministry of Finance and others Vs Mr. Md.

First, there has to be an existence of a liability of repayment of a loan. Secondly, there has to be default in re-payment of loan in terms of the agreement. Thirdly, the properties to be taken over and/or sold by the Sangstha must have to be a property pledged, mortgaged, hypothecated or assigned by the industrial concern to secure its liability to the Sangstha. The power under clause (1) can be exercised if the aforesaid conditions are fulfilled and the ouster clause (5) comes into play when the Sangstha acts in consonance with clause (1) and not otherwise. In this regard the expression “under clause (1)” occurring in clause (5) and the expression “such taking over or transfer” in the said clause and clause (5)(a)(i)(ii)(iii) are particularly noticeable. In other words, if the conditions of clause (i) are not fulfilled the ouster clause (5) does not operate. In that case the purported action under clause (1) would be taken without jurisdiction. Such a case will not come within the mischief of clause (5).</p><p><strong>Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha Vs.

The frame of the suit itself is necessary to be taken into consideration before deciding whether the suit is triable by the S.C.C. Court or not. It is a settled question of law that Court of Small Cause is not entitled to consider the question of title but incidentally it can go into the question of title. In the instant case the learned S.C.C.

Suit and the relief sought by the plaintiff is ejectment of the defendant from the suit premises claiming that the suit land belonged to them without filing a suit for declaration of title and under the garb of Small Cause Courts Act, they tried to evict the defendant, such a suit is not maintainable in law.</p><p><strong>Dr. Abdul Gani Vs.

The legitimate expectation of a person can be enforced only when he has got a legal right.</p><p>The expression ‘legitimate expectation’ first used by Lord Denning has by now been established as a principle of law. This principle in essence imposes a duty to act fairly and it requires the concerned authorities to act reasonably in dealing with the rights and interests of the people under given circumstances. If there is any breach of such right or interest, the court should not be slow in upholding it. if the situation so demands, the court shall strike down such orders in exercise of its power of judicial review of executive actions.</p><p><strong>Bangladesh Soya-Protein Project Ltd. v.

When the Ordinance, a special enactment, excludes the application of section 5 of the Limitation Act for condonation of delay to an appeal it cannot be hold that the learned District Judge failed to exercise his jurisdiction vested under section 134(5) of the Ordinance in not condoning delay in filing the appeal.
