In the previous verse it has been stated that in the case of a pregnant woman her period of Iddat will be till delivery. It is therefore apparent that the maintenance has been related to the period of iddat, The interpretation given by the learned Judges is thus apparently in conflict of the aforesaid verse... From the above, it is clear that the interpretation given by the learned Judges is not and cannot be acceptable because it brings conflict and even on the general criterion of interpretation as they also would not deny that a document should be read as a whole, the interpretation of the learned Judges must be rejected.</p><p><strong>Md.

During the period of Martial law many acts and things were done in pursuance of those Martial Law Regulations. Hence it was necessary to give a constitutional validity, ratification and confirmation to ensure constitutional continuity. By imposing Martial Law existing legal order was changed and a new legal order was promulgated outside the constitutional mandate and as such the constitutional coverage was sought to be given by paragraphs 3A and 18 of the Fourth Schedule. As a matter of fact, Constitution (Fifth Amendment) has given a post facto validation to all acts and things of that period. These paragraphs are like Indemnity Act which is passed after every declaration of Martial Law, ratifying and validating all acts and things done during that period.
