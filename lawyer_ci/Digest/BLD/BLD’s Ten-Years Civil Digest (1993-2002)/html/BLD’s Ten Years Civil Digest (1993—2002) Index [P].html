Proof Dicey in his introduction to the study of the Law of Constitution says:</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">“Nothing is harder to define than the extent of the indefinite powers or rights possessed by either House of Parliament under the head of privilege or law and custom of Parliament.”:</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Parliamentary privilege is indeed, to use the language of Reddish, which has been quoted by May in his “Parliamentary Practice”:</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">“The sum of the fundamental rights of the House and of its individual members as against the prerogatives of the Crown, the authority of the ordinary courts of law and the special rights of the House of Lords”</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The resignation letters submitted by 147 members of the Parliament to the respondent No. 1, The Speaker is outside the ambit of Article 78(1). of our Constitution inasmuch as the act of submission of resignation to the Speaker by the members of Parliament though in connection with the business of the House, yet it does not from a part of the proceeding of the Parliament within the meaning of Article. 78(1) of the Constitution of Bangladesh and that too is one stage ahead of the business of the Parliament. That stage will reach the moment ‘the Speaker shall bring the fact to the notice of the House, if it is in session in accordance with the provision of Rule 178(3) of the Rules of the Procedure of Parliament of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">From a close analysis of the decisions cited at the Bar it is manifestly clear that the action brought before the court in those cases had their origin in the proceeding-in parliament and were immune from judicial scrutiny and were protected “parliamentary privileges”. In the instant case, submission of resignation in masse (en bloc) to the Speaker is not immune from judicial review. . Under clause (2) of Article 67 of the Constitution a member of the Parliament may resign his seat by writing under his hand addressed to the Speaker of the Parliament. The expression “addressed to the Speaker” used in clause (2) of Article 67 has no protection of Article 78(1) of the Constitution inasmuch as resignation letters submitted to the Speaker does not fall within the ambit of the expression “proceeding of parliament” as envisaged in Article 78(1) of the Constitution. The High Court Division held that it committed no mistake in issuing Rules in the Writ Petitions nor has it transgressed upon its jurisdiction conferred under Article 102 (2) (a) (ii) and (i) less of the Constitution and it did not come in conflict with the Parliament by invading the domain of Parliamentary Privilege” or stretching its sleeve to any proceeding of the Parliament. Thus, the contention raised at the Bar to oust the jurisdiction of the High Court Division is the result of misconceived idea about the constitutional provisions of this Article and accordingly, it fails.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Md.

When an applicant’s prayer is allowed under section 4 of Partition Act, it involves a kind of forced sale for the stranger purchaser. Hence,, the court would in equity determine the valuation of the transferred share on the date of filing of the application for permission to .purchase the share of the stranger purchaser.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sayesta Bibi and others Vs.

If properties are left out in a partition suit it brooks further litigation. It is true that this rule is relaxable. But there are specific situations calling for relaxation. They are generally (a) where different portions of the property lie in different jurisdictions, or (b) when some portion of the property is at the time incapable of partition, or (c) when the property from its nature is impartible, or (d) when the property is held jointly with strangers who cannot be joined as parties to a general suit for partition, or (e) where co-tenamts, by natural agreement, decide to make partition of part of the joint property retaining the rest in common.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Nurul Afsar Vs.

Accordingly the suit is sent back on remand to the trial court for affording an opportunity to the plaintiff to implead the Shahabuddin as defendant in the suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sabed Ali Howlader and ors.

But when a suit is filed for partition and for recovery of possession, then the plaintiff has to pay ad-valorem court fee on the value of his share of the suit property under Section 7(VIA) of the ‘Court-Fees Act. When the plaintiffs Suit is for declaration of his title and partition then also he is required to pay advalorem court fee on his share of the suit property—Court Fees Act, 1870 (VII of 1870).</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Mahmoodul Huq and others Vs.

Hence, although his suit for declaration of title has been dismissed, he is free to agitate the question of his entitlement to a specific portion of the property in a properly framed partition suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Mrs. Sabiha Khanam Vs.
