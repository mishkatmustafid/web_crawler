Termination order which gives all the termination benefits is to be deemed to have been passed under Section 19 of the Act, although it was passed in pursuance of a proceeding. When an employee is given all the benefits of the termination under Section 19 of the Act and the termination order is without any stigma, he cannot approach the Labour Court under Section 25.</p><p><strong>The Managing Director, Bangladesh Consumer’s Supplies Company Ltd.

The corporation having violated the mandatory provision for removing an employee from the service, the order of removal is illegal and without lawful authority.—Government Servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1984, Rule 7, Sub-rule 11.</p><p><strong>Md. Mahfuzur Rahman Vs. Bangladesh Forest Industries Development Corporation, 13 BLD (HCD) 1.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter</strong></p><p>Rule 22 prescribes the manner of disposal of an Appeal by an aggrieved Govt.

A.K.M. Faziul Karim and another, 15 BLD (AD) 114.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service Matter</strong></p><p><strong>Enquiry Procedure</strong></p><p>An officer or employee of the Parjatan Corporation is not entitled to a second show cause notice since the Rules do not specifically so provide. The respondent was given a second show cause notice ex gratia. Since the principle of natural justice was duly followed in conducting the enquiry, there could be no grievance on this ground. But since the enquiry was not conducted in conformity with the Rules the ultimate order of the High Court Division was maintained—Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation Service Rules, 1980, Rule 57 (1)(2).</p><p><strong>Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation, Dhaka V. A KM Abul Kalam, 15 BLD (AD) 127.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Service Matter</strong></p><p><strong>Notification can be challenged straightway before the Administrative Tribunal.</strong></p><p>The First Proviso of Section 4(2) of the Act is attracted when there is a higher administrative authority to take decision in respect of any order or action to be impugned before the tribunal. In the instant case, there being no higher administrative authority to redress their grievance the appellants are entitled to challenge the impugned notification straightway before the Administrative Tribunal within 6 months under Second proviso to Section 4(2) of the Act—Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 (VII of 1981), Section-4(2).</p><p><strong>Abdul Mannan and others Vs. Mr. Hasan Mahmud Khandker and others, 16 BLD (AD) 147.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter—Dismissal</strong></p><p>Dismissal from service is a serious matter and only a competent authority under the law is entitled to pass an order of dismissal. The resolutions which have been relied upon by the learned Advocate for the appellant are clearly not adequate enough to read in them a power authorising the Director General to dismiss a person appointed by the Parishad.</p><p><strong>Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy Vs. Janab Shahidul Islam and another, 17 BLD (AD) 245.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter—Optional Retirement</strong></p><p>Sub-section (1) of Section 9 gives a public servant the option to retire from service any time after he has completed 25 years of service by giving 30 days’ written notice to his appointing authority. Sub-section (2) of section 9 gives the Government the option to retire in the public interest a public servant any time after he has completed 25 years of services without assigning any reason.</p><p>In the instant case, none of the petitioners has completed 25 years of service and the impugned retirement order was made not in the public interest but it was done in effecting retrenchment in the Corporation. Moreover, under sub-section (2) of Section 9 of the Act the authority to order retirement vests in the Government and not in the Corporation. Consequently, the impugned order of retirement must be held to be illegal and without jurisdiction—Public Servants (Retirement) Act, 1974 (XII of 1974), Section —9(1)(2).</p><p><strong>Abul Hossain and others Vs. Bangladesh Jute Corporation and others, 15 BLD (HCD) 341.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter—Pensions</strong></p><p>The Bank’s service regulations adopted the Bangladesh Service Rules for payment relating to pensions for its permanent employees, but the Bangladesh Service Rules have no provision for payment of pension to terminated officers. As Rule 342(2) of the said Rules caters for a situation similar to termination simplicitier by providing for retiring pension to an officer who is required by the Government to retire after completing twenty-five years of service, without giving any reason, a term is implied into the Bank’s Service Regulations that Rule 342(2) shall apply to employees terminated without assignment of reason—Rupali Bank Employees Service Regulations 1981, Regulation—16, Bangladesh Services Rules 1983, Rule—342(2).</p><p><strong>M. A. Jalil v. Rupali Bank Ltd. and others, 22 BLD (HCD) 264.</strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Service matter—Leniency in punishment</strong></p><p>An unblemished record of 22 years of service provides a good ground for awarding a less harsh sentence in the form of compulsory retirement in place of dismissal from service. But it can never be a good ground for reinstating the employee in the service of the Bank when the authority has decided to remove him for lack of confidence in him. In the circumstances, an order of compulsory retirement is substituted in place of the order of reinstatement made by the Administrative Tribunal.</p><p><strong>Sonali Bank Vs. Ruhul Amin Khan, 14 BLD (AD) 171.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter—Removal</strong></p><p>The removal of the petitioner under Regulation 56(2) is not a termination simpliciter. As a matter of fact it is not a case of termination but it is a case of removal from service in the garb of termination—Chittagong Development Authority Employees (service) Regulation, 1990, Regulation—56(2)</p><p><strong>Chittagong Development Authority and others Vs. Engineer Abul Kalam and another, 19 BLD (AD) 9.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter—Retirement of Navy officer</strong></p><p>Rule 14(5) of the Navy Rules empowers the Government to retire any Officer at any time without assigning any reason whatsoever—Navy Ordinance, 1961 and Navy Rules 1961.</p><p><strong>Rear Admiral A.A. Mustafa Vs. Bangladesh, 14 BLD (AD) 16.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter</strong></p><p>The expression ‘to carry out the purpose of this Order’ as employed in Article 40(1) includes power of appointment, removal, dismissal etc. of the employees of the Bar Council. No doubt, Article 40(3) authorises the Government in absence of framing of the Rules to exercise the power of the Bar Council but Article 40(3) does not oust the power of the Bar Council explicitly. According to Article 10(J) of the Order, the Bar Council is vested with the authority to perform function conferred on it under this Order—Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Order and Rules, 1972, Article—40(i)(3); 10(j); 40(k); Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Section—115(1).</p><p><strong>Bangladesh Bar Council Vs. Basiruddin Ahmed, 21 BLD (AD) 83.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter—Continued ill-health</strong></p><p>A person may suffer from continued illness but it does not necessarily mean that he suffers from continued ill-health. The interpretation of the word ‘continued ill-health’ should be kept as flexible as possible so as to accommodate individual cases or class of cases of ill-health within the scope of those words, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case.</p><p><strong>M/s. Karim Jute Mills Ltd. Vs. Chairman, Second Labour Court, Dhaka and another, 17 BLD (AD) 208.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter—Aggrieved person and necessary party</strong></p><p>Although there is no guidance in the Act or in the Rules framed thereunder to determine the question of necessary parties and the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure have got very limited application to a case before the Administrative Tribunal, but still then as a general rule all necessary parties must be impleaded so that the tribunal may effectually adjudicate on all matters before it.</p><p>Since the appellants are claiming relief against the Government alone, the case cannot be held to be bad for defect of parties for non-impleading respondent Nos. 1-15. But since the order of the tribunal was likely to prejudice them in the matter of their seniority they are ‘aggrieved’ persons within the meaning of Section 6(2) of the Act— Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 (VII of 1981), Section—6(2.).</p><p><strong>Md. Abdul Mannan and others Vs. Mr. Hasan Mahmud Khandker and others, 16 BLD (AD) 147.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter—Interim relief by Administrative Tribunal Although the Code of Civil Procedure</strong></p><p>has been made applicable for specified purposes to the proceedings before the Administrative Tribunal yet it is not a Civil Court exercising all the powers of the Court provided under the Code of Civil Procedure. The Administrative Tribunal cannot grant interim relief in respect of a case pending before it— Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 (VII of 1981), Section—7.</p><p><strong>Kamrul Hasan Vs. Bangladesh and others, 16 BLD (AD) 35.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter</strong></p><p>Article 133 of the Constitution regulates the conditions of service of Government servants and they come under protection of Article 135. The services in the Bank and other statutory bodies are not protected by Article 135 of the Constitution.</p><p><strong>Bangladesh Bank and others Vs. Mohammad Abdul Mannan, 14 BLD (AD) 117.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter—Uncontroverted material assertion</strong></p><p>The failure of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal to consider the legal incidence of an uncontroverted material assertion of the petitioner before the Administrative Tribunal and the pleadings of the parties in juxtaposition renders its decision untenable.</p><p><strong>A.K. Mohammad ldris Vs. Bangladesh Krishi Bank and others, 16 BLD (AD) 33.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter</strong></p><p>It provides that on the expiration of 180 days from the date of notice of the proceeding the employee proceeded against shall stand exonerated from all the allegations if in the meantime the authority has not taken the final decision in the matter.</p><p>Appointment of an Enquiry Committee after the proceeding lost its force on the expiration of 180 days is illegal and void— Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation Petrobangla) Ordinance, 1985, Service Regulation No-42(8).</p><p><strong>Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla) and another Vs. Bazlul Karim, 16 BLD (AD) 25.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter</strong></p><p><strong>Equality before law—Seniority in Service</strong></p><p>Regulation 18 (c) envisages that the order of merit in which the recruits are placed in the training and the date of completion of their training are the deciding factors in counting seniority in service. T training of the recruits in batches not being a requirement of law, the grouping of persons for training recruited in the said examinations held under the same advertisement should be held to be one training programme which started on 15.10.1989 and ended on 25.1.1990. The seniority list was, therefore, required to be prepared in order of merit on the completion of the training programme as merit of the recruits at the end of the training governs the question of seniority. Since no reasonable basis for classification for placing in groups or training could be proved, there. was enough scope for arbitrary selection which is violative of the equality clause enshrined by Article 27 of the Constitution— Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972, Article — 27, Bangladesh Biman Employees (Service) Regulation, 1979, Regulation -18(c).</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Aminul Huq and others Vs. Rafiqul Hassan and others, 16 BLD (AD) 174.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter</strong></p><p><strong>Functions of the Public Service Commission</strong></p><p>As a general rule regularization of appointment of the Cadre Service takes effect from the date of recommendation by the Public Service Commission. Since the appellants were promoted as A.S.Ps. on an officiating basis without the recommendation of the Public Service Commission their claim for seniority from the date of their such appointment or from any date prior to the recommendation by the Public Service Commission is not tenable in law—Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972, Article —140, Bangladesh Civil Service Seniority Rules, 1983, Rules-3, 5 and 6, Cadre Rules, 1980, Rule-3</p><p><strong>Md. Abdul Mannan and others Vs. Mr. Hasan Mahmud Khandker and others, 16 BLD (AD) 147.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter</strong></p><p>When it is found that before removing the respondent from service the University authority thrice asked him to show cause as to why he should not be removed from service for violation of service discipline in refusing to vacate the staff quarter illegally occupied by him, and he fully availed of those opportunities, the plea of vic5lation of the principle of natural justice cannot be entertained—Dhaka University Order, 1973 (P,O. 11 of 1973), Article -59(2).</p><p><strong>Dhaka University Vs. Syed Md. Ismail, 16 BLD (AD) 103.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter</strong></p><p><strong>Departmental proceeding and proceeding in a Court of law </strong></p><p>It is well settled that on the selfsame allegation a departmental proceeding against an employee is competent besides a proceeding in a Court of law.</p><p>The respondent was compulsorily retired following an independent departmental enquiry in which he examined witnesses in his defence and the said order was affirmed in appeal filed under the Rules. In these circumstances, irrespective of the question as to whether conviction on a criminal charge in a Martial Law Court is covered by Rule 8 of the Rules or not, the order of punishment cannot be interfered with in the absence of any fault in the departmental proceedings— Government Servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1976, Rules -3(C) and 8.</p><p><strong>Government of Bangladesh Vs. Md. Abdul Karim, 16 BLD (AD) 99.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter</strong></p><p>Inspite of some amount of dubiousness on the part of the Government as regards the absorption of the respondent the aggrieved employee is entitled to get the benefit. of doubt in his favour, A double standard treatment on the part of the executive government while dealing with its different employees is to be deprecated—Surplus Public Servants Absorption Ordinance,1985 (XXIV of 1985), Sections—5 and 6.</p><p><strong>The Director General, NSI Vs. Md. Sultan Ahmed, 16 BLD (AD) 76.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Service matter</strong></p><p>The cumulative effect of Rules 3 and 4 of the Bangladesh Biman Employees (Pension and Gratuity) Rules, 1988 is that an employee of the Corporation irrespective of sex has the right to be in service till completion of 57 years of age.</p><p>Since even after amendment of regulation 11 in 1984 there has been no corresponding amendment of Rules 3 and 4, which prescribed retirement on completion of 57 years, the subsequent amendment which was not in existence at the time of appointment of the petitioner cannot curtail or reduce her age limit from 57 years to 35 years as it does not have any sanction of law. This is also violative of Article 28 of the Constitution— Bangladesh Biman Employees (Pension and Gratuity) Rules, 1988, Rules -3 and 4.</p><p><strong>Jonaba Dalia Parveen Vs.

But this extension is not a right guaranteed under any law as a fundamental, right and it i subject to conditions laid down in Clauses (a) to (e) of sub- regulation (3) of Regulation No. 27. Extension of service as contemplated in Regulation No. 26 being merely a privilege, the right of extension for continuing in service on the basis of a resolution is not a fundamental right that can be enforced in writ jurisdiction—Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972, Article— 102, Recognized Non-Government Secondary School Teachers (Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dhaka) Terms and Conditions of Service Regulations, 1979, Regulations -2(a), 26 and 27.</p><p><strong>Mir Abu Bakar Siddique Vs.

On general principles and in exercise of its inherent power and executing Court can entertain and give effect to a claim to set off, even in cases which do not come strictly under Order XXI Rule 19 of the Code. An equitable set off can be claimed in a case where cross demands arise out of the same transaction or where they are so connected in nature or circumstances that it would be inequitable to allow one party to execute his decree depriving the other party to separate proceedings. No party as of right can claim such set off, which may be granted by a Court in its discretion to be exercised judicially—Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (V of 1908), Order XXI Rule 19.</p><p><strong>Shankar Lal Das v.
