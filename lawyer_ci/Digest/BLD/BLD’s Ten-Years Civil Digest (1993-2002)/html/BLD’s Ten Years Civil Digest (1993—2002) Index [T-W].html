It should take notice under section 114(e) of the Evidence Act and should start with the presumption of regularity in official business. Initially, in the writ petition itself, the writ petitioner must include some reliable and relevant materials to show that between the last date of fixation of tariff value and the impugned date of fixation of tariff value the international market price of a particular importer item has either gone down or has gone up to an extent which is significantly higher or lower than the impugned fixation of tariff value. If there are no such materials in the writ petition itself the High Court Division should not entertain the petition and dismiss it in limine.</p><p align="justify">If the writ petitioner annexes relevant and reliable documents in support of its claim that the impugned fixation of tariff value is grossly inflated and is abnormally higher than the prevalent international market price the High Court Division will issue a Rule Nisi and may or may not pass an interim order keeping in view the decision reported in 50 DLR(AD)( 1998) 129.</p><p align="justify"><strong>Mustafa Kamal, Proprietor of MIs.

This section describes how the tariff value of imported goods and exported goods will be determined, the assumptions on the basis of which the normal price of such goods will be determined and the meaning of some words used in that section. This is an executive power, not a legislative power—Customs Act, 1969 (IV of 1969), Sec tion—25.</p><p align="justify"><strong>Mustafa Kamal Vs.

Although proviso to the said section provides that the Board under exceptional circumstances recorded in writing, extend the period of final assessment under this subsection but the respondents have failed to produce any paper to show that either final assessment of the customs duty of the imported goods was made within the said stipulated time or time was extended to the customs authority by the Board for such final settlement. In the instant case the respondents acted illegally, without any lawful authority in making provisional assessment of the goods in question at US$ 1400 per Metric Ton and the petitioner’s imported goods are liable to be assessed at the rate of US$400 per Metric Ton and the petitioner of the respective writ petition is entitled to get refund of the amount which he paid as customs duty in excess—Customs Act, 1969 (IV of 1969), Section—81.</p><p align="justify"><strong>Md.
