The new sub-rule 4A of Rule 10 neither says that it will have retrospective effect nor is there any authority in President’s Order 16 of 1972 to make rules with retrospective effect. Therefore, the auction sale having taken place before the insertion of the new sub-rule 4A, the sale would be governed by the law as it existed then as sub-rule 4.</p><p>It is a matter of construction whether the execution of a further contract is a condition of the contract or a mere expression of a desire of the parties as to the manner in which the transaction already agreed to will go through. In the former case, there is no enforceable contract either because the condition is nullified or because the law does not recognizes a’ contract to enter into a contract. In the latter case, there is a binding contract and the reference to the mere formal contract may be ignored. In such cases, refusal to execute formal contract cannot give rise to an action for breach of contract.</p><p><strong><em>United Commercial Bank Ltd. v.

Firstly, the tender procedure was continuing and it was not concluded. Secondly, during the pendency of the suit this amended Rule came into force and thirdly, the plaintiff being a lawful lessee in the premises participated in the auction and subsequently offered the hidest bid money to the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 for purchasing the same. The sale by tender was not concluded and the tender procedure was continuing and during pendency of the suit this amended Rule (4A) came into force, the plaintiff is entitled to have the benefit of this amended Rule, although it was not given any retrospective effect. The plaintiff is claiming a right to purchase the property in the instant suit and during pendency of the suit by operation of law such right was given to him and as such he is entitled to have that right, although the Suit was filed earlier.</p><p><strong><em>MIs United Commercial Bank Ltd.
