Proviso (a) to Section 5 contemplates a legally enforceable decree. The exparte decree obtained by the writ petitioner is a declaratory decree simpliciter without any prayer for recovery of possession, when, admittedly, the writ petitioner was not in possession thereof. Such a decree is not within the contemplation of proviso (a) to Section 5.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Bangladesh Vs Anwar Ahmed and others, 18 BLD (AD) 282.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sections—5 and 7</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The onus is on the claimant of the building to prove that the building is not an abandoned property.

This presumption is, of course, a rebuttable one. It is for the claimant to show that the original owner was present in Bangladesh or his whereabouts were known or he did not cease to occupy or manage the property in question at the relevant time. Since the notification in the official gazette carries a presumption that the building in question is an abandoned property, it is exempt from any legal process be it an auction sale by the Govt. itself or through Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Rahima Begum and others Vs the Court of Settlement and others, 17 BLD (AD) 118.</strong></em><em> </em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—5(2)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ordinance 54 of 1985 has created a special forum to deal with a property which has been enlisted under Section 5 as abandoned property. A special procedure has also been made therein to decide those cases. A legal presumption has also been attached under section 5(2) of the Ordinance to the list published under sub-section (1) as conclusive evidence that the enlisted property is an abandoned property.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Bangladesh Vs Anwar Ahmed and others, 18 BLD (AD) 282.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—5(2)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sub-section (2) of section 5 of the Ordinance provides that the lists published under sub-section (2) shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that the buildings included therein are abandoned property and have vested in the Government as such.

Section 7 of the Ordinance says that a person claiming any right or interest in any such building may make an application to the Court of Settlement for exclusion of the building from such list, etc. on the ground that the building is not an abandoned building and has n&amp; vested in the Government under P.O. 16 of 1972 or that his right or interest in the building has not been affected by the provisions of that order.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 7 enjoins upon the claimant before the Court of Settlement to prove that the property is not an abandoned property, in a like manner a plaintiff is to prove his case and the Government, like that of a defendant, is under no legal obligation to prove that the property is an abandoned property or to disclose the basis of treating the property as an abandoned property. Respondent successfully rebutted the presumption attached to the list published under sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Ordinance that the property is an abandoned property and vested in the Government.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Bangladesh Vs Md.

No. 16 of 1972 or that his right or interest in the building has not been affected by the provision of that Order. The onus, therefore, is squarely on the claimant of the building to prove that the building is not an abandoned property. The Government is under no obligation either to deny the facts alleged by the claimant or to disclose the basis of treating the property as abandoned property.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Govt. of Bangladesh vs. Md.

So it cannot be said the Court of Settlement does not offer an equally efficacious remedy. The plea taken by the respondent relying on the decisions reported in 42DLR (AD) 86 and 5 1DLR (AD) 25 that the writ petitioner could invoke the writ jurisdiction without having recourse to the Court of Settlement, does not seem tenable because the jurisdiction of the Court of Settlement in the instant case in including the property in the list of abandoned properties cannot be said to be ex-facie void.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Bangladesh and another Vs Habib Zamil, 21 BLD (AD) 36.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sections—7 and 10</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The order of the Court of Settlement Constituted under the provision of section 7 of Ordinance LIV of 1985 for restoration of the property in question to the petitioner is final and binding upon the Government in view of section 10 of the said Ordinance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Though no specific provision has been made in the Ordinance for the execution of the order of the Court of Settlement, the Government is under a legal obligation to give effect to the decision of the Court of Settlement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Hafeezuddin Ahmed vs. Govt. of Bangladesh and another, 15 BLD (HCD) 98.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—7(1)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Period of limitation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The case has been dismissed by the Court of Settlement as barred by limitation holding that the petitioner failed to file the petition within 108 days from the date of publication of the list in the official gazette as per provision of section 7(1) of the Ordinance. It is difficult to understand under what reason the period of limitation has been fixed at 108 days. Either it would be one month, three months or six months but section 7(I) of the Ordinance has provided the limitation for 108 days which means 3 months 18 days and such period of limitation could nowhere be found in the Limitation Act or in any other special Act providing limitation, This may be through inadvertance or mistake that 180 days has been printed as 108 days. The Ministry of Law. Justice and Parliamentary Affairs shall look into the matter and if it is a mistake in providing limitation of 108 days instead of 180 days, they should come out with an appropriate amendment in the section at the earliest in order to avoid mischief of limitation for wrong printing of the period of limitation in the Ordinance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Md.
