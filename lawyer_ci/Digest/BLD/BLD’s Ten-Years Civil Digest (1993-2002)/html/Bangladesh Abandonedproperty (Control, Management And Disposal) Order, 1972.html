It has been found by the Court of Settlement that the predecessor of interest of the petitioners died here in 1982 leaving behind the petitioners as his heirs who have inherited the said house as successor-in interest and he continuously lived in this country and paid income tax of his business till his death. The government most illegally declared the case property as abandoned property.</p><p><strong><em>Bibi Zarina and others Vs Government of Bangladesh and others, 2O BLD (HCD) 164.</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—2(1)</strong></p><p>When it is proved that the alleged owner of the property was not present in Bangladesh during the relevant period, his whereabouts were not known and he ceased to occupy, supervise or manage the property in person, such a property easily comes within the definition of abandoned property as envisaged in Article 2(1) of P.O. No. 16 of 1972.</p><p><strong><em>Bangladesh vs. Md. Suruzzamal and others, 15BLD (AD) 146</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong> MIs. Khan Brothers Ltd. vs. Government of Bangladesh, 27 DLR 423; Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh vs. MIs. Speedbird Navigation Co. 30 DLR (SC) 101; Bangladesh vs. Messrs A.TJ. Industries Ltd., 28 DLR (AD) 120; Gannyson vs. Sonali Bank, 36 DLR (AD) 146—Cited.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Article—2(1)</strong></p><p>From the definition it appears that an abandoned property means any property owned by a person (1) who is not present in Bangladesh, or (2) whose whereabouts are not known, or (3) who has ceased to occupy, supervise or manage in person his property. So, the disputed house did not come within the definition of ‘abandoned property’ of the case property as defined in Article 2 of P.O. No. 16 of 1972 and as such the enlistment as abandoned property in the ‘Kha’ list of abandoned property is without lawful authority.</p><p><strong><em>Masuda Anowar Vs Bangladesh and another, 17 BLD (HCD) 427</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Articles—2(1), 14 and 24</strong></p><p>Abandoned Property has been defined in Article 2(1) of P. 0. 16 of 1972 wherein it has been said that if a person ceased to occupy or manage in person his property the same is an abandoned property. Article 14 of P.O. 16 of 1972 clearly speaks that any property vested in the Government under the Order shall be exempt from all legal processes and Article 24 speaks that anything done or any action taken or any order passed under the Order shall not be called in question in any court. Hence, from the definition of abandoned property and on the basis of the averment of the plaintiff himself when he failed to manage and supervise the property in any manner the property vested in the Government as an abandoned property. Therefore, the High Court Division was correct in holding that the suit was filed for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession is not maintainable.</p><p><strong><em>Syed Afzal Nowab Vs G.

The definition of properties as given in Article 2(5) includes right under a contract.</p><p><strong><em>Govt. of Bangladesh Vs Saber Ahmed, 18 BLD (HCD) 498</em></strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
