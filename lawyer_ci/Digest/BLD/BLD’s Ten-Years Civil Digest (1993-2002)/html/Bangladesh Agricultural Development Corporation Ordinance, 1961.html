The High Court Division took the view that the objection as to non-compliance of section 74(1) was taken for the first time before it. This objection, although not taken in the written statement was taken by way of filing an application on 8 September 1992 in the trial court which passed an order on that date for keeping the application on record. This was also taken as a ground in the memo of Title Appeal No. 424 of 1992. The lower appellate court found that there was no service of notice which was a factual finding. Regardless of this finding the High Court Division construed Ext. 2 (Kha) dated 12 March 1991 as a notice which lacked the formalities of a notice under section 74(1). Again this purported notice was served upon the Corporation on 12 March 1991 long after six months from the date of accrual of the cause of action according to the plaint itself and therefore the notice was ineffectual even if it be so construed. [The High Court Division missed all these facts.]</p><p><strong><em>Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) Vs Abdul Barek Dewan being dead his heirs: Bali Begum and others, 19 BLD (AD) 106</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—74(1) (3)</strong></p><p><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972 Article—111</strong></p><p>Section 74(3) of the Ordinance provides that any suit in respect of an act purporting to be done under the Ordinance must be commenced within 6 months after the accrual of the cause of action and such view was taken by the Appellate Division in the case reported in 36DLR (AD) 69. Surprisingly, the High Court Division criticized the said decision by way of section 74(3) of the Ordinance speaks of action whereas in the said decision the action was understood as suit. The reasoning given by the High Court Division was first that it did not agree with the decision of the Appellate Division and secondly that the decision was given “per incuriarn”. The criticism as offered by the learned Judges of the High Court Division betrays their lack of knowledge about the doctrine of “per incuriam” and Article 111 of the Constitution. Besides, the word ‘action’ in sub-section (3) read along with sub-section (1) of section 74 of the Ordinance cannot mean anything else than a suit. A case against the Corporation in matters of limitation is governed by the special law as provided in sub-section (3) and not by the general law of limitation. The contrary view of the High Court Division is obviously wrong.</p><p><strong><em>Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) Vs Abdul Barek Dewan being dead his heirs: Bali Begum and others, 19 BLD (AD) 106.</em></strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
