A defence Service officer appointed in the service of the Biman Corporation falls within the category of public servant to whom the Public Servants (Retirement) Act, 1974 is equally applicable. When the seniority of defence officer on appointment in civil post is determined by talking their past service as provided under rules 5 and 7 of the Defence Services Officers (Appointment and Fixation of seniority in civil post) Rules, 1983, the Public Servants (Retirement) Act, 1974 is perfectly applicable to them on completion of 25 years of service as a whole.</p><p>In the instant case the writ petitioners, who were employees of the Biman, therefore, fall well within the meaning of a public servant as defined in section 2(d) of the Act and it is only the Government who had the power to retire them in exercise of the power under section 9(2) of the Act.</p><p><strong><em>Bangladesh Biman Corporation Vs Ltd.

No. 676 of 1996—Cited.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Regulation No. 19(1) (a) Seniority of Employees</strong></p><p>The recruitment of the respondents and those included in the impugned seniority list being one, the fact of their being included in the first batch for training and thereby getting an appointment a few days before the next batch of trainees, which is merely of fortuitous and accidental, is quite immaterial for determining seniority, the entire period of training of the different batches is to be treated as one training for the purpose of counting seniority as the process of recruitment was one and the same.</p><p><strong><em>The Managing Director, Bangladesh Biman Corporation and ors.

The submission of a letter seeking permission to withdraw letter of resignation does not render the resignation with immediate effect as non-existent or ineffective. The matter of communication of the acceptance of resignation is a mere formality and routine work, and a lapse of time in between the resignation and acceptance does not keep the resignation in hibernation, which is intended to be immediately effective.</p><p>If a resignation is with immediate effect under regulation 53(3), arguments that the employee could recall or rescind the resignation prior to acceptance and communication of acceptance of the resignation, including arguments based on section 21 of the General Clauses Act 1897, or the principles of estoppel, are not applicable.</p><p><strong><em>Bangladesh Biman Corporation and others v.

Jashimuddin Vs Bangladesh Biman Corporation and others, 20 BLD (HCD) 230.</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>The Service Regulations do not provide for service of a second show cause notice upon an employee during departmental proceedings. In the present case, the petitioner did not reply to the ex-gratia second show cause notice, and did not prefer an appeal before the authority concerned nor in the plaint alleges that he did not nor could not reply to the said notice for want of a copy of the enquiry report. It was correctly held that non- supply of enquiry report did not cause any prejudice to the petitioner.</p><p><strong><em>Waliulhah Pradhan v.
