BOGMC subsequently formed a subsidiary company named Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration Company Limited and got it registered under the Companies Act, 1913. By resolution of the Board of Directors of the Corporation held on 1. 6.1991 respondent No. I was permanently transferred to the said subsidiary company. The High Court Division rightly held that respondent No. I acquired a right under section 24(2)(d) of the Ordinance to remain an officer of the Corporation and his permanent transfer to the subsidiary company without his consent was illegal.</p><p><strong><em>Chairman, Petro Bangla and others Vs.

Service Regulations of the Corporation do not contemplate permanent transfer of an employee and as such the impugned order is found to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect.</p><p><strong><em>A.K.M.
