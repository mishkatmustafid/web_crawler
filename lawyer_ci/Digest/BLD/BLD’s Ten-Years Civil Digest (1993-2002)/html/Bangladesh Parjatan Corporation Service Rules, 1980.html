The respondent was given a second show cause notice ex-gratia. The Corporation could have passed the order of punishment after the enquiry was over without serving any second show cause notice. Since the principle of natural justice was duly followed in the case in conducting the enquiry, no grievance could be made on this court. But since the enquiry was not conducted in accordance with the Rules the ultimate order of the High Court Division is upheld.</p><p><strong><em>Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation, Dhaka Vs. A.K.M.
