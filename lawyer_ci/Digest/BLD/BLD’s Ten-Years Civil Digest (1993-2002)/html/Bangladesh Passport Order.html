The order of impounding of the passport of the appellant in this case obviously has been passed on the basis of the order of the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs and nothing could be shown to us to indicate that there was any chance to frustrate impounding of the passport by the appellant. The appellant having not been supplied with the copy of the order recording reasons therefore restricting the appellant from leaving the country certainly is violative of Article 7(4) of the Bangladesh Passport Order as the appellant had no opportunity to take a decision to avail of the alternative remedy by way of appeal as provided in Article 10 of the Passport Order, 1973. Withholding the order of the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs also is indicative of malafide. (Per A.M.
