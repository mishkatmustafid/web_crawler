No. 59 of 1972 there is a general power of the Government to give directions to the Board. It says, “Each Board shall, in discharging its functions, be guided by such direction as the Government may give from time to time.”</p><p>From the language employed in Article 4(3) it seems to be clear that the direction that the Government may give from time to time to either the Water Board or the Power Board in the discharge of their functions will be in the nature of guidance which will be related broadly to policies and procedures. Article 4(3) was never meant to be a provision for enabling the Government to interfere with the day-to-day function of either Board in an individual case and in a particular contractual matter between a Board and a contractor.</p><p><strong><em>Chairman, Bangladesh Water Development Board and another Vs M/s.
