A suit at the instance of some co-sharers in exclusive possession of a joint property for recovery of possession against a trespasser is quite maintainable in law. In such a case the failure to implead other co-sharers as parties to the suit will not affect the plaintiff’s right to recover possession from the trespassers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The uniform judicial opinion is that a Suit by only one co-sharer in exclusive possession of a joint property warding off an invasion to the rights of all co-sharers of a joint property is maintainable in law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Baroda Sundari Paul and others Vs.

The applicants having set up a different genealogy and claiming title and possession in a large area of the suit land on the basis of purchase during the pendency of the suit their interest in the land purchased by them will not be affected if the suit is decided in their absence. Moreover, parties cannot be allowed to obtain documents in respect of the suit land during pendency of the suit in the names of their minor sons and daughters, married or unmarried, to set up a different case, at the peremptory hearing stage of the suit, from the one they had set up earlier with the object of lingering the litigations.

Defendant No.2 being an allottee under defendant No. 1 and being in possession of the first floor of the building is a proper party to the suit and the order of the trial Court making him a party is a proper order that calls for no intereference.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Mrs. Jahanara Begum Vs.

The expression ‘at any stage of the proceeding’ confers a wide discretion on the Court in the matter of addition or striking out of parties.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A belated prayer for addition of a necessary party under Order 1 Rule 10(2) or for amendment of pleadings under Order VI Rule 17 of the Code by itself is no ground to refuse such a prayer if such addition or amendment of pleadings be found necessary for complete and effectual adjudication of the matters in issue.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 96(2) of the S.A.T.

When the earlier suit came up before the Appellate Division it was found that the present claim of taka 7 lacs was made in a concealed manner in paragraph 21 of the plaint of that suit. The learned counsel appearing for the defendant-petitioner submitted at that time that the plaintiff-respondent could not get taka 7 lacs in that suit without suing for account and his submission was accepted. The defendant-petitioner cannot now turn round and take up an opposite stand to plead that the present suit for that particular relief is not available to the plaintiff in view of the provision of Order II Rule 2 C.P.C.

But the Court will be reluctant to allow an amendment which would have the effect of altering the nature of the suit or it would take away a legal right accrued to the defendant by lapse of time.
