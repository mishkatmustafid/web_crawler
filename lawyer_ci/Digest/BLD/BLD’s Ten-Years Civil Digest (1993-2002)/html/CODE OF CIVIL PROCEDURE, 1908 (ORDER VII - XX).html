The two requirements of a dispute for reference to the Registrar of the Co-operative societies in respect of which the Civil Court has no jurisdiction are: (i) the dispute must be touching the business or affairs of a co-operative society and (ii) the parties to the dispute must be the Society and its Managing Committee or any officer or member or past members and others as enumerated in Clause (a) to (d) of Section 86.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In view of the fact that the dispute in question is a dispute touching or concerning the affairs or business of a co-operative society and the parties to the dispute are members of the Managing Committee of that Society, ‘the instant case fulfils both the requirements of a dispute as contemplated by Section 86 of the Ordinance and the dispute falls within the mischief of Section 133 of the Ordinance which bars the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts.

What a plaint should contain has been provided by Order VII rule 1 of the Code, and Order VII rule 11 of the Code has provided the incidents and circumstances when a plaint would be liable to he rejected. Therefore, an application under Order VII rule 11 of the Code for rejection of such an application is not maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Dhaka Leather Company Ltd. v.

The Court has ample power to grant such a relief provided it is not inconsistent with the pleadings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Comndr. (Retd) A.A. Chowdhury Vs. A.K.M.

A plaint can be rejected only when the suit is found to be barred under any law or when the Court comes to the conclusion that even if ali the averments made in the plaint itself are taken to be true and correct still then the plaintiff will not be entitled to any relief whatsoever.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Mst.

A plaint rejected a suit is entertained, i.e., registered in a register of civil suits under Order IV Rule 2 of the Code. Summons is issued under Order V of the Code. A plaint is rejected if it falls under the mischiefs of described in clauses (a) or (b) or (c) or (d) of Order VII Rule 11 of the Code. Order VII Rule 13 of the Code provides that the rejection of a plaint on any of the grounds mentioned in Rule 11 shall not of its own force preclude the plaintiff from presenting a fresh plaint in respect of the same cause of action. In other words, if the plaintiff removes the cause of action for rejection of the plaint he can present a fresh plaint in respect of the same cause of action. Rejection of plaint shall be deemed to be a decree in terms of section 2(2) of the Code and is therefore appealable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 34 of P 0 128 of 1972 is an independent substantive and procedural provision regarding bar of entertainment of a suit on grounds different from those described in order VII Rule II of the Code. Article 34(5) specifically lays down that if the prayers in the suit are of the description contained in Article 34(5) (a) (i ) or (ii) or (iii), then the suit will not be entertained. In an ordinary civil suit the plaint is rejected, inter alia, “where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law.” Therefore in an application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code the statement in the plaint has to be looked into to determine if the suit is barred by any law. But under Article 34(5) it is not the statement in the plaint but the reliefs claimed in the suit under Article 34(5) (a) (i) or (ii) or (iii), which will determine whether the suit is entertain- able or not. Under Order VII Rule II of the Code it is the statement in the plaint which is the determining factor, but under Article 34(5) it is the relief claimed which is the determining factor.

First, there has to be an existence of a liability of repayment of a loan. Secondly, there has to be default in re-payment of loan in terms of the agreement. Thirdly, the properties to be taken over and/or sold by the Sangstha must have to be a property pledged, mortgaged, hypothecated or assigned by the industrial concern to secure its liability to the Sangstha. The power under clause (1) can be exercised if the aforesaid conditions are fulfilled and the ouster clause (5) comes into play when the Sangstha acts in consonance with clause (1) and not otherwise. In this regard the expression “under clause(1)” occurring in clause (5) and the expression “such taking over or transfer” in the said clause and clause (5)(a)(i)(ii)(iii) are particularly noticeable. In other words, if the conditions of clause (i ) are not fulfilled the ouster clause (5) does not operate. In that case the purported action under clause (1) would be taken without jurisdiction. Such a case will not come within the mischief of clause (5).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha Vs Rahman Textile Mills Ltd. and Ors., 19 BLD (AD) 207.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br/> <strong>Order VII Rule 11</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A plaint may be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code merely on a plain reading of the plaint but in exceptional circumstances the Court may invoke its inherent jurisdiction and can throw the plaint out in limini. The plea of implied bar should be decided on evidence unless the fact disclosed in the plaint clearly indicate that the suit is not maintainable. In exceptional cases recourse may be taken even under section 151 of the Code. In an application for rejection of plaint on the ground of undisclosed cause of action the Court should not dissect the plaintiff’s case part by part.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Abdul Jalil and others Vs Islamic Bank Bangladesh Ltd., 20 BLD (AD) 278.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br/> <strong>Order VII, Rule 11</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Court is not satisfied with statements made in the application for restoration as well as the statements made in the supplementary affidavit in which the petitioner introduced quite different facts and, as such, the application is rejected.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Islami Bank, Bangladesh Limited and others Vs.

Sirajul Islam, 13 BLD (HCD) 631.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br/> <strong>Order VII Rule 1(g)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Clause (g) has made it mandatory to include the relief in a plaint. A suit is generally known or categorised by the relief prayed for in the plaint. A Court gives a final adjudication upon the plaint by either granting or refusing such of the relief as is established in the trial of the suit. The prayers or relief sought for is, therefore, an important and integral part of the plaint.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paul Reinhurt Limited and another v.

It is only the averments made in the plaint which are to be considered to come to a finding as to whether those disclose a cause of action.

This was evidently a suit for enforcement of his visiting right of his son for a very temporary period without claiming guardianship or custody of the child. Such an agreement being not unlawful, immoral or opposed to public policy is not hit by the provision of Section 23 of the Contract Act. There is nothing in the plaint to show that any of the provisions of Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. is attracted in the case.

In the first place, it contemplates that a still born suit should be buried at its inception so that no further time is consumed and unnecessary expenses incurred on a fruitless litigation. Secondly, it gives the plaintiff a chance to retrace his step at the earliest opportunity, so that if permissible under the law, he may file a properly constituted suit for appropriate relief.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In exercising this power the Court can look into the statements in the plaint alone.

At this initial stage of the proceeding it is the plaint of the suit which is the only record before the Court and it is on the basis of the plaint that the court is to see whether the suit is barred by any law or whether it is not otherwise maintainable.
