In such a case expressions of general agreement with those of the trial court are generally considered sufficient.

It is purely discretionary with the appellate Court to grant such a relief on for a sufficient cause. If the operation of the order of temporary injunction is stayed till the disposal of the appeal, it simply means that there is not only no order of injunction in existence but also it virtually gives the appellant the final relief of the appeal pending adjudication. In the absence of any compelling reasons and that too for preventing an apparent injustice, the stay of operation of the impugned order. of temporary injunction pending decision in the appeal is not contemplated in law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>A.

The phrase ‘to appear and answer the appeal’ admits of one simple construct on, requiring the respondents to appear o the day fixed for hearing of the appeal under rule 16(2) and answer the points raised by the appellants in support of their appeal. So, rule 12 does not, in any way, empower and/or authorise the appellate Court either to allow a respondent to file a written statement for the first time in appeal or to accept such written statement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Narayan Chandra Saha and another Vs Jatindra Chandra Saha and others, 19 BLD (HCD) 614.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Order XLI Rule 27(1)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Order 41 rule 27(1) of the Code empowers the appellate Court to admit additional evidence only where the Court requires further evidence for one of the two causes specified in the rule.

The applicant must show a prima facie case and good chance of his success in the suit. No order for appointment of receiver should be passed to deprive a defacto possessor of the property as sub rule (2) of Rule I of Order XL C.P.C. does not authorise the Court to remove from the possession of property any person to whom any property to the suit has not a present right so to remove.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Kamiruddin and others Vs Md.
