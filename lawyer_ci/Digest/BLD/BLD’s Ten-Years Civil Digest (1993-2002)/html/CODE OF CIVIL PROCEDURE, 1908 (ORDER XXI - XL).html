The words “during the pendency of the suit” clearly mean before a final decree or order has been passed or made in the suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The only question to be decided on an application under Order 21, Rule 16 of the Code is whether the application is the person entitled to execute the decree.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Manik Chand Bibi alias Rezian Nahar and another Vs.

The Order of the Court directing the university authorities to publish the result of the plaintiff partakes the nature of mandatory injunction, wilful disobedience of which makes the judgment-debtors liable for detention in civil imprisonment and their properties are liable for attachment under Order 21 Rule 32 (2) C.P.C.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>University of Chittagong and another Vs.

After such claim or objection is raised, the Court should investigate and adjudicate upon the claim or objection. It appears that the executing Court without any investigation rejected the application by two words. Where a third party has claimed property under attachment in execution of a decree and filed an application under the provision of law, it becomes the duty of the Court to investigate the claim. The executing Court should not reject the application without assigning any reason.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Foyez Ahmed and others v.

The Governor of Bangladesh Bank being a Public Officer is under a legal obligation to obey the direction of the Court for payment of the decreetal amount out of the ‘Consolidated Fund” for the satisfaction of the decree and in doing so no further or independent instrument is necessary.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Bangladesh Bank Vs.

This contemplates the pendency of a suit between the decree-holder and the judgment debtor in respect of the decree in question and it has no reference to any suit filed by a third party.

In the instant case the decree was drawn up and signed on 15.9.1999 and the execution case was filed on 29.11.1999.

On general principles and in exercise of its inherent power and executing Court can entertain and give effect to a claim to set-off, even in cases which do not come strictly under Order XXI Rule 19 of the Code. An equitable set-off can be claimed in a case where cross demands arise out of the same transaction or where they are so connected in nature or circumstances that it would be inequitable to allow one party to execute his decree depriving the other party to separate proceedings. No party as of right can claim such set-off, which may be granted by a Court in its discretion to be exercised judicially.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Shankar Lal Das v.

The stay of an execution case is purely a matter of judicial discretion for the Court and when the exercise of such discretion is justified by the materials on record, the same calls for no interference by the Appellate Division.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Asia Khatun being dead her legal heirs and representatives : Bulbul Ahmed and others Vs.

This order granting time to the purchaser is clearly beyond the scope of Order 21 Rules 85 and 86 of the Code and is illegal because by that time the auction purchaser forfeited all his rights to the property as well as to the earnest money.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Sonali Bank Vs.

The Rule, of course, does not abate for non-substitution within 90 days.

The final decree is, in fact, a continuation of the preliminary decree in course of which the parties are put to actual physical possession of the suit properties according to sahams allotted a specific saham, it is likely that his vital interests would go unrepresented and he is likely to be adversely affected thereby. In the instant case, contesting defendant Abdus Salamhad died before the passing of the final decree without bringing his legal representatives on record.

The reasoning is that abatement of a suit precludes fresh suits on the same cause of action, although there is no trial on merit of the case if abatement is not set aside the applicant is deprived to the opportunity of proving his case only on account of his culpable negligence or lack of vigilance. Refusal to condone delay may result a meritorious matter being thrown out without any hearing. It is ordinarily always desirable that delay is condoned and substitution is allowed so as to decide a case on merit upon hearing the parties unless there are deliberate negligence on the part of the applicant.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Abdul Kader Mondal and ors.
