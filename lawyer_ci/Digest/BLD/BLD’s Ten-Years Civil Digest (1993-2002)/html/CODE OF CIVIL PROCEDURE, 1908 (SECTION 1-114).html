A transferee of a property sold by a person is not his legal representative and as such he does not fall within the category of ‘legal representative’ as contemplated by sub-section (11) of Section 2 of the Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sub-rule (2) of Rule 10 of Order I C.P.C. empowers a Court at any stage of the proceeding to add in it any person whose presence before the Court may be considered necessary in order to enable it effectively and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all questions involved in the case. Although opposite party Nos 3 and 4 are not legal representatives of their vendor Balai Ch.

This decision was upheld in appeal. The High Court Division summarily rejected the petitioners’ application u/s 115 of C.P.C.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The petitioners’ main contention is that the Courts below were wrong in directing the subsequent purchasers to execute the kabala in favour of the plaintiff, although they were not parties to the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Appellate Division considered different aspects of the question and the trend of decisions of the superior Courts of the subcontinent and took the view that a direction for reconveyance to the plaintiffs by the subsequent purchasers alone could be a possible solution and that would have the effect of vesting title to the property in the plaintiffs but it would be inequitable to compel the subsequent transferees to enter into terms and convenantsin the vendors’ agreement to the plaintiffs to which they would never have agreed had they been free agents. Moreover, if the original contract is varied b altering or omitting by terms of the contract the Court will be remaking the contract, a thing it has no power to do, because in that case it will no longer be specifically enforcing the original contract but a different one. The Appellate Division held that the proper form of decree in such a case will be to direct specific performance of the contract between the vendor and the plaintiff and, to direct the subsequent transferee to join in the conveyance so as to pass on title, which resides in him, to the plaintiff.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Ezaher Meah and others Vs Mst.

Exclusion of jurisdiction of civil Courts is not to be readily inferred unless the suit is expressly barred by any statutory provision. Even if jurisdiction is so excluded, still then the civil Courts have jurisdiction to examine as to whether the provisions of an Act have been duly complied with or to examine as to whether a statutory tribunal has acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Md.

But where common questions of disputed title are involved in the two suits it is desirable that the suits be tried simultaneously, although the parties to the suit are not the same.

The suit was dismissed on contest. The petitioners appeal against the dismissal of the suit was also unsuccessful. Thus the decisions of the civil Courts with regard to the nature of the property and the plaintiff s claim thereto became binding upon the petitioner. The High Court Division correctly held that the decisions of the Civil Courts between the Government and the present petitioner being binding upon them, the Court of Settlement acted illegally and without jurisdiction in declaring that the property in question is not an abandoned property and ordering restoration of possession.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Mohammad Moinuddin Vs The People’s Republic of Bangladesh and another, 16 BLD (AD) 122.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br/> <strong>Section—11: Res judicata</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">When the causes of action of the two suits are different and the subject-matter of the two suits is also completely different, the decision in one suit cannot be considered as <em>res judicata</em> in the other suit. In such a case, the principle of <em>res judicata</em> is not applicable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Md. Rajiuddin Chowdhury Vs Suruj Ali, 16 BLD (HCD) 96.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br/> <strong>Section—11: Res Judicata</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">To bring a case within the ambit of Section 11 of the Code of Civil procedure the issues in the former suit and the subsequent suit shall be the same, the suits should be between the same parties, the subject-matter should be the same and the former suit must be disposed of finally.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br/> <strong>Section—11: Res judicata</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The main object of the principle of resjudicata is to prevent multiplicity of suits and interminable disputes between the litigants. This principle aims at preventing not only a new decision hut also a new investigation so that the same person cannot be vexed again and again in multiple proceedings over the same question. This principle is mutual in character and it is open as such to the plaintiff as to the defendant.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Md.
