A reference to the provision of section 115 of the Code would show that every irregularity or even illegality in the exercise of jurisdiction does not render the judgment void.

If in revisional jurisdiction the High Court Division rides roughshod over both substantive and procedural law then a litigant does not know what will happen to his case, what course will it take and what relief will ultimately emerge. This is a travesty of justice, as we know it. The suo motu exercise in the manner it was done, besides being without jurisdiction was an act of extreme judicial indiscretion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per Bimalendu Bikash Roy Chowdhury, J: Plaintiff No. 1 Shamsun Nahar Be- gum never appealed against the decree of the original court nor did she take any appeal therefrom.

This was never the practice of a superior Court which ever acted in such a light-hearted way in a serious matter like this nor should it ever do it for the sake of, if not anything else, its own credibility.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Md.

Evidently the learned Judge of the High Court Division failed to consider the uncontroverted assertion of the present appellant as the opposite party in the Rule that he had engaged Mr. Abdul Mannan Khan at Rangpur as his Advocate for the Rule but because of his death in October 1990 he could not know about the fate of his case before 7.8.92 and he came to Dhaka on 15.8.92 and thereafter instructed his lawyer to take steps for re-haring of the Rule.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Falguni Majumder Vs Mokbul Hossain Biswas and ors, 19 BLD (AD) 223.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—115</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Family Court Ordinance, 1985, Section—5</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The jurisdiction of the High Court Division while hearing a revision petition is purely discretionary and the discretion is to be exercised only when there is an error of law resulting in an error in the decision and by that error failur of justice has been occasioned and interference is called for the ends of justice and not otherwise.

But when the appellate Court reverses the judgment of the trial Court on non-consideration of the material evidence on record and without adverting to the reasons on which the trial court based its judgment, the High Court Division may be justified in interfering with the finding of facts arrived at by the appellate court when it finds that non-consideration of such evidence has materially affected the decision of the appellate court occasioning failure of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Johara Khatun and others Vs.

Under Rule 7 it is only the Division Court which can hear an appeal under Section 476B Cr.P.C. It is well-settled that an order under Section 476 Cr.P.C. passed by a Civil Court, if no appeal lies, will be amenable to revision, only under section 115 C.P.C.

If however, the High Court Division is satisfied that the lower appellate Court has failed to consider any material evidence in reversing a finding of fact arrived at by the trial Court on assigning proper reasons therefore, the proper course in such a case will be to send the case back on remand to the appellate Court for re-hearing the appeal upon proper assessment of the evidence on record.
