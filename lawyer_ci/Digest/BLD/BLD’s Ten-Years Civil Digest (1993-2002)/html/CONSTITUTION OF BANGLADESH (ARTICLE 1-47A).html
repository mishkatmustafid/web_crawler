The nature and character of their function are different. Moreover, Article 22 has emphasized on separation of the judiciary from the executive. Sub-paragraph (6) of Paragraph 6 of the Transitional and Temporary Provisions of the Fourth Schedule mandates compliance of Chapter II of Part VI of the Constitution which in effect requires all concerned to maintain, preserve and protect the independence of the judiciary and also to enhance the separation of the judiciary from the executive and preserve the then arrangement as a temporary and transitional one.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Secretary, Ministry of Finance and others Vs Mr. Md.

In view of the provisions of Article 137 the direction to establish another public service commission for judicial and magisterial services is not contrary to the provision of the constitution for recruitment of persons to be employed for judicial service and magistracy exercising judicial functions in accordance with the provisions of Article 140 of the Constitution for the recruitment of persons to be employed in the judicial and magisterial service is in consonance with the spirit of Article 22 of the Constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Secretary, Ministry of Finance and others Vs Mr. Md.

The law of restitution of conjugal rights is a violation of the concept of social justice as enunciated in the preamble of the Constitution as well as under Article 27 of the Constitution, providing equal protection of law to all citizens. and Article 28 thereof providing guarantee against discrimination on grounds of religion, race, sex etc. The dictum of restitution of conjugal rights is a violation of the concept of liberty, freedom, equality and social justice enshrined in our Constitution. Consequently, the law of restitution of conjugal rights is repugnant to the Constitution and as such void. No suit for restitution of conjugal rights is maintainable in law in any Court in Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Khodeja Begum and others Vs. Md.

The training of the recruits in batches was not a requirement of any law or rule but it was necessitated because of the logistic constraints of the Biman. The grouping of persons for training recruited in the same examinations held under the same advertisement for recruitment was, therefore, an act performed by the Biman under compulsion. The High Court Division was justified in taking the view that although the training of the recruits was held in batches it was practically one training which started on 15. 10.1989 and ended on 25.1.1990. In that view of the matter the seniority list was required to be prepared in order of merit on the completion of the training on 25.1.1990. It is not the merit at the time of recruitment but it is the merit at the end of the training which governs the question of seniority according to Regulation 18(c).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since no reasonable basis for classification for placing in groups for training could be proved it was obvious that there was enough scope for arbitrary selection and as such it is violative of the equality clause as being arbitrary and discriminatory.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Aminul Haq Vs.

Bombay Municipal Corpora- tion (1985) 3 S.C.C. 454 that “Article 37 provides that the directive principles, though not enforceable by any Court, are nevertheless fundamental in the Governance of the country. The principles contained in Articles 39(a) and 41 must be regarded as equally fundamental in the understanding and interpretation of the meaning and content of fundamental rights. If there is an obligation upon the State to secure to the citizens an adequate means of livelihood and the right to work, it would be sheer pedantry to exclude the right to livelihood from the content of the right to life. The State may not, by affirmative action’s, be compellable to provide adequate means of livelihood or work to the citizens. But any person, who is deprived of his right to livelihood except according to just and fair procedure established by law, can challenge the deprivation as offending the right to live conferred by Article 21.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) and others Vs Government of Bangladesh and others, 19 BLD (HCD) 488. </em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ref: (1985) 3SCC 454—relied upon.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Articles—27 and 29(1)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article-27 of the Constitution provides that all citizens are equal before 1w and are entitled to equal protection of law and Article 29(1) of the Constitution provides That there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizen in respect of employment or office the service of the Republic.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the petitioners merely prepared a list and kept it to themselves or their different departments for implementation as and when possible the writ petitioners had nothing to complain about, but when a number of them are appointed from a list and the appointment of others is postponed pending inquiry into the genuineness of a list comprising of 1745 persons with which list the writ petitioners have no concern, they can legitimately complain of inequality before law and discrimination in public employment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The Secretary, Ministry of Establishment, Government of Bangladesh &amp; others Vs Md.
