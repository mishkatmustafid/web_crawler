The High Court Division dwelled on the question of title of the petitioners in the land on the general proposition that title follows possession. But in the instant case, there is no material on record to ascertain the quantity of land in possession of the petitioners from which they were allegedly evicted.

Whether the petitioners have any title to the land acquired by the Government is a question of fact which cannot be decided in a writ petition.

The High Court would be empowered to prevent a Tribunal from going wrong in law, but that is not the same thing as correcting a decision or an order merely because it is erroneous. A Tribunal may decide a point of law or pass an order in deciding issues before it keeping within jurisdiction though deciding it erroneously. That error would not be an error for interference under certiorari though it can be examined in appeal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This Court (Viz. the High Court Division, in its supervisory capacity, though not in an appellate capacity, has jurisdiction to see that the Tribunal do not go wrong in law when only the question of reasonableness of the order would come in.

The High Court Division has to pass an interim order under clause (1) of sub-clause (a) of clause (2) of Article 102 of the Constitution under the following constraints:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(1) Sub-clause (b) of clause (4) enjoins that the High Court Division may make an interim order of fulfillment of the conditions precedent for the exercise of the power.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) The first condition is that the Attorney General will be given a reasonable notice of the applications or he or an Advocate authorised by him in that behalf will be given an opportunity of being heard. If the High Court Division is of the opinion that an interim order is inextricably connected with sub-clause (a) or (b) of clause (4), it ought to refrain from passing an interim order, fix a date for passing an interim order, fix a date for appearance of the Attorney General or his authorised Advocate giving him a notice therefore unless in the facts of the case the High Court Division is of the opinion that the Attorney General and sufficient notice of the application had there was no cogent reason for his non-appearance for making submissions on the interim order.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) The non-appearance of the Attorney General will not by itself be a ground for the High Court Division to pass an interim order unless it satisfies itself that the interim order is not likely to have the effect of causing prejudice or interference with the implementation of a development work or programme or it would have the effect of being harmful to the public interest. (4) The satisfaction of the High Court Division in passing the interim order is latent in the order itself, even though no satisfaction is explicitly expressed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(5) The High Court Division will not consider whether an interim order will actually prejudice or interfere with the implementation of any development programme or work or will actually be otherwise harmful to the public interest but will only consider whether such interim order is likely to have the said effect.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(6) Broadly speaking to obtain an interims order a writ petitioner must not only make out a prima facie case but a very strong prima facie case and the balance of inconvenience in his favour shall be so strong that it will outweigh the consideration of sub-clause(a) o (b) of clause(4).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(7) Generally speaking, impeding the assessment or collection of public revenue is harmful to the public interest. In the absence of any jurisdictional issues involved, there is no justification to protect temporary private interest by interim order impeding collection of the public revenue.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(8) When the order under challenge• found to suffer from an absolute lack of jurisdiction or when it is in gross violation of Law apparent on the face of the applications causing grave injustices, where denial of interim relief will lead to public mischief, the High Court Division will look into the matter but in’ doing so it will consider whether-in-spite of a prima facie case and balance of convenience, the individual interest should be subjugated to public interest.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(9) It serves no public purpose to permit the Customs authorities to realise all the claims before they release the goods if the claimed amount has prima facie no sanction of law.

Therefore, he has a right to ask the Court to issue a writ of quo warranto asking the respondents under what authority of law they were holding such public office. In such circumstances the Court is justified in issuing a writ of quo warranto in order to get information from the respondents as to how they cling to their office without performance of duties and obligations attached to such office.
