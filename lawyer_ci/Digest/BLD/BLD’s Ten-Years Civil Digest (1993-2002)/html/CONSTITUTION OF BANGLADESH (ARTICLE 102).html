Initially, in the writ petition itself, the writ petitioner must include some reliable and relevant materials to show that between the last date of fixation of tariff value and the impugned date of fixation of tariff value the international market price of a particular importer item has either gone down or has gone up to an extent which is significantly higher or lower than the impugned fixation of tariff value.

The General Secretary of a political party has locus standi to contest the writ or appeal even after the withdrawal of the candidature by the candidate nominated by that party in order to safeguard its party interest.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Even when a political party which obtained a protected symbol before the General Election held on the 12th June, 1996 decides not to take part in a by-election, the Returning Officer is still under a cautionary direction of the Election Commission to scrutinize the written documents of a candidate if he presents himself as a nominated candidate of a political party which took part in the General Election held on the 12° June, 1996. It is the case of the appellant that it did not nominate the writ petitioner as its candidate for the by election in question and therefore it has a sustained interest in its protected symbol “Langal”. If the decision of the High Court Division in the impugned judgment is to the effect that the symbol “Langal” will be allotted to a person who has not been nominated by the appellant as its candidate in the by- election in question, then that political party, namely, the appellant, has every locus standi to prefer this appeal and prosecute the same in order to safeguard and protect its claimed protected symbol.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the candidate who has withdrawn does not present himself on the date of allotment of symbols and/or if his political party does not oppose the allotment of the symbol “Langal” to the lone candidate remaining on the scene, the lone candidate will not get a walkover. The Returning Officer will still have to scrutinize the political credentials of the candidate on the basis of written documents produced by the lone candidate. If he has filed only the letter of the Secretary General of his party, the Returning Officer is not in a position to grant him the symbol “Langal” as he has also a similar letter from another Secretary General of the same party in his possession. He has to be satisfied from the written documents of the lone candidate or if contested or if opposed by the rival candidate or his party, then from both sides” written documents as to which is the political party known as Jatiya Party which was allotted the symbol “Langal” in the general election held on the 12° June, 1996. The Returning Officer rejected the symbol “Langal” to respondent No. 1 on the ground that he failed to produce papers to show that he was a candidate nominated by the Jatiya Party which contested the General Election held on the 12th June, 1996 with the symbol “Langal”. He has perfectly and correctly understood the direction of the Election Commission. It is the High Court Division which misconstrued the direction by holding that since respondent No. 1 expressed his preference for the symbol “Langal” and a letter of Mr. Anwar Hossain Manju was in favour of allocating the said symbol to respondent No. 1, and as no one from the Jatiya Party represented by Mr. Naziur Rahman Manju opposed the prayer of respondent No. 1, the Returning Officer acted illegally in allocating the symbol of “Butterfly” to respondent No. 1. The High Court Division has not even noticed the directions of the Election Commission and has gone astray in laying down the path to be followed by a Returning Officer while deciding a thorny and sensitive matter of allocating a protected symbol.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Jatiya Party represented by Md.
