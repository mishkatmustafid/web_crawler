Article 66(2)(c) should therefore be construed to mean that a citizen of Bangladesh is permitted to acquire a citizenship of a foreign State as provided under Article 2B(2) of the P0 149 of 1972. But if a person is found to be a citizen of Bangladesh as well as a citizen of any foreign State either on the date when he files nomination paper for the Parliamentary election or if such person acquires citizenship of a foreign state after he was elected as a member of Parliament, he becomes disqualified to contest the election or to continue as a member of the Parliament. Because a citizen of. Bangladesh with total and indefeasible loyalty and patriotism is only considered fit and qualified for becoming a member of Parliament. By the said disqualification clause in our Constitution, a person being a citizen of Bangladesh as well as a citizen of a foreign State is considered to have lost his absolute patriotism and loyalty to Bangladesh and thus becomes unfit to be a member of Parliament. Reasons being that once such person is elected, he is normally given the charge of the helm of affairs of the country either in the capacity as a Member of the Parliament or as a Member of a Parliamentary Committee or as a Minister or the Prime Minister of Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md Abdul Halim Vs The Speaker of Bangladesh Parliament and others, 21 BLD (HCD) 391.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Articles—66(2) and 67(1)(d)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disqualification’s for election to Parliament or for being a sitting Member thereof</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A person convicted of an offence involving moral turpitude and sentenced to suffer imprisonment for a term of not less than two years cannot be elected as a Member of the Parliament—A Member of the Parliament vacates by his seat as Member on such conviction and sentence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 67(1)(d) provides for automatic vacation of seat as a Member of Parliament if he incurs disqualification as per provision of Article 66(2)(d) of the Constitution.

Resignation by conduct or otherwise against the party disciplines and dictates is also envisaged under these Articles.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">[In fact, by taking seat with the treasury bench, against the dictates of their party, from which they were elected to Parliament, the two members went beyond the control of the Chief Whip of the opposition, who was to maintain party discipline and this amounted to formal renunciation of ties with the party and cessation of membership from the B.N.P. The speaker very well knew that he would have to allot the two members seats with the treasury bench, once they joined the Awami League Cabinet. Rule 7 of Rules of Procedure of Parliament clearly lays down: “the member shall seat in such order as the Speaker may determine, Under the circumstances, it would not have been wrong for the Speaker to expect, that unless the B.N.P. took a different stand, a dispute would follow.]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Khondker Delwar Hossain Vs The Speaker, Bangladesh Jatiya Shangshad (Parliament), 19 BLD (HCD) 45.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Article—66(4)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rules of Procedure of Parliament, Rule—178</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Members of Parliament (Determination of Dispute) Act, 1980, Section—3</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reference of disputes under Article 66(4)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 66(4) provides that the Speaker is not to decide the question, he can only refer it to the Election Commission and if the latter come to the opinion that members concerned have, by their action, vacated their seat, they then cease to be members. Apparently the authority, contemplated by the Constitution and the law, to take action on a dispute whether a seat of Parliament is vacated or not, is the Election Commission and not the Speaker.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From a reading of rule 178 of the Rules of Procedure and the relevant sections of Act I of 1981 along with Article 66 of the Constitution it becomes obvious that in case of a dispute of the nature contemplated in Article 66(4) it must be referred to the Election Commission by the Speaker. Act I of 1981 provides in detail the procedure to be followed to implement Article 66(4). Section 3 of the Act I. of 1981 further provides a time limit of thirty days within which the Speaker shall refer the dispute along with a statement to the Election Commission for it to be heard and determined. The law is so specific and the procedure laid down is so elaborate that the assumption by the Speaker of the role of deciding whether there is dispute, to the exclusion of the Election Commission, makes the constitutional provisions on anti defection redundant. What is important to remember is that the Speaker has no power to adjudicate upon the matter in disputes. He is only to act as a Post Office.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Constitution does not require the speaker to come to the conclusion, that a dispute has not arisen, because in order to come to such a conclusion, he shall have to decide the main issue that the two members have not resigned from the party, which the Speaker is not competent to do so as it is the domain of the Election Commission. It is the opinion of the Election Commission which is in substantive decisive. When the Speaker forwards the dispute to the Election Commission it can be assumed that the Election Commission should proceed to investigate the dispute before giving its opinion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Khondker Delwar Hossain Vs The Speaker, Bangladesh Jatiya Shangshad (Parliament), 19 BLD (HCD) 45.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ref: AIR 1994 (SC) 1558; AIR 1956 page 1892; PLD1969 (Lahore)602; PLD 1963 (SC) 486; 1884 (12) Q.B.D. 271; “Constitutional Law of Bangladesh”—Mahmudul Islam; Mays Parliamentary Practice (Seventh Edition) 62—Cited.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Article.—67(1)(b)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Absence of a member from Parliament without its leave for ninety consecutive sitting days</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The question in this Reference is whether the ‘absence’ of some members of Parliament comes within the mischief of Article 67(1)(b) of the Constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Special Reference No. I of 1995, 15 BLD (AD) 194.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Article—67(1)(b)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In all written constitutions the framers envisage the possibility of absence from the House, whatever be the reasons and put an upper limit to the period of absence with a provision of bye election to keep the democratic process in motion. Our constitution provides the longest possible latitude to the members of Parliament during which they can remain absent without leave. the term ‘absent’, however, cannot receive different interpretations in different circumstances, because that will introduce an element of uncertainty in the interpretation of a constitutional provision and will make the door open to provide for the longest longitude as well. The Court cannot give its stamp of approval to two kinds of parliamentary absence, one sanctioned by the Constitution and the other outside the purview of the Constitution. Article 67(I)(b) of our Constitution allows members of Parliament to remain absent, for any reason whatsoever, for eighty nine consecutive sitting days without the leave of the Parliament, no matter whether this period is consumed by an individual member or by some members en bloc by illness, absence from the country, walkout or boycott. Once this permissible limit is crossed, the guillotine will apply and the member “shall vacate his seat.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Special Reference No. 1 of 1995, 15 BLD (AD) 194 .</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">ref: AIR.

Article 70 was introduced to achieve this objective. The spirit was that members elected to the Parliament should continue to maintain their allegiance to the party by which they have been nominated and to uphold the manifesto and programme of that party in national politics. It was designed to ensure that the party which forms the Government can continue to govern the country and not be destabilized and dethroned by floor crossing and horse trading being allured by the other side and vice versa. This provision was deliberately inserted in view of the prevailing political culture of the country. Political party has been recognised as a constitutional entity for the first time in the Constitution of Bangladesh and indirectly in Article 70 the constitution of a political party is also recognised by use of the words “resigns from the party”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The Secretary, Parliament Secretariat, Dhaka Vs Mr. Khandker Delwar Hossain and others, 19 BLD (AD) 276.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ref: PLD1969(Lahore) 602; PLD 1963 (SC)486.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Article.—70(1)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The resignation of the two B.N.P. members of Parliament from their party under Article 70(1) of the Constitution and the dispute caused by it, as a whole, does not fall within the meaning of a proceeding in Parliament, the conduct of business and definitely not a matter falling within the meaning of regulation procedure’ or ‘maintenance of order’ in Parliament.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Khondker Delwar Hossain Vs The Speaker, Bangladesh Jatiya Shangshad (Parliament), 19 BLD (HCD) 45.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Article—78</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The dispute raised by the two B.N.P. leaders by their letters to the Speaker could not have been settled through Parliamentary proceeding simple because Parliament is not forum envisaged by the Constitution, to address such a dispute.
