But when the writing contains scandalous and offensive language to bring the Court into disrespect and disrepute and castigates its dignity and majesty and it challenges its authority, the writer being a member of the subordinate judiciary, commits contempt of court. The offending observations contained in the article in question have undoubtedly cast aspersions on the courage and ability of the Judges of the Supreme Court and the same do amount to contempt of court.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The Judge’s of the High Court Division Vs Ashok Kumar Karmaker and others, 16 BLD (HCD) 233.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ref: Quintin Hogg Case, (1958) 2 V,7LR 1206; Special Reference No.1 of 1964, 1965 (SC)745; 16 DLR 535 (S.C.); 46 DLR 555— Cited.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—3</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Punishment for contempt of Court</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The impugned statement by the respondent published in the daily newspapers neither directly nor indirectly imputes any aspersion to a Judge and the Court nor does it contain any scandalous statement against a Judge or the judiciary to lower down its image in the estimation of the public in general but it serves as a constructive criticism relating to the appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court and as such it does not constitute contempt of the Court. The disputed statement or any part of it makes no reference to the judgment of any of the Judges of either Division of the Supreme Court. The suggestion for constitution of a six-man committee, including the Law Minister, the Speaker, the learned Chief Justice and two other Senior Judges of the Appellate Division and one Member from the Bar Association and one Member from the Bar Council for appointment of Supreme Court Judges appears to be an honest criticism of the constitutional provision relating to the mode of appointment of Supreme Court Judges.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Dr. Ahmed Husain, Senior Advocate Vs.

Exception 1 itself relaxes the rigours of section 28. The plea of sovereignty and interest of the country and its. citizens, if accepted, will render foreign arbitral jurisdiction absolutely nugatory. Such a consequence will itself be op. posed to public policy, for no country lives in an isolated island these days.

Such contract does not offend the main provision of section 28 of the Act because the local Courts still retain the jurisdiction to decide the us between the parties.

Exception (1) to Section 28 of the Contract Act, however, enacts a saving clause in favour of the contracts to refer to arbitration any dispute that may arise between the parties. Hence arbitration clause is protected by Exception (1) to Section 28 of the Contract Act. [Per Latifur Rahman, J.]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bangladesh Air Service (Pv.) Ltd. Vs.

Where inspite of the intervention of events subsequent to the making of the agreement, which were not in the contemplation of the parties and which could not be foreseen with reasonable diligence, the contract could still be performed in substance, then it cannot be said that the contract has become impossible of performance within the meaning of section 56 of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

The plea of frustration of the contract of lease having not specifically taken in the written statement and the defence being one of denial of the plaintiff’s title, then one of permissive possession, then extinction of permissive possession by fire and thereafter possession of structures in his own right and title and the defendant successfully resisting the plaintiff’s attempt for taking the suit out of the S.C.C. Court for trial as a regular suit, the defendant’s plea for a regular suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession cannot be entertained as it will tantamount to putting a premium on the defendants desperate and contradictory stands.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

The filing of the suit on 7.7.99 based on a non-existing right is ill-conceived, aimed at prolonging enjoyment of the said bridges under the cover of litigations for making illegal gains. It is evident from the admission of the PW 1 that the plaintiff defaulted in payment of the scheduled installments when trial Court found that at least two installments for the lease money had remained unpaid along with other dues of a huge amount money which is clear violation of the clauses of the lease agreement. Since the plaintiff continued to enjoy the privilege of collecting of tolls even after 9.6.99, defendant No. 1 committed no illegality in claiming government dues from the plaintiff by the impugned notice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a democratic society the government functionaries are under constitutional and moral obligations to mete out equal treatment to all citizens irrespective of social standing and political affiliations.

When the Ordinance, a special enactment, excludes the application of section 5 of the Limitation Act for condonation of delay to an appeal it cannot be hold that the learned District Judge failed to exercise his jurisdiction vested under section 134(5) of the Ordinance in not condoning delay in filing the appeal.

In view of said provision it cannot be said that an appeal against an order of assessment of custom duty or imposition of fine is not an equally efficacious remedy. Unless and until an appeal is filed against an order of assessment of customs duty or imposition of fine and prayer made for exemption from depositing the duty demanded or fine imposed showing good reason for the same and such prayer is unreasonably or arbitrarily rejected it cannot be said that the remedy of appeal provided under the Act is not equally efficacious remedy entitling the aggrieved person to seek remedy by invoking writ jurisdiction.

It simply did not take any steps in terms of the proviso to section 194 of the Customs Act. In that view of the matter the Appellate Division did not think that the High Court Division was well found in law, in the facts and circumstances of the case, that the respondent rightly invoked the writ jurisdiction and that its writ petition was maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Finance and others Vs Section Steel Industries lid., 19 BLD (AD) 98.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—196B</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of Section 196B of the Customs Act 1969 the Government could, on its own, call for and examine the records of the proceeding relating to such orders as passed by the Member N.B.R. but such calling and examining of the record must confine to the records which were before the Member NBR, the appellate authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>M/s.
