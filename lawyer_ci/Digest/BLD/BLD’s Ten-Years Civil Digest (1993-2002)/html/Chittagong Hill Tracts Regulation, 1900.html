Both the Government and the Court have to recognise their custom and usage and not to introduce any other criterion or factor which will add to the customary requirements of that office. The introduction of an element of political acceptability of a claimant to the office of the Bohmong Chief is an extraneous consideration in the selection of the Bohmong Chief, which is an alien criterion for selection.</p><p><strong><em>Aung Shwe prue Chowdhury Vs.
