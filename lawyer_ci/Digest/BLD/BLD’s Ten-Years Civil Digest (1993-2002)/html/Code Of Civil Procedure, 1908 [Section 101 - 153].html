A review is never contemplated to be a re-hearing of a case for re-opening a closed chapter. It is available only under certain well-defined circumstances, namely, where some important evidence has been discovered, which could not, inspite of due diligence, have been known to the party to be produced at the time of hearing or the Court has overlooked some important question of fact and law, which would have a direct bearing on the decision of the case, or there is otherwise some apparent mistake. or error on the face of the record. The ground that the Court has fallen into an error in deciding an important question or that an important ground was not urged at the original hearing, cannot be the ground for review. The finality or sanctity that attaches to a judgment or order passed by a competent Court on hearing the contending parties cannot be lightly interfered with in review.</p><p><strong>Sree Parimal Chandra and others Vs Mst.

Majid Vs Iqbal Bahar Chowdhury and others, 20 BLD (AD) 149.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—151</strong></p><p>in the Artha Rin Adalat Am no provision has been made for the return and rejection of the plaint as contemplated under Order VII Rules 10 and 11 of the Code. When an Artha Rin Adalat having no jurisdiction entertains a suit wrongly and proceeds with it, the aggrieved party cannot be left without any remedy. If it is evident on the face of the record that the Artha Rin Adalat has wrongly assumed jurisdiction and is illegally, proceeding with a suit, the High Court Division may act under Section 151 of the Code, which provides that nothing in the Code limits or otherwise affects the inherent power of the Court to make such orders as may be necessary to secure the ends of justice or otherwise to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court. In exercise of the inherent power the High Court Division directed the Artha Rin Adalat to return the plaint to the filing Advocate for presentation before the appropriate Court.</p><p><strong>Kazi Jawaherul Islam (K.J.

Standard Co-operative Credit Society Limited &amp; ors, 18 BLD (HCD) 311.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—151</strong></p><p>The Court has inherent power to rectify its own mistake or any mistake committed by any Court official causing prejudice to a particular party, for no fault of its own, by resorting to the provision of section 151 C.P.C. a party cannot be made to suffer for the mistake done by the Court and the aggrieved party cannot be pushed to take recourse to any ardourous, costly and time-consuming exercise for rectifying such a mistake. In such circumstances, exercise of power under section 151 of the Code is not only permissible but also imperative for preventing an injustice. Availability of an alternative remedy under other provisions of the Code does not always stand in the way of exercise of the inherent power of the Court for doing even-handed justice for which alone the Court exists.</p><p><strong>Abdul Mannan Sikder Vs.

Suit 44 of 1978 and on the self-same grounds he has filed a, fresh suit challenging the legality of the said decree, it is apparent that he has resorted to dilatory tactics to deprive the respondents of the fruity of the decree. The learned Courts below were perfectly justified in rejecting the petitioner’s prayer for staying further proceedings of the previous suit.</p><p><strong>Jamil Akhter V Khurshed Anwar and another, 16 BLD (HCD) 171.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—151</strong></p><p><strong>Inherent Powers of the Court</strong></p><p>In a case where there are allegations of fraud practiced upon the Court an application under section 151 C.P.C would lie but when the allegations are that fraud was practiced upon a party to the proceeding, an application under section 151 C.P.C. at the instance of the aggrieved party would not lie. In the later case the proper course for the aggrieved party would be to institute a regular suit to set aside the impugned decree or order. In a case where fraud is committed upon the Court as well as upon the aggrieved party, the Court has inherent jurisdiction to interfere in exercise of its power under section 151 C.P.C. to remedy the wrong inspite of availability of other remedies in the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p><strong>Abdus Sattar Khondker Vs.

Since there is no limitation for filing an application for amendment of the decree, it may be filed even when an appeal is pending against the decree or when the appeal has been disposed of without noticing the clerical or accidental error. in the decree. The limitation for filing an appeal runs from the date of the original decree and not from the date on which the decree is subsequently amended under Section 152 of the Code.</p><p>In exercise of the power of review the Court which has passed the decree may amend or modify it in any way and to any extent which it thinks proper in a given case.
