A suit at the instance of some co-sharers in exclusive possession of a joint property for recovery of possession against a trespasser is quite maintainable in law. In such a case the failure to implead other co-sharers as parties to the suit will not affect the plaintiff’s right to recover possession from the trespassers.</p><p>The uniform judicial opinion is that a Suit by only one co-sharer in exclusive possession of a joint property warding off an invasion to the rights of all co-sharers of a joint property is maintainable in law.</p><p><strong>Baroda.

The applicants having set up a different geneology and claiming title and possession in a large area of the suit land on the basis of purchase during the pendency of the suit their interest in the land purchased by them will not be affected if the suit is decided in their absence. Moreover, parties cannot be allowed to obtain documents in respect of the suit land during pendency of the suit in the names of their minor sons and daughters, married or unmarried, to set up a different case, at the peremptory hearing stage of the suit, from the one they had set up earlier with the object of lingering the litigations.

Defendant No.2 being an allottee under defendant No. 1 and being in possession of the first floor of the building is a proper party to the suit and the order of the trial Court making him a party is a proper order that calls for no intereference.</p><p><strong>Mrs. Jahanara Begum Vs.

When the earlier suit came up before the Appellate Division it was found that the present claim of taka 7 lacs was made in a concealed manner in paragraph 21 of the plaint of that suit. The learned counsel appearing for the defendant-petitioner submitted at that time that the plaintiff-respondent could not get taka 7 lacs in that suit without suing for account and his submission was accepted. The defendant-petitioner cannot now turn round and take up an opposite stand to plead that the present suit for that particular relief is not available to the plaintiff in view of the provision of Order II Rule 2 C.P.C. In the facts of the case, it cannot be said that the present suit comes within the mischief of Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. for rejection of the plaint.</p><p><strong>Sonali Bank Vs.

The only limitation in allowing an amendment of the plaint is that the proposed amendment should not change the fundamental character and nature of the suit. The settled law is that amendment of pleadings may be allowed at any stage of the proceeding for the purpose of determining the real of controversy between the parties.</p><p>A suit for simple declaration of title and recovery of possession and/or partition is essentially based on a common claim of the plaintiff which may call for different relief or reliefs in different situations and as such the adding of a relevant new relief by way of amendment does not change the nature and character of the suit when the claim of the plaintiff basically rests on the same foundation. In the instant case by adding a relief for partition in a suit for declaration of title and possession there is no alteration to the foundation of the suit and the fundamental character of the suit remains the same and as such the proposed amendment was rightly allowed.</p><p><strong>Abdul Motaleb Vs Md.

A plaint rejected a suit is entertained, i.e., registered in a register of civil suits under Order IV Rule 2 of the Code. Summons is issued under Order V of the Code. A plaint is rejected if it falls under the mischiefs of described in clauses (a) or (b) or (c) or (d) of Order VII Rule 11 of the Code. Order VII Rule 13 of the Code provides that the rejection of a plaint on any of the grounds mentioned in Rule 11 shall not of its own force preclude the plaintiff from presenting a fresh plaint in respect of the same cause of action. In other words, if the plaintiff removes the cause of action for rejection of the plaint he can present a fresh plaint in respect of the same cause of action. Rejection of plaint shall be deemed to be a decree in terms of section 2(2) of the Code and is therefore appealable.</p><p>Article 34 of P 0 128 of 1972 is an independent substantive and procedural provision regarding bar of entertainment of a suit on grounds different from those described in order VII Rule II of the Code. Article 34(5) specifically lays down that if the prayers in the suit are of the description contained in Article 34(5) (a) (i ) or (ii) or (iii), then the suit will not be entertained. In an ordinary civil suit the plaint is rejected, inter alia, “where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law.” Therefore in an application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code the statement in the plaint has to be looked into to determine if the suit is barred by any law. But under Article 34(5) it is not the statement in the plaint but the reliefs claimed in the suit under Article 34(5) (a) (i) or (ii) or (iii), which will determine whether the suit is entertain- able or not. Under Order VII Rule II of the Code it is the statement in the plaint which is the determining factor, but under Article 34(5) it is the relief claimed which is the determining factor.

First, there has to be an existence of a liability of repayment of a loan. Secondly, there has to be default in re-payment of loan in terms of the agreement. Thirdly, the properties to be taken over and/or sold by the Sangstha must have to be a property pledged, mortgaged, hypothecated or assigned by the industrial concern to secure its liability to the Sangstha. The power under clause (1) can be exercised if the aforesaid conditions are fulfilled and the ouster clause (5) comes into play when the Sangstha acts in consonance with clause (1) and not otherwise. In this regard the expression “under clause(1)” occurring in clause (5) and the expression “such taking over or transfer” in the said clause and clause (5)(a)(i)(ii)(iii) are particularly noticeable. In other words, if the conditions of clause (i ) are not fulfilled the ouster clause (5) does not operate. In that case the purported action under clause (1) would be taken without jurisdiction. Such a case will not come within the mischief of clause (5).</p><p><strong>Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha Vs Rahman Textile Mills Ltd. and Ors., 19 BLD (AD) 207.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Order VII Rule 11</strong></p><p>A plaint may be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code merely on a plain reading of the plaint but in exceptional circumstances the Court may invoke its inherent jurisdiction and can throw the plaint out in limini.
