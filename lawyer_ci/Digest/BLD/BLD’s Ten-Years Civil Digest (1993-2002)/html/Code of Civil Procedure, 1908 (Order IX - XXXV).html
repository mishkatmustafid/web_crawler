The general rule is that on an application under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code the Court is competent to set aside an ex-parte decree as against the applicant alone but if it is found that the decree in question is indivisible one, in that case the Court has no alternative but to set aside the entire decree even though the decree was passed against some of the defendants on contest on merit. It is also well settled that even if the decree is divisible the Court, in consideration of the nature of the suit -and the decree, is competent to set aside the decree as a whole in the interest of justice. The determining factor is the nature of the decree and not the reasons behind the decree.</p><p><strong>Rezaul Karim Vs.

Since two courses are open to the plaintiff against the exparte dismissal of the suit for default the defendant is not supposed to know the remedy actually availed of by the plaintiff in this regard, unless notified. Moreover, with the dismissal of the suit, albeit exparte, a valuable right accrues to the defendant and that right cannot be taken away without affording him an opportunity of being heard. Since the restoration of the suit took place beyond the knowledge of the defendant, the latter is entitled both in equity and as of right to a fresh notice of the date fixed for hearing of the suit after its restoration.</p><p><strong>Md.
