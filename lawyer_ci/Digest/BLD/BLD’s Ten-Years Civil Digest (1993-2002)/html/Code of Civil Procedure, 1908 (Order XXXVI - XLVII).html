It is purely discretionary with the appellate Court to grant such a relief on for a sufficient cause. If the operation of the order of temporary injunction is stayed till the disposal of the appeal, it simply means that there is not only no order of injunction in existence but also it virtually gives the appellant the final relief of the appeal pending adjudication. In the absence of any compelling reasons and that too for preventing an apparent injustice, the stay of operation of the impugned order. of temporary injunction pending decision in the appeal is not contemplated in law.</p><p><strong>A.
