The High Court Division was well aware of the legal position and having found that there was an apparent breach of section 95 of the Act in holding the meeting on 7.1.1995 granted temporary injunction. The said order of injunction was found to be inappropriate but the same cannot be a routine matter to be followed under all circumstances:</p><p><strong>Mohammad Mohibul Ahsan (Shawan), Director, Ittefaq Group of Publications Ltd.

In the instant case, out of four Directors of the Company the petitioners are two Directors and they hold 50% of the shares of the Company. Consequently the petitioners cannot be regarded as minority share-holders and as such they are not entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court under section 233 of the Companies Act.</p><p><strong>Moksudur Rahman Vs.

Case 235 (Delhi)—Cited.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Section—233</strong></p><p>The Court in its summary jurisdiction will not go into factual disputes or on a fact finding mission as the evidence involved is too complicated. The main function of the Court is not to see whether fraud is committed but whether the resolutions adopted are unfair to the company and the minority shareholders.</p><p>For the adoption of a special resolution in any extraordinary general meeting amending an article or articles, there should be a prior Board decision or a decision of the Board by circulation expressing the need for such amendment.</p><p>Where the articles of association specifically lay down that an extraordinary general meeting may be called either by the Board or the Managing Director, such meetings convened by the company secretary “by order of the Board” in the absence of any evidence that the secretary was empowered to do so, are not properly called meetings and are no meetings in the eye of law. Any decision taken in those meetings suffers from illegality.</p><p>The re-appointment of the managing director of the company should not be done under the agenda item of miscellaneous matters of the notice of the Board meeting. It leads one to believe that this might have been done only to regularize holding of the post of managing director once the question is raised as to the continuation of his appointment.</p><p>The arrogation of absolute authorization to give loan from the company’s funds by the managing director to all directors, including himself as managing director, is contrary to the provisions of company law and prejudicial to the interest of the company and its members. While amending the articles dealing with fiduciary powers, it should have been kept in mind that such powers are exercised only in the interest of and for the benefit of the company and not for the interest and benefit of the directors.</p><p>A sole authority given by an amendment of an article of association to the managing director of a company to open and operate bank account/accounts both in Bangladesh and abroad is prejudicial to the interest of the company and its members. It centralizes the power in one hand, as the managing director alone can open and operate bank accounts requiring no resolution of the Board, so that the Board will not know where in the world an account is opened in the name of the company, giving plenty of opportunity to the managing director to divert and misappropriate the company’s fund.</p><p><strong>Md Shahadat Hossain v. Base Textile Limited, 21 BLD (HCD) 585.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Section—233</strong></p><p>Section 459 of the English provision is based upon “unfairly prejudicial” conduct. The Bangladesh statute does not require any unfair conduct. Even if the conduct is fair but prejudicial, the Bangladesh provision will apply.</p><p>Past acts which have no effect on the petitioner at the date of the petition will not normally give rise to relief under s. 233. The acts must have an effect on the petitioner on the date of the petition. It must be continuous act on the part of the majority shareholder continuing up to the date of the petition. It must show that the company’s affairs are being conducted in a manner oppressive to a particular part of the members. The conduct must be burdensome, harsh and wrongful.</p><p>There must be a casual nexus between the misconduct relied upon and the effect upon the applicant. The alleged conduct of commission or omission must relate to the affairs of the company, one of whose member is the petitioner. The management of a company is entrusted to the directors, who under the law have to exercise their powers in the interest of the company as a whole. A remedy under section 233 can only be given only if the directors have acted in the breach of duty or if the company has breached any of its articles or any relevant agreement.</p><p>The validity of the petition has to be judged on the facts alleged in it. The petitioner can rely upon supporting affidavits from persons having personal knowledge of the allegation of oppression, mismanagement and misconduct or on expert opinion.</p><p>Section 233 enables a member to obtain a remedy where a company with sufficient profit persistently refuses to pay dividends or the member is excluded from the profit after he is no longer a director.</p><p>The failure on the part of the majority to give the petitioners a say in the running and management of the company is prejudicial. As a result, the prejudice suffered by the petitioners is that they were “locked out” of the company within which their investment was locked in. They can neither take out their investment nor participate in the conduct of the affairs of the company.</p><p>A pending money suit filed by the petitioners for damages for sums misappropriated! defalcated from the company by the respondents does not bar a proceeding under section 233 of the Companies Act because a proceeding under section 233 comes within the statutory jurisdiction of the company court whereas the money suit is a derivative action.</p><p>The facts of the particular case provided reasons for the court to pass an order directing majority shareholders to purchase jointly or severally all the shares owned jointly by the minority shareholders at a price valued by an expert and accepted by the court, with interest till realisation.</p><p><strong>Mrs. Homera Ahmed and others v.

If act or omission of the directors is such which is fraudulent in character or when the majority endeavor directly or indirectly to appropriate to themselves money, property or advantages which belong to the company or in which other share holders are entitled to participate, the petitioner or petitioners are entitled to relief in the section. The petitioner must however show the infringement of his right or any other oppression suffered by him in the matter of his interest in his capacity as a member, not as a director.</p><p>A member of the company will be able to bring himself within the section if he can show that the value of his share holding in the company has been seriously diminished or at least seriously jeopardised by reason of a course of conduct on the part of those who have had de-facto control of the company, which has been unfair to the member concerned.</p><p>The act or omission by the majority shareholders, who are in de-facto control of the company, affecting or destructive of the interest of the shareholders generally including the petitioners as a minority shareholder is normally called in question by petition under section 233 of the Act.</p><p><strong>Dr. A.M.B.

The petitioner’s claim that he is a ‘contributory’ to the Bulk Management Limited having not been proved, he has no <em>locus standi</em> to petition for the winding up of the Bulk Management Limited. The petitioner who is not even a share-holder of the Bulk Management Limited cannot derive any advantage or minimise any disadvantage from winding up of the respondent Company and as such the petitioner is not competent to file the present petition for winding up.</p><p><strong>Mazharul Hoque Vs.

Outsiders are not required to inquire whether internal regulations of the company were in fact complied with but are entitled to assume that the company acted in accordance with its Articles of Associations.

An order of winding up of a company can be made in the discretion of the Court but under section 250 of the Act, when a winding up order has been made, no suit or other legal proceedings shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company except by leave of the Court.</p><p><strong>Mr. Amir Hossain v.
