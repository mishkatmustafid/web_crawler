The protection which was been given under paragraphs 3A and 18 to the “acts and things done” relate to those that were done in exercise of the powers derived or purported to have been derived from the Martial Law Proclamation. They have been ratified and confirmed and are declared to have been validly made, done or taken and shall not be called in question before any Court, Tribunal or authority on any ground whatsoever. Evidently, the acts and things which were done on the August, 1975 to which indemnity was sought to be given by’ the Indemnity Ordinance were not done in exercise of the powers derived from the said Ordinance. Therefore, they have no nexus with the “acts and things done” referred to in paragraphs 3A and 18. [Per A.T.M.
