It is also the constitutional obligation of the Government to ensure that the rights of the people, envisaged in under Art.18 and Art.32 of the Constitution are vindicated and defended.

The nature and character of their function are different. Moreover, Article 22 has emphasized on separation of the judiciary from the executive. Sub-paragraph (6) of Paragraph 6 of the Transitional and Temporary Provisions of the Fourth Schedule mandates compliance of Chapter II of Part VI of the Constitution which in effect requires all concerned to maintain, preserve and protect the independence of the judiciary and also to enhance the separation of the judiciary from the executive and preserve the then arrangement as a temporary and transitional one.</p><p><strong>Secretary, Ministry of Finance and others Vs Mr. Md.

In view of the provisions of Article 137 the direction to establish another public service commission for judicial and magisterial services is not contrary to the provision of the constitution for recruitment of persons to be employed for judicial service and magistracy exercising judicial functions in accordance with the provisions of Article 140 of the Constitution for the recruitment of persons to be employed in the judicial and magisterial service is in consonance with the spirit of Article 22 of the Constitution.</p><p><strong>Secretary, Ministry of Finance and others Vs Mr. Md.

The law of restitution of conjugal rights is a violation of the concept of social justice as enunciated in the preamble of the Constitution as well as under Article 27 of the Constitution, providing equal protection of law to all citizens. and Article 28 thereof providing guarantee against discrimination on grounds of religion, race, sex etc. The dictum of restitution of conjugal rights is a violation of the concept of liberty, freedom, equality and social justice enshrined in our Constitution. Consequently, the law of restitution of conjugal rights is repugnant to the Constitution and as such void. No suit for restitution of conjugal rights is maintainable in law in any Court in Bangladesh.</p><p><strong>Khodeja Begum and others Vs. Md.

This restriction in effect negates/abridges the petitioner’s right as a citizen in pursuing his lawful profession as a businessman and as such this is inconsistent with the concept of equality before law as enshrined in Articles 27 and 40 of the Constitution.</p><p>Persons performing any function in connection with any affair of the Republic, especially those dealing with public right or interest must maintain a high degree of vigilance so that fundamental rights as guaranteed by the Constitution are preserved, protected and safe-guarded.</p><p><strong>Nasiruddin Ahmed Vs.

The training of the recruits in batches was not a requirement of any law or rule but it was necessitated because of the logistic constraints of the Biman. The grouping of persons for training recruited in the same examinations held under the same advertisement for recruitment was, therefore, an act performed by the Biman under compulsion. The High Court Division was justified in taking the view that although the training of the recruits was held in batches it was practically one training which started on 15. 10.1989 and ended on 25.1.1990. In that view of the matter the seniority list was required to be prepared in order of merit on the completion of the training on 25.1.1990. It is not the merit at the time of recruitment but it is the merit at the end of the training which governs the question of seniority according to Regulation 18(c).</p><p>Since no reasonable basis for classification for placing in groups for training could be proved it was obvious that there was enough scope for arbitrary selection and as such it is violative of the equality clause as being arbitrary and discriminatory.</p><p><strong>Aminul Haq Vs.

The Bangladesh Bank (Staff) Regulations having been made under the Bangladesh Bank Order 1972, are protected legislations and as such these cannot be declared void on the ground that they are inconsistent with or repugnant to Article 27 as offending the concept of equality before law.</p><p>Conditions of Service of Government Servants are regulated by law made in pursuance of Article 133 of the Constitution and they come under protection of Article 135 of the Constitution. In pursuance of these Articles, the Government Servants (Discipline and Control ) Rules, 1976, subsequently renamed as Control and Appeal Rules 1984, have been made. The services in the Bank and other statutory bodies are not protected by Article 135 of the Constitution.</p><p><strong>Bangladesh Bank and others Vs.

Their impoverishment lead them to float and flock together in certain areas where vacant space is available and start by constructing huts in slums engaging themselves in the jobs of rickshaw-pulling, day labourer and garment workers, maids etc. The Government and the non-Government Organisation sometimes come to their succour in a very un-planned manner for their rehabilitation making some poor poorer and some poor idle turning them into misguided terrorist/ mastaans/drug traders/traffickers and violent arms cadre. Sp the misfortune remains with their until their death.</p><p>Our Constitution both in the directive State Policy and in the preservation of the fundamental rights provided that the State shall direct its policy towards securing that the citizens have the right to life, living and livelihood, Thus our country is pledge bound within its economic capacity and in an attempt for development to make effective provision for securing the right to life, livelihood etc. As to the fundamental State policy which is not enforceable and the fundamental rights the Indian Supreme Court held in the case of Olga Talis Vs. Bombay Municipal Corpora- tion (1985) 3 S.C.C. 454 that “Article 37 provides that the directive principles, though not enforceable by any Court, are nevertheless fundamental in the Governance of the country. The principles contained in Articles 39(a) and 41 must be regarded as equally fundamental in the understanding and interpretation of the meaning and content of fundamental rights. If there is an obligation upon the State to secure to the citizens an adequate means of livelihood and the right to work, it would be sheer pedantry to exclude the right to livelihood from the content of the right to life. The State may not, by affirmative action’s, be compellable to provide adequate means of livelihood or work to the citizens. But any person, who is deprived of his right to livelihood except according to just and fair procedure established by law, can challenge the deprivation as offending the right to live conferred by Article 21.”</p><p><strong>Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) and others Vs Government of Bangladesh and others, 19 BLD (HCD) 488. </strong></p><p>Ref: (1985) 3SCC 454—relied upon.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Articles—27 and 29(1)</strong></p><p>Article-27 of the Constitution provides that all citizens are equal before 1w and are entitled to equal protection of law and Article 29(1) of the Constitution provides That there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizen in respect of employment or office the service of the Republic.</p><p>If the petitioners merely prepared a list and kept it to themselves or their different departments for implementation as and when possible the writ petitioners had nothing to complain about, but when a number of them are appointed from a list and the appointment of others is postponed pending inquiry into the genuineness of a list comprising of 1745 persons with which list the writ petitioners have no concern, they can legitimately complain of inequality before law and discrimination in public employment.</p><p><strong>The Secretary, Ministry of Establishment, Government of Bangladesh &amp; others Vs Md.

Syndicated bridge financing for the Ekushey Television by some foreign and local banks and the investment by the USA finance company is neither a contribution to philanthropy nor an effort to do something for the noble cause of free media. it is a simple case of investment, and like every investment the investment in ETV has its own risk. The third party rights exist and fall with the Ekushey Television, since their interests are merged with that of ETV. The substantive legal principle in this regard is that every person is subject to the ordinary law within the jurisdiction.

Right to life under Articles 31 and 32 of the Constitution is not thus confined to protection of life and limbs only necessary for full enjoyment of life but it also includes, amongst others, protection of health and normal longevity of an ordinary human being.

An offence as defined in the General Clauses act means an act or omission made punishable by law for the time being in force. Therefore, the prosecution is meant to be in reference to the law that creates the offence and the punishment must also be according to what is prescribed by that law. The professional misconduct, under a service rule  might amount to a criminal offence, the courts are there to deal with it. and not the Departmental Enquiry Committee that can act only as a fact-finding body to recommend certain penalties like removal, dismissal, demotion etc. It has certainly no duty to investigate an offence that is punishable under the Penal Code or any other law. Proceeding before it, therefore, is not a criminal proceeding to protect a person’s right guaranteed under Article 35(2) of the Constitution against the principle of double jeopardy.</p><p><strong>Shaikh Md.

Act I of 1981 provides in detail the procedure to be followed to implement Article 66(4). Section 3 of the Act I. of 1981 further provides a time limit of thirty days within which the Speaker shall refer the dispute along with a statement to the Election Commission for it to be heard and determined. The law is so specific and the procedure laid down is so elaborate that the assumption by the Speaker of the role of deciding whether there is dispute, to the exclusion of the Election Commission, makes the constitutional provisions on anti defection redundant. What is important to remember is that the Speaker has no power to adjudicate upon the matter in disputes.

It is the opinion of the Election Commission which is in substantive decisive.

Article 70 was introduced to achieve this objective. The spirit was that members elected to the Parliament should continue to maintain their allegiance to the party by which they have been nominated and to uphold the manifesto and programme of that party in national politics. It was designed to ensure that the party which forms the Government can continue to govern the country and not be destabilized and dethroned by floor crossing and horse trading being allured by the other side and vice versa. This provision was deliberately inserted in view of the prevailing political culture of the country. Political party has been recognised as a constitutional entity for the first time in the Constitution of Bangladesh and indirectly in Article 70 the constitution of a political party is also recognised by use of the words “resigns from the party”.</p><p><strong>The Secretary, Parliament Secretariat, Dhaka Vs Mr. Khandker Delwar Hossain and others, 19 BLD (AD) 276.</strong></p><p>Ref: PLD1969(Lahore) 602; PLD 1963 (SC)486.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article.—70(1)</strong></p><p>The resignation of the two B.N.P. members of Parliament from their party under Article 70(1) of the Constitution and the dispute caused by it, as a whole, does not fall within the meaning of a proceeding in Parliament, the conduct of business and definitely not a matter falling within the meaning of regulation procedure’ or ‘maintenance of order’ in Parliament.</p><p><strong>Khondker Delwar Hossain Vs The Speaker, Bangladesh Jatiya Shangshad (Parliament), 19 BLD (HCD) 45.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—78</strong></p><p>The dispute raised by the two B.N.P. leaders by their letters to the Speaker could not have been settled through Parliamentary proceeding simple because Parliament is not forum envisaged by the Constitution, to address such a dispute.
