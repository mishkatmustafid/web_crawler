Any person other than an officious intervener or a wayfarer without any interest in the cause beyond the interest of the general people of the country having sufficient interest in the matter in dispute is qualified to be a ‘person aggrieved’ and can maintain an action for judicial redress of public injury arising from breach of some public duty or for violation of some provision of the Constitution or the law and seek enforcement of such public duty and observance of such constitutional or legal provision. The real test of ‘sufficient interest’, of course, essentially depends on the co-relation between the matter brought before the Court and the person who is bringing it. [Per A.T.M.

It is the case of the appellant that it did not nominate the writ petitioner as its candidate for the by election in question and therefore it has a sustained interest in its protected symbol “Langal”. If the decision of the High Court Division in the impugned judgment is to the effect that the symbol “Langal” will be allotted to a person who has not been nominated by the appellant as its candidate in the by- election in question, then that political party, namely, the appellant, has every locus standi to prefer this appeal and prosecute the same in order to safeguard and protect its claimed protected symbol.</p><p>If the candidate who has withdrawn does not present himself on the date of allotment of symbols and/or if his political party does not oppose the allotment of the symbol “Langal” to the lone candidate remaining on the scene, the lone candidate will not get a walkover. The Returning Officer will still have to scrutinize the political credentials of the candidate on the basis of written documents produced by the lone candidate. If he has filed only the letter of the Secretary General of his party, the Returning Officer is not in a position to grant him the symbol “Langal” as he has also a similar letter from another Secretary General of the same party in his possession. He has to be satisfied from the written documents of the lone candidate or if contested or if opposed by the rival candidate or his party, then from both sides” written documents as to which is the political party known as Jatiya Party which was allotted the symbol “Langal” in the general election held on the 12° June, 1996. The Returning Officer rejected the symbol “Langal” to respondent No. 1 on the ground that he failed to produce papers to show that he was a candidate nominated by the Jatiya Party which contested the General Election held on the 12th June, 1996 with the symbol “Langal”. He has perfectly and correctly understood the direction of the Election Commission. It is the High Court Division which misconstrued the direction by holding that since respondent No. 1 expressed his preference for the symbol “Langal” and a letter of Mr. Anwar Hossain Manju was in favour of allocating the said symbol to respondent No. 1, and as no one from the Jatiya Party represented by Mr. Naziur Rahman Manju opposed the prayer of respondent No. 1, the Returning Officer acted illegally in allocating the symbol of “Butterfly” to respondent No. 1. The High Court Division has not even noticed the directions of the Election Commission and has gone astray in laying down the path to be followed by a Returning Officer while deciding a thorny and sensitive matter of allocating a protected symbol.</p><p><strong>Jatiya Party represented by Md.

The High Court Division has to pass an interim order under clause (1) of sub-clause (a) of clause (2) of Article 102 of the Constitution under the following constraints:</p><p>(1) Sub-clause (b) of clause (4) enjoins that the High Court Division may make an interim order of fulfillment of the conditions precedent for the exercise of the power.</p><p>(2) The first condition is that the Attorney General will be given a reasonable notice of the applications or he or an Advocate authorised by him in that behalf will be given an opportunity of being heard. If the High Court Division is of the opinion that an interim order is inextricably connected with sub-clause (a) or (b) of clause (4), it ought to refrain from passing an interim order, fix a date for passing an interim order, fix a date for appearance of the Attorney General or his authorised Advocate giving him a notice therefore unless in the facts of the case the High Court Division is of the opinion that the Attorney General and sufficient notice of the application had there was no cogent reason for his non-appearance for making submissions on the interim order.</p><p>(3) The non-appearance of the Attorney General will not by itself be a ground for the High Court Division to pass an interim order unless it satisfies itself that the interim order is not likely to have the effect of causing prejudice or interference with the implementation of a development work or programme or it would have the effect of being harmful to the public interest. (4) The satisfaction of the High Court Division in passing the interim order is latent in the order itself, even though no satisfaction is explicitly expressed.</p><p>(5) The High Court Division will not consider whether an interim order will actually prejudice or interfere with the implementation of any development programme or work or will actually be otherwise harmful to the public interest but will only consider whether such interim order is likely to have the said effect.</p><p>(6) Broadly speaking to obtain an interims order a writ petitioner must not only make out a prima facie case but a very strong prima facie case and the balance of inconvenience in his favour shall be so strong that it will outweigh the consideration of sub-clause(a) o (b) of clause(4).</p><p>(7) Generally speaking, impeding the assessment or collection of public revenue is harmful to the public interest. In the absence of any jurisdictional issues involved, there is no justification to protect temporary private interest by interim order impeding collection of the public revenue.</p><p>(8) When the order under challenge• found to suffer from an absolute lack of jurisdiction or when it is in gross violation of Law apparent on the face of the applications causing grave injustices, where denial of interim relief will lead to public mischief, the High Court Division will look into the matter but in’ doing so it will consider whether-in-spite of a prima facie case and balance of convenience, the individual interest should be subjugated to public interest.</p><p>(9) It serves no public purpose to permit the Customs authorities to realise all the claims before they release the goods if the claimed amount has prima facie no sanction of law.

Therefore, he has a right to ask the Court to issue a writ of quo warranto asking the respondents under what authority of law they were holding such public office. In such circumstances the Court is justified in issuing a writ of quo warranto in order to get information from the respondents as to how they cling to their office without performance of duties and obligations attached to such office.
