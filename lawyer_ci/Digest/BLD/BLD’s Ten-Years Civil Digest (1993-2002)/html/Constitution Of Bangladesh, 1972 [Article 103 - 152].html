A review lies where an error apparent on the face of the record exists. It is not a re-hearing of the main appeal. Review is not intended to empower the Court to correct a mistaken view of law, if any, taken in the main judgment. It is only a clerical mistake or mistake apparent on the face of the record that can be corrected by the leave but it does not include the correction of any erroneous view of law taken by the Court.</p><p><strong>Secretary, Ministry of Finance and others Vs Mr. Md.

Similar or identical provisions were embodied in Article 162 of the Constitution of 1956 and Article 59 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1962, Article 143 of the Constitution of India, Article 129 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka and Article 130 of the Constitution of Malaysia.</p><p>This Article is couched in wide terms which provides that any question of law may be referred by the President for consideration of the Appellate Division if at any time it appears to him that such a question has arisen or is likely to arise which is of such a nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon it. The discretion is entirely of the President. Expediency, or the motive, political or otherwise, or bonafides of making the Reference cannot be gone into by the Court. The Appellate Division may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report its opinion thereon to the President. Although the giving of opinion by the Supreme Court is not obligatory, it will be unwilling to decline a Reference except for good reasons of a compelling nature. It is well settled that the opinion given under Article 106 of the of Constitution is not a judgment or a law declared giving rise to a binding effect.</p><p><strong>Special Reference No. I of 1995, 15 BLD (AD) 194.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—109</strong></p><p>Article 109 provides that the High Court Division shall have superintendence and control over all Courts and Tribunals subordinate to it. According to this provision of the Constitution, Courts and Tribunals subordinate to the High Court Division are under the direct control and supervision of the High Court Division in all respects and as such no further constitutional provisions are necessary to bring the subordinate Courts under the supervision and control of the High Court Division. By constitutional mandate the subordinate Courts have already been separated and made independent and brought under the High Court Division fully, finally and conclusively. [Per Md.

The constitutional implication of this Article is that the subordinate judiciary unlike the Supreme Court of Bangladesh is not a creature of the Constitution but of law. Its status is not the same as that of the Supreme Court. The Constitution has guaranteed the independence of the Judges of the Supreme Court in exercise of their judicial functions by making some provisions in the Constitution. There are provisions regarding appointment of Judges, their tenure of office, their removability only after being tried by their own peers in the Supreme Judicial Council where they have the fullest opportunity to defend themselves, their salary being chargeable on the consolidated fund and a provision in Article 147 that the remuneration, privileges and other terms and conditions of the Judges of the Supreme Court shall not be varied to their disadvantage during their terms of office.

Masdar Hossain &amp; others, 20 BLD(AD) 104.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—115</strong></p><p>In Article 115 it is the President who has been vested with the primary power, as distinguished from contingent power, to frame rules with regard to appointments of persons to offices in the judicial service or as magistrates exercising judicial functions. This rulemaking power of the President is constitutionally different in content, manner and effect from the contingent rule-making power of the President in the proviso to Article 133 of the Constitution.</p><p>Article 115 of the Constitution provides a direct, primary and plenary power of the President to make rules with regard to appointments of persons to offices in the judicial service or as Magistrates exercising judicial functions. The Parliament has no authority under our Constitution to make laws or the Government has no authority to pass orders or frame rules on this subject. The Parliament also cannot delegate to the executive Government the authority to pass any executive order on the subject. Nor does the Constitution require that the President shall exercise his power under Article 115 in consultation either with the Supreme Court or with any public service commission.</p><p>After amendment the recommendatory role of the Supreme Court in the case of appointment of District Judges and the consultative role of the appropriate public service commission and the Supreme Court in the case of appointment of any other persons in the judicial service have been done away with.

If the rules as contemplated under Article 115 of the Constitution are not sufficient and complete to implement and carry out the purpose of effective separation, some other enactments may be made for complete and effective implementation of the same. [Per Md. Mozammel Hoque, J.]</p><p><strong>Md. Masdar Hossain and 440 others Vs Bangladesh and others, 18 BLD (HCD) 558.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Articles—115 and 116</strong></p><p>Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 Sessions Courts are functionally and institutionally separate from the executive organ. But the Magistrates are members of the administrative service and they work under the control of the District Magistrate who is also the Deputy Commissioner and control of the District i.e.; the top executive and administrative head of the District. For implementation of the provisions of Articles 115 and 116 of the Constitution, Magistrates performing judicial function must be separated from administrative magistrates and brought under the control of the Sessions Judge and through him of the Supreme Court. [Per Md. Mozammel Hoque, J.]</p><p><strong>Md. Masdar Hossain and 440 others Vs Bangladesh and others, 18 BLD (HCD) 558.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—115 and 116</strong></p><p>Article 116 speaks of vesting of control and discipline in the President of persons in the judicial service and magistrates exercising judicial functions that too in consultation with the Supreme Court to safeguard independence of judiciary. This provision of the constitution clearly reflects the independence of the judiciary. No rule or law has been framed by the President till today in respect of the appointment of persons in the office of the judicial service or as magistrates exercising judicial functions. On the President of the Republic a solemn duty is cast to make Rules regarding the appointments of persons in the judicial service and magistrates exercising judicial functions. The power given under Article 115 is built in power of the President under the constitution to frame rules. This is the plenary power of the President to frame rules and this take immediate effect on the rules being made by the President. This legislative field has been exclusively given to the President by the Constitution. This rule making power of the President contemplates the manner, method, qualifications and other ancillary matters required to be covered by the rules before appointment of members of judicial service and magistrates exercising judicial functions. The President will also make separate rules regarding suspension and dismissal and other disciplinary procedures under Article 115. It is for the rule making authority, namely, the President to decide the manner and method of appointment of members of judicial service and magistrates exercising judicial functions. [Per Latifur Rahman, J agreeing with Mustafa Kamal, C.J]</p><p><strong>Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Government of Bangladesh Vs Mr. Md. Masdar Hossain &amp; others, 20 BLD (AD) 104.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Articles—115, 116, 133</strong></p><p>Setting up of the separate Judicial Service Commission is not contrary to the provision of Article 133 of the Constitution which provides that subject to the provisions of the Constitution parliament may by law regulate the appointment and conditions of service of persons in the service of the Republic. The power of the Parliament and the President under Article 133 of the Constitution to make law and rules in respect of the terms and conditions regulating appointment and the conditions of service as Article 133 of the Constitution are applicable to the members of the judicial service as a class apart from the executive and administrative civil service of the Republic. They are to be treated as a class apart from other services of the Republic as a distinct entity, never to be treated alike or merged or amalgamated with any other service, except with a service of allied nature. Their pay and allowances ought to be determined separately by a separate Judicial Public Service Commission. Article 133 cannot be invoked for the judicial officers—Judicial officials are not persons in the service of the Republic for the purpose of Article 133 and hence rules regarding their appointment and condition of service cannot be framed under Article 133.</p><p><strong>Secretary, Ministry of Finance and others Vs Mr. Md. Masdar Hossain and others, 21 BLD (AD) 126.</strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Article—116</strong></p><p>Article 116 provides that the control, power of posting promotion and grant of leave and discipline of the persons employed in judicial service and the Magistrates exercising judicial functions shall vest in the President who will exercise all those powers in consultation with the Supreme Court. It appears that all the above functions of the President are not being exercised by the President according to the true sense and spirit of the above Article 116. The High Court Division held that the President shall exercise all those functions not through the executive organ of the state but through the Supreme Court by making suitable rules. [Per Md. Mozammel Hoque, J]</p><p><strong>Md. Masdar Hossain and 440 others Vs Bangladesh and others, 18 BLD (HCD) 558.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—116A</strong></p><p>Article 1 16A provides that all persons in judicial service and the judicial functions shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. If Articles 115,116 and 116A are read with Article 109 of the Constitution, it will give clear and unambiguous picture that by inserting these provisions in the Constitution, the framers of the Constitution have already separated the judiciary, i.e.; the subordinate Courts, including the Magistrates exercising judicial functions, from the executive and only necessary enactments and rules are required to be made to implement, give effect to and carry out the purposes of the said constitutional provisions. [Per Md. Mozammel Hoque, J]</p><p><strong>Md. Masdar Hossain and 440 others Vs Bangladesh and others, 18 BLD (HCD) 558.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—116</strong></p><p>Article 116 of the Constitution of Bangladesh provides that the control (including the power of posting, promotion and grant of leave) and discipline of persons employed in the judicial service and magistrates exercising judicial functions shall vest in the President and shall be exercised by him in consultation with the Supreme Court.</p><p>A plain literal reading of the Article shows that the control which includes the power of posting, promotion and grant of leave and the discipline of persons employed in the judicial service and magistrates exercising judicial functions is to be executed by the President and he shall exercise this power in consultation with the Supreme Court.</p><p>Article 116 of the Constitution clearly envisages that whenever the question of posting or promoting a person employed in the judicial service and magistrates exercising judicial functions comes up for consideration before the President, consultation with the Supreme Court becomes mandatory. The words “posting, promotion:’ in this Article are not qualified by any other words and these are wide enough to include all sorts of posting and promotion of persons employed in the judicial service. It is also clear that the post. ing and promotion of persons in the judicial service may also be made in a non-judicial post as these words cannot be construed to mean posting and promotion in judicial service alone. Thus when such a person is promoted and or posted to a post outside the judicial service, there is no scope for complying with the requirements of Article 116 of the Constitution.</p><p>In the instant case, by the impugned notification three District Judges were promote as Joint Secretaries in the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs without prior consultation with the Supreme Court in terms of Article 116 of the Constitution. This has been held to be ultra vires of Article 116 of the Constitution and as such unconstitutional.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Md.

The Parliament in exercise of its power under Article 136 cannot usurp the primary rule-making power of the President under Article 115. Article 136 will always have to be read keeping in view the fact that the reorganization of the services of the Republic cannot be allowed by amalgamating or unifying the judicial service with any other civil administrative executive services of the Republic or by placing the judicial service on a par with the civil administrative executive services on making it one of the many Cadre services of the Bangladesh Civil Service.

Judicial service may be amalgamated with judicial magistrates pursuing a judicial career all the way. But as oil and water cannot mix, the judicial and civil administrative executive services are non-amalgamable.</p><p>The Supreme Court and the subordinate courts are the repository of judicial power of the State. Functionally and structurally judicial service stands on a different level from the civil administrative executive services of the Republic. While the function of the civil administrative executive services is to assist the political executive in formulation of policy and in execution of the policy decisions of the Government of the day, the function of the judicial service is neither of them. It is an independent arm of the Republic which sits on judgment over parliamentary, executive and quasi-judicial actions, decisions and orders. To equal and to put on the same plane the judicial service with the civil administrative executive services is to treat two unequals as equals. Article 1 16A of the Constitution was also lost sight of and it was conveniently forgotten that all persons employed in the judicial service and all magistrates are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions while the civil administrative executive services are not.

Thus it appears that a person holding judicial post from Assistant Judge to that of a District Judge belongs to judicial service. Chapter II of Part VI of the Constitution deals with subordinate courts. Articles 1.15, 116 and 1 16A speak of persons employed in ‘judicial service’ and ‘magistrates exercising judicial functions’. It is clear that the members of the judicial service and the magistrates exercising judicial functions exercise judicial power of the State as distinct and separate from executive power and other cadre services of the State. Article 1 16A also contemplates that the members of the judicial service and magistrate exercising judicial functions shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. It is to be borne in mind that judicial functions is distinct from other functions as visualized in the Constitution itself.</p><p>“The service of the Republic” means any service, post or office whether in a civil or military capacity, in respect of the Government of Bangladesh, and any other service declared by law to be a service of the Republic. In the same article, public officer has been defined which means “public officer means a person holding or acting in any office of emolument in the service of the Republic”. In broad concept the service of the Republic means all services of Bangladesh. It is a generic term and any person who is getting emolument because of his service in the republic is a public officer. In that sense, the member of the judicial service and the magistrates exercising judicial functions are no doubt public officers in the generic term. But within the scheme of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh the nature of judicial service has been contemplated as distinct and separate from other works performed by other officers of other cadre services. The judicial service is, of course, included in the definition of service of the Republic but they have been separately treated within the scheme of the Constitution as reflected in Articles 115, 116, 1 16A and 152(1) of the Constitution.
