The alleged information by a nominated officer cannot be a proper communication of acceptance by the Corporation. The tenderer acquired no vested right on the property merely because his tender for that property had not been rejected and his earnest money had not been refunded by the Corporation. As there was no definite communication of acceptance of tender by the Corporation no vested right was acquired by the plaintiff.</p><p><strong>Sahana Chowdhury (widow) and others Vs Md Ibrahim Khan and another, 21 BLD (AD) 79.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—7</strong></p><p>An acceptance must be expressed in some usual and reasonable manner, unless the proposal prescribes a particular manner in which it is to be accepted. Acceptance means, in general, communicated acceptance. In the instant case the manner of acceptance has been clearly indicated by the plaintiffs in Exhibit-8 signifying offer. [Per A.T.M. Afzal, C.J; (Majority)]</p><p><strong>Bangladesh Muktijoddah Kalyan Trust, represented by the Managing Director Vs Kamal Trading Agency and others, 18 BLD(AD)99</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—16</strong></p><p>Defendant No. 1 was undoubtedly in a dominant position on account of his high official position and close association with the Martial Law Authority at the relevant time and the plaintiff had a helpless role to play in the face of pressure from the Martial Law Authority. The bargain obtained by defendant No. 1 in the compromise petition was clearly unconscionable because the plaintiff had to give up his rightful claim in the contractual land. The burden of proof that the compromise was not attained by undue influence, therefore, lay squarely upon defendant No.1 which he has miserably failed to discharge.</p><p><strong>Abul Hossain Vs Farooq Sobhan and others, 19 BLD(AD)291</strong></p><p>Ref: 51 md.

Au agreement for sale of the suit land not being enforceable against a minor it cannot been forced against the promisor as well for lack of mutuality. The submission that a contract entered into with a minor is not always void and a minor can ask for its enforcement if it is for his benefit is not applicable to the facts of the present case.</p><p><strong>Md.

B)—Cited.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Section—28</strong></p><p>Foreign Arbitration Clause is an integral part of International Trade and Commerce</p><p>Section 28 makes void to that extent every agreement by which any party thereto is restricted absolutely from enforcing his rights under or in respect of any contract by the usual legal proceedings in ordinary tribunals but Exception 1 to section 28 provides that section 28 shall not render illegal a contract if disputes are referred to arbitration, that is, for determination by a person or persons other than a Court of competent jurisdiction. Exception 1 itself relaxes the rigours of section 28. The plea of sovereignty and interest of the country and its. citizens, if accepted, will render foreign arbitral jurisdiction absolutely nugatory. Such a consequence will itself be op. posed to public policy, for no country lives in an isolated island these days. Foreign arbitration clause is an integral part of international trade and commerce today. [Per Mustafa Kamal,J]</p><p><strong>Bangladesh Air Service (Pv.) Ltd. Vs. British Airways PLC, J7BLD(AD)249</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—28, Exception 1</strong></p><p>There is nothing in Exception 1 to section 28 of the Contract Act that prohibits the parties to a contract from choosing a foreign forum under the supervision of a foreign Court for arbitrating their disputes. Such contract does not offend the main provision of section 28 of the Act because the local Courts still retain the jurisdiction to decide the us between the parties. [Per Mustafa kamal, J.]</p><p><strong>Bangladesh Air Service (Pv.) Ltd. Vs. British Airways PLC, 17 BLD (AD) 249.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—28, Exception 1</strong></p><p>Section 28 of the Contract Act deals with making those contracts void which restrict the right of a contracting party from taking legal actions in the ordinary tribunals through usual process of law. Exception (1) to Section 28 of the Contract Act, however, enacts a saving clause in favour of the contracts to refer to arbitration any dispute that may arise between the parties. Hence arbitration clause is protected by Exception (1) to Section 28 of the Contract Act. [Per Latifur Rahman, J.]</p><p><strong>Bangladesh Air Service (Pv.) Ltd. Vs. British Airways PLC, 17 BLD (AD) 249.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Sections—42 and 45</strong></p><p>The suit was filed during the life time of all the partners of the firm, but defendant- respondent Nos. 2 to 4 and 6 died during the pendency of the suit. Provisions of sections 42 and 45 of the Act clearly indicate that when a person or two or more persons made a joint promise to two or more persons they are jointly liable for the performance of the same and the right to claim performance of the same rests as between him and them during their life time and if any of them died their representative must be brought on record to enable them to perform the contract. But in the instant case admittedly defendant Nos. 2 to 4 and 6, partners of firm, died during pendency of the suit before the trial court and no step was taken for their substitution in the suit. Therefore, the suit must fail as it cannot be proceed against dead persons.</p><p><strong>Pubali Bank Ltd Vs M/s. Sultana Oil Mills and Soap Factory and others, 19 BLD (HCD) 249</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—56</strong></p><p><strong>The Doctrine of Frustration of a Contract</strong></p><p>To attract the doctrine of the frustration of a contract the performance of the contract must become impossible due to the happening of certain events. Where inspite of the intervention of events subsequent to the making of the agreement, which were not in the contemplation of the parties and which could not be foreseen with reasonable diligence, the contract could still be performed in substance, then it cannot be said that the contract has become impossible of performance within the meaning of section 56 of the Act.</p><p><strong>Md. Mokbul Hossain Khondker Vs. Mosammat Jaheda Khatoon, 14 BLD (HCD) 549.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—56</strong></p><p><strong>Doctrine of Frustration</strong></p><p>Doctrine of frustration as embodied in Section 56 of the Contract Act is applicable to leases of immovable property. The plea of frustration of the contract of lease having not specifically taken in the written statement and the defence being one of denial of the plaintiff’s title, then one of permissive possession, then extinction of permissive possession by fire and thereafter possession of structures in his own right and title and the defendant successfully resisting the plaintiff’s attempt for taking the suit out of the S.C.C. Court for trial as a regular suit, the defendant’s plea for a regular suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession cannot be entertained as it will tantamount to putting a premium on the defendants desperate and contradictory stands.</p><p><strong>Md.

The filing of the suit on 7.7.99 based on a non-existing right is ill-conceived, aimed at prolonging enjoyment of the said bridges under the cover of litigations for making illegal gains. It is evident from the admission of the PW 1 that the plaintiff defaulted in payment of the scheduled installments when trial Court found that at least two installments for the lease money had remained unpaid along with other dues of a huge amount money which is clear violation of the clauses of the lease agreement. Since the plaintiff continued to enjoy the privilege of collecting of tolls even after 9.6.99, defendant No. 1 committed no illegality in claiming government dues from the plaintiff by the impugned notice.</p><p>In a democratic society the government functionaries are under constitutional and moral obligations to mete out equal treatment to all citizens irrespective of social standing and political affiliations. Granting of revenue holiday to the plaintiff involving crore of taka without any justifiable reason is a classic example of wanton discrimination and miss use of discretion in managing the affairs of the State. The public  functionaries must be cautious in doling out charities by way of grant. ing revenue holiday to individuals or establishments against public interest.</p><p><strong>M/s.

Defendant No. 8 represented defendant Nos. 1-7 both for the purpose of the suit land and for execution of the Kabala as their attorney.
