But when a suit is filed for partition and for recovery of possession then he is required to pay advalorem court fee on the value of his share of the suit property under Section 7 (VT-A) of the Court Fees Act. Even if the plaintiff claims to be in possession of his share of the suit property but he prays for declaration of his title and partition then also he is required to pay advalorem court-fee on the value of his share of the suit property under Section 7 (IV) (C) of the Court-Fees Act.</p><p><strong>Mahmudul Huq and others Vs Nowab Au Chowdhury and ors, 16 BLD (HCD) 195.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Sections—7(XI), 8C and 8D</strong></p><p><strong>Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, Order VII Rule 10</strong></p><p><strong>Return of Plaint</strong></p><p>Section 7(XI) of the Court-Fees Act provides an objective standard for valuation of a suit for eviction of a monthly tenant by the landlord. In such a case, the subjective satisfaction of the plaintiff is of no avail.</p><p>Under Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure the Court may return a plaint to the filing Advocate when it finds that he has no jurisdiction, either pecuniary or otherwise, to entertain and try the suit. A plaint cannot be returned on the ground of incorrect valuation of the suit or for want of adequate court fees. If it appears that the suit has not been properly valued and sufficiently stamped, the Court is required to make an enquiry either by himself or by any other person appointed by him on that behalf to determine the correct valuation of the suit in terms of sections 8C and 8D of the Court Fees Act, The learned Assistant Judge clearly erred in law in returning the plaint to the filing Advocate ignoring the express provisions of law regulating the return of the plaint and the valuation of the suit.</p><p><strong>Didar ali  and others Vs.
