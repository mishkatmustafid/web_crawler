The Government in exercise of its power under Section 19 of the Customs Act can grant exemption of customs duty wholly or in part which is already fixed by the Legislature as provided in the First Schedule of the Customs Act.

On the basis of change of price in the foreign market from time to time Government increases or decreases tariff value of goods to be imported in the country to prevent evasion of payment of proper customs duty by under invoicing or to prevent smuggling out of foreign exchange by over invoicing. This power of the Government to fix tariff value was not questioned in the writ petition by the writ petitioner respondent. So charging and realization of enhanced sales tax and custom duty cannot be objected to as the above provisions of section 25(7) and 30 of the Act provide both the value and the rate of duty applicable to any imported goods on the date on which bill of entry is presented under section 79 of the Act.[Per Latifur Rahman, C.J.]</p><p><strong>Bangladesh and others Vs Mizanur Rahman, 20 BLD (AD) 212.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—25(1)(2)</strong></p><p>Sub-section (1) and (2) of Section 25 of the Act authorize the department to assess normal price of the goods! import in question in the Rule considering the contemporary commercial price of the goods at the place of origin with notice to the importer or agent to produce any document or paper in support of their invoice value, which shall be the basis for ascertainment of the normal price in the event of cancellation of the CRF certificate.</p><p><strong>Alhaj Nazir Ahmed Vs The National Board of Revenue and others, 21 BLD (HCD) 59.</strong></p><p>Ref: Dhaka Warehouse Ltd Vs.
