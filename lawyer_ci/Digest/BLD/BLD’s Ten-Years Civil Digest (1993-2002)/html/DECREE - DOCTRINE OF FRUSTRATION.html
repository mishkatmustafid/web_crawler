No one should be allowed to interfere with the course of justice by presenting the Court with a fait accompli. If a party to a proceeding brings about any change in the existing state of things on the date of the institution of the proceeding, in order to forestall the possible order of the court, the court may, in a proper case, in the exercise of its inherent power require the offending party to restore the status- quo ante by issuing a temporary injunction in mandatory form—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908), Section—151 and Order 39 Rules I and 2.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Babul Kanti Das and others Vs.

The phrase to appear and answer the appeal’ admits of one simple construction, requiring the respondents to appear on the day fixed for hearing of the appeal under rule 16(2) and answer the points raised by the appellants in support of their appeal.
