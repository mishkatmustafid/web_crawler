In 1974 the Emergency Property (Continuance of Emergency Provisions)(Repealed) Ordinance, 1974 was promulgated which was subsequently made Act No. XLV of 1974. This was followed by Act No. XLVI of 1974. Under the provisions of the aforesaid Ordinance the Vested and Non- resident properties were being administered. The Vested and Nonresident Property (Administration) (Repealed) Ordinance, 1974 was replaced by Ordinance No. 92 of 1976 and in that Ordinance there was a saving clause for protecting the existing proceedings and lists in respect of vested and non- resident properties. Excepting this saving clause the vested property law was totally repealed. In the circumstances, treating the suit property as a vested and non-resident property in the year 1979 by starting a new V. P. case is illegal and without jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Dhaka Vs.

In the circumstances, the lawful order the High Court Division could pass under the law was to direct the appellants either to derequisition the case property under section 8B of the Act or to finally acquire the same by publishing in the Gazette a notification under section 5(7) of the Act. The High Court Division wrongly exceeded its jurisdiction in assuming the executive functions of the Government by officials directing release of the case property in favour of the writ petitioner.</p><p><strong>Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and others Vs Abdul Wahab Mia and others, 21 BLD (AD) 94.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—5(1)(7)</strong></p><p>For assessment of compensation for the acquired property the period of “24 months” shall be the period preceding the date of notice under section 5(1).

But in the instant case the records shows that no step for obtaining the approval of the Government was taken in the case of appellant.</p><p>The sequence of events shows that the appellant made application before the Additional Land Acquisition Officer claiming compensation when he had no title and interest in the case lands. As the notice of the assessment was collusively procured and as such it cannot be considered a notice under section 7 (aa) of the Act. Accordingly the arbitration proceeding was, therefore, without jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>Md. Abdul Majid Dana Vs Bangladesh, 19 BLD (AD) 12.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—8B</strong></p><p>There is no principle of law under which once a property has been validly acquired for a public purpose, as admitted by Government and has vested in the requiring body then even if the said property be utilized for a different purpose, the acquisition shall not stand void. A simple reading of section 8B of the Act shows that it does not come into operation in the circumstances of the case. So the order of withdrawal from acquisition in question cannot be sustained.</p><p><strong>Brahamanbaria Pourashava Vs Secretary, Ministry of Land Reforms, Government of Bangladesh and others, 19 BLD (AD) 87.</strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Section—8B</strong></p><p>After finality has reached to a proceeding for requisition and acquisition and compensation has been paid for the property, there can be no order for withdrawal from acquisition and return of the property to its former owner as section 8B of the Act stands as a bar against it.</p><p><strong>Md.
