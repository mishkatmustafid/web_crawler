There is no compulsion in the said provision to deny the ancillary or concomitant power of granting stay while entertaining an appeal by the High Court Division.

Rekha appeared before the trial Court and expressed her willingness to live with her mother who was divorced long ago by petitioner Abdur Razzaque. Abdur Razzaque had already taken a second wife and he did not take any care of his minor daughter nor did he pay any maintenance to her so far except giving her small gifts at times. Considering the welfare of the child, the High Court Division was right in refusing to the petitioner the custody of Rekha-- Guardian and Wards Act, 1890 (VIII of 1890), Section -25.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdur Razzaque Sarder Vs.
