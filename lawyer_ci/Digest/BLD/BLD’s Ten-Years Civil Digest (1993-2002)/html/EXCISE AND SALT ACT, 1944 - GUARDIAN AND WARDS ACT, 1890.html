The language used in both the sections of law is one and the same. The view taken by a Single Judge of the High Court Division that “the law of restitution of conjugal rights is void” while exercising power under section 115 of the Code, cannot be endorsed to strike down a piece of legislation practiced over a long period.

Afzal, CJ: </strong>The law requires that the relief must be specifically claimed either simply or in the alternative. It is true that general or other relief which the Court may think just may be granted although not specifically asked for. But the essential conditions are that the averments in the plaint must justify such relief and the defendant must get an opportunity to contest such relief. In the name of granting general or other relief the court cannot and would not mount any surprise on the defendant make liable for something which does not arise out of the plaint and as such he had no occasion to answer the same. This is merely an extension of the principle of natural justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The defendant was admittedly absent at the hearing of the revision before the High Court Division. The worst that could happen to him was that the Rule could have been discharged for default or on merit and the appellate judgment and decree would have been maintained in that case. But if the learned Judges entertained some bright and innovative ideas about some verses of the Quran hitherto not known for saddling the defendant with more liability than the plaintiff had claimed and received, then was it not necessary and lot elementary that the defendant ought to have been put on notice again? It was like enhancing the sentence of an accused in exercise of revisional jurisdiction in a criminal case. Could any tribunal do it without putting him on prior notice? This is exactly what has been done by the High Court Division which to say the least, was unfortunate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Md. Hefzur Rahman Vs.

An appeal lies under section 17 of the Ordinance to the Court of District Judge. The High Court Division interferes in revision under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure when the lower appellate Court appears to have committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. In such a case the High Court Division may make such order in the case as it thinks fit. The High Court Division did not say in the impugned judgment that the lower appellate Court committed any error of law on the point of maintenance. Giving the plaintiffs a substantive relief beyond the frame of the suit is beyond the jurisdiction of the revisional court and is a sad case of judicial excess defying all judicial norms and trampling the judicial procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Md.

Under sub-section (5) of Section 16 of the Ordinance it is permissible for the Court to allow installments even after the passing of the decree. The difference between the general provisions and those provided in section 16(5) of the Ordinance is that whereas under the former the power is hedged by certain conditions including one of limitation. But under sub-section (5) of section 16 of the Ordinance there is no such condition except that the power should be exercised by way of proper judicial discretion. This power is wider under subsection (5) of section 16 of the Ordinance and it may be exercised either on the application of a party or even suo motu so long as the decree remains unsatisfied. A Family Court therefore has the power to allow installments as it deems fit even after the passing of the decree.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reshma Sultana Vs Khaez Ahmed Mojumder, 17 BLD (AD) 72.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ref: A.I.R. 1921 (Patna) 340; A.I.R. 1932 Allahabad 273 (FB), A.I.R. 1943 Nagpur 340 (F.B); A.I.R. 1985 (Andhra Pradesh) 49;— Cited.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—20</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, Order XLI Rule 27</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 20 of the Ordinance is a bar to the application of the Civil Procedure Code in a Family Court proceeding with the exception of sections 10 and 11 under the Family Courts Ordinance.

Although in the present case the departmental proceeding was started on the basis of the conviction of the respondent in the Summary Martial Law Court but it was an independent enquiry in which the respondent had examined several witnesses in his defence and no fault was found by either of the tribunals with the enquiry procedure. The order of compulsory retirement was passed following an independent enquiry and the said order has been affirmed in appeal filed under the Rules. Under such circumstances, irrespective of the question as to whether conviction on a criminal charge in a Martial Law Court is covered by Rule 8 of the Rules or not, the order of punishment cannot be interfered with in the absence of any fault found with the departmental proceeding.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Government of Bangladesh Vs Md.

If the enquiry report makes finding in favour of the delinquent employee and the punishing authority disagrees with the said findings and holds that charges framed against I delinquent employee have been proved, the punishing authority is required to give some reasons for disagreeing with the findings of the Enquiry Officer. Unless the reasonings are perverse and shocking to human conscience, based on pure surmises and conjectures, there is no scope for the High Court Division to reject the reasonings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, represented by its Chairman Vs Kazi Abdul Hye, 17 BLD (AD) 156.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ref: Md.
