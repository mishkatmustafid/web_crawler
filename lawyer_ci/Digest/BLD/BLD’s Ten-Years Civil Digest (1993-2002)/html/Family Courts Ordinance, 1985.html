Any person professing any faith has a right to bring a suit for the pur. poses mentioned in Section 5 of the Family Courts Ordinance. A Hindu wife is therefore entitled to bring a suit for maintenance against her husband under the Family Courts 0rdinance.</p><p><strong>Nirmal Kanti Das Vs.

The Appellate Division held that residuary Article 120 of the First Schedule, providing for a period of limitation of 6 years from the time when the right to sue accrued in respect of a suit for which no period of limitation is provided elsewhere in the First Schedule, will be applicable to a suit for maintenance by a Muslim wife under the Family Courts Ordinance 1985.</p><p><strong>Jamila Khatun Vs.

It is on record that the plaintiff and the defendant are highly educated persons and they are responsible government officers. From the judgment of the Appellate Division it appears that the defendant-petitioner has got married again and as such the welfare of the twin sons will not be protected in the hands of the step-mother.</p><p><strong>Amirul Bor Chowdhury Vs.

Children in easy circumstances under Mohammadan law are bound to maintain their poor parents, although the latter may be able to earn something for themselves. These poor parents may also file suits in the Family Court for their maintenance from their opulent children. Similarly, poor or disabled relatives, even servants of the wife, can maintain a suit for maintenance under the Ordinance under circumstances enjoined by Mohammadan Law.</p><p><strong>Jamila Khatun Vs.

If Section 24 is read with section 5 of the Ordinance it will be evident that not only the Muslims but also the members of other communities professing other religion come within the ambit of the Ordinance and they are entitled to avail themselves of the forum of the Family Court for speedy settlement of disputes regarding maintenance, guardianship, custody of the children etc. and the Family Court has the exclusive jurisdiction to try these matters.</p><p><strong>Pachan Rissi Das Vs.

It is thus neither discriminatory nor violative of any of the provisions of the Constitution.</p><p>The view taken by a Single Judge of the High Court Division in the case of Khodeja Begum and ors. Vs. Md. Sadeq Sarker, reported in 1 8BLD3 1 that no amount of oral evidence is sufficient to prove the marriage unless the marriage is attendant with a duly executed kabinnama or that restitution of conjugal rights is violative of social justice and repugnant to Article 27 of the Constitution is not a correct proposition of law.</p><p><strong>Md.

The language used in both the sections of law is one and the same. The view taken by a Single Judge of the High Court Division that “the law of restitution of conjugal rights is void” while exercising power under section 115 of the Code, cannot be endorsed to strike down a piece of legislation practiced over a long period. The legitimacy or otherwise of a valid piece of legislation can only be decided in writ jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution.</p><p><strong>Hosna Jahan (Munna) Vs. Md.

Afzal, CJ: </strong>The law requires that the relief must be specifically claimed either simply or in the alternative. It is true that general or other relief which the Court may think just may be granted although not specifically asked for. But the essential conditions are that the averments in the plaint must justify such relief and the defendant must get an opportunity to contest such relief. In the name of granting general or other relief the court cannot and would not mount any surprise on the defendant make liable for something which does not arise out of the plaint and as such he had no occasion to answer the same. This is merely an extension of the principle of natural justice.</p><p>The defendant was admittedly absent at the hearing of the revision before the High Court Division. The worst that could happen to him was that the Rule could have been discharged for default or on merit and the appellate judgment and decree would have been maintained in that case. But if the learned Judges entertained some bright and innovative ideas about some verses of the Quran hitherto not known for saddling the defendant with more liability than the plaintiff had claimed and received, then was it not necessary and lot elementary that the defendant ought to have been put on notice again? It was like enhancing the sentence of an accused in exercise of revisional jurisdiction in a criminal case. Could any tribunal do it without putting him on prior notice? This is exactly what has been done by the High Court Division which to say the least, was unfortunate.</p><p><strong>Md. Hefzur Rahman Vs. Shamsun Nahar Begum and another, 19 BLD (AD) 27.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—6(4)(g) and 17</strong></p><p><strong>Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, Section—115</strong></p><p><strong>Per Mustafa Kamal, J:</strong> Section 6(4)(g) of the Ordinance provides that the plaint shall contain inter alia the relief which the plaintiff claims. An appeal lies under section 17 of the Ordinance to the Court of District Judge. The High Court Division interferes in revision under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure when the lower appellate Court appears to have committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. In such a case the High Court Division may make such order in the case as it thinks fit. The High Court Division did not say in the impugned judgment that the lower appellate Court committed any error of law on the point of maintenance. Giving the plaintiffs a substantive relief beyond the frame of the suit is beyond the jurisdiction of the revisional court and is a sad case of judicial excess defying all judicial norms and trampling the judicial procedure.</p><p><strong>Md. Hefzur Rahman Vs. Shamsun Nahar Begum and another, 19 BLD (AD) 27.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—16(3)</strong></p><p><strong>In the execution proceeding whether the subsequent execution against the judgment- debtor is maintainable or not?</strong></p><p>From the materials on record it was found that on the own seeking of the petitioner 40 installments were granted but the petitioner did not pay a single installment. The execution was started for one installment only in respect of Tk. 13,000/- and odd whereas the total decree was for Tk. three lac and odd and as such the entire decretal amount remained unpaid. As a matter of fact, the execution was for one installment and there is no legal bar to proceeding with the executing under section 16(3) of the Ordinance for the unpaid amount. The entire amount having remained unpaid. there is no legal bar to proceeding with the subsequent execution.</p><p><strong>Md. Serajul Islam Vs Maksuda Akhter (Navy) Advocate, 20 BLD (AD) 84.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—16(3B)</strong></p><p>In view of the provision of section 16(3B) of the Ordinance, a fresh and separate cause of action will arise for failure to pay money of each and every installment for the purpose of sending the judgment-debtor to imprisonment for his failure to pay the money under each installment.</p><p><strong>Maksuda Aktar Vs Md Serajul Islam, 19 BLD (HCD) 466.</strong></p><p>Ref: 1981 BCR 212; Karson Ranee Chawda, AIR 1958’99—Cited.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—16(5)</strong></p><p><strong>Enforcement of decrees</strong></p><p>Under the general law the trial Court may allow payment of the installments even after the passing of the decree under certain circumstances. Under sub-section (5) of Section 16 of the Ordinance it is permissible for the Court to allow installments even after the passing of the decree. The difference between the general provisions and those provided in section 16(5) of the Ordinance is that whereas under the former the power is hedged by certain conditions including one of limitation. But under sub-section (5) of section 16 of the Ordinance there is no such condition except that the power should be exercised by way of proper judicial discretion. This power is wider under subsection (5) of section 16 of the Ordinance and it may be exercised either on the application of a party or even suo motu so long as the decree remains unsatisfied. A Family Court therefore has the power to allow installments as it deems fit even after the passing of the decree.</p><p><strong>Reshma Sultana Vs Khaez Ahmed Mojumder, 17 BLD (AD) 72.</strong></p><p>Ref: A.I.R. 1921 (Patna) 340; A.I.R. 1932 Allahabad 273 (FB), A.I.R. 1943 Nagpur 340 (F.B); A.I.R. 1985 (Andhra Pradesh) 49;— Cited.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—20</strong></p><p><strong>Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, Order XLI Rule 27</strong></p><p>Section 20 of the Ordinance is a bar to the application of the Civil Procedure Code in a Family Court proceeding with the exception of sections 10 and 11 under the Family Courts Ordinance. The lower appellate Court cannot take evidence under Order XLI Rule 27 of the Code as the provisions of appeal in the Family Courts Ordinance do not provide for taking of evidence. Family Courts Ordinance being a special law must be applied strictly.
