The distinction between ‘Hiba’ (gift) and ‘Ariyat’ in Muslim Law stems from some basic distinctions between the concept of property in English Law and Muslim Law. In the instant case, the alleged deed of gift is found to be not a gift of the corpus but a gift of the usufructs for life in favour of the wife of the donor and this is permissible under the Muslim Law as it stands today in the subcontinent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Rabjel Mondal Vs.

Abul Kashem on the ground that the letter addressed to him by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes came back unserved but in disallowing this gift the Taxes Appellate Tribunal lost sight of the fact that the assessee applicant in support of his contention submitted the certified copy of the statement of account of the donors and it further appears that the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes himself confirms that these gifts have been shown by the donors in their respective wealth statements. But this aspect of the case was overlooked by the Taxes Appellate Tribunal in disallowing the gift made by Md. Abul Kashem. Thus, the order passed by the Taxes Appellate Tribunal do not withstand the scrutiny of law and as such the High Court Division held that the Taxes Appellate Tribunal, Additional Bench—2, Dhaka was not justified in disallowing the gift made by Md. Abul. Kashem on the ground of non service of letter addressed to him by the revenue authority-Income Tax Ordinance, 1984(XXXVI of 1984), Section—160.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.
