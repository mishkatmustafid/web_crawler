Although in the present case the departmental proceeding was started on the basis of the conviction of the respondent in the Summary Martial Law Court but it was an independent enquiry in which the respondent had examined several witnesses in his defence and no fault was found by either of the tribunals with the enquiry procedure. The order of compulsory retirement was passed following an independent enquiry and the said order has been affirmed in appeal filed under the Rules. Under such circumstances, irrespective of the question as to whether conviction on a criminal charge in a Martial Law Court is covered by Rule 8 of the Rules or not, the order of punishment cannot be interfered with in the absence of any fault found with the departmental proceeding.</p><p><strong>Government of Bangladesh Vs Md.

Union of India (Cal) (199 1)16, Administrative Tribunal Cases 18—Cited</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rule—7(5)</strong></p><p>It requires that on receipt of the report of the Enquiry Officer or the Board of Enquiry, the authority shall consider the report and record its findings on the charge.</p><p>The Enquiry Officer’s findings are not binding on the punishing authority. The authority has the duty, obligation and jurisdiction to give independent findings based not only on the enquiry report and papers submitted by the Enquiry Officer but also on other departmental reports and papers available to it. If the enquiry report makes finding in favour of the delinquent employee and the punishing authority disagrees with the said findings and holds that charges framed against I delinquent employee have been proved, the punishing authority is required to give some reasons for disagreeing with the findings of the Enquiry Officer. Unless the reasonings are perverse and shocking to human conscience, based on pure surmises and conjectures, there is no scope for the High Court Division to reject the reasonings.</p><p><strong>The Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, represented by its Chairman Vs Kazi Abdul Hye, 17 BLD (AD) 156.</strong></p><p>Ref: Md.

Ramzan Khan, 1991 (1) SCC 588—Cited.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Departmental Proceedings—</strong>Second proceeding on the same cause of action is not barred</p><p>The Appellate Tribunal after setting aside the order of dismissal from service on grounds of illegalities and irregularities in the enquiry proceedings directed a fresh departmental proceeding against the delinquent officer. The principle that a man cannot be vexed twice on the same cause of action having no application to departmental proceedings, the order of the Appellate Tribunal cannot be said to be illegal.</p><p><strong>Chaudhury Aziz Ahmed Hashmatullah Vs.

Secretary being the designated authority, the imposition of minor punishment has been lawfully passed in the case although the charge-sheet was submitted by the authority for imposing major penalty.</p><p><strong>Government of Bangladesh and another Vs M.A. Malek, 17 BLD (AD) 161.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rule—7(9)</strong></p><p><strong>Completion of departmental proceeding within 150 days</strong></p><p>In the instant case, no final decision was taken by the authority within 150 days as contemplated by Rule 7(9) of the Govt. Servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1985. But since the Tribunal found the very appointment of the petitioner as false and fictitious the Appellate Division refused to exercise its discretion to interfere in the case of a departmental proceeding as the petitioner would not be able to improve his case in a fresh inquiry.</p><p><strong>Md.

Jahangir Kabir Vs Bangladesh, 16 BLD (AD) 85.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rule 22</strong></p><p>Govt. Servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1985-Rule 22 prescribes the manner of disposal of an appeal by an aggrieved Govt. Servant, but no time limit has been fixed for disposal of appeals by the appellate authority.</p><p>Previously there was a provision for disposal of an appeal within 60 working days, but by the present amendment, this time limit has been abolished. But even in the absence of any time limit for disposal of the appeals by the appellate authority, inordinate delay in disposal of the appeal is deprecated inasmuch as the aggrieved party cannot ventilate his a grievance before the proper forum before disposal of his appeal.</p><p><strong>Md.
