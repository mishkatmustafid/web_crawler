Rekha appeared before the trial court as a court witness and expressed her willingness to live with her mother who was divorced long ago by petitioner Abdur Razzaque who had already taken a second wife while her mother Mosammat Jahanara Begum did not as yet take a second husband. The petitioner did not take any care of his minor daughter, nor did he pay any money for her maintenance except giving her small gifts and visiting her at school at times. Under these circumstances, considering the welfare of the child, the High Court Division was right in refusing the custody of Rekha to the petitioner.</p><p><strong>Abdur Razzaque Sardar Vs.Mosammat Jahanara Begum, 16 BLD(AD)163.</strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
