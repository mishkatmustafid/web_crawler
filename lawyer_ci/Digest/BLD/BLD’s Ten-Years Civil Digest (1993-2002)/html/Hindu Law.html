In the instant case, the onus is upon the transferee and transferee (defendants Nos. 1 and 2) as both of them contested the suit to prove the kinds of legal necessity led to the transfer of the suit land.</p><p>The word ‘Necessity when used in this connection has somewhat special, almost technical meaning. It does not mean actual compulsion, but the kind of pressure which the law recognises as serious and sufficient. The receipt even of full value for the property by a Hindu widow, where there is no pressure on the estate, will not justify the sale.</p><p><strong>Shib Nath Das alias Shib Nath Sarker Vs.

An adoptive son is entitled to be put in possession of his adoptive father’s property left by him at his death.</p><p><strong>Smriti Ranjan Das and another Vs.
