This was protected and saved in the category of other laws referred to in paragraphs 3A and 18 of the 4th Schedule of the Constitution. So, the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975(L of 1975) is not a part of the Constitution, rather it is an ordinary law protected and saved in the category of other laws’ enumerated in paragraphs 3A and 18 of the 4th Schedule. A simple majority in the Parliament was sufficient for repeal of the Indemnity Ordinance—Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972, Article—93(1) and 142.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shahriar Rashid Khan Vs.

Bangladesh and others, 17 BLD (HCD) 113.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Indemnity Ordinance</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As Ordinance L of 1975 is void it will not create any benefit or vested right in favour of the persons for whom it was made. The benefit of section 6 of the General Clauses Act is not available to them and their prayers for declaring the criminal proceedings pending against them illegal cannot be accepted, because the Indemnity Ordinance itself is void being repugnant to the Constitution—General Clauses Act. 1897 (X of 1897), Section—6.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shahriar Rashid Khan Vs.

The Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 dated 26.9.75 only related to the 15th August, 1975 incident and it was in no way connected with the incident which took place in jail on 3.11.1975—Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 (L of 1975), Section—2.</p><p><strong><em>Shahriar Rashid Khan Vs.

For such amendment the procedure of Article 142 of the Constitution is not necessary. A simple majority is enough to repeal the Indemnity Ordinance as it is an ordinary law. [Per Latifur Rahman, J]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shahriar Rashid Khan Vs. Bangladesh, 18 BLD (AD) 155.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Indemnity Ordinance</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Indemnity Ordinance was expressly made by the President in exercise of the powers conferred by clause (1) of Article 93 of the Constitution. So there was no extra magic in the Indemnity Ordinance which in normal times was required to be laid before the Parliament for its survival.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To give approval to a law is a qualitatively different act from enacting the law itself. An Ordinance when approved in the Constitution remains an Ordinance and it does not thereby become a part of the Constitution—Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 (L of 1975).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shahriar Rashid Khan Vs.

A simple majority in the Parliament is enough for the purpose. [Per A.T.M. Afzal, C.J.]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shahriar Rashid Khan Vs Bangladesh and others, 18 BLD (AD) 155.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Indemnity Ordinance</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In paragraph 3A(7) of the Fourth Schedule to our Constitution the words “competent authority” have not been defined. But inspite of lack of such definition or explanation it is not difficult to see who can alter. Nowhere it appears to have been provided that to amend any other law” the procedure followed for amendment of the Constitution needs be followed. In the absence of any such provision these ordinary laws made by the Martial law authorities, these may be altered, amended or repealed by following the ordinary process of alteration, amendment or repeal by a simple majority. The Parliament has competently passed the Indemnity (Repeal) Act, 1996 by a simple majority.—Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 (L of 1975).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shahriar Rashid Khan Vs.

This concept of reorganization of service is available to all other civil posts including executive service of Republic other than members of the judicial service and magistrates exercising judicial functions as they have been treated separately under Articles 115, 116 and 1 1A of the Constitution. Article 136 refers to all general services of civil posts. Judicial service’ has been separately treated in the relevant constitutional provisions and as such conditions of service is to be separately framed under Article 133 and it cannot be tagged as Bangladesh Civil Service (Judicial) under Paragraph 2(x) of Act XXXII of 1975.

The constitutional implication of this Article is that the subordinate judiciary unlike the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, is not a creature of the Constitution but of law. Its status is not the same as that of the Supreme Court. The Constitution has guaranteed the independence of the Judges of the Supreme Court in exercise of their judicial functions by making some provisions in the Constitution. There are provisions regarding appointment of Judges, their tenure of office, their removability only after being tried by their own peers in the Supreme Judicial Council where they have the fullest opportunity to defend themselves, their salary being chargeable on the consolidated fund and a provision in Article 147 that the remuneration, privileges and other terms and conditions of the Judges of the Supreme Court shall not be varied to their disadvantage during their terms of office.

While making Recruitment Rules under Article 115 it has to be borne in mind that Article 116A will be meaningless without judicial autonomy. Judicial autonomy requires that judicial appointments shall be made on merit by a separate Judicial Service Commission which may be established either by a statute or by the President while framing rules under Article 115.

But the Civil Court has ample reserve of its inherent powers to do what meet the ends of justice when fraud is committed on the Court itself.

In such a situation, inherent right of the court in section 151 of the Code may be applied to make such order as would enable it to do effective and complete justice between the parties..

They abstained from opposing the express ruling of commentators of great antiquity and high authority because they were not qualified to do so. A person who ventures to interpret the Holy Quran (1) shall be a Muttaqi (2) must have a wide knowledge of Hadith in connection with the Prophet’ s(s) interpretation of the Holy Quran and with the statements of his sahabis (companions) and their successive companions (3) have a knowledge about those parts of the Holy Quran which have been repealed or substituted (4) have a knowledge about the significance of each Ayat (5) have a knowledge about Ilmul Kirat (6) have a profound knowledge of the Arabic language, grammar, diction etc. as the H61y Quran was revealed in the Arabic language (7) must have a thorough knowledge of all the major commentaries and works of different Schools of thought, (8) must be a faqih and other qualifications as well, not necessarily limited to and special preserves of Ulemas.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.
