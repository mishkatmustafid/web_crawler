If paragraphs 3A and 18 were not incorporated in the Constitution then there would be utter confusion in the field of constitutional dispensation and law. There would be discontinuity of constitutional dispensation and the period in issue would remain outside the Constitution. Martial Law having ceased, the operation of ordinary civil. law continued.
