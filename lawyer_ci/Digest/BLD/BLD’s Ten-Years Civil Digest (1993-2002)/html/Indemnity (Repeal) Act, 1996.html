Agreeing with the decision reported in A.I.R. 1956 (All) 684, the High Court Division held that an unconstitutional Act is not a law, it confers no right, it imposes no duties, it affords no protection, it creates no office. It is, in legal contemplation, as inoperative as if it had never been passed.</p><p><strong>Shahriar Rashid Khan Vs Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Law and Parliamentary Affairs and others, 17 BLD (HCD) 114.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Jail Killing not covered by Indemnity Ordinance</strong></p><p>It is absurd to think that incident that took place on 3.11.75 was a part of the same transaction which took place on 15.8.75 in view of the fact that the Indemnity Ordinance of 1975 relates to the incident of 15th August, 1975 only, and not to the incident that place on 3rd November, 1975. There is no law whatsoever to immune the killers in jail on 3.11.75 from the legal consequences. This Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 dated 26.9.75 only related to 15th August, 1975 incident and it was in no way connected with the incident which took place in jail on 3rd November, 1975.</p><p><strong>Shahriar Rashid Khan Vs Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Law and Parliamentary Affairs and others, 17 BLD (HCD) 114.</strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
