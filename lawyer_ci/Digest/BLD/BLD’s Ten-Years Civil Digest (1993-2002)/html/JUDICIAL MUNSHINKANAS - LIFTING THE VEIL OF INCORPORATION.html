Chapter—IT of Part—VI of the Constitution allots a separate and distinct existence of judicial service and magistrates exercising judicial function. Under Article 109 the High Court Division of the Supreme Court has been vested with the powers of superintendence and control over all courts and tribunals subordinate to it.

But as oil and. water cannot mix, the judicial and civil administrative executive services are nonamalgarnable.

It appears that a person holding judicial post from Assistant Judge to that of a District Judge belongs to judicial service. Chapter II of Part VI of the Constitution deals with subordinate courts. Articles 115, 116 and 1 16A speak of persons employed in ‘judicial service’ and ‘magistrates exercising judicial functions’. It is clear that the members of the judicial service and the magistrates exercising judicial functions exercise judicial power of the State as distinct and separate from executive power and other cadre services of the State. Article 1 16A also contemplates that the members of the judicial service and magistrate exercising judicial functions shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. It is to be borne in min1 that judicial functions is distinct from other functions as visualized in the Constitution itself.

The nature and character of their function are different. Article 22 has emphasized on separation of the judiciary from the executive. Sub-paragraph (6) of paragraph 6 of the Transitional and Temporary Provisions of the Fourth Schedule mandates compliance of Chapter II of Part VI of the Constitution which in effect requires all concerned to maintain, preserve and protect the independence of the judiciary and also to enhance the separation of the judiciary from the executive and preserve the then arrangement as a temporary and transitional one—Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972, Articles—22, 133, 137 and 140, Part IV, Chapter II, Para—6(6)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Secretary, Ministry of Finance and others Vs Mr. Md.

Article 133 cannot be invoked for the judicial officers—Judicial officials are not persons in the service of the Republic for the purpose of Article 133 and hence rules regarding their appointment and conditions of service cannot be framed under Article 133.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Secretary, Ministry of Finance and others Vs Mr. Md.

First, there has to be an existence of a liability of repayment of a loan. Secondly, there has to be default in re-payment of loan in terms of the agreement. Thirdly, the properties to be taken over and/or sold by the Sangstha must have to be a property pledged, mortgaged, hypothecated or assigned by the industrial concern to secure its liability to the Sangstha. The power under clause (1) can be exercised if the aforesaid conditions are fulfilled and the ouster clause (5) comes into play when the Sangstha acts in consonance with clause (1) and not otherwise. In this regard the expression “under clause (1)” occurring in clause (5) and the expression “such taking over or transfer” in the said clause and clause (5)(a)(i)(ii)(iii) are particularly noticeable. In other words, if the conditions of clause (i) are not fulfilled the ouster clause (5) does not operate. In that case the purported action under clause (1) would be taken without jurisdiction. Such a case will not come within the mischief of clause (5).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha Vs.

The legitimate expectation of a person can be enforced only when he has got a legal right.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The expression ‘legitimate expectation’ first used by Lord Denning has by now been established as a principle of law. This principle in essence imposes a duty to act fairly and it requires the concerned authorities to act reasonably in dealing with the rights and interests of the people under given circumstances. If there is any breach of such right or interest, the court should not be slow in upholding it. if the situation so demands, the court shall strike down such orders in exercise of its power of judicial review of executive actions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bangladesh Soya-Protein Project Ltd. v.

Both Gower and Farrar have classified in their books various categories of cases where the corporate veil may be pierced by the Court. But they also agree that no consistent and inflexible principle can be evolved in determining the question as to whether the veil of incorporation should be lifted or not. It remains on the court to decide whether the facts of the case justify the lifting of veil of incorporation and this Court held that this is an apt case to do so.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Professor Muzaffer Ahmed Vs Bangladesh Bank &amp; others, 20 BLD (HCD) 235.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lifting the Veil of Incorporation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The circumstances, under which the fundamental principle of corporate entity as laid down in Salomon’ s case may be disregarded, are many, one of which is to find whether there exists the relationship of holding and subsidiary companies, among a group of companies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Board of BRAC Bank is composed of BRAC, represented by Mr. Abed and some other individuals who are not only it’s members but also its employees. The control of the composition of the board or BRAC bank i.e., power to appoint or remove a majority of the board passes to BRAC. They will remain separate entities in name alone but to all intent and purposes they are the same economic unit. In sum, BRAC Bank is BRAC which is a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, not allowed by law to purchase shares in a banking company. Instead of remaining a charitable and social welfare society it will become a financial institution with a vital role to play in the economic dynamics and money market of the country. BRAC as a creature under the Societies Registration Act, is not allowed in this sort of venture investment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Professor Muzaffer Ahmed Vs Bangladesh Bank &amp; others, 20 BLD (HCD) 235.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p> </p></div></div>
