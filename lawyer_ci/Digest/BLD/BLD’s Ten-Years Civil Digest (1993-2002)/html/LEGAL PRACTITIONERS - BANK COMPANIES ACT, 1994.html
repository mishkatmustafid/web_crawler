No doubt, Article 40(3) authorises the Government in absence of framing of the Rules to exercise the power of the Bar Council but Article 40(3) does not oust the power of the Bar Council explicitly.

The order of impounding of the passport of the appellant in this case obviously has been passed on the basis of the order of the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs and nothing could be shown to us to indicate that there was any chance to frustrate impounding of the passport by the appellant. The appellant having not been supplied with the copy of the order recording reasons therefore restricting the appellant from leaving the country certainly is violative of Article 7(4) of the Bangladesh Passport Order as the appellant had no opportunity to take a decision to avail of the alternative remedy by way of appeal as provided in Article 10 of the Passport Order, 1973. Withholding the order of the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs also is indicative of malafide. (Per A.M.

It is not necessary to describe in the notice the nature and number of document or documents on the basis of which the offending director is claimed by the lender Bank to be personally responsible for repayment of a loan or an installment. But if the offending debtor denies his personal liability to repay the loan in his written representation the Bangladesh Bank may send for the incriminating materials and confront the offending director with the same. It is before respondent No. 1 that the offending director will place all his grievances against the show cause notice and it is respondent No. I who will determine the relevance, genuineness, connection between the lender Bank’s documents and the loans in question and the liability or otherwise of the offending director.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Md.

By this gazette notification, an undue favouritism has been shown and discrimination has been made, in favour of BRAC Bank, only to remove its incapacity to operate, which the authority became aware of, after the issuance of the Rule in which the letter of ‘no objection’ itself and the registration of the bank and the certificate of incorporation have been challenged. Apparently, on the days the letter of ‘no objection’ was issued i.e., 4 April 1999 and the Bank was registered on 20 May, 1999, there was no waiver and BRAC Bank did not meet the initial requirement for incorporation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Professor Muzaffar Ahmed Vs Bangladesh Bank &amp; others, 20 BLD (HCD) 235.</strong></em></p><hr/><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BANK COMPANIES ACT, 1994 (XIV OF 1994)</strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><br/> <strong>Sections—29 and 45</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If a director of a Bank or a relation of such a director is a defaulter in respect of his personal or corporate loan then he or the enterprise in which he has vested interest is not entitled to any reschedulement of loan.
