But this aspect of the case was overlooked by the Taxes Appellate Tribunal in disallowing the gift made by Md. Abdul Kashem. Thus, the order passed by the Taxes Appellate Tribunal do not withstand the scrutiny of law and as such the High Court Division held that the Taxes Appellate Tribunal, Additional Bench—2, Dhaka was not justified in disallowing the gift made by Md.
