But in the instant case there being nothing on record to show that the decree-holder bonafide prosecuted the case in any wrong forum, the learned Assistant Judge erred in law in giving the decree-holder the protection of Section 14 of the Limitation Act—Limitation Act, 1908(IX of 1908), Section—14</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Babul Chowdhury and others Vs.

It is difficult to understand under what reason the period of limitation has been fixed at 108 days. Either it would be one month, three months or six months but section 7(I) of the Ordinance has provided the limitation for 108 days which means 3 months 18 days and such period of limitation could no where be found in the Limitation Act or in any other special Act providing limitation, This may be through inadvertance or mistake that 180 days has been printed as 108 days. The Ministry of Law Justice and Parliamentary Affairs shall look into the matter and if it is a mistake in providing limitation of 108 days instead of 180 days, they should come out with an appropriate amendment in the section at the earliest in order to avoid mis-chief of limitation for wrong printing of the period of limitation in the Ordinance—Abandoned Buildings (supplementary provisions) Ordinance, 1985 (LIV of 1985), Section—7(1)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

Limitation will thus run not from the date of the constitution of the Board but from the date of the actual functioning of the Board—Rin Shalishi Am, 1989 (XV of 1989), Section—7(1)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ajahar Ali Sarder Vs.

Abdul Majid Dana Vs. Bangladesh, 19 BLD (AD) 7.</em></strong></p><p> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Limitation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The prescribed period of limitation for filing appeal from an order passed under section 86 and 87 of the Co-operative Societies Ordinance, 1984 is one month from the date of knowledge of the decisions. Section 134(3) provides that section 5 of the Limitation Act shall not be made applicable to an appeal filed under Section 134(1). There is no reason to hold that because the petitioner could not file the appeal within prescribed period of limitation within 30 days due to devastating cyclone the petition ought to have been accepted by the learned District Judge on condonation of delay and the learned District Judge dismissed the case illegally holding that the appeal before the appellate authority was time barred. When the Ordinance, a special enactment, excludes the application of section 5 of the Limitation Act for condonation of delay to an appeal it cannot be hold that the learned District Judge failed to exercise his jurisdiction vested under section 134(5) of the Ordinance in not condoning delay in filing the appeal. Where a special enactment expressly provides that for filing an appeal beyond period prescribed provision of Section 5 of the Limitation Act shall not be made applicable the appellate authority before whom the appeal lies has no power to condone delay by applying provision of section 5 of the Limitation Act for accepting the appeal—Co-operative Societies Ordinance, 1984 ( I of 1985), Sections—86, 87, 134(3), Limitation Act, 1908 (IX of 1908), Section—5</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Afazuddin &amp; ors.

An application for execution must therefore satisfy first the requirement of Article 182(2) of the Limitation Act. If the execution case is hit by any of the two provisions noted above it must fail—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Section—48, Limitation Act, 1908 (IX of 1908), Article -182(2) of the First Schedule</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Assistant Custodian, Enemy Property and A.D.C.
