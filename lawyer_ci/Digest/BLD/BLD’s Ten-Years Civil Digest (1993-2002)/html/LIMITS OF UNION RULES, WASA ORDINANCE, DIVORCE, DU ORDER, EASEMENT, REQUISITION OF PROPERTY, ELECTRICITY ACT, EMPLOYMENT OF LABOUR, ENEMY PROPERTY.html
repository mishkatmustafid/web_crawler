This was followed by Act No. XLVI of 1974. Under the provisions of the aforesaid Ordinance the Vested and Non- resident properties were being administered. The Vested and Nonresident Property (Administration) (Repealed) Ordinance, 1974 was replaced by Ordinance No. 92 of 1976 and in that Ordinance there was a saving clause for protecting the existing proceedings and lists in respect of vested and non- resident properties. Excepting this saving clause the vested property law was totally repealed. In the circumstances, treating the suit property as a vested and non-resident property in the year 1979 by starting a new V.

There is nothing in the proviso that termination should be of an officer of the trade union and not any member. In the instant case, respondent No. 2 by oral and documentary evidence substantiated his claim that his service was terminated for his trade union activities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>M/s A R Howlader Jute Mills Ltd.
