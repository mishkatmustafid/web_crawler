It has only been said that in accepting legal fees some considerations are to be made by the Advocates themselves with regard to the time, labour and intricacies of the case. These instructions are mere guide-lines and it has no binding force. Hence, the High Court Division rightly held that the amount charged. as legal fees is not disproportionate as there is no fixed standard of fees of Advocates.</p><p><strong>Bangladesh Bar Council Vs.
