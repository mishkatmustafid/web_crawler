Where the application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act does not explain delay of each day and statements in support of condonation of delay are too vague and general in nature, having no reference to day to day basis, such an application must be held to be insufficient for condoning delay. When laches and gross negligence on the part of the Government are found, delay cannot be condoned.</p><p><strong>Bangladesh Vs.

No warrant of proclamation and attachment was served or executed at the village address of the petitioner. Considering ,these facts the Court held that there were sufficient grounds preventing the appellant petitioner from filing the appeal in time and he had no wilful negligence or laches.

It cannot deserve unlimited latitude in matters of condonation of delay. Though in many cases of the Government, delay is condoned upon sympathetic considerations as the file of the Government moves through different stages and time-consuming procedures. But an inordinate delay of 1340 days arising out of the gross negligence of Government officials cannot be condoned. Appropriate action should be taken against the delinquent officers for their laches and negligence, causing losses to the Government.</p><p>It is really surprising to know that more than one year and nine months were consumed to start a part-file and to file the leave petition. This is a gross negligence on the part of the Solicitor Wing, which cannot be condoned.</p><p><strong>Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, Ministry of Works and others Vs Mr. Alauddin, 21 BLD (AD) 35.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—5</strong></p><p><strong>Sufficient cause—condonation of delay</strong></p><p>The expression ‘sufficient cause’ should receive a liberal construction so as to advance substantial justice.
