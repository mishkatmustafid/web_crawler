During the period of Martial law many acts and things were done in pursuance of those Martial Law Regulations. Hence it was necessary to give a constitutional validity, ratification and confirmation to ensure constitutional continuity. By imposing Martial Law existing legal order was changed and a new legal order was promulgated outside the constitutional mandate and as such the constitutional coverage was sought to be given by paragraphs 3A and 18 of the Fourth Schedule. As a matter of fact, Constitution (Fifth Amendment) has given a post facto validation to all acts and things of that period. These paragraphs are like Indemnity Act which is passed after every declaration of Martial Law, ratifying and validating all acts and things done during that period.

That stage will reach the moment ‘the Speaker shall bring the fact to the notice of the House, if it is in session in accordance with the provision of Rule 178(3) of the Rules of the Procedure of Parliament of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From a close analysis of the decisions cited at the Bar it is manifestly clear that the action brought before the court in those cases had their origin in the proceeding-in parliament and were immune from judicial scrutiny and were protected “parliamentary privileges”. In the instant case, submission of resignation in masse (en bloc) to the Speaker is not immune from judicial review. . Under clause (2) of Article 67 of the Constitution a member of the Parliament may resign his seat by writing under his hand addressed to the Speaker of the Parliament. The expression “addressed to the Speaker” used in clause (2) of Article 67 has no protection of Article 78(1) of the Constitution inasmuch as resignation letters submitted to the Speaker does not fall within the ambit of the expression “proceeding of parliament” as envisaged in Article 78(1) of the Constitution. The High Court Division held that it committed no mistake in issuing Rules in the Writ Petitions nor has it transgressed upon its jurisdiction conferred under Article 102 (2) (a) (ii) and (i) less of the Constitution and it did not come in conflict with the Parliament by invading the domain of Parliamentary Privilege” or stretching its sleeve to any proceeding of the Parliament. Thus, the contention raised at the Bar to oust the jurisdiction of the High Court Division is the result of misconceived idea about the constitutional provisions of this Article and accordingly, it fails.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

If properties are left out in a partition suit it brooks further litigation. It is true that this rule is relaxable. But there are specific situations calling for relaxation. They are generally (a) where different portions of the property lie in different jurisdictions, or (b) when some portion of the property is at the time incapable of partition, or (c) when the property from its nature is impartible, or (d) when the property is held jointly with strangers who cannot be joined as parties to a general suit for partition, or (e) where co-tenamts, by natural agreement, decide to make partition of part of the joint property retaining the rest in common.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Nurul Afsar Vs.
