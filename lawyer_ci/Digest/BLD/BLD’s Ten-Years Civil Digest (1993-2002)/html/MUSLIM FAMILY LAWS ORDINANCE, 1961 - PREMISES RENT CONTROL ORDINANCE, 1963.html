Application of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance has been overridden by Section 3 of the Family Courts Ordinance, 1985, in clear language providing that this Ordinance shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in any other law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nirmal Kanti Das Vs.

The relationship between the spouses is based on the concepts of social justice and adjustments. But if due to any reason love is lost between the parties, the husband is at liberty to divorce his wife by exercising his right of talaq. But such a right is not available to the wife unless she is given the delegated power of divorce by way of talaq-e-tawfiz. A wife thus cannot dissolve the marriage even through the intervention of the Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Khodeja Begum and others Vs. Md.

The exercise undertaken by the learned Judges was not only gratuitous but wholly illegal being not within their jurisdiction under the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Md.

This section does not declare a second marriage, without such permission, void or illegal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Muslim Jurists and Scholars are almost unanimous in taking the view that in the context of modern society it is virtually impossible to be able to ‘deal with the wives justly’ and as such the Quranic sanction for taking a second wife under specified conditions virtually amounts to a prohibition in taking a second wife during the subsistence of an existing marriage. Viewed in this context, the High Court Division held that section 6 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance is against the principle of Islamic Law and if should be repealed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Jesmin Sultana Vs Mohammad Elias, 17 BLD (HCD) 4.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ref: (1996) 16 BLD 396;—Cited.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—6</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Payment of dower being obligatory as per Nikahnama the wife is entitled to the same on talaq.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Md.

This provision was further amended on 30.12.97 whereby sub-rule (2) of Rule 10 of the earlier amendment was deleted. Thus whatever right a Nikah Registrar had under the previous Rule was done away with by subsequent Rule 10 of 1997.

Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act was enacted for the first category of tenants and not for the second category. Section 85(2) of the Act speaks about the second category of tenants.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since the lease-hold right in the land within the Dhanmondi Residential Area is transferable and heritable and yearly rent is payable to the Government, its owner is a non-agricultural tenant and not a “tenant” as mentioned in section 85(2) of the Act. An application under section 24 of the Nonagricultural Tenancy Act in respect of any land situated within Dhanmondi Residential Area is maintainable in law.</p><p><strong>Dr. Ismat Mirza and others Vs Md.

The superior courts of the sub-continent area of the consistent view that the word should be liberally interpreted. In order to be a member of the family, there must be a blood relationship. Section 4 makes a distinction between members of a family undivided qua the property under partition and transferees who are not members of such family. The words ‘such family’ in section 4 do not mean the ‘family’ already referred to in the section without the qualification ‘undivided’. A transferee who is a descendant from a common ancestor of himself and the joint family cannot merely for that reason be said to be a member of ‘such family’. Where it appears from the evidence that co-sharers were not agnates or cognates, they never lived together nor messed together, but were merely brought close by marriage which did not integrate their families but helped continue their separate identities, it cannot be held that there was any common bond or cementing factor bringing them within the fold of an undivided : family.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A house which has not actually been used by an undivided family for a number of years is not a dwelling house. The expression ‘dwelling house belonging to an undivided family’ refers to a family dwelling house. It does not mean any house or building for human dwelling belonging to an undivided family. A house which is in the occupation of tenants cannot be said to be a family dwelling house.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Haripada Saha v. Md.

The second part indicates that the overriding provision in the first part of section 3 does not exclude the operation of the law, rules and regulations including PRB in force prior to the promulgation of the Ordinance. It is for the authority to decide whether a delinquent police personnel would be proceeded under the Ordinance or pre-existing law/rules. As pre-existing law remained valid, disciplinary proceedings under Regulation No. 858 of the PRB has been legally initiated. Moreover, Regulation 858 (a)(2) empowers the Superintendent of Police to award a police personnel, i.e. Sub-inspector of Police, any punishment, i.e. dismissal, removal, which may be awarded by the Inspector General or Deputy Inspector General of Police under Regulation No. 858(a)(1). Thus AT was in error in holding that Superintendent of Police can only award punishment to Sub-Inspector of Police under Regulation 858(a)(1)(iv), i.e. censure or reprimand.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Government of Bangladesh and others V.

A tenant has no right to claim adjustment of any advance against monthly rent. Advance rent or any premium in any form being strictly prohibited by law, any agreement for advance or premium is evidently void and not enforceable. The remedy for the tenant in case of advance is to move the Rent Controller within six months of creation of the tenancy for getting an order of refund.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mymensingh Arya Dharma Gnan Prodaini Sava v.

There is nothing in the ‘explanation’ to justify the view that there should be a prior personal tender of the rent to the landlord before remitting it by postal money order.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If Section 19(1) be read along with Section 18(5) of the Ordinance, it will be evident that in order to make a deposit under Subsection (1) of Section 19, the tenant is only to show that he remitted the Rent by Postal Money Order within the specified time and the landlord refused to accept it and the tenant’s prayer for deposit with the Rent Controller was made within a fortnight of the receipt of the undelivered rent sent through the postal authorities the landlord has refused to accept the within the specified period by postal of the Ordinance. There is nothing in that there should be a prior personal before remitting it by postal money.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The underlying object of this provision is to enable the tenants to fall back on the evidence of tender as preserved by the Rent Controller’s office for the purpose of subsequent determination of the question as to whether a tenant is a defaulter or not, should the landlord subsequently sue him for ejectment on the ground of default. This is for the protection of tenants and as such any ‘doubt’ regarding the meaning of the aforesaid provisions should be resolved in favour of the tenants for whose benefit it is intended.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>M/S.

If the landlord fails to notify in writing his willingness to accept rent from the tenant, Clause (b) of Section 19(1) enables the tenant to deposit rent with the Rent Controller within 15 days from the stipulated date and in the absence of only such stipulation within 15 days from the 15th day of the month next following for which rent becomes payable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Atiqullah Vs.

The question of bonafide doubt or dispute as to who is entitled to receive rent pre-supposes a dispute as to the ownership of the premises.
