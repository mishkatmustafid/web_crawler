The mandatory provision is that after termination of the proceeding the record should be submitted for review to the competent authority.</p><p>In the present case after termination of SMLC No. 51 of 1982 it was not submitted before the competent authority for review. In the absence of such assertion this Court is not inclined to believe that the said judgment was not eventually submitted for review as contemplated under Regulation No. 3 of M.L.R. 1 of 1982 and was not disposed of in due course. The law does not provide for further review at the instance of an aggrieved party and as such there is no reason to assume that a review petition is in fact pending before any authority for which a forum is required to be created.</p><p><strong>Mr. Abdul Hakim Vs Govt. of Bangladesh and others, 17 BLD (HCD) 317.</strong></p><p>Ref: 42 DLR 1; 42 DLR (AD) 241; 13 BLD (1993)(AD) 17;—Cited.</p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
