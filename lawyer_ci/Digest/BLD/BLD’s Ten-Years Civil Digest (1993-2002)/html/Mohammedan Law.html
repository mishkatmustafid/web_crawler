But if during the continuance of the family, properties are acquired in the name of the managing member of the family and these are possessed by all the members jointly, the presumption is that these are properties of the family and not the properties of the member in whose name the properties stand.</p><p><strong>Sarafat Hossain Vs.

A suit which does not ask for preemption of the whole of such interest cannot be entertained. It is a fundamental principle of the law of pre-emption followed over a century in the sub-continent that the pre-emptor cannot break up the bargain of sale by suing only for a portion of the property conveyed by the disputed sale. The maxim of law that he who takes the benefit must also bear the burden has its origin in the principle of justice, equity and good conscience. The very nature of preemptive right envisages that the pre-emptor can substitute himself in place of the purchaser by taking all the benefits as well as all the disadvantages of the sale under preemption.</p><p>In the instant case, land under pre-emption was transferred by a registered sale deed. The pucca structures standing on the land were also sold on the same day by another registered sale deed. Pre-emptors claim for preemption of the case land only without opting for pre-emption of the sale of the pucca structures standing in the case land is not maintainable in law as being inconsistent with the very nature and essence of pre-emptive right.</p><p><strong>Attar Mia and another Vs.

In the instant case there is no material to show that the marriage between the petitioner and the opposite party also solemnized after observance and fulfillment of the requirements as laid down is section 252 of the Mohammedan Law.</p><p><strong>Anwar Hossan Vs Mamata Begum, 19 BLD (HCD) 435.</strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
