Application of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance has been overridden by Section 3 of the Family Courts Ordinance, 1985, in clear language providing that this Ordinance shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in any other law.</p><p><strong>Nirmal Kanti Das Vs. Sreemati Biva Rani, 14 BLD(HCD)413</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Sections—5 and 7</strong></p><p><strong>Registration of marriage and Talaq</strong></p><p>The Muslim Marriage is a social contract and not a sacrament between a man and woman followed by recitations from the Holy Quran. The relationship between the spouses is based on the concepts of social justice and adjustments. But if due to any reason love is lost between the parties, the husband is at liberty to divorce his wife by exercising his right of talaq. But such a right is not available to the wife unless she is given the delegated power of divorce by way of talaq-e-tawfiz. A wife thus cannot dissolve the marriage even through the intervention of the Court.</p><p><strong>Khodeja Begum and others Vs. Md. Sadeq Sarkar, 18 BLD (HCD) 31.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—6</strong></p><p><strong>Polygamy</strong></p><p>The discussion on polygamy in Islam and recommendation thereon as accorded in the impugned judgment should be taken to be deleted lest it may create confusion in the mind of the subordinate Courts and the people at large.</p><p>It was totally unnecessary for the learned Judges to indulge in the discussion on polygamy in Islam which was neither an issue in the suit nor required to be decided in the context of the pleadings of the parties. The exercise undertaken by the learned Judges was not only gratuitous but wholly illegal being not within their jurisdiction under the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p><strong>Md. Elias Vs Jesmin Sultana, 19 BLD (AD)122.</strong></p><p>Ref: 17BLD( 1997)04—Cited.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Section—6</strong></p><p><strong>Polygamy</strong></p><p>Section 6 of the Ordinance prohibits contracting or performing second marriage during the subsistence of the existing one, except with the previous permission of the Arbitration Council. This section does not declare a second marriage, without such permission, void or illegal.</p><p>Muslim Jurists and Scholars are almost unanimous in taking the view that in the context of modern society it is virtually impossible to be able to ‘deal with the wives justly’ and as such the Quranic sanction for taking a second wife under specified conditions virtually amounts to a prohibition in taking a second wife during the subsistence of an existing marriage. Viewed in this context, the High Court Division held that section 6 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance is against the principle of Islamic Law and if should be repealed.</p><p><strong>Jesmin Sultana Vs Mohammad Elias, 17 BLD (HCD) 4.</strong></p><p>Ref: (1996) 16 BLD 396;—Cited.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Section—6</strong></p><p>Payment of dower being obligatory as per Nikahnama the wife is entitled to the same on talaq.</p><p><strong>Md.

Helana Begum and others, 19 BLD (AD) 150.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—7</strong></p><p><strong>Validity of a divorce without notice to the Chairman</strong></p><p>Mere non-service of notice upon the Chairman of the Union Council as required under Section 7 of the Ordinance does not render the divorce necessarily ineffective if divorce is established by the conduct of the husband.</p><p><strong>Md.Sirajul islam Vs. Mosammat Helana Begum, 16 BLD (HCD) 477 .</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—7(1)</strong></p><p>Section 7(1) of the Ordinance provides for giving of notice of talaq to the Chairman and a copy thereof to the wife and provides for punishment for contravention and this law overrides any other provision of any other law But there being clear intention to divorce by the affidavit on the part of the petitioner and the same having been disclosed and produced before the lower appellate Court by the petitioner himself, the petitioner cannot take advantage of his own wrong and cannot claim the benefit of non-service of notice by him to the Chairman, he is bound by his admission.</p><p><strong>Md.

When the communication is over and the husband admits to have received the same, the requirement of sub-section (1) of section 7 of the Ordinance has been duly complied with and the talaq-e-tawfiz became effective.</p><p><strong>Mrs. Sherin Akhter and another Vs Al.
