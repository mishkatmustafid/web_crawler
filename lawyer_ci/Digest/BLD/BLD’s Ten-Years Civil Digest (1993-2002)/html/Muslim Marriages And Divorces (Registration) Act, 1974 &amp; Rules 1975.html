This provision was further amended on 30.12.97 whereby sub-rule (2) of Rule 10 of the earlier amendment was deleted. Thus whatever right a Nikah Registrar had under the previous Rule was done away with by subsequent Rule 10 of 1997. The right given under previous Rule 10 was taken away by subsequent amendment and as such the question of affecting the vested right of the petitioner does not arise.</p><p><strong>Mr. Raisuddin Vs Bangladesh and others, 19 BLD (AD) 179.</strong></p><p>Ref: 50 DLR(AD)82; I6BLD(AD)1 10— Cited.</p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
