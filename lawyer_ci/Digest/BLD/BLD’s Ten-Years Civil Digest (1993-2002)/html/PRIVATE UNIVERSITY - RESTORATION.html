This principle bars not only a new decision but also a new investigation so that the same person cannot be vexed again and again over the same question. This is available to the plaintiff as well as to the defendant—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Section—l1</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Mannaf Hossain Vs.

It gives effect to the law that the parties to a judicial decision should not afterwards be allowed to relitigate the same question even though the decision may be wrong. If it is wrong it must be challenged by way of an appeal or other procedure. The whole doctrine of res judicata is based on consideration of judicial policy—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Section—11.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sirajul Islam Chowdhury Trawlers lid.

Injury does not mean only the physical or mental injuries but it also extends to aversion of the wife to live with an estrained husband.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Even though findings of the Courts below are that the wife was refusing to perform her marital obligations to the husband without any lawful excuse and the husband is entitled to a decree for restitution of conjugal rights and the decisions of the Superior Courts of the sub-continent support the said view, the High Court Division departed from this traditional view in the light of observations enshrined in the Islamic Jurisprudence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mosammat Nur Akhtar Vs.
