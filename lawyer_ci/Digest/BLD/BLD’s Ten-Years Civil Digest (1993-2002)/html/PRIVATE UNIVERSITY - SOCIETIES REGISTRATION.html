It was in fact a special arrangement for those who voluntarily want to retire on getting some financial benefits. There was no compulsion on the part of any of the petitioners to accept the special scheme of retirement. The petitioners went into voluntary retirement out of their own free will and as such they cannot be allowed to turn round to say that the scheme is illegal and is violative of the provisions of the Public Servant’s (Retirement) Act. 1974.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

It is also evident from the retirement order itself that it was not made in the public interest but in effecting retrenchment in the Corporation. Moreover, under sub-section (2) of section 9 of the Public Servants (Retirement) Act, 1974 the authority to order retirement vested in the Government and not in the Corporation, although the employees affected belonged to a Corporation. The impugned order of retirement is therefore illegal and without jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abul Hossain and others Vs.

Even after amendment of Regulation I in 1984 there has been no corresponding amendment of Rules 3 and 4 of the Bangladesh Biman Employees (Pension and Gratuity) Rules, 1988. In the instant case the petitioner was appointed before the amendment of the Regulation No. 11 of the Bangladesh B iman Corporation Employees (Service) Regulations 1979. Before its amendment the retirement age of the Stewardess was 57 years. Therefore, the petitioner’s right to remain in service till she completes 57 years of age cannot be curtailed on the strength of a subsequent amendment which was not in existence at the time of her appointment. The reduction of the age limit of the petitioner from 57 years to 35 years on the strength of Regulation No. 11 made in 1984 does not have any sanction of law the same being violative of Article 28 of the Constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Jonaba Dalia Parveen Vs.

XII of 1974</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since it appears from the office record that the decision to retire the petitioner was taken in the public interest, mere non- mentioning of the words “in the public interest” in the impugned order of retirement does not at all effect its legality.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Retirement—whether a punishment—to take or not to take disciplinary action under the relevant rules against a delinquent Government servant is a matter which is absolutely within the discretion of the Government. In a case of a Government servant who has completed 25 years of service, the authorities may even start proceedings against him on a given charge and thereafter may drop the same and proceed under section 9(2) of the Act to retire him.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Retirement with full pentionary benefits after completion of 25 years of service is not a punishment nor does it contain any stigma. Such retirement is altogether different from ‘dismissal’ ‘removal’, ‘compulsory retirement’, which are different kinds of punishment as contemplated in rule 3 of the Government Servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1976.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shah Mohammad Zahurul Hoque Vs.

The High Court Division acted without jurisdiction in excluding the ballot papers of both the appellant and the election-petitioner containing the aforesaid omissions.

On the prayer of the election petitioner there could not be any recounting of ballot papers when he failed to bring home the allegations of corrupt or illegal practice against the returned candidate and when no foundation of recounting had been laid and hence the learned tribunal committed a patent illegality and flagrant error of law in recounting the ballot papers.

When a case of urgency is made out and the Single Vacation Judge is satisfied that it is both urgent and proper to interfere, there is no lack of jurisdiction in exercising the power but this unusual power is to be exercised sparingly and with utmost caution, keeping in mind that it is improper for a learned Single Judge acting during the vacation to interfere with the interlocutory order of a regular Division Bench in wanton disregard of propriety.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Azizur Rahman alias Md.

Another apparent reason being to save the acts in which the returned candidate participated. There is no compulsion in the said provision to deny the ancillary or concomitant power of granting stay while entertaining in appeal by the High Court Division.
