When an applicant’s prayer is allowed under Section 4 of the Partition Act, it involves a kind of forced sale for the stranger-purchaser. And hence, the Court would, in equity, determine the valuation of the transferred share on the date of filing of the application for permission to purchase the share of the stranger-purchaser</p><p><strong>Sayesta Bibi and others Vs.

In order to get the benefit of section 4, it is not necessary that a person must live in the family dwelling house. Because it is not the residence or occupation but the ownership of the dwelling house that entitles a person to apply under section 4 of the Act.</p><p><strong>Noorjahan Akhter Vs A Motaleb &amp; ors., 21 BLD (HCD) 130.</strong></p><p>Ref: AIR 1928 Calcutta 539; I.L.R. 1923 (Bom) 73; 1ODLR(1958)3 18—Cited.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Section—4</strong></p><p>The main purpose behind enacting section 4 is to protect and preserve the co-sharers’ sentiment and attachment to their ancestral house and also to preserve purdah and privacy of the members and inmates of the undivided dwelling house.</p><p><strong>Noorjahan Akhter Vs A Motaleb &amp; ors., 21 BLD (HCD) 130.</strong></p><p>Ref: Sayesta Bibi and ors.

The superior courts of the sub-continent area of the consistent view that the word should be liberally interpreted. In order to be a member of the family, there must be a blood relationship. Section 4 makes a distinction between members of a family undivided qua the property under partition and transferees who are not members of such family. The words ‘such family’ in section 4 do not mean the ‘family’ already referred to in the section without the qualification ‘undivided’. A transferee who is a descendant from a common ancestor of himself and the joint family cannot merely for that reason be said to be a member of ‘such family’. Where it appears from the evidence that co-sharers were not agnates or cognates, they never lived together nor messed together, but were merely brought close by marriage which did not integrate their families but helped continue their separate identities, it cannot be held that there was any common bond or cementing factor bringing them within the fold of an undivided : family.</p><p>A house which has not actually been used by an undivided family for a number of years is not a dwelling house. The expression ‘dwelling house belonging to an undivided family’ refers to a family dwelling house. It does not mean any house or building for human dwelling belonging to an undivided family. A house which is in the occupation of tenants cannot be said to be a family dwelling house.</p><p><strong>Haripada Saha v. Md.
