By a separate clause it was provided that WASA charge will be paid at the rate of Taka 60/- only per month along with the rent. Stipulation was that the tenant would pay the water bills but for the convenience of the tenant would pay a lump sum of Taka 60/- only per month to the landlord along with the rent. This amount which is not due to the landlord on account of any amenity, benefit or service rendered by him cannot be included in term ‘rent’. Therefore, non-payment or non-deposit of the WASA charge along with the rent cannot make the tenant a defaulter for nonpayment for rent or for not making a valid deposit.</p><p><strong>Continental Corporation (Pvt.)

Under Section 14 of the said Act the tenant is entitled to pray for refund of the salami paid to the landlord within 6 months of such payment and the landlord is liable to pay fine under Section 23 of the said Act.</p><p>Due to the wide-spread prevalence of voluntary payment of salami in the urban areas on condition of making the monthly tenancy transferable and non- ejectable a tenant hardly goes to the House Rent Controller for refund of salami and for punishing the landlord. It is because of this fact that an interest is created in favour of the tenant in the tenanted premises by way of allowing him to transfer his possession to a third party and or to sub-let whole or part of the premises and also of his non- ejectability from the premises.</p><p><strong>Munshi Amiruddin Ahmed Vs.
