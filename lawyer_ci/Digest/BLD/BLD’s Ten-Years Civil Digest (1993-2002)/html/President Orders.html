No. 7 of 1973 does not come in the category of a ‘suit’. It is just a special provision made for realisation of loans by the Corporation’. An application under Article 27 of P.O. No 7 of 1973 cannot, there-. fore, be equated with a suit as none of a suit such as a regular plaint, court fees, limitation, written statement, decree etc. is attracted to such an application.</p><p>The financial institution may get the relief or reliefs in a summary way which is not available in a suit. It cannot, therefore, but be said that Article 27 is a special provision providing special procedure for realisation of loan which comes squarely within the provision to Section 5(1) of the Artha Rin Adalat Act 1990. The action contemplated under Article 27 is thus outside the concept of gvgjv or ‘suit’ as mentioned in Section 5(1) of the Artha Rin Adalat Act.</p><p>The word gvgjv is a generic term and there is no scope to attribute a wide meaning to that word except that of a ‘suit’ as used in section 5(1) of the Artha Rin Adalat Act, 1990.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Bangladesh House Building Finance Corporation Vs. Jahan Ara Akhter and another 16 BLD (AD) 231.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>PRESIDENT’S ORDER NO 16 OF 1972</u></strong></p><p><strong><u><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></u></strong></p><p>The pre-requisites of the enlistment of the buildings in the official Gazette are that these buildings must of necessity be abandoned properties within the meaning of President’s Order No.16 1972 and the possessions thereof have been taken by the Government before such enlistment, that no such building can be enlisted in the official Gazette as an abandoned property relating to which any decree or order has been passed by any Court having competent jurisdiction declaring the property as not abandoned property or not to have vested in the Government or declaring the Government possession illegal or directing the Government to restore possession to owner prior to the date of publication in the official Gazette.</p><p>The onus is firmly rested on the Government to prove that the property in question is an abandoned property and is taken over by the government and government continued in possession prior to the enlistment. The Government has to prove that the property is an abandoned property within the meaning of President’s Order No. 16 of 1972; the Sub- Divisional Officer or the Deputy Commissioner had applied his mind as to the nature and character of the property and found the same to have been an abandoned property upon verification and enlisted the same as an abandoned property.</p><p>The Court of Settlement is not, an appellate Court to sit over the judgment and decree of the civil Court. The Ordinance No.54 of 1985 has vested the Court of Settlement with power to examine if the property is an abandoned property or not and upon such examination, the relief asked for it could be granted in favour of the claimant.</p><p>The Court of Settlement has no power to set aside or nullify any judgment and decree of a civil Court having competent jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>Mrs. Akhtar Jahan Begum Vs. The Court of Settlement, Bangladesh Abandoned Buildings and ors., 13 BLD (HCD) 177.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—2</strong></p><p><strong>Abandoned Buildings (Supplementary Provisions) Ordinance, 1985 (LIV of 1985)</strong></p><p><strong>Article—7(3)</strong></p><p><strong>Notice of surrender</strong></p><p>If a property comes within the definition of ‘abandoned properties’ as contemplated in Article 2 of P.O. No. 16 of 1972, it automatically vests in the Government in terms of Article 4 thereof on the commencement of the said Order. But an abandoned property in possession of any person can only be included in the ‘Kha list’ of abandoned properties in respect of which notice for surrender has been issued, upon the occupiers. This notice must be the notice as required by Article 7(3) of Ordinance No LIV of 1985 and as prescribed by Rule 3(8) of the Bangladesh Abandoned Property (Taking Over Possession) Rules, 1972. The enlisting of any property in the ‘Kha list’ and publication thereof in the official gazette in respect of which no notice under Article 7(3) of P.O. 16 of 1972 has been issued will be clearly illegal. Thus once a property is enlisted as an abandoned property by observing the legal formalities it becomes conclusive evidence as regards the character of the property in question.</p><p><strong>Mrs. Lalima Begum and another Vs The Chairman, Court of Settlement, 1st Court, Dhaka and another, 17 BLD (HCD) 271.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—10(1)</strong></p><p>The Government has the right to cancel allotment of an abandoned property under Article 10(1) of P.O. 16 of 72 but before that is done it must be found that the allottee has violated any of the terms and conditions of the lease. The Government has also the right to affix standard rent for the suit premises.</p><p><strong>The Secretary, Ministry of Public Works, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh Vs. Md.

Bangladesh, 43 DLR 139—Cited.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong><u>PRESIDENT ORDER NO. 27 OF 1972</u></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>A rticle—23(4)</strong></p><p>Sub-Article 4 of Article 23 has been intended to operate retrospectively. No suit is maintainable against any Scheduled Industrial Enterprise after 5.2.1982. But there being other defendants in the suit besides the Scheduled Industrial Enterprise against whom reliefs have been claimed, it is not possible to hold that the suit as whole could not be commenced or proceeded with in view of Article 23(4) of P.O. No. 27 of 1972.</p><p><strong>The Official Liqui4ator, The Dhakeswari Cotton Mills. Ltd. Vs. The Dhakaeswari Cotton Mills Ltd. 16 BLD (AD) 295.</strong></p><p>Ref: Dawsons Bank Ltd. Vs.

(The Indian Decisions, New Series, Allahabad Vol. VIII) — Cited.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>PRESIDENT ORDER NO.69 OF 1972 AND PRESIDENT ORDER NO.90 OF 1972</strong></p><p>From a combined reading of the provision of the two Orders it is clear that P.O. 69 of 1972 envisages abatement of all kinds of suits or other legal proceedings against the Government of Bangladesh whether or not related to acquisition under the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 when the Government opts not to be a party thereto while P.O. 90 of 1972 envisages abatement only of suits and other legal proceedings in which the legality or validity of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 or any other law making amendment thereto or for acquisition of any property made under any provision thereof is called in question. P.O. 69 of 1972 may be termed as the ‘genus’ of which P.O. 90 of 1972 is the ‘species’. Both the Orders aim at abatement of a suit and there is no inconsistency or mutual exclusiveness between the two Orders. As a logical sequel, the provisions of P.O. 69 of 1972 cannot be said to have- been abrogated because of the non obstante clause added to P.O. 90 of 1972. Partial abatement of a suit does not appear to have been contemplated under P.O. 90 of 1972.</p><p><strong>Bangladesh represented by the Secretary Ministry of L.A. and L.R Vs Chowdhary Tanbir Ahmed Siddiky, 17BLD (AD) 131.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>PRESIDENT’S ORDER NO. 149 OF 1972</strong></p><p><strong>Section—2</strong></p><p>It provides that who or whose father or grand-father was born in the territory now comprising Bangladesh and who was a permanent resident of such territories on the 25<sup>th</sup> of March, 1971 and continues to be so resident, shall be deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh by birth. It being found that the Petitioner was permanently residing in Bangladesh prior to the liberation of the country, conclusively proves that he is a citizen of Bangladesh.</p><p><strong>Ganga Narayan Roy Vs.
