Col. (Rtd) Md. Zainul Abedin and ors. 20 BLD (AD) 230.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Sections—4 and 9</strong></p><p>The scheme of the retirement of the petitioners under special circumstances is outside the ambit of the Public Servant’s (Retirement) Act, 1974. It was in fact a special arrangement for those who voluntarily want to retire on getting some financial benefits. There was no compulsion on the part of any of the petitioners to accept the special scheme of retirement. The petitioners went into voluntary retirement out of their own free will and as such they cannot be allowed to turn round to say that the scheme is illegal and is violative of the provisions of the Public Servant’s (Retirement) Act. 1974.</p><p><strong>Md. Nurul Haque Vs Govt. of Bangladesh and ors., 18 BLD(AD)142</strong></p><p>Ref: 1949 All England Law Reports, Kings Bench Division, 724—Not applicable.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Section—5(3)</strong></p><p>Since the appointment of the petitioner in the project is in fact re-employment of the petitioner in BSTI and the approval of the President having under section 5(3) of the Act has not been obtained before issuing Annexure-A, the appointment of the petitioner as Project Director was illegal, the said appointment could be cancelled by the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 and as such there is no illegality in the impugned order cancelling the reemployment of the petitioner.</p><p><strong>Syed Nurul Hossain Vs Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Industries, Dhaka and others, 19 BLD (HCD) 261.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—9 (1) (2)</strong></p><p><strong>Optional Retirement</strong></p><p>Sub-Section (1) of Section 9 of the Act provides that a public servant may opt to retire from service any time after he has completed 25 years of service by giving notice in writing to the appointing authority at least 30 days prior to the date of his intended retirement while sub-section (2) of Section 9 provides that the Government may retire from service a public servant in the public interest at any time after he has completed 25 years of service without assigning any reason.</p><p>In the instant case. none of the petitioners completed 25 years of service on the date of their impugned retirement. It is also evident from the retirement order itself that it was not made in the public interest but in effecting retrenchment in the Corporation. Moreover, under sub-section (2) of section 9 of the Public Servants (Retirement) Act, 1974 the authority to order retirement vested in the Government and not in the Corporation, although the employees affected belonged to a Corporation. The impugned order of retirement is therefore illegal and without jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>Abul Hossain and others Vs. Bangladesh Jute Corporation &amp; ors, 15 BLD (HCD) 341</strong></p><p> </p><p>The Public Servant (Retirement) Act,l974 (XII of 1974) has been made applicable to the employees of the Bangladesh Biman Corporation. Even after amendment of Regulation I in 1984 there has been no corresponding amendment of Rules 3 and 4 of the Bangladesh Biman Employees (Pension and Gratuity) Rules, 1988. In the instant case the petitioner was appointed before the amendment of the Regulation No. 11 of the Bangladesh B iman Corporation Employees (Service) Regulations 1979. Before its amendment the retirement age of the Stewardess was 57 years. Therefore, the petitioner’s right to remain in service till she completes 57 years of age cannot be curtailed on the strength of a subsequent amendment which was not in existence at the time of her appointment. The reduction of the age limit of the petitioner from 57 years to 35 years on the strength of Regulation No. 11 made in 1984 does not have any sanction of law the same being violative of Article 28 of the Constitution.</p><p><strong>Jonaba Dalia Parveen Vs. Bangladesh Biman Corporation, 16BLD(HCD)357</strong></p><p>Ref: 45 DLR(AD)122; A.I.R.1981 (SC) 1829; 1992 (SC) 392—Cited.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Section—9(2)</strong></p><p><strong>Sub-section 2 of Section 9 of Act. XII of 1974</strong></p><p>Since it appears from the office record that the decision to retire the petitioner was taken in the public interest, mere non- mentioning of the words “in the public interest” in the impugned order of retirement does not at all effect its legality.</p><p>Retirement—whether a punishment—to take or not to take disciplinary action under the relevant rules against a delinquent Government servant is a matter which is absolutely within the discretion of the Government. In a case of a Government servant who has completed 25 years of service, the authorities may even start proceedings against him on a given charge and thereafter may drop the same and proceed under section 9(2) of the Act to retire him.</p><p>Retirement with full pentionary benefits after completion of 25 years of service is not a punishment nor does it contain any stigma. Such retirement is altogether different from ‘dismissal’ ‘removal’, ‘compulsory retirement’, which are different kinds of punishment as contemplated in rule 3 of the Government Servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1976.</p><p><strong>Shah Mohammad Zahurul Hoque Vs.
