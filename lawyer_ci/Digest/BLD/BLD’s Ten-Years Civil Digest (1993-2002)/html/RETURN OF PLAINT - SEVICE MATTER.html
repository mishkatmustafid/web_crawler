Thus, when an Adalat wrongly assumes jurisdiction and proceeds with a suit, the aggrieved party is entitled to invoke the provision of section 151 C.P.C. for redress of its grievance and the Court is competent togrant appropriate relief in exercise of its inherent power.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Kazi Jawaherul Islam Vs.

In such a case the subjective satisfaction of the plaintiff is of no avail.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure the Court may return a plaint to the filing Advocate when it is found that it has no jurisdiction, either pecuniary or otherwise, to entertain and try the suit. A plaint cannot be returned on the ground of incorrect valuation of the suit or for want of adequate court fees. If it appears that the suit has not been properly valued and sufficiently stamped, the Court required to make an enquiry either by itself or by any other person appointed by the Court in that behalf to determine the correct valuation of the suit in terms of sections 8C and 8D of the Court Fees Act. The learned Assistant Judge clearly erred in law in returning the plaint to the filing Advocate ignoring the express provisions of law regulating the return of the plaint and the valuation of the suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Didar Ali and others Vs.

The authority should bear it in mind that the petitioners have not preferred any appeal against the judgment of the High Court Division and they by their unilateral action cannot render the judgment of the High Court Division to be ineffective.

A review is never contemplated to be a re-hearing of a case for re-opening a closed chapter. It is available only under certain well-defined circumstances, namely, where some important evidence has been discovered, which could not, inspite of due diligence, have been known to the party to be produced at the time of hearing or the Court has overlooked some important question of fact and law, which would have a direct bearing on the decision of the case, or there is otherwise some apparent mistake or error on the face of the record. The ground that the Court has fallen into an error in deciding an important question or that. an important ground was not urged at the original hearing, cannot be the ground for review. The finality or sanctity that attaches to a judgment or order passed by a competent Court on hearing the contending parties cannot be lightly interfered with in review—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Section—i 14, Order 47 XL VII.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sree Parimal Chandra &amp; ors.

Evidently the learned Judge of the High Court Division failed to consider the uncontroverted assertion of the present appellant as the opposite party in the Rule that he had engaged Mr. Abdul Mannan Khan at Rangpur as his Advocate for the Rule but because of his death in October 1990 he could not know about the fate of his case before 7.8.92 and he came to Dhaka on 15.8.92 and thereafter instructed his lawyer to take steps for re-hearing of the Rule—Code of’ Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Section— 115</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Falguni Majumder Vs Mokbul Hossain Biswas and ors, 19 BLD (AD) 237.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Revision</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ordinarily in exercise of revisional authority under section 115(1) of the Code the revisional Court is not empowered to interfere with the finding of facts arrived at by the Court or tribunal upon reappreciation of evidence unless there has been non-consideration or gross misreading of evidence.—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Section— 115(1)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Mutalib Vs.

If in revisional jurisdiction the High Court Division rides roughshod over both substantive and procedural law then a litigant does not know what will happen to his case, what course will it take and what relief will ultimately emerge. This is a travesty of justice, as we know it.

The party seeking revision is to show further that there was violation of statutory provision or principle of natural justice which rendered the proceeding coram-non-judice. A reference to the provision of section 115 of the Code would show that every irregularity or even illegality in the exercise of jurisdiction does not render the judgment void.

As Rule 342(2) of the said Rules caters for a situation similar to termination simplicitier by providing for retiring pension to an officer who is required by the Government to retire after completing twenty-five years of service, without giving any reason, a term is implied into the Bank’s Service Regulations that Rule 342(2) shall apply to employees terminated without assignment of reason—Rupali Bank Employees Service Regulations 1981, Regulation—16, Bangladesh Services Rules 1983, Rule—342(2).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>M.

The seniority list was, therefore, required to be prepared in order of merit on the completion of the training programme as merit of the recruits at the end of the training governs the question of seniority. Since no reasonable basis for classification for placing in groups or training could be proved, there. was enough scope for arbitrary selection which is violative of the equality clause enshrined by Article 27 of the Constitution— Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972, Article — 27, Bangladesh Biman Employees (Service) Regulation, 1979, Regulation -18(c).</p><p> </p><p> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Aminul Huq and others Vs.
