In the instant case, the impugned order of dismissal from service was made without prior approval of the Board. The subsequent approval of the order of dismissal by the Board cannot cure this basic infirmity.</p><p><strong>Sheikh Roushan Ali Vs Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Jessore and others, 16 BLD (HCD) 204;.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Recognised Non-Government Secondary School Teachers (Board Of Intermediate And Secondary Education, Dhaka) Terms And Conditions Of Service Regulation, 1979</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Regulation—14</strong></p><p>There is no provision in Regulation 14 imposing a legal obligation on a member of the enquiry committee to be present in all its sittings and as such no legal consequence follows from a member’s failure to attend such a sitting. The enquiry committee will follow the ordinary rules of a committee meeting and the absence of a member in a particular sitting is of no legal consequence.</p><p>In the absence of any rule or service condition that the order of dismissal could only be passed after a prior second show cause notice to the appellant- employee, the appellate court was wrong in invoking the principles of equity of justice on the ground that the meeting of the enquiry committee ought to have been adjourned due to the absence of the teachers’ representative and that the plaintiff- appellant deserved a second show cause notice before the passing of order of dismissal.</p><p><strong>Post Office High School, represented by the Secretary, Managing Committee Vs.
