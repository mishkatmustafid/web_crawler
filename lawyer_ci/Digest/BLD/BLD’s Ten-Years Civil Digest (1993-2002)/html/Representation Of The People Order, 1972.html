In that sense, Election Commission is a composite body, an individual member can only act under section 4 of the Order when he is authorised by the Commission itself.</p><p>In the instant case, there is no delegation/authorization by the Commission itself. The Chief Election Commissioner being unwell he went on leave for treatment abroad and he verbally nominated a member to act as Acting Chief Election Commissioner. This may at best be said to be a direction of the Chief Election Commissioner to perform functions of the office in his absence as Acting Chief Election Commissioner, but for exercising and performing any powers or functions under this Order he must get authorisation from the Commission itself, otherwise his action under the Order will be coram non judice and without jurisdiction. The functions that the Acting Chief Election Commissioner was performing in the instant case, was a function vested in him under this Order.</p><p>The Acting Chief Election Commissioner had acted coram non judice in exercising his power in this particular case.</p><p><strong>Jatiya Party Vs Election Commission for Bangladesh and others, 21 BLD (AD) 11.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—20(1)(a)</strong></p><p>Article 20(1)(a) of the Order provides that if there are more contesting candidates than one in respect of any constituency, the Returning Officer shall allocate, subject to any direction of the Commission one of the prescribed symbols to each contesting candidate and in so doing shall, so far as possible, have regard for any preference indicated by the candidate.</p><p><strong>Jatiya Party represented by Md. Moidul Islam, Joint Secretary General Vs Motassim Billah and others, 20 BLD (AD) 69.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—31 (2)(d)(e)</strong></p><p>The Tribunal was justified in not excluding the ballot papers from counting which contained a part of the official seal, because the law has not demanded in a mandatory language the presence of a full seal on the ballot paper before its exclusion from count.</p><p><strong>Moulana Delwar Hossain Saydee Vs Sudhangshu Shekhor Holder and others, 20 BLD (AD) 11.</strong></p><p>Ref: Abdul Mannan Vs. Election Tribunal, 31DLR(AD)33 1—relied upon.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Articles—31(2)(e) and 36(4)(c)(1)</strong></p><p>When the counterfoils of ballot papers contain official mark it serves the purpose of requirement of law and it does not require to be signed either by the Presiding Officer or by the Assistant Presiding Officer and the Election Tribunal most illegally cancelled the ballot papers of the returned candidate having “boat symbol” of the Shambupura election centre and Domarchar election centre and therefore, the election result of Md. Emdadul Haque Bhuiyan as a Parliament Member has not been materially affected in any manner and his election as member of Parliament is sustained. [Per M M Hoque]</p><p><strong>Mr. Emdadul Haque Bhuiyan Vs Ataur Rahman Khan and ors., 20 BLD (HCD) 74.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—31 (2)(d)(e)(f)</strong></p><p>The ballot papers which do not contain the stamp with official mark in its back and the number of the elector mark in writing on the counterfoil by the Presiding Officer having stamp in the counterfoil with the official mark and without signature or thumb impression on the counterfoil of the ballot papers cannot be treated and counted as valid votes.</p><p><strong>Moulana Delwar Hossain Saidi Vs S.S. Holder and others, 19 BLD (HCD) 85.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—31 (2)(d)(e)(I)</strong></p><p>The votes which are not valid votes as per requirements of Article 31(2)(d) (e) and (f) are declared as invalid votes and those votes are deducted from the total votes counted.</p><p><strong>Moulana Delwar Hossain Saidi Vs S.S. Halder and others, 19 BLD (HCD) 85.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Articles—36 and 73</strong></p><p>When the election petitioner did not raise any objection about the alleged rigging in election in the two election centres namely, Shambupura and Domarchar either to the respective Presiding Officers or to the Returning Officer, the allegations of rigging, disturbance and other corrupt practices in the said election centres were an afterthought which has no basis at all when after analysing the depositions of PWs 1, 2 and 4 and the deposition of the RWs, 1, 3 to 8, 10 and 14-15 it appears that the election petitioner had totally failed to prove disturbance and election rigging in the said two centres. [Per M M Hoque]</p><p><strong>Mr. Emdadul. Haque Bhuiyan Vs Ataur Rahman Khan and ors., 20 BLD (HCD) 74.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—36(4)(i)(iv)</strong></p><p>The ballot papers that are required to be excluded from the count are fully described in Article 36(4)(i)-(iv) of the Order. Neither the Tribunal nor the High Court Division has any jurisdiction to add any other extraneous requirement other than those contained in sub- clauses (i)-(iv) of clause (4) of Article 36. These sub-clauses do not require that a ballot paper is to be excluded from the count if it does not contain the Code number or the signature or initial of the Assistant Presiding Officer. The High Court Division acted without jurisdiction in excluding the ballot papers of both the appellant and the election-petitioner containing the aforesaid omissions. Further, from the election petition it does not appear that the election-petitioner made any allegation as to the illegal counting of votes by the Presiding Officer of Char Baleswar polling centre.</p><p><strong>Moulana Delwar Hossain •Saydee Vs Sudhangshu Shekhor Halder and others, 20 BLD(AD) 11</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Articles—36 and 73</strong></p><p>Before reopening ballot boxes for recounting ballot papers the Election Tribunal must be satisfied on the basis of the statements made in the election petition and the legal evidence adduced and other materials on record that the scrutiny and the recounting of ballot papers has become a material issue and is imperatively necessary to resolve the controversy and to do complete and effectual justice between the parties which is lacking in the present case. On the prayer of the election petitioner there could not be any recounting of ballot papers when he failed to bring home the allegations of corrupt or illegal practice against the returned candidate and when no foundation of recounting had been laid and hence the learned tribunal committed a patent illegality and flagrant error of law in recounting the ballot papers.
