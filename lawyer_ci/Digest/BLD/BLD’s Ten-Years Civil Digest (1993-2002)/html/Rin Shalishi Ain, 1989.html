An application before the Board cannot be presented unless the sitting of the Board actually takes place after the Collector concerned notifies about the place, date and time of the sitting of the Board. Thereafter the applicant has to be examined by the Charmin of the Board immediately on receipt of the application and if the application is found unsatisfactory the same is liable to be dismissed forthwith. In the instant case, the Board started functioning on and from 4.1.1990. Since limitation is to be counted not from the date of the constitution of the Board on 27.5.1989 but it is to be counted from the date of functioning of the Board on 4.1.1990, the defendant’s application before the Board was not barred by limitation.</p><p><strong>Ajahar All Sarder Vs.
