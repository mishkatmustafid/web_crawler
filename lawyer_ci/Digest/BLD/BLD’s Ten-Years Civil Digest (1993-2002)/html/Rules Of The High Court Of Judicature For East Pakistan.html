It is the urgency of the matter which gives jurisdiction to the Single Vacation Judge even to keep in abeyance during the period of vacation an order passed by regular Division Bench. When a case of urgency is made out and the Single Vacation Judge is satisfied that it is both urgent and proper to interfere, there is no lack of jurisdiction in exercising the power but this unusual power is to be exercised sparingly and with utmost caution, keeping in mind that it is improper for a learned Single Judge acting during the vacation to interfere with the interlocutory order of a regular Division Bench in wanton disregard of propriety.</p><p><strong>Azizur Rahman alias Md.

Idrish Ali Bhuiyan i. Dr. Alauddin Ahamed, 22 BLD (HCD) 175.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—62(2)(3)</strong></p><p>The decision of a tribunal on an election petition shall be final under clause(2) of Article 62 but the same sub-clause starts with a ridden i.e.; “same as provided in clause(3)” which means that finality is subject to any appeal taken by an aggrieved person to the High Court Division under sub-clause (3), the decision in the appeal shall be final under sub clause(3). As soon as there is an appeal under sub-clause (3) taken the finality of the decision under sub-clause (2) of the tribunal is automatically displaced.</p><p><strong>Sudhangshu Shekhor Halder Vs Moulana Delwar Hossain Saydee and others, 19 BLD (AD) 133.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—65(a)</strong></p><p>For failure of the Presiding Officer to take proper steps when Abdul Mannan did not show up and when Shahidul Islam acted in his place unlawfully, the voters cannot be disenfranchised and the candidates should not be penalised to go through the motion of another polling particularly when there is absolutely no finding that Shahidul Islam’s participation made a difference in the voting pattern or that the appellant had a connivance in the matter or that he benefited from an illegality of which he had prior knowledge.</p><p>Any and every kind of failure of any person to comply with the provisions of the order and the rules will not result in the declaration of the election as a whole to be void.</p><p><strong>Moulana Delwar Hossain Saydee Vs Sudhangshu Shekhor Halder and others, 20 BLD (AD) 11.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—67(1)</strong></p><p>The purpose of taking effect of an order of a tribunal on the date on which it is made under clause (1) of Article 67 seems to be that the law clearly lays down that such an order shall not be effective from any prior date. The reason of making this provision is that all declaratory decree/orders are retrospective in operation and unless specifically given prospective date of operation, the final order passed by an Election Tribunal will automatically retrospective. Another apparent reason being to save the acts in which the returned candidate participated. There is no compulsion in the said provision to deny the ancillary or concomitant power of granting stay while entertaining in appeal by the High Court Division. As for the power of and reasons granting stay, the Appellate Division has endorsed the view taken by the High Court Division.</p><p><strong>Sudhangshu Shekhor Halder Vs Moulana Del war Hossain Saydee and others, 19 BLD (AD) 133.</strong></p><p>Ref: AIR 1969 (SC) 430; PLD 1972 (Peshwar)15 1—Cited.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Article—73</strong></p><p>Evidence led in support of the corrupt practice must not only be cogent and definite but if the election petitioner is to succeed he must establish definitely and to the satisfaction of the Court the charge of the corrupt practice which he brings against the returned candidate. In the light of the pleading and evidence and materials brought on record it is seen that the election petitioner failed to adduce any cogent, satisfactory or reliable evidence to bring home the charge of corrupt or illegal practice against the returned candidate and miserably failed to discharge the onus of proving the charges leveled by him against the returned candidate.
