Pension is earned by an employee during the period he works and is part of the consideration of the contract of employment, though the same is payable after his employment comes to an end. The Bank’s service regulations adopted the Bangladesh Service Rules for payment relating to pensions for its permanent employees, but the Bangladesh Service Rules have no provision for payment of pension to terminated officers as there is no law to terminate the services of a Government servants. But as Rule 342(2) of the said Rules caters for a situation similar to termination simpliciter by providing for retiring pension to an officer who is required by the Government to retire after completing twenty-five years service, without giving any reason, a term is implied into the Bank’s Service Regulations that Rule 342(2) shall apply to employees terminated without assignment of reason.</p><p><strong>M.
