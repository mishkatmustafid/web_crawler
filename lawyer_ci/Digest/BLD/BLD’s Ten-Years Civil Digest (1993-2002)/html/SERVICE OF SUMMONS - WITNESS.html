Once the defendant denies service of summons upon him the whole onus shifts to the plaintiff to prove satisfactorily that summons was in fact duly served—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Order VIX Rule 13.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since the finding of the trial court as to non-service of summons cannot be said to be perverse the High Court Division erred in law in setting aside that finding entering into a question of fact.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Wazed Sarder Vs.

Although Rule 19A of Order V provides that a declaration of service by the serving officer shall be received as a due service, the Court cannot accept service of summons mechanically—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Order V Rules 17, 19 and 19A.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Wahab Gazi Vs. sheikh Haider Ali and others, 16 BLD (AD) 53.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Service of summons</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">When summons is effected under Rule 17 of Order 5 C.P.C., Rule 19 casts a duty upon the servying  officer on oath touching his proceeding and to ascertain by enquiry as to whether summons has been duly served and make a declaration to that effect.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rule 19A of Order 5 C.P.C. provides that a declaration made and subscribed by the serving officer, shall be received as evidence of service of summons. In the instant case in the absence of any declaration by the serving officer and in the absence of examination of the process server by the Court, the order of the learned Munsif reading “notice has been served” does not satisfy the requirements of law as to due service. In such circumstances, it must be held that there has been no due service of notices and the ex-parte decree is accordingly set aside—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 190.8), Order V Rules 17, 19. 19A</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sk.

But subsequently he did not file any written statement in the suit and consequently the exparte decree was passed. In that view of the matter, the petitioners’ plea that summons was not served upon them is not tenable at all.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

On general principles and in exercise of its inherent power and executing Court can entertain and give effect to a claim to set off, even in cases which do not come strictly under Order XXI Rule 19 of the Code. An equitable set off can be claimed in a case where cross demands arise out of the same transaction or where they are so connected in nature or circumstances that it would be inequitable to allow one party to execute his decree depriving the other party to separate proceedings. No party as of right can claim such set off, which may be granted by a Court in its discretion to be exercised judicially—Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (V of 1908), Order XXI Rule 19.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shankar Lal Das v.

The stay of an execution case is purely a matter of discretion for the court and this power has to be exercised judicially—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Order XXI Rules 26 and 29.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Asia Khatun being dead her legal heirs and representatives Bulbul Ahmed and others Vs.

It has no reference to any suit filed by a third party. In the instant case by the impugned order further proceedings of the two execution cases have been stayed at the instance of a third party and as such the same is not sustainable in law—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Order XXI Rule 29.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abul Kalam and others Vs.

Where common questions of title are involved in the two suits it is desirable that the suits be tried simultaneously although parties thereto are not the same, for avoiding conflicting decisions and multiplicity of litigations—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Section— 10.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Faziur Rahman Vs.

It is purely discretionary with the appellate Court to grant such a relief only for a sufficient cause. If the operation of the order of temporary injunction is stayed till the disposal of the appeal, it simply means that there is not only no order of injunction in existence but also it virtually gives the appellant the final relief of the appeal pending adjudication. In the absence of any compelling reasons and that too for preventing an apparent injustice, the stay of operation of the impugned order of temporary injunction pending decision in the appeal is not contemplated in law—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Order XLI Rule 5.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>A.

The Rule does not abate for non-substitution within 90 days. Courts have always been liberal in allowing substitution in a revision case when there is no gross laches on the part of the defaulting party—Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908), Order—22.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Badal Kanti Barua and others Vs.

A transferee of a property sold by a person is not his legal representative. Sub-rule (2) of Rule 10 of Order I C.P.C. empowers a Court at any stage of the proceeding to add a person as a party whose presence is considered by the Court necessary for effective and complete adjudication of all questions involved in the case—Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908), Section 2 sub-section (11), Order I Rule 10 and Order 22 Rule 4 (A).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

So, if the final decree is completed in the absence of a contesting defendant, who was allotted a specific Saham, it is likely that his vital interests. would go unrepresented and he is likely to be adversely affected thereby.

In the instant case although the concerned heirs, who are left out earlier, did not take any steps for impleading themselves but the learned trial court on the application of other heirs of the deceased plaintiff rightly impleaded them as plaintiffs in the suit— Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (V of 1908), Order XX Rule 4.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Firoza Khanam &amp; ors.

It should take notice under section 114(e) of the Evidence Act and should start with the presumption of regularity in official business. Initially, in the writ petition itself, the writ petitioner must include some reliable and relevant materials to show that between the last date of fixation of tariff value and the impugned date of fixation of tariff value the international market price of a particular importer item has either gone down or has gone up to an extent which is significantly higher or lower than the impugned fixation of tariff value.

But before a property is treated as vested property, particularly on the basis of a V.P. Case started long after the lifting of the emergency on 16th February, 1969 a heavy duty is cast upon the Government to show that the recorded tenant actually migrated to India before 1965 and settled there by conducting necessary enquiry into individual cases, rather than relying on the stray noting of a Thashilder, who is accountable to none and whose report is yet to be authenticated by any responsible officer of the Government.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When challenged in a Court of law, the onus is heavily on the Government to prove affirmatively that the property in question is a vested property, failing which some evidence to the contrary is sufficient to take the disputed property out of the ambit of the enemy property laws.

Bulk Management (Bangladesh) Ltd. and others, 16 BLD (HCD) 575.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Winding up</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company was formed with three persons one of them died and there is a dead lock between the remaining two so far the business of the company is concerned; both are making allegations and counter allegations against each other, no Annual General Meeting or any other meeting has been held since its incorporation about 14 years ago and no return has been submitted to the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies. The heirs of the deceased shareholder have not been included as members of the company. Under the fact and circumstances it is just and equitable that the Company should be wound up as there is a complete dead lock between the share holders, who are also directors—Companies Act, 1994 (XVIII of 1994), Section-241(ii)(vi).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>S M M Yusuf Vs. Bismilalh Shipping Lines (Pvt) Ltd., 20 BLD (HCD) 517.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Winding up</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the affidavit-in-opposition it appears that the Company has not specifically denied the claim of the petitioner and as such it is deemed to have been admitted. Moreover, there is no statement in the affidavit-in opposition that the claim of the petitioner has since been paid off. Notice as required under section 242 of the Act has been served upon the Company and as such the Company is unable to pay its admitted debt and it is liable to be wound up—Companies Act, 1994 (XVIII of 1994), Sections—241 and 242.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>M.

While section 138, 139, 140, 141 of Negotiable Instruments Act purports to impose penalties in case of dishonour of cheques, object of a petition for winding up of a company is to pay its debts out of its realizable assets—Companies Act, 1994 (XVIII of 1994), Section—241 (v).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mr. Amir Hossain V.
