If these tworequirements were fulfilled, the plaintiff was entitled to a decree forpermanent injunction. It appears from a review of the judicial pronouncementsof the superior courts of the sub-continent that the aforesaid view of late hasundergone a change. It is now well-settled that if the plaintiff can prove hispossession in the suit land he is entitled to protect his possession by way ofpermanent injunction. Even the rightful Owner cannot evict by force a person inlong and continuous possession in the suit property. The question of title hasthus become a matter of little significance. </span></p><span style='Cambria","serif";Times New Roman";'><br clear="all" style="page-break-before:always;"/></span><p><b><span style='Cambria","serif";'>Kalyan KrishnaGoswami Vs.
