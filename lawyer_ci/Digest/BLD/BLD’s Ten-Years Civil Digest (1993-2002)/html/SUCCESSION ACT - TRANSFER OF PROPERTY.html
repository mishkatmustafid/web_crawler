Section 7 of the Ordinance describes the function of the Tea Board viz : to correct statistics from growers, manufacturers or dealers of tea or other persons on any matter relating to tea industry and to undertake, assist or encourage scientific, technological and economic research and to assist in the maintenance of demonstration farms for the promotion of tea and other economic crops. Section 24 of the Ordinance provides that no person shall manufacture tea except in a registered tea factory. It therefore follows that tea is an industry and it is to be manufactured in a tea factory and as such there is no warrant for the conclusion that a tea garden is half agricultural and half industrial in nature. A Tea Company being an industrial company is to be assessed income tax at the rate of 50% and not at the rate of 60%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although the basic raw materials used for processing tea are agricultural in nature, yet tea manufacturing is an industrial process. It being an individual process and one business not being divisible into half agricultural and half industrial, the concerned tea garden cannot be deprived of the benefit of reduced tax as provided under the Finance Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Commissioner of Income Tax, Chittagong (South), Chittagong Vs.

Inspite of repeal of section 93A and 93B of the 1953 Act the proceeding taken under these sections shall not affect such proceeding although section 12 of 1982 Ordinance provides that where compensation has not been paid or deposited within one year from the date of the decision of the Government the proceeding of acquisition shall stands abated. Claim for release of unutilized acquired land is not a vested right and nor failure of the requiring body to utilize the land acquired within 3 years from the date of acquisition in view of the decision of the Government creates no constitutional or legal right in the petitioners who claim for release of such land. Non-payment of compensation within one year from the date of decision of the Government for acquisition of land as contemplated under section 12 of the Ordinance does not render such land liable to be released. Section 12 is not applicable to the facts of the instant cases which was started long before the Ordinance came into force in view of the provision of amended section 79 of the 1953 Act as no retrospectively can be read into section 12 of the Ordinance of 1982.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

The Registrar rejected the prayer for adjournment solely on the ground that the appellant did not appear before him in accordance with law as he did not file any power of attorney or vokalatnama.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 80 of the Act provides that whereby or under this Act, any act other than the making of an affidavit, is required to be done by any person, the act may, subject to prescribed conditions or in special cases with the consent of the government, be done in lieu of by that person himself, by a duly authorised agent being either a legal practitioner or a person registered in the prescribed manner as a Trade Marks agent. The application for time, as has already been said, was not filed either by the person required to file the same under law or by a duly authorised agent. The provisions of section 70(c) or 80 of the Act have no manner of application in the instant case. Section 70 (c) could have come it into play had the opposition been duly filed and in case of rejection or abandonment of such opposition but in the instant case extension of time was sought for filing opposition and that too not by any duly authorised person. Rule 76 of the rule framed under the Act empowers the Registrar to extend time for doing act in any particular case under certain circumstances.

But with the change of ownership and attornment this position changed. Since no period for notice was fixed in the new tenancy, the tenant cannot invoke the plea of one month’s notice stipulated in the original tenancy. Moreover, the tenant started a new partnership firm under the name and style: “MIs. Greenland and Company’ and the landlord issued rent receipts in favour of the company. This clearly shows that a fresh tenancy was created and the original contract was no longer in force.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Even if there is an agreement between the landlord and tenant providing for 30 days notice for terminating tenancy and the notice served on the tenant falls short of 30 days but the suit for ejectment is filed after one month of service of notice under Section 106 of the T.P.Act, the notice will be regarded as a valid and sufficient one.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Alhaj Md.
