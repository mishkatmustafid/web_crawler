In the present case, the plaintiff by conscious choice filed the suit for eviction of the defendant as an unauthorised occupant liable for eviction without any notice. Such a suit is not maintainable in the Court of Small Causes in view of Section 15(1) read with Article 4 of the Second Schedule of the Act.</p><p><strong>Md. Faziur Rahman Shah Vs. Md. An- fur Rahman alias Badsha Chairman 16 BLD (AD)1 79</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—15(2)</strong></p><p>Generally suits of a civil nature of which the value does not exceed one thousand taka is triable by a Court of Small Causes. Subsection (2) of Section (2) of Section 15 read with Article (4) of the Second Schedule gives exclusive jurisdiction to the Court of Small Causes to entertain and try a suit for ejectment of a monthly tenant by his landlord. The plea of the defendant does not determine or change the forum of trial nor does it oust the jurisdiction of the Court of Small Causes. In order to decide whether a suit is one of a Small Cause Court nature or not, one has to refer to the allegations made in the plaint. If the allegations in the plaint make out a prima facie case which comes within the ambit of a Small Cause Court, the defence plea will be immaterial. In the instant case, the suit is in essence a suit by the landlord for ejectment of his tenant. Once a relationship of landlord and tenant is pleaded by the plaintiff he cannot be thrown out of the Court on the plea of tenant’s title on which the landlord’s claim does not depend. In such a case, the question of title to the disputed premises is not at all relevant. When it is found that the defendant is a tenant under the plaintiff, the defendant is precluded from setting up his own title and denying the title of the plaintiff in the suit premises.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Haji Kasimuddin Mandal Vs.

Under such circumstances, it cannot be said that the suit involves any complicated question of title. The learned S.C.C. Judge was perfectly justified in rejecting the petitioners prayer for return of the plaint.</p><p><strong>Faiz Ahmed Chowdhury Vs. Arif Ahmed, 16 BLD (HCD) 228.</strong></p><p>Ref: 22 DLR 841; 11DLR427; 35 DLR (AD)3 10—Cited.</p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—23</strong></p><p><strong>Return of plaints in suits involving questions of title</strong></p><p>From a reading of section 23 of the Act it is clear that the word ‘may’ occurring in section 23(1) of the Act shows that it is not mandatory. When in a suit heard by a Small Causes Court, any complicated question of title to immovable property is involved, it would be a wiser course to act under section 23 of the Act.</p><p>In the instant case, the plaintiffs were able to prove the relationship of landlord and tenant between themselves and there being no complicated question of title involved, the trial Court was wrong in returning the plaint for filing the same in a proper Court and as such the impugned order is liable to be set aside.</p><p><strong>Rabiul Alam and another Vs. Sree Bidhan Kumar Deb, Advocate, (HCD) 46. </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>SCC Suit</strong></p><p>The tenant-appellant did not claim title for himself rather he set up a case that Binodi Lal never executed any deed of exchange in favour of the plaintiffs. The High Court Division found that the plaintiff had title on the basis of exchange deed which was validated by the A.D.C. (Revenue), Dinajpur on 3.2.82 after due enquiry. The basic question is whether the plaintiff-landlord has been able to prove that the defendant-appellant was inducted by him on the disputed premises and whether a relationship of landlord and tenant has been established between the parties.</p><p>In the instant case from the averments in the written statement of the defendant- appellant it is palpably clear that the defendant admitted that he used to pay rents to the plaintiff and the rent was enhanced from time to time. All that the defendant stated in his pleading was that due to unfavorable condition he had to pay rents to the landlords and due to ill advise of his senior Advocate he deposited rent in House Rent Control Case No. 97 of 1979. Apart from the above averments. the High Court Division found from the circuit. Ext. 4 acknowledging the payment of rent from October to November, 1947. The High Court Division also compared the signature of the appellant appearing in Ext.5 series with Ext.4 and found those to be of the handwriting of the appellant. From rent receipts, Ext. 5 series the High Court Division found that the relationship of landlord and tenant was established between the parties. Ext. F series, entry of statement of Pourashava clearly show that plaintiff No. 1 was the owner of the house and the defendant was shown as occupier. The High Court Division also considered the oral evidence of the parties and also the legal effect of filing of Rent Control Case No. 97 of 1979 by the defendant and came to a definite conclusion that relationship of landlord and tenant was established between the plaintiff and the defendant and as such there was no complicated question of title and relationship of landlord and tenant having been established decreed the suit.</p><p><strong>Bidhan Kumar Deb Vs Rabiul Alam and others,, 20 BLD (AD) 257.</strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
