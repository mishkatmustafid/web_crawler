While registering the society, the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies did not find anything wrong with the memorandum of association or any of its articles to be against the Act. A charitable society can invest unspent money for getting more money to be spent in charity, as there is no bar in the Act and when its memorandum of association has authorized the society to invest its money not immediately required. (Per Mahmudul Amin Choudhury, CJ)</p><p>The investment of BRAC of its money not immediately required in BRAC Bank Ltd. is not an activity as envisaged in section 20. It is an investment under its memorandum of association in order to augment its resources for more efficiently achieving the objects for which it was incorporated. So, no amendment of section 20 is necessary. (Per Mainur Reza Chowdhury. J)</p><p>BRAC has been registered under the Act with the object to engage itself in charitable purposes and social welfare activities strictly on non-profit basis. By its investment in BRAC Bank, BRAC has gone for purely commercial activities, which is not permitted by its memorandum. In the event of bankruptcy of BRAC Bank the charity money would be lost if not totally but substantially, and the memorandum of BRAC does not contemplate investment of its assets or money where the loss of such investment is probable. Unless an amendment is made to the Act, it is not permissible for societies to go for commercial undertaking. (per Md. Ruhul Amin, J, dissenting)</p><p><strong>BRAC v. Professor Mozaffar Ahmed and others, 22 BLD (AD) 41.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—20</strong></p><p><strong>Foreign Donation (Voluntary Activities) Ordinance, 1978</strong></p><p><strong>Section—2(d)</strong></p><p>A scrutiny of section 20 of the Act and section 2(d) of the Ordinance will establish that the purposes for which a society is registered under the Act and assistance is given to an organisation under the Ordinance, are basically non-profit making and voluntary in nature. They can engage in activities with service oriented zeal to the community without entering into purely commercial venture. Allowing BRAC to purchase shares of BRAC Bank will cause a metamorphosis, changing BRAC from a society to a company which is not legally allowed. Not only that, there will also be probability of plethora of laws, like Bankruptcy Act, Income Tax Act, etc. coming into conflict with the Societies Registration Act, resulting in serious legal complications in future.</p><p>Unless otherwise authorised, no new territory can be included in section 20 of the Act and section 2(d) of the Ordinance which specifically provide for a society to engage in the fields set out therein and they do not contemplate undertaking of investment of money in purchasing shares in a corporate entity like a banking company. BRAC is neither empowered by any legislation, nor allowed by its Memorandum and Articles of Association, nor authorised by the Societies Registration Act nor by the Foreign Donation (Voluntary Activities) Regulation Ordinance, 1978, to buy shares to own, promote or control a bank.</p><p><strong>Professor Muzaffer Ahmed Vs Bangladesh Bank &amp; others, 20 BLD (HCD) 235.</strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
