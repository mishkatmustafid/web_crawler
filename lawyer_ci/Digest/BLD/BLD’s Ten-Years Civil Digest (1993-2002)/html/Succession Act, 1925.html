In this case 3 witnesses were examined by the plaintiff who proved the execution and attestation of the Will. The trial Court without discussing the evidence of the witnesses dismissed the suit by merely comparing the signatures of the executor by naked eyes. The learned Judge ought to have discussed the evidence of the witnesses before coming to any sweeping conclusion. On consideration of the evidence of the witnesses the High Court Division accepted the execution and attestation of the Will and granted probate.</p><p><strong>Sree Pratik Bandhu Roy Vs.

Even in the case of a non-contentions petition, in case of any doubt, the District Delegate has to seek directions of the District Judge. He cannot, however, reject a non-contentions petition for probate or letters of administration as has been done in the instant case in violation of section 288 of the Succession Act. The caveat or respondent claiming through the testator has no difficulty in contesting the probate proceeding.</p><p><strong>Haripada Ghose and another Vs.

Inspite of some amount of dubiousness on the part of the Government as regards the absorption of the respondent, the Appellate Division found it to be just and proper to extend the benefit of doubt in favour of the respondent. A double standard treatment meted out to different employees by the executive Government is deprecated.</p><p><strong>The Director General, NSJ Vs. Md.
