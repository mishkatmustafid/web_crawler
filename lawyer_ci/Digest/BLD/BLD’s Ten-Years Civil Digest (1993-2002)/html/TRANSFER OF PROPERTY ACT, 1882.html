But if the tenant denies title of the landlord in the suit premises, the necessity of serving any notice upon him under Section 106 of the T.P. Act is waived.</p><p>In the original tenancy there was a provision for giving one month’s notice for determination of the tenancy. But with the change of ownership and attornment this position changed. Since no period for notice was fixed in the new tenancy, the tenant cannot invoke the plea of one month’s notice stipulated in the original tenancy. Moreover, the tenant started a new partnership firm under the name and style: “MIs. Greenland and Company’ and the landlord issued rent receipts in favour of the company. This clearly shows that a fresh tenancy was created and the original contract was no longer in force.</p><p>Even if there is an agreement between the landlord and tenant providing for 30 days notice for terminating tenancy and the notice served on the tenant falls short of 30 days but the suit for ejectment is filed after one month of service of notice under Section 106 of the T.P.Act, the notice will be regarded as a valid and sufficient one.</p><p><strong>Alhaj Md.

Act is an exception to ordinary rule that the transferor cannot convey a greater till to the transferee than he himself has and has to be construed strictly. If anyone seeks protection purportedly either under section 41 of the T.P. Act or under Section 115 of the Evidence Act, he must prove the facts entitling him the benefits under either of the laws. He is required to prove that he, after taking reasonable care to ascertain that the transferor had power to make the transfer, acted in good faith.</p><p><strong>Wahidha Begum Vs Tajul Islam, 20 BLD (HCD) 431.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—43</strong></p><p><strong>Feeding the grant by estoppel</strong></p><p>The essential requirements for application of the provision of this section are : (a) erroneous or  fraudulent representation by a person having no title or having imperfect title to certain immovable property that he was authorised to transfer such property; (b) actual transfer of the said property by him for a reconsideration and (c) subsequent acquisition of tille or interest by the said person in the said property. On fulfillment of these conditions the transfer made by the unauthorised person would operate on the title or interest which has subsequently been acquired by the said person at the option of the transferee.</p><p><strong>Abdul Motalib alias Motalib Vs.

Government of Bangladesh and others, 31 DLR (AD) 218; A.l.R. 1936 (Peshwar) 103—Cited.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Section—43</strong></p><p>It provides that a transfer by an unauthorised person, who subsequently acquires interest in the property transferred, fraudulently or erroneously representing that he is authorised to transfer certain immovable property and professing to transfer such property for consideration, such transfer shall, at the option of the transferee, operate on any interest which the transferor may acquire in such property at any time during the subsistence of the contract for transfer.</p><p>Thus although an agreement to transfer the right of an heir apparent or spes succession is invalid and unenforceable under the law, conveyance of an estate by an heir apparent on contingent remains dormant for valuable consideration to a purchaser is not void. If the state expectant subsequently acquires title in the property, he is bound to make good the sale and the Court will compel him to carry out the agreement by way of a legal conveyance.</p><p><strong>Khatibun Nahar and others Vs.

It does not necessarily create any tenancy after the expiry of the stipulated lease period. The common law rule is that if a lessee remains in possession after the expiry of the terms, he is a tenant by sufferance. There is, of course, a distinction between a tenant continuing in possession after the determination of the tenancy with the consent of the landlord and a tenant remaining in possession without the landlord’s consent. The former is called a tenant holding over or a tenant at will and the latter is called a tenant by sufferance’.</p><p><strong>Md. Mokbul Hossain Khondker Vs.
