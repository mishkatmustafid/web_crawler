The Societies Registration Act contains no limitation on investment to be made by a society. A society cannot be construed as a trust, and the provisions of the Trust Act have no manner of application in the functioning of a society. Therefore, the embargo in the Trust Act has no manner of application in the case of any society registered under the Societies Registration Act.

In the instant case, the creation, existence, validity and executability of the trust itself is being disputed, the trial court was correct in holding that if the Miscellaneous Case under section 74 of the Trusts Act is proceeded with, conflicting decisions may arise leading to serious complications. The Miscellaneous case was rightly stayed till the disposal of the Partition Suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Khalid Hamidul Huq Vs.

But in order to make out a case for recounting the person who challenges the counting has to prove that at the time of counting of votes by the presiding officer a contesting candidates or his election agent upon raising specific objection specifically requested the presiding officer to recount the ballot papers and the same was improperly refused or was not done in accordance with law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover before opening the election materials, for recounting of ballot papers the Election Tribunal is to satisfy itself positively that those materials has been preserved by the proper authority in accordance with law and the same has also been found intact under proper seal and cover so that no reasonable suspicion can be raised by the interested candidate of any post election tampering with ballot papers or other relevant election materials.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abdul Mutalib Vs Md.

The Presiding Officer has no other option but to count the votes at the polling centre unless question of safety and security of the personnel in charge of holding election at the centre or that safety as well as security of ballot box or boxes or that of the scrutinized ballot papers is involved. The word ‘shall’ in the sub- rule has made obligatory counting of votes by the Presiding Officer after scrutiny of the ballot papers in the ballot box or boxes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Md Mozibur Rahman Moznu Vs Abdul Halim and others, 21 BLD(AD)109</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Part—III</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule—39(5)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It can hardly be disputed that the facts alleged to invoke the writ jurisdiction and that to have a writ for the redress of respondent’s grievance are primarily based on disputed facts those said to have affected result of the election of the post of Chairman the Union or in other words has made consolidation of result as per provision 39(5) of the Rules.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case facts alleging which legality of the declaration of election result has been challenged are undoubtedly a election dispute and that in Part-Ill of the Rules provision has been made for adjudication of such dispute by the election tribunal constituted under that part.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Md Mozibur Rahman Moznu Vs Abdul Halim and others, 21 BLD (AD) 109.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RuIe—29</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under this rule it is the discretion of the Presiding officer to stop the poll and report it to the Returning Officer if the poll is interrupted or obstructed for reasons beyond his control. If the Presiding Officer can control the interruption or obstruction of the poll with the help of law enforcing agencies or by persuading the candidates and their supporters temporary interruption or obstruction of the poll cannot invalidate the entire poll. But when the Presiding Officer stops the poll and reports the matter to the Returning Officer, in that case the adjourned poll cannot be restarted by the Presiding Officer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sajjad Hossain Vs.

The object of these Rules is to secure not only the secrecy of the ballot but also to eliminate chances of post election tampering of the election materials.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case it being an undisputed fact that the gunny bags and the ballot packets along with other election materials remained in custody of the Returning Officer until 23rd February, 1992 long after receipt of the same from the Presiding Officers, although under Rule 42 of the said Rules they were to be sent to the Upazila Nirbahi Officer or the Sub- divisional Officer in properly sealed condition. The three gunny bags containing ballot papers and other election materials were found without proper seal on the tied up end of the gunny bags. The Election Tribunal also found the two packets containing valid votes of Nidanpur Supatala Government Primary School Polling Station open with signs of seal missing. Under these conditions it is only natural to presume that there was tampering with the sealed gunny bags containing ballot papers. The Election Tribunal erred in law in missing these salient aspects of the case depending only upon mere counting of ballot papers in the gunny bags under highly suspicious conditions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Non-consideration of the important aspects of the case verges on illegality striking at the very root of the impugned decision and the same has occasioned failure of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Md.

But if their provisions are incorporated in the domestic law, they are enforceable in national courts. The local laws, both constitutional and statutory, are not always in consonance with the norms contained in the international human rights instruments.
