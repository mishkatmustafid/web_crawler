Section 7 of the Ordinance describes the function of the Tea Board viz : to correct statistics from growers, manufacturers or dealers of tea or other persons on any matter relating to tea industry and to undertake, assist or encourage scientific, technological and economic research and to assist in the maintenance of demonstration farms for the promotion of tea and other economic crops. Section 24 of the Ordinance provides that no person shall manufacture tea except in a registered tea factory. It therefore follows that tea is an industry and it is to be manufactured in a tea factory and as such there is no warrant for the conclusion that a tea garden is half agricultural and half industrial in nature. A Tea Company being an industrial company is to be assessed income tax at the rate of 50% and not at the rate of 60%.</p><p>Although the basic raw materials used for processing tea are agricultural in nature, yet tea manufacturing is an industrial process. It being an individual process and one business not being divisible into half agricultural and half industrial, the concerned tea garden cannot be deprived of the benefit of reduced tax as provided under the Finance Act.</p><p><strong>Commissioner of Income Tax, Chittagong (South), Chittagong Vs.
