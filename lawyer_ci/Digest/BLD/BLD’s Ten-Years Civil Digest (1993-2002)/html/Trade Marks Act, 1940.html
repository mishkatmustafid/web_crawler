The Registrar rejected the prayer for adjournment solely on the ground that the appellant did not appear before him in accordance with law as he did not file any power of attorney or vokalatnama.</p><p>Section 80 of the Act provides that whereby or under this Act, any act other than the making of an affidavit, is required to be done by any person, the act may, subject to prescribed conditions or in special cases with the consent of the government, be done in lieu of by that person himself, by a duly authorised agent being either a legal practitioner or a person registered in the prescribed manner as a Trade Marks agent. The application for time, as has already been said, was not filed either by the person required to file the same under law or by a duly authorised agent. The provisions of section 70(c) or 80 of the Act have no manner of application in the instant case. Section 70 (c) could have come it into play had the opposition been duly filed and in case of rejection or abandonment of such opposition but in the instant case extension of time was sought for filing opposition and that too not by any duly authorised person. Rule 76 of the rule framed under the Act empowers the Registrar to extend time for doing act in any particular case under certain circumstances. This rule apparently does not contemplate extension of time for doing any act by a person who is not party to a proceeding or is not an authorised agent of a party.</p><p><strong>Nabisco mc, U.S.A Vs The Registrar of Trade Marks, 21 BLD (HCD) 402.</strong></p><p>Ref: Anath Bandhu Guha and sons Ltd. through its attorney Md.
