There is no bar in the Ordinance that once an application for removal of the Mutwalli is rejected, a subsequent application under section 32(2) cannot be filed. Therefore, the principle of res judicata has no manner of application under section 32 of the Ordinance.</p><p><strong>Md. Azizul Hoq v. The Administrator of Waqf, Government of Bangladesh and others, 22 BLD HCD) 223.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Section—32(2)</strong></p><p><strong><br clear="all" style="page-break-before: auto;"/> </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972, Article—102(2)</strong></p><p>An alternative remedy by way of appeal under a statute will not be a bar to a writ petition under Article 102(2) of the Constitution if there is a non-relaxable pre-condition for bringing the appeal.</p><p>In the instant case the constraint of relinquishing the office of Mutawalli prior to bringing an appeal is non-relaxable and as such the High Court Division was wrong in summarily rejecting the writ petition merely because the appellant had an alternative remedy under subsection (2) of section 32 of the Ordinance.</p><p><strong>Tafizul Huq Sarker Vs Bangladesh and others, 18 BLD (AD) 269.</strong></p><p>Ref: 17 DLR (1965) 46; 19 DLR (1967) 592; 42 DLR (AD)167; 16 BLD (AD) 83; 46DLR(AD) 191; 1 5DLR(SC) 181—Cited.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Sections—32(2) and 43</strong></p><p>Sub-section (2) of Section 32 of the Wakf Ordinance mandates that the removed Mutwalli is to hand over charge and without complying with such requirement of the proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 32, no appeal can be entertained by the court against the order of removal.</p><p>In this case the learned Judges of the High Court Division rightly found that the appeals were filed against that order but in the memorandum the appellant mentioned section 43 in order to mislead the court. The finding on merit equally is based on consideration of materials that the order of removal was passed for mismanagement of the Wakf Estate and for misappropriation of the fund. These findings of the learned Judges of the High Court Division do not call for any interference.</p><p><strong>Maulvi Afsar Uddin Haider and another Vs A.M. Mahiuddin &amp; ors, 19 BLD (AD) 302.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—38</strong></p><p>It provides that for the purpose of an enquiry under the Ordinance, the Wakf Administrator shall have the power to summon and enforce the attendance of the witnesses, including the interested parties, to examine them, to compel the production of necessary documents and to issue commissions for examination of witnesses in the same manner as is available to a Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p>In hearing an appeal from the order of the Wakf Administrator, the District Judge is required to decide the dispute regarding the right to the office of the Mutwalli claimed by the contending parties on hearing them and after taking necessary evidence. The District Judge acted illegally in passing the impugned judgment and order without examining any witness and the relevant documents in connection with the disputes.</p><p><strong>Md. Afazuddin Mollah and others Vs. Mobarak Au Munshi and others, 14 BLD (HCD) 242.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Sections—35 and 50</strong></p><p>Section 50 empowers the Wakf Administrator to determine the question as to whether a particular property is wakf property or not. Any person aggrieved by the decision or order of the Administrator may submit a petition to the District Judge under Section 35(1) of the Ordinance within three months from the date of such decision or order. Section 50 of the Ordinance provides an adequate and sufficient relief in a proceeding to determine the character of the wakf property. The jurisdiction of the Administrator and the District Judge or any Civil Court are not parallel, alternative or cumulative.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Md. Afazuddin Mollah and others Vs. Mobarak Au Munshi and others, 14 BLD (HCD)242</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—50</strong></p><p>Section 50 of the Ordinance provides that when there is a dispute as to the Wakf character of a property raised whether before or after the enrolment of the Wakfs, such dispute must be raised before the Administrator of Wakfs. The Wakfs Ordinance being special statute providing special procedures. it must be availed, of first and the jurisdiction of the civil Court in such cases is expressly barred. It is thus found that the entire proceeding before the learned Assistant Judge is a coram non-judice as he had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit.</p><p><strong>Chairman, Santosh Islami University Vs. Nil Mahmud and others, 15 BLD (HCD) 542.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section—64(1) (2)</strong></p><p>Against an order of eviction passed under Section 64(1) of the Wakf Ordinance, an appeal lies under Section 64(2) of the Ordinance before the District Judge whose decision shall be final but it made no provision for appeal in case of rejection of an application under Section 64 of the Ordinance.</p><p><strong>Md.

This ouster of jurisdiction of the Civil Court is attracted only after the Administrator has given a decision or order as to the character of the disputed property.</p><p>When the jurisdiction of the Wakf Administrator under Section 50 of the Ordinance is not invoked, power of Section 102 is not attracted.</p><p><strong>Md.
