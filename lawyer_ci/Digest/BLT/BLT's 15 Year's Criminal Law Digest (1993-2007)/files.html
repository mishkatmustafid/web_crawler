BLT mere absconding cannot s be a circumstance to lead to an inference of guilt of accused. In Judicial confessional statement confessing convict-appellant Sukkur Ali marked convict Ramjan as the culprit who along with other culprits made the rickshaw halt and who demanded money from deceased and who offered Taka 40/- to him for taking breakfast. Since the commission of crime Ramjan was in abscondence and this abscondence is supportive evidence of his involvement in offence and an incriminating circumstance against him.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs Md.

It must be borne in mind that penetration itself is sufficient to constitute the sexual intercourse to the offence of rape, Since the case is of gang rape, resistance was absolutely impossible as because woman is always weaker than man. Normally in almost all the cases accused is found to be one BLT in this case there were more than one accused persons and the circumstances and situation is quite different. It is in the testimony of P. W. 1 that since long days passed, alamats of rape could not be seized. The victim A was examined by P. W. 10 Dr. Nazrul Islam who on examination found chest pain, abdomen pain, physical assault, dyshuia etc. The possibility of alleged rupturing of vagina of the victim A in the event of commission of rape by five (5) persons on her could be gathered and elicited by the defence, even by the Bishesh Adalat itself in search of truth. The Bishes Adalat for that purpose, was expressly vested by section 165 of the Evidence Act with the right to put questions. BLT that was not done. The Bishes Adalat was not an expert on medical science and, therefore, it was absolutely incompetent to say anything on this subject and it travelled beyond its jurisdiction in assuming the function of a medical expert in recording the finding that in the event of commission of rape by seven (7) (actually five) persons. Vagina of victim A was required to be ruptured. The Bishes Adalat was also wrong in holding that it was not possible on her part to go to the room of the Principal of the college in the absence of any legal evidence to that effect. The Bishes Adalat imported its own views and there is no logic nor any reason to hold the said views. Reasons are the soul of law. The dicision of the Bishes Adalat is founded on mere suppositions, surmises and conjectures.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shamin Hossain Vs.

The Respondent No. 1 at the relevant time held the responsible post of Secretary, Ministry of Works. Officers of the Bureau of Anti-Corruption are empowered under sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Anti-Corruption Act, 1957 to hold any enquiry and investigation in respect of the offence specified in the schedule to that Act. We are of the view that though normally police cannot act on the basis of any report in the newspaper, as the matter has been brought to the notice of this court in the form of an application under Article 102 of the Constitution, this court to ensure transparency and accountability of public servants, especially those who hold responsible position, may give a direction to the Respondent No. 3 to take steps for holding enquiry into the allegations as contained in the report published in the daily "Dinkal" on 27.07.2001 so-' far the allegations relate to the Respondent Nos. 1 and 1A and thereafter to proceed according to law. We are inclined to issue such a direction in consideration of the fact that under Section 3 of the Anti-Corruption Act, 1957, an officer of the Bureau of Anti-Corruption is empowered to make such enquiry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mohammad Hossain Advocate Vs.

Moreover it appear that out of the seizure list witnesses the only PW6 was  produced before the  Court  and was examined by the prosecution. PW6 in his examination-in-chief stated that “ ???? ?/?? ??? ??? ???? ??/??.?? ???? ??? ???? ???? ??? ????? ???? ?? ? ???? ????? ????? ??????? ?/? ???? ????? ??? ???? ??? ??? ???? ????? ???? ?????? ? ???? ??? ??? ?????? ????? ???? ???? ????????? ????? ???? ? ????? ?? ???? ??? ???? ??? ????" From the evidence it is crystal clear that the rexin back was seized from a local vehicle not from the possession of any of accused persons. This PW6 did not mention any name of the accused person in his examination-in-chief. The PWl PW2, PW3 and PW8 although gave some direct evidence against the appellants BLT those evidence did not find support from the seizure list. From the discussion mad above it is crystal clear that the incriminating articles were neither recovered from the exclusive possession of the accused appellants nor the appellant had excessive control over the spot recovery of those guns - the sentence awarded thereunder is not sustainable in law and is liable to be set aside.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Golam Mohammad Faruque &amp; Ors.

So, his possession of the said pistols and ammunition while he was at Sena Bhaban as the resident of Bangladesh and thereafter for about a week was not possession and control within the meaning of section 19 (f) of the Arms Act, 1878- conviction under section 11 (f) for possession thereof has been bad in law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Hussain Muhammad Ershad Vs the State 3 BLT (HCD) 193</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-19(f)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since the seized 'daos' do not come within the mischief of Arms as defined in section 4 of the Arms Act, the trial of the accused appellant under section 19 (0 of the Act is illegal and the conviction and sentence passed upon him under section 19j (f) of the Arms Act cannot be sustained in Law and is liable to be set aside.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mizanur &amp; Ors Vs.

If there is any doubt as to "possession" the accused must be given the benefit of it. The prosecution case has. been grounded on the fact that after repeated] calls the accused-appellant opened the door; and on searching his body, whether inside the house, or on the courtyard or on the verandah, the Bayonet was recovered from body hidden on his waist under the lungi. Now the question is: Can it be at all believeable that hearing many calls from outside by police personnels and other people for opening the door of the house, the appellant opened the door keeping Bayonet on his waist under the Lungi to the same recovered from his body? The answer is: It is impossible and also improveable. It is the evidence that the accused-appellant did not open the door of the house at the first call BLT opened the after repeated calls. The appellant, opening the door of the house, took time to hide the Bayonet in any place the house. The appellant's first anxiety has been to keep the Bayonet in a place when the house was alleged to be of a dacoit. The prosecution version of the therefore, suffers from an inherent improbability and also an infirmity of a nature-the accused must be given the benefit of it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sukkur Ali Kha Vs.

Ordinarily, it be sufficient for the prosecution to prove that an incriminating fire-arm or ammunition was in possession of the accused and if such possession is established y the prosecution the Court will presume existence of mens rea in the mind of the subject to the right of the accused to this presumption and proved that he not possess the incriminating fire-arm ammunition consciously, knowingly or ally-  in  the  present  case, the t was holding. 3006 inch calibre rifle and same cartridges under the incriminating  cartridges under a valid licence and all these were kept at Sena Bhaban where he was residing. It has also been proved that the appellant presented the rifle in question and 13 pieces of cartridges to the military museum on 26th November, 1987. Thereafter on 24.12.90 the incriminating 11 pieces of cartridges found at Sena Bhaban when the Inventory Committee as making inventory of the articles left there. The appellant asserted that these 11 pieces of incriminating cartridges had been left at Sena Bhaban by the person sorted out the cartridges on account of inadvertence or having filed to identify them and that these had been left there until 24.12.90 without his knowledge, consent and intention - the assertion made by the appellant to be reasonable in all probability these cartridges were left behind at Sena Bhaban from 26.11.87 till 24.12.90.without his knowledge, consent and intention. So, even in his cartridges were technically in his possession being at Sena Bhaban these were in his possession without any guilty intention or mens rea on his part- his possession  could  not  be  construed as possession within the meaning of Section-19(f) of the Arms Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Hussain Mohammad Ershad Vs.

Whereas, an order of detention is made if the authority is 'satisfied' that the detent had acted or is acting or is about to act prejudicial activities within the meaning of "Prejudicial-Act" under the Special Powers Act. This 'satisfaction' as referred to is that of the authority and its satisfaction cannot be replaced by that of a police officer. This 'satisfaction' of the authority is subject to judicial review and this Court can look into this subjective satisfaction of the authority objectively. In respect of these detents, the 15 Years Digest authority made the orders of detention, the moment the police officer made proposal for detention after arrest under section 54 of the Code. This shows that the report of the police officer replaced the "satisfaction" of the authority in making an order on detention. Therefore, it is beyond the schame of the detention law that an order of detention can be made in respect of a person on the basis of a report of the police] officered after he was arrested under section 54 of the Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

On account of delay the report not only gets bereft of the advantage of spontaneity, danger creeps in of the introduction of coloured version, exaggerated account or concocted story as a result of deliberation and consultation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mujibor Rahman Vs The State 14 BLT (HCD) 109</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 154</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Delay in filing First Information Report</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Though, Informant PW1, PW2 and PW3 noticed marks of injuries on head and other persons of the body of deceased Hosna Nahar yet the cause of death could not be ascertained and eventually an Unnatural Death Case was registered with Police Station.

In First Information Report explanation had been offered in the terms that to ascertain cause of death of his daughter he insisted for Post Mortem examination of her daughter deceased Hosna Nahar at the time of registration of Unnatural Death case and on receipt of Post Mortem Report and, also, getting information from neighboring witnesses became fully aware of incident and, thereafter, lodged First Information Report on 27.3.2000.

In this context it is posited that it could not be believed at all that a woman would lay a false written complaint in respect of the chastity of her daughter against her own husband if them would not have occurred any such heinous incident at all and if her husband would not have deflowered her deaf and dumb daughter, the victim of crime. Subsequent version laid bare by Informant PW 1 before Tribunal manifests that she did not ten evidence fairly and did not bring to factuality truth and factuality in Tribunal.

The learned Magistrate upon receipt of the said application recorded an order stating that the record of the case has already transmitted to the learned Sessions Judge for trial. From the above facts it appear to us that the application for retracting confession was made at a belated stage after more than two months of making confession.

The aforesaid witness recording the statement admitted in cross-examination that the accused signed the statement in English and was asked the questions in English and Urdu BLT he recorded the statement in Bengali. Under Section 164(2) of the Code such confessional statements are required to be recorded and signed in the manner as provided in section 364 of the Code. Section 364 of the Code provides that the whole examination including every question put to an accused and every answer given by him shall be recorded in the language in which he is examined and if it is not practicable it can be written in the language of the Court or in English and if the accused does not understand the language in which it is written it shall be interpreted to him in a language which he understands to enable him to get a chance to explain or add to his answers. On perusal of the confessional statement (Ext-9) it appears to us that the same has been recorded by P.W. 11 Dewan Jakir Hossain in Bengali which the accused appellant admittedly does not understand and that though the witness knew English, the said statement has not been interpreted to the accused in the said language or any other language consideration to the perfunctory manner in which the statement has been recorded without complying with the requirement of law, we are of the view that the aforesaid confessional statement.

The Full Bench approved the majority views taken by different Benches observing that those authorities actually established no more than "(a) where there is other evidence a portion of the confession may in the light of that evidence be rejected while acting upon remainder with the other evidence, and (b) where there is no other evidence and the exculpatory element is not inherently incredible, the court cannot accept the  inculpatory element and reject the exculpatory element." The Full Bench then answered the reference as follows: "where there is no other evidence to show affirmatively that any portion of the exculpatory element in the confession is false; the court must accept or reject the confession as a whole and cannot accept only the inculpatory element while rejecting exculpatory   element   as inherently incredible." The Supreme Court of India in the case of Nishi Kant Jha V The State of Bihar, AIR 1969 (SC) 422 approved the views of the Allahabad High Court. Our Appellate Division in the case of State Vs Lalu Mia and another 39 DLR (AD) 117 did not depart from the views taken by the F Bench in the case of Balmakund and t Supreme Court of India in the case of Nis Kanata Jha (supra).

There is nothing on record demonstrating that convict-appellant was taken on remand to bring to light from him the crime episode. Record, also, reveals that co-convict Bashir Ahmed was taken on remand on three occasions and he was under lice custody for a period of nine (9) days in three terms, three days in each term. Judicial confessional statement was recorded by PW 3 on 13.12.1999 wherein the recovery event had been disclosed. Strange enough to note that before Judicial confessional statement recovery episode of skeleton of Motahar Member had been carried on. The cart went ahead of the horse and this casts a serious doubt in respect of truthfulness of prosecution case in respect of bridgment of convict-appellant in commission of crime. The recovery of skeleton of Motahar Member at the alleged pointing of convict-appellant along with co-convict Bashir Ahmed cannot be depicted as corroborative evidence to judicial confessional statement of co-convict Bashir Ahmed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdus Salam @ Biplob Vs The State 13 BLT (HCD)-567</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-164</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The accused Mafizuddin was arrested on 22.08.1997 and he was produced before the recording Magistrate on 24.08.1997 and there is no explanation for delay in producing the condemned prisoner Mafizuddin before the recording Magistrate within the specified time —The High Court Division opined that it is unsafe to rely on such confessional statement to convict accused Mafizuddin since same has been recorded after detaining him in police custody beyond the period permitted by law.

The cardinal question is now before us as to whether this statement bear any truthfulness since her statement was not corroborated by any P.Ws there by it lost of her credibility in its true sense— the statement of convict appellant made under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal procedure casts serious doubt about the truthfulness as well as genuineness of the alleged statement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Joshana @ Reshma Vs.

If the facts and circumstances surrounding the making of a confession appear to fling a doubt on the voluntariness and truthfulness of the confession, the court is to refuse to act upon the confession, even if, it is admissible in evidence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mujibor Rahman Vs The State 14 BLT (HCD)-109</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-164</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Judicial confessional statement of convict appellant was recorded when he was taken on remand by the police for the second time for a period of 3 days. Order dated 25.11.1990 passed by Chief Metropolitan Magistrate demonstrates that the convict-appellant was sick and order for proper medical treatment was recorded. The question now is what this sickness was? Answer must be "sickness was on account of torture carried out and third degree method used by Police upon convict-appellant." Thus, it can be evidently said that Judicial confessional statement was neither true nor voluntary and no conviction can be awarded on the strength of confessional statement which was not free, true and voluntary.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mujibor Rahman Vs The State 14 BLT (HCD)-109</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-164</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Recording a Confessional Statement of a Sick Person</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The observations of the Magistrate clearly show that though Mamun had difficultly in talking because of his illness at that time, he was in a position to have clear understanding and to make statements. In our view there is no legal bar in recording a confessional statement of a sick person. However the law requires the recording Magistrate to assess the situation as a whole including the makes ability to understand the implication of what he is saying and to decide whether or not to certify the valuntriness and the truth of statement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

It is evident from the form that there are some other vacant spaces and it was not filled up carefully. It appears from the translation of the printed questions appears to have been made not properly. From the form of the recording statement, it is clear that the Magistrate did not state when she started recording the statement. How much time she allowed the accused for reflection. So on scrutiny of the above confessional statement, it is difficult for us to hold that the same were recorded in full compliance with the provision of 164 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that the same is not voluntary and true. Hence the trial court appears to have committed gross illegality in accepting the confessional statement as voluntary and true.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bashar &amp; Ors Vs. the State 15 BLT (HCD)-391</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-164</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Exculpatory in nature It is also evident from the 164 statement of the accused that the confessing accused did not take any active part in the commission of offence. He categorically stated that " ???? ??? ?? ???? ????? ??????? ????” So, it is clear that the confessional statement is exculpatory in nature and as such the same cannot be used against the maker of the same.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bashar &amp; Ors Vs. the State 15 BLT (HCD)-391</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-164 read with Evidence Act, 1872 Section-25</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A confession made to a police officer must be ruled out of evidence even if it was made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate as the terms of section 25 are not qualified or controlled by section 26.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bura Yunus &amp; Ors Vs.

Confessional statement of an accused can be relied upon for the purpose of conviction and no further corroboration is necessary if it relates to the confessing accused himself provided it is voluntary and, also, free. Voluntary means that one who makes it out of his own free will inspired by the sound of his own conscience to speak BLT the truth. Such confession are made mostly out of a thirst to speak the truth. A free and voluntary confession deserves highest credit, because it is presumed to flow from highest sense of guilt. If the Court believes that the confession is voluntary and free, there is no legal bar on the Court for ordering conviction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

If the prosecution fells that those may be interpolated they may pray for keeping those in the safe custody of the trial court. These statement are vital documents and these cannot be withheld from the defence. These may be necessary for the defence to make out their own case. The accused has every right to look into these statements before any hearing takes place. For the ends of justice and for transparency in the trial these documents cannot be withheld and what has been done in the present case cannot be supported by any stretch of imagination. The prosecution in such a case is bound to send the statements recorded under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure along with the police report to the trial court. They cannot withhold these. We fail to understand why in this case the prosecution is playing hide and seek. The attitude of the prosecuting agencies is far from satisfactory. If the prosecution wants transparency in the trial they must come with clean hands. Any withholding of such documents will definitely affect the result of the case and this will cause prejudice to the defence. It appears that hearing under section 265 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of the petitioners of Criminal Petition No. 69 of 2000 is yet to be completed and in such circumstances before that date the originals should be produced before the trial court and if the prosecution fails to produce those the court may take adverse view on the genuineness or otherwise of the statements.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Major (Retd.)

In that view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove at accused Sirajul Islam has made any extra judicial confession in the manner as stated by it and that the defence version is more probable than that of the prosecution. The learned Sessions Judge has totally ignored the inconsistent statements of P.Ws.l, 2, 3 and 12 as regards their stories that the accused Sirajul has made extra judicial confession in their presence and convicted the condemned prisoner on the basis of his inconsistent extra judicial confession.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>State Vs.

On death reference High Court Division confirmed the death sentence. Appellate Division commuted it to one of life imprisonment.

A fine is a kind of financial punishment as distinguished from physical punishment and it must, therefore, be paid by the counvict under all normal circumstances. The accused has no option to plead that he will undergo imprisionment for a term fixed be the Court in lien of payment of the fine. If the accused is allowed to exercise his option, he can easily avoid the payment of fine by undergoing imprisonment for a fixed term for default in payment of fine and thereby frustrate the very purpose of impositions of the fine and defeat legislative intent. Fine being a charge upon the property of a convict as a public due, it continues to be so even after his death and it is recoverable from his successor-in-interest under the provisions of Section-386 C.P.C. A duty is cast upon the trial court to ensure recovery of the fine as promptly as possible.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Ali Hossain &amp; Ors. Vs.

In case of an Assistant Sessions Judge passes any sentence not exceeding five years, the convict may appeal to the Court of Sessions. Only exception is that if a person is convicted under section 124 A of the Penal Code by a Magistrate, his appeal lies to the High Court Division.

Where, however, the facts alleged by the prosecution do not amount to an offence the plea of guilty of an accused cannot stand in the way of his acquittal an section 412 of the Code cannot bar an appeal from his conviction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Skeikh Mujibur Rahman @ Razibulla &amp; Ors.

This on confers a general right of appeal and thought the co-accused can only appeal as to his conviction and not as to his sentence, yet the other accused can appeal as to both.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ayar @ Ayaruddin &amp; Ors Vs.

Aleya Begum &amp; Ors. 6 BLT (HCD)-90</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section- 423</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If it is found that the accused had suffered a substantial part of the sentence imposed upon him or her in the mistrial, the Court may not for ends of justice direct a retrial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is no question that the court has undoubted right to direct a retrial where there has not been a trial in accordance with law. We are of the view that having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and particularly in view of the fact that in the meantime (During pendency of appeal in this Court) the appellant has continued to suffer imprisonment, it is a fit and proper case in which the High Court Division should consider the case on merit also and then pass whatever order or orders it thinks appropriate in the interest of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Asiman Begum Vs.

Further, the prosection should not be given a change to fill up its lacuna by bringing new evidence which it did not or could not produce in the first trial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Asiman Begum Vs. The State 7BLT (AD)-133</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-423 read with Children Act, 1974 Sections-6 and 66(1)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the scrutiny of the record, we find some redeeming features and vital facts record to find that the question of accused appellant of being a child within meaning of the Children Act, 1974 unfortunately the defence did not prop and specifically did not press the is before the learned Tribunal urging upon ' to direct an enquiry to ascertain as whether he comes within any exception entitling him not be tried by the Tribunal the usual course, and the learned Spec Tribunal trialed him and convicted him, we find from the charge sheet that accused appellant Md. Monir Hossain 14-15 years on the day of submitting charge sheet against him on 24.09.1998. It also found form order No.6 dated 22.12.1998 from the order sheet of the S that the prayer for the accused appellant specifically grounded on the question of being a 'minor'. In the facts of the case, found that the question of the accused appellant of being a child was before learned Tribunal  although not specific pressed for an answer. Since the convict against the accused appellant is one imprisonment for life and the age of accused appellant on the date of framing charges against him is a matter of importance touching the jurisdiction of Court, we fee find it necessary in the interest of justice that the learned Special Tribunal should direct an enquire to satisfy himself to whether accused appellant Md.

Against  the said judgment and order of acquittal, the State filed government appeal before the High Court Division. In such circumstances it will not be fair and reasonable to put the appellants behind the prison bar when they have already got an order of acquittal from competent court after a full-fledged trial. It may also be mentioned that as a measure of punishment bail should not be refused in case when an order of acquittal has been passed appellants are entitled to bail.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Hafiz Howlader &amp; Ors Vs.

It was observed in that case that in an appeal against a short sentence (2 years ringorous imprisonment as in the present case) bail should be ordinarily granted in the exercise of a proper discretion because usually it takes time to hear the appeal and within passage of the Period of sentence the appappeal becomes infructuous.

The learned Judges failed to consider that a minor's refusal to go with her father is not at all a material consideration regarding her custody.

She was put to judicial custody by the learned Magistrate in April. 1997 when she was produced before him. Since then she has been staying in a prison house except for a few days when she came out therefrom on getting adinterim bail from the High Court Division. It is entirely unacceptable that a young girl who is an innocent victim of the alleged offence should remain in an unwholesome atmosphere of a jail for an indefinite period. It is not known when the trial will conclude which, we have been informed, has however, started. The young girl cannot be allowed to walk away from the prison house of her own, because she has not independent place to stay. The parties have not been able to provide any answer to our query whether she could be put in a safe neutral home pending disposal of the case. The welfare of the girl, in our opinion, should be the deciding factor in such a situation. The appellant produced a certificate from the school where the girl was reading which corroborates the statement of the appellant that his daughter was a minor at the relevant time. The radiologists opinion also supports the appellants case. Having considered all aspects of the matter we are satisfied that it will be fit and proper and in the best interest of the girl if she is released from custody and given to the care of her father.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bashu Dev Chatterje Vs.

In such a situation the opinion of the girl who is a minor is irrelevant. The minor's refusal to go with her father the appellant is not at all a material consideration.

Assistant Public Prosecutor filed an application for] withdrawal of the Prosecution against the accused petitioner-Learned Sessions Judge by an order, rejected the petitioner for withdrawal on the grounds inter alia that there was no material before the Government for withdrawal from the] prosecution that the petitioner was at that time a fugitive from law, that the order of the Government was mala fide- Held: I appears that both the High Court Division and the learned Sessions Judge applied the independent minds in considering whether in the circumstances of the case the government's decision to withdraw from prosecution is immune from interference not.

It appears that before start of the trial, the special public prosecutor prayed for withdrawal from the prosecution—the government's order does not contain anything that there was consideration by the authority of the materials before taking the decision for the withdrawal. The only word used for the withdrawal is — It is well settled that the consent mentioned in Section-494 of the Code of Criminal procedure is not to be given mechanically. The court is to exercise its function judicially before giving such consent which implies that the Court will have to examine the materials on which the Government decides withdrawal of a case. In the instant case no reason/ground has been assigned for the withdrawal of the case and there is no indication that materials were considered before taking the decision and the Division Special Judge committed illegality in allowing withdrawal under the aforesaid circumstances.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Srimati Protiva Rani Dey (Tirtha)Vs.

Though the section does not circumscribe the powers of the public prosecutor, the essential consideration which is implicit to accord consent is that it should be in the interest of administration of justice. It is either that the prosecution will not be able to produce sufficient evidence in support of the charge or that it will be difficult to predicate, on information as revealed subsequently would falsify the evidence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

It is also found from the record that driver Rahim recognized the accused in the T.I. Parade. Although subsequently he made contradictory statements about recognition of accused in the T.I. Parade and sworn an affidavit before the Notary Public. The truth or falsity of this document will be gone into at the trial. This affidavit cannot have any] bearing at the present moment in considering the question of bail of the accused respondent. Further, we also find that the accused respondent was found last in the company of the deceased just 45 minutes before the occurrence and this statement was also supported by other witnesses in their statements under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. That part, in the FIR there is also a mention of clear motive of the murder.

All persons charged with non-bail-able offences must be treated equally unless, of course, there are spec: circumstances   which   need spec' consideration in a particular facts of a ca Granting of anticipatory  bail is extraordinary remedy and as such in the c of accusations of non-bail-able offences anticipatory bail should not be granted the person should be directed to seek under Section 497 of the Code of Crimial procedure. The discretion of granting anticipatory bail shall not be exercised in unscrupulous and frivolous petitions just to avoid the Normal legal procedure. On vague and general allegations anticipatory bail should not be granted which will make a short circuit of judicial administration and will help the commission of further offences in the society. Anticipatory bail should be granted by the High Court Division for a limited period or till filling of the charge sheet, whichever is appropriate in the circumstances of the case. After expiry of the period or filing of the charge sheet, as the case may be, the accused must appear before the court concerned and obtain fresh bail from the Court on the merit of the case.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

The "appearance" before "Court" as contemplated under Section 497 (1) of The Code is definitely not "High Court Division". "Appearance" before "Court", thus, cannot be construed as "appearance" before "High Court Division" and is to be construed as "appearance" before "High Court Division" and is to be construed as "appearance" before "Magistrate". The High Court Division, therefore, does not possess power under Section 497 of The Code of grant bail to an accused person when he/she appears on surrender.

Before granting bail in a non-bailable case, the court when the case is at the investigation stage, should take into consideration various matters such as the nature and seriousness of the offence, the character of the evidence in support of the prosecution, the severity of the punishment to which the accused may be subjected, the danger of the accused abusing the concession of bail by way absconding and tampering with the evidence, the larger interest of the public or the state, whether the grant of bail would thwart the course of justice and similar other considerations. None of the above considerations is a sufficient reason for the grant of bail but any one those considerations can be a good ground for the refusal of bail.

When fresh bail was rejected this Division was moved and leave was granted and at the time of granting leave ad interim bail was granted to the appellants and now there is no allegation of misuse of privilege of bail.

Moreover, the deceased was killed in her husband's house and naturally on that moment the husband was the best custodian and he is suppose to know the cause of death of the deceased, but the story narrated in the U.D. case which was ended in the final report creates presumption about the implication of petitioner in the occurrence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Azam Reza Vs.

Even though a Gazette Notification was published showing accused Ramizuddin to be an absconding accused and ordering his trial in absentia, there is absolutely no material to show that accused Ramizuddin had any knowledge about the proceeding even since it was started against him, as at all material times he was abroad. There are also no materials to support the informant- petitioner's allegations that accused- respondent Ramizuddin contested the informant-petitioner's various applications at any time he was abroad- In that view of the matter we do not think that the discretion exercised by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, affirmed by the High Court Division, calls for our interference.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Nimar Ali Vs.

But on 03.01.2000 when his petition for recalling the said witness was taken up he merrily remained absent in the court and thus allowed the application to be rejected on the ground that the engaged lawyer was found absent on call—we are of the view that in the ends of justice a chance may be given to the accused appellants to get cross examination of the witnesses examined by the prosecution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shamsul Haque Ladu &amp; Anr.

The State 5 BLT (HCD)-155</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-561A</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The first F. I. R. which was lodged at Shan Thana on 19.4.90 ended in charge-sheet dated 17.3.90 and the accused persons which included the present petitioners were on trial before the learned Additional Sessions Judge under section 395/397 of the Code which ended in the conviction of petitioners. The second F. I. R. which lodged with Nalcity Police Station also ended in charge sheet which was submitted 12.89 and the present petitioners were paced on trial before the learned Special Tribunal under section 19(a) and (f) of the Arms Act. On application for quashing of the proceedings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Held: It appears that the facts alleged in the present case are precisely those facts which have been alleged by the prosecution in the earlier dacoity case. During continuation of the investigation the I. O. recovered the rifle which was taken away by the petitioners and that was the alamat of the dacoity case. It is not the case of the prosecution that independent of the taken away of the rifle, the present fire arm was recovered from the possession of these petitioners. The recovery of the rifle by the Inspector was a part of the investigation of the dacoity case and there is no independent occurrence or acts in the recovery of the rifle- The second trial which is sought to be quashed is involving the offence punishable under section 19(a) of the Arms Act. But as this case occurred during the same transaction or arose from the same facts already decided by the Sessions Judge this cannot be allowed to be proceeded further as there is an express prohibition under section 403(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Apart from the prohibition against double jeopardy in this section. Article 35 of the Constitution also has the similar prohibition. So reading the provisions of section 403(1) (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure together there can be no doubt that in the facts and circumstances of the case the second trial appeared to us to be unwarranted. Though the second trial that is the present proceeding is with respect of different offences that is recovery of fire­arms but that arose out of the same transaction which was the subject matter of the dacoity case which ended in conviction of the petitioners though the charge-sheet has been submitted under section 19(a) of the Arms Act but the fact remains that the recovered fire arms is the subject matter of the earlier case for which the petitioners ought to have been charge under the appropriate section of the Penal Code for possessing the alamats of dacoity which has not been done into a separate proceeding has been initiated by the prosecution- we hold that the proceeding is illegal.

That being so, it must be said that the application of the petitioners before the High Court Division under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure was wholly misconceived.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

It is a case of public interest where there is allegation of overt act against the police personnel posted in the Court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and in the interest of transparency and visible administration of justice there is no impediment to a judicial inquiry as ordered by the High Court Division.

We have noticed that in the FIR the informant stated that his daughter was 17 years old and was a student of second year of Higher Secondary Certificate. In course of investigation of the case, the victim made a statement under Section-164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure wherein she stated that she was 18 years old. In the Kabinnama, her age has been mentioned as 19 years old. The occurrence took place of 16.11.1993 and at present, the victim is about 25 years old. Considering all these aspects, we are of the opinion that victim Nasima Aktar was not below 18 years old at the time of occurrence and therefore, the allegations made in the FIR do not attract Section-366A of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have also noticed the statement of the informant made before us that his daughter Nasima Aktar is now an expectant mother. Since the informant, father of victim, has accepted the marriage condisering the welfare of his daughter, although the offence charge in non-compoundable, we feel that the ends of justice will be secured if we accept the prayer made by the informant and record an order of compounding the offence. On the contrary, if we reject the prayer entail unnecessary harassment to the parties. Law encourages composition of offences and in the instant case we feel it necessary for carrying out the other provisions of the Code and also for doing justice for prevention abuse of the process of the court by invoking the inherent powers of the court —Accordingly we accept the application filed by the informant for compounding the offence and it is allowed for the interest of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shajedul Alam Chowdhury Vs.

Only on receipt of the report by the  police he came to the conclusion that the offence as alleged in the petition complaint is triable by the Special Tribunal under the Special Powers Act —Held : this case there was no illegality irregularity on the part of the learned Magistrate in taking steps under Section 200/202/190 of the Code on receipt of the petition of complaint and since he sent the records of the case along with the police report to the Special Tribunal, the Special Tribunal also rightly took cognizance of the offence under Section-27(l)(2) of the Special Powers Act—the petition under Section-561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure is misconceived.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Golam Rahman Vs.

Where the question of the custody of property like vessel in the present case, we are of the opinion that Magistrate instead of entering into investigating the title of the rival claimants, it is his duty to decide expeditiously who is the person prima facie entitled to possession thereof and handover its possession to him for avoiding great loss that has sustained when it was kept unused, for sustained when it was kept unused, for ensuring the vessel in the same condition as it was at the time of its seizure and to produce before the court as and required.

There is nothing in the FIR that at the time of taking loan in the petitioner made any promise with the complainant that he will return the money within a specific time or of date and we also do not find any allegation of inducement for getting the loan money from the complainant. Rather we find from the FIR that the accused took the money from the informant as loan for business purpose as such in the allegation we do not find any ingredient of instrustment or that the money was taken with any specific promise or inducement.

According to the accused, they were given entire termination benefits on calculation — Held : The complainants may take recourse to such remedies when the entitlement of complainants are ascertained, Since the Labour Court passed general order conferring termination benefits, it has no Jurisdiction to determine the quantum under section 26 of the employment of Labour (Standing orders) Act, 1965,. It can punish an offender for refusal or failure to comply with a definite order of ascertained sum. The complainants in the instant cases instead of proceeding under Section 26 of the Employment of Labour (Standing Orders) Act, which is the only provision applicable in their cases made the complaints under different sections including  Section  55  of the Industrial Relations Ordinance which is altogether different and the said provision is not at all applicable in the face and circumstances the case.

This is why in the absence of any direct witness a well-knit chain of circumstances excluding all reasonable hypotheses of the innocence of the accused may alone form the basis of conviction against an accused. In our case under review, the vital circumstances surrounding the story of rape allegedly committed by accused Mansur Ali on victim Sufia Begum before the very eyes of Monowara Begum is by no means a matter which is amenable to reason and prejudice. It is unfortunate that this vital circumstantial evidence escaped the attention of the learned Special Tribunal while convincing the accused appellant on a charge of grave offence involving rape, for the facts and circumstances of the case an the inconsistencies and contradictions in evidence of the P.Ws. regarding condition of victim Sufia Beg immediately after the occurrence made wide room for doubts regarding the guilt the accused appellant. The inordinate del in lodging the FIR has not also b satisfactorily proved by the prosecution which makes the prosecution case worse, am, therefore, inclined to hold that prosecution has not been able to prove charge against the accused appellant beyond reasonable  doubts  and  the accused therefore entitled to the benefit of doubt</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mansur Ali Bepari Vs.

We have already found earlier that this P.W. 8 failed to state as to when he visited the project in question nor he has come with any measurement book showing pre-measurement and post-measurement of the project in question. So, anything claimed by the prosecution regarding the completion of the project in question or alleged misappropriation of the wheat in question deserves no consideration without any proof about the pre-measurement and post-measurement of the project in question and since P.W. 8 the Project Implementation Officer who was in charge of the project in question failed to state as to when he visited the project in question and there being no scrap of paper to show the measurement and post-measurement of the project in question we are led to hold that the prosecution has hopelessly failed to prove about the alleged work done by the accused persons in respect of the project in questions. So the allegation of misappropriation of the wheat in question cannot be conceived of.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, it appears that the accused appellant, for the reason best known to them have deposited the claimed amount and as such there is no scope to hold the accused-appellants guilty for the offence</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

This burden is a bit lighter than that of the prosecution, because the court is to consider his plea only after the prosecution leads evidence in support of the charge, and not before.

In the first place, the accused should be unknown to the identifying witness by name, secondly he must not having had any opportunity to see the accused after the occurrence in connection with which he is put up for identification and thirdly the identifying witness makes no mistake, except to a most negligible character, in matter of identification. If the accused w known to the witness by name from before of occurrence he would disclose the name the accused immediately after occurrence and at any rate to Investigating Officer and in that case question of his figuring as a witness in a T.I. parade will not arise. His identification the known accused in a test identification parade will thus become meaningless and similarly if the witness has had an opportunity to see the accused after the commission of the crime in relation to which the latter is put up for identification there will be no difficulty on the part of the witness to pick up the suspect from among any number of persons. If a witness makes a mistake in identifying a person placed in the T.I. parade, there is no guarantee that a similar mistake will not be committed by him with regard to other suspects. It may not be out of place to mention here that the delay which matters in a T.I. parade is the delay from the date of occurrence and not from the date of arrest of the accused as human memory fades with lapse of time and when the T.I. parade is held after long delay horn the time of commission of crime, the chances to mistake increases.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mirja Abdul Hakim &amp; Ors.

Apart from this, all the eye witnesses stated that both the informant party and the accused came from the same village. Behula and the eye witnesses were also from the same village. All these eye witnesses stated that they knew Ful Mia from before. That apart, it is in the evidence of the eye witness that accused Ful Mia was also taking at the relevant time with them. So there can be no difficulty in recognizing the accused who was known from before. The learned Single Judge disbelieved the story of recognition primarily because the investigating officer did not seize the lantern from the shop of P. W. 2 Akkel Ali. It is very surprising that non- seizure of the lantern can be a material consideration for holding that the eye witnesses could not recognize the accused at the time of occurrence.

But none of the P.Ws including the victim Habibur Rahman himself did not state that the accused appellant ever kidnapped him or looted away the money in question. It appears that there is a reservation in the FIR that accused appellant Liakat Ali was with the two other accused persons who kidnapped Habibur Rahman. But during trial save and except a formal statement about fastening of the mouth of the victim Habibur Rahman by Gamsa/towel by the accused appellant there is no other evidence whatsoever in the matter of kidnapping the victim Habibur Rahman or looting of money from his room. P.Ws. 7 and 8 who have categorically said about recovery of the victim Estemera from the nearby house are totally silent about the connection of the accused appellant Liakat Ali. It further appears that none of the close neighours who have admittedly got their houses by the four sides of the P.W. house have not been examined in this case. The non examination of those neighbours in this case together with absence of towel/Gamsa which was allegedly fastened by the accused Liakat in the mouth of the victim Habibur Rahman at the time of his kidnapping has made the entire prosecution case suspicious and in their absence the benefit of Section-114(g) of the Evidence Act must go in favour of the defence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mohd.

In this case besides the oral evidence the prosecution also relied upon the circumstantial evidence. Admittedly Niru died at the house of this condemned-prisoner, her husband and naturally there cannot be any eye witness of the occurrence from the side of her father nor the someone from the house of the condemned-prisoner would depose in support of the murder or on the factum of assault by this prisoner upon the deceased. In such a situation the prosecution had no other alternative but to rely on the circumstantial evidence. In such circumstances when the wife met with her death while she was in the custody of her husband it is he who is to explain how she met with her death. The defence tried to impress that she was assaulted at her father's house by her relations who thereafter kept her forcibly at the house of this condemned-prisoner but none of the prosecution witnesses or even D. W. 1 has admitted this. No other defence witness was examined to prove this defence version of the case. According to the defence she was kept in the house of the condemned-prisoner at the date of occurrence which he stated in his statement recorded under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He also stated that he saw his wife in injured condition. But he took no step for her treatment or inform any of the co-villager of the incident. It appears that he allowed his wife to die and even after her death he has not informed any of the co-villager or reported the matter to the police which is admittedly at a distance of 3 kilometers from his house. None of the inmates of the house also informed the police or took any medical help for saving the life of the deceased suggested that she was assaulted by the prosecution witnesses but no evidence was led in support of this suggestion.

A suggestion was given to P.W. 6 that Meherunnessa and her son Sibu were not present. Meherunnessa was not convicted for murder. As regards Sibu, P.W. 2 stated that she saw him. Therefore the complicity of appellants in the murder of Dhan Mia been established by the prosecution beyond any doubt. The prosecution also has been able to prove the first circumstance support of the prosecution case deceased Dhan Mia along with P.Ws. went to his father-in-law's house to bring wife Moina. P.W. 2 has satisfactorily proved that she stayed in that house and that she been all the accused at night in the east hut, thus is he second circumstance prove against the accused. After the murder of Dhan Mia, the accused got a false lodged through Meherun Nessa with the police stating that Dhan Mia committed suicide with malafide intention of screening them (accused) from legal punished although they believed that the information given to the police was false. This is another circumstance P.W. 11 holding examination on the persons of deceased found injuries and clearly opined that the death was due to the said injuries, the defence could not satisfactory explanation as to how Dhan sustained such injuries.

Moreover, P.W. 17 found only one injury causing the death and that injury was caused by the appellant and the search for money was also made by the appellant as per the confessions then how the confessions could be treated to be inculpatory. As stated earlier, the Court found that there is not an iota of evidence on record from any of the witnesses examined by the prosecution implicating the appellant with the offence or any other accused persons.

From his evidence it cannot be found that P.W. 1 sustained injury by an explosive substance. The Investigating Officer also failed to get the injury and the shirt of P.W. 1 examined by an expert to find out whether P.W. 1 sustained injury by explosive sub-stance.

Concept of "possession" under The Act of 1908 or The Act of 1878 connotes an element of consciousness in the person charged with the offence -Control in section 4(b) means that the accused must have such power over explosive substances that he can direct its custody, production, use or disposal in some mariner. "Control" in context means power or ability to regulate the keeping or possession or use to endanger life and cause serious injury to a person or property -Possession or control essential to constitute an offence under section 4(b), thus, must be "conscious possession" and "effective control" over explosive substances to endanger life or to cause serious injury to person or property.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Muhibur Rahman Manik &amp; Anr Vs.

The concerned doctors in the Board ought to have given their utmost attention as experts on the physical and pathological condition of each parts of the body and to give their considered medical opinion in respect of any abnormality in the concerned limbs with possible explanation for such abnormality. An omnibus statement that the death was due to shock and hemorrhage as a result of injuries mentioned above, are not enough and not expected from the medical persons who are presumed to be experts. They ought to be specific in their findings and to the point in indicating the abnormalities found in each part of body. In this case, their own report ought to have put them on alert that this might be a case of rape, as such, necessary further investigation ought to have been done by them. But unfortunately, the board did not even consider it necessary to examine the discharge from vagina by a chemical examiner. This only highlights their inefficiency and indifference to their professional work.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs. Md.

The conferment of this very power on the informant has recognized the informant/ complainant as an aggrieved party, no doubt. So, my view is that by no stretch of imagination can the complainants or informants be excluded from the category of "?????????" or "aggrieved party" as stated in section 28 of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 .</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Nannu Miah Vs The State &amp; Ors 13 BLT (HCD) 245</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain (Amended) 2003</u></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-11(Ga) read with Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 Section-561A</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Allegation that informant's Husband with Be active help of the Petitioners (Husband's brother and Sister) assaulted on her with intent to cause her miscarriage which caused simple injury on her Person After  completing  investigation Police recommending for discharging the present accused petitioner's from allegations as because during investigation police could gather any sorts of tangible evidence to connect this petitioner's -Held; we are of the view that there is no clear evidence or legal basis to justify the order of taking cognizance so far it relates to the accused petitioners under Section 11 (Ga) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain (Amended) 2003 ignoring the police report under section 173 Cr.P.C.-Rule is made absolute.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Jannatul Ferdous</em></strong> <strong><em>@ Kushum &amp; Anr Vs.

It is settled that father as the well wisher of a minor daughter is entitled to her custody and a minor in her own interest should be given to her father's custody. It also decided by the Appellate Division that any observation made by the minor girl is a victim of a offence of abduction and rape and it is not at all desirable that she should be kept in jail for a long and indefinite period which will be detrimental to her welfare.

No retrospective effect has been or could be given the aforesaid Ain which provides for trial of the pending cases under the repealed Ain by the Tribunals constituted thereunder as if the same has not been repealed.

A common intention presupposes prior concert, which requires a prearranged plan of the accused participating in an offence.

Ruhul Amin, J: In a case of conspiracy there must be prima facie evidence that a person was a party to the conspiracy before his act can be used against his co-conspirators. A conspirators acts and declarations are admissible against other conspirators on the same principle as the act or declarations of an agent are receivable against his principle. Strict proof of conspiracy is not necessary. The provision of law is that there should be reasonable ground to believe that the prisoner and the persons whose acts, statements or writings are sought to be given in evidence have conspired to commit an offence, Section 10 of the Evidence Act is intended to admit evidence of communications between different conspirators while the conspiracy was going on with reference to the carrying out of conspiracy, but it is not intended by the law as in section 10 of the Evidence Act to admit in evidence the confession of a co-accused, and put it on the same footing as communications passing between the conspirator or between a conspirator and other Evidence of declaration acts or writings of a conspirator is admissible against other conspirators on the principles that the thing done, written or spoken was something done in carrying out the conspiracy and was receivable as a step in proof of conspiracy. Criminal courts, on less than Civil Courts, exits for the administration of justice, and courts of both descriptions have inherent power to mould the procedure, subject to the statutory provisions applicable to the matter in hand, to enable them to discharge their functions as courts of justice. From this point of view that the overt acts may properly be looked to as evidence of the existence of a concerted intention, indeed, the conspiracy is usually closed bound up with the overt acts, because in many cases it is only by means of the overt acts that the existence of the conspiracy can be made out. The gist of offence of conspiracy lies not in doing the act or effecting the purpose for which the conspiracy is formed, not in attempting to do any of the acts nor inducing others to do any of the acts nor inducing others to do them but in the forming of the scheme or agreement between the parties conspiracy is a matter of inference reduced from certain criminal acts of the parties accused, done in pursuance of an apparent criminal purpose common between them. The offence of conspiracy under section 120B of the Penal Code is one which requires detailed and specific proof against each other of the accused that he individually participated in a particular design to do a particular criminal thing. In order to establish the charge of conspiracy the prosecution has to prove an agreement between the persons charged to do an illegal act. Agreement can be inferred from over acts and conduct. If it is proved that persons charged pursued by their acts the same object. One performing one part and the other performing another part with a view to attaining the object they were justified. The bare fact of associations with persons who were party to a criminal conspiracy is not of itself a sufficient foundation for the conviction of that person on a charge of conspiracy. There must be something to show that the association was of a suspicious character. There is no difference between the mode of proof of the offence of conspiracy and that of any other offence, it can be established by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence. The law requires specific proof against each of the conspirators participating in particular design to do a particular criminal thing. Unless a detailed and specific proof against each of the accused that they participated in a particular design to do a particular thing has been established, there can be no conviction under Sec. 120B. It is going a little too far to say that since they were all together they must have had a common object therefore they must have previous)}1 come to an agreement amongst themselves to commit the crimes. Mere evidence of association is not sufficient for an inference of conspiracy. In a  case of criminal conspiracy it is not necessary to prove that a conspirator was aware to all the acts his fellow conspirators committed in pursuance of the conspiracy. Since conspiracy is often hatched up in utmost secrecy it is impossible! to prove conspiracy by direct evidence. It] has often than not. to be inferred form the acts,! statements and conduct of the parties to their conspiracy, Thus if it is proved that the! accused pursued, by their acts, the same object by the same means one performing one part of the act and the other part of the same act so as to complete it with a view to attainment of the object which they were pursuing, the courts is at liberty to draw the inference that they conspired together t effect the object, It should, however, he remembered that where there is no direct evidence, for example through the evidence of an approver, and the case for the prosecution is dependent on circumstantial evidence alone, it is necessary for the prosecution to prove and establish sue circumstances as would lead to the only conclusion of a criminal conspiracy and rule out the theory of innocence. The prosecution is required  to  prove  the  charge of  conspiracy by cogent evidence, direct or circumstantial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per M. Fazlul Karim, J: From the character of the crime conspiracy, there may not be any dir evidence to establish the same but certain, specific facts, circumstances and material or record may lead such inference which leads to irresistible conclusion the occurrence was due to conspiracy who has been hatched up by different person different places.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per A.B. M. Khairul Haque, J:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The ingredient of the offence of criminal conspiracy are as follows :</p><p> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">I. There must be an agreement between two or more persons, a meeting minds, nor mere consensus.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">II. The said agreement is for doing an illegal act or by an act by illegal means.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A criminal conspiracy by its very nature is of secretive in character. There would hardly be and direct evidence of the evil design of the conspirator. The conspiracy can only be inferred from the circumstances and gathered from the depositions of the witnesses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It appears from the evidence on record |hat the entire Army, the Navy, the Air Force were loyal to the Government, only the troops from the 1st Bengal Lancer Regiment and 2nd Field Artillery Regiment ted by a handful of disgruntled officers committed the dastardly crime (P.W. 44, 45) Those disgruntled officers were also alive to such a threat to them. They were aware of the presence of Rakhi Bahini, the BDR, and the Police also. As such they took two steps immediately after the killings. Major Rashid rushed to the house of P.W. 44 Col. Safyet Jamil, Commander 46 Brigade and told him, not to take any action in respect of killing of the President of Bangladesh, more in the tone of command than in submission and the show of strength exhibited by Major Farook when he appeared with 4 (four) tanks in the Head Quarter of 1st Bengal Regiment. The purpose was to demoralize the Brigade (P.W. 44) and it had the desired result. The top brass of the Army was stunned and so much frozen that no action could immediately be taken by them. Although three infantry battalions remained 'stand to' in the meantime, Major Dalim started his announcements on the Radio about the murder of the President and taking over of power by the Army under the leadership of Khondaker Mostaq.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Brigadier Dastagir from Chittagong wanted to declare on the Radio that they would protect the Constitution and defy the Government under Khondaker Moataq (P.W. 47) in his cross examination). This was also a real possibility, not only from Chittagong but from other places also. It appears that this aspect was not overlooked by the accused persons. That was the reason the three Chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force were forced to read their oath of allegiance on the Radio, followed by the BDR and Police Chief.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It may be noted that rushing of all the accused to the Radio Station was not a mere coincidence but it had also an important purpose on the canvass of the grand scheme. The conspirators knew very well that mere killing of the President and others would not do. The armed forces and the people at large were also made to realize that the entire armed forces were behind the conspirators and the new Government. That was why the plan in respect of the Radio Station was so very important Major Ahmed Sharful Hossain (A-7) was the first person to reach the Radio Station with his tank at about 4-30 in the morning of 15th August and took control of the Radio Station (P.W. 14) Major Shahrior (A-2) went to the Radio Station at about 5-30 A.M. Major Dalim (A-6) rached there at about 5-30 so also Major A.M. Rashed Chowdhury (A-8) Captain Abdul Majed also reached the Radio Station at that time. Major Shahrior (A-2), Major A.M. Rahsed Chowdhury (A-8) Major Ahmed Sharful Hossain (A-7), Major Abdul Majed did not fire a shot or were engaged in any overt act but they by being indoctrinated by the fiery speeches of Major Farrok (A-l), Major Rashid (A-4), Major Dalim (A-6) allowed themselves to be brought into the web of conspiracy in furtherance of their common intention to achieve the objects of the said common intention, went to the Radio Station in order to stand and wait and also to lend their services to the other conspirators as and when needed. Otherwise those abovementioned 4 (Four) officers had no reason or plausible explanation to be in the Radio Station in the early morning at 4-30 to 5-30 on 15th August. The defence on behalf of Major Shahrior that he was on an Interned Security Duty (ISD) or that he got a fresh appointment on that early morning are all myths and abhorrent of common sense. Similarly, Lt. Kismat Hashem and Lt. Nazmul Hossain Ansar went out of the Cantonment with their tanks. Lt. Kismat Hashem was seen in the house of the late President and Lt. Nazrul Hossain in the bend of the old Race Course or in front of the Radio Station. They were in the night parade, as such knew about the purpose of deployment of the tanks, Where they went was immaterial, the moment, they took their tanks out of the Cantonment, they were acting in furtherance of the common intention of the conspiracy no matter where they went and where they were. The purpose of deployment of tanks was to show the strength of the conspirators and also to terrorize the people. Both the objects were successfully achieved. They even terrorized the 46 Briagade (P.W 44) not to speak of the common people. The defence on behalf of Major Ahmed Sharful Hossain (A-7), Lt. Kismat Hashem (A-12 and Lt. Nazmul Hossain Ansar that they move the tanks towards the city under orders of their commanding officer is not defense. They were present in the parade ground and heard the speeches. So the purpose was no secret. The 15 Years Digest</p><p style="text-align: justify;">troops were armed, the tanks were made ready for action, anybody would understand that this was not training in and around the city. They on realizing the purpose could have pulled themselves out of the mission, instead, they went along with it in furtherance of the common intention, Similarly, the firing of the cannon shells on the house of the then President on the orders of Major Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) (A-3) shows his direct participation in the murders of the victims</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

But his previsous history of mental illness from time to time and his treatment at different places prior to the occurrence and the subsequent medical reports and opinions of the physicians, found in the records, show that the accused had been suffering from Schizophrenia. Although, no medical expert was examined in this regard but it is well known that a schizophrenic may look sombre or even apparently sober all the time but suddenly can commit acts of violence and such schizophrenic fits may not even last long always but sometimes only for few moments. But unfortunately, in this case, no Pshychiatrist was examined in Court in order to highlight the probable mental condition of the accused when he killed the victim, on the basis of the past history of mental illness of the accused and also on the basis of observations made on the accused in the Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Hospital and at the Pabna Mental Hospital no effort whatsoever was taken to ascertain the mental condition of the accused when the offence was committed in spite of revelation of his earlier history of mental illness. This is a failure on the part or the prosecution to prove the mental element of the accused when he committed the crime, Rather, the circumstances of mental illness of the accused from time to time preceding the occurrence, absence of any motive or reason to kill an unconcerned and innocent victim, his unconcerned attitude when he was apprehended immediately after the occurrence, subsequent diagnosis by the physician that he had been suffering from schizophrenia, all these facts and circumstances taken  together raise  a doubt  about the presence of mens rea, the essential ingredient of the offence of murder, in mind of the accused. This gives rise to reasonable doubt as to the guilt of accused within the meaning of Section 2 of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Nikhil Chandra Haider Vs.

All the members of unlawful assembly had knowledge the prosecution of the common object of unlawful assembly guns and other deadly weapons were to be used which might death. The accused persons were aggressors as they attacked the informant party with any provocation. From the weapons and nature of injuries received by deceased persons at the vital parts of bodies it is palpably clear that it  is a case of murder as defined under Section of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>State Vs.

Shahajahan Ali in course post mortem examination on the death body of the deceased found one cut injury and five penetrating injuries. Out of the said injuries two of them were on the chest and the cut injury was on the sub-costal region. On dissection, doctor found that both pleura injured from posteriority. Chest cavity contained full blood and both the lungs were founds injured. The defence has not at all challenged P.W. 5 that the injuries were caused with the intention of such bodily injuries to the deceased were not sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death the injuries No. 1, 3, and 4 were inflicted on the vital parts of the deceased and we are of the opinion that the injuries were caused with the intention of causing such bodily injuries which are sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the definition of murder, Exeption-1 as submitted by the learned Advocate is applicable only when there is "grave and sudden provocation inflicted the injuries neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill the deceased. The defence could not make out any case that the appellant lost the self control by the grave and sudden provocation of the deceased. Therefore exception-1 has not manner of application in this case. The case is covered my the definition of murder "3rdly" of Section-300 of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Shahidul Islam Vs.

Where there is neither intention nor knowledge nor likelihood that the injury will or can result in death, the offence would be neither murder nor culpable homicide not amounting to murder but it would be voluntarily causing grievous hurt or hurt and conviction in such case would be either under section 325 or 326 according to the nature of the weapons used or under section 323 of The Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

However to prove this fact, prosecution has produced both oral and documentary evidence. The two post mortem reports (Ext. 15 and 16) and the two inquest reports (Ext.5 and 10) on the dead bodies of the two judges clearly speak of their death from bomb blast injuries. These documents are corroborated by the testimony of the three eye witnesses namely P.W.I, the informant Driver Sultan, and by P.W.I 1 Badsha, the milk seller who went to deliver milk to the Government quarters where the vehicle carrying the judges was standing, and also by P.W. 14 peon Mannan who was standing beside the vehicle. They witnessed the bomb blast. Moreover P.W.4 Pallabi Mukharjee the wife of deceased judge Pandey, P.W. 16 Sabir Hossain and P.W. 17 Jobair, being the two brothers and owners of the neighboring shop P.W. 18 and 20, being two local residents, testified that they had gone to the place of the blast immediately after the blast, and found the two Judges with serious injuries from the bomb blast. The relevant seizure list being Ext.-7 about seizure of the intact and broken stlcno &lt;ti$  as the remnant of the blasted bomb, the seizure lists Ext.4 and 8 showing seizure of the damaged microbus and the blood stained wearing apparels of the Judge Sohel Ahmed and also of the injured peon Mannan (P.W. 14) and production of those articles in court, further reinforce the fact of the death of the two Judges from the bomb blast. We find nothing on record to disbelieve these oral and documentary evidence, which sufficiently prove the death of the judges from bomb blast.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

I. R. does not mean that Mofizuddin, Abdul Karim and Mozaffar stated to P. W. 1 that they had heard names of the assailants from the mouth of the victim or that they had been victim in his  sense.  All the witnesses examined by the prosecution to prove declaration are in erected and cannot be relied upon for m finding of guilt in a case under Sect of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

Jahanara Begum 4 BLT (AD)-240</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-302</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Does not fall within the section 302 of P. C- The High Court Division itself noticed that there were several serious juries on the body of the deceased but there is no evidence that the appellant had used more than one injury upon the deceased as noticed above. The High Court Division failed to notice that P. W. 11 the doctor had given his opinion that the death caused due to haemorrhage from all the id wounds. There is no evidence that the alleged axed blow by the appellant alone caused the death of Hyder Ali. It is, therefore, evident that the appellant could be convicted for causing the death of Hyder Ali. He could at best be held liable causing hurt with a dangerous (sharp­ing) weapon but not for causing the death of Hyder Ali.  The High Court vision, however, found that the appellant could not escape from the liability of inflicting such fatal blow which resulted in death of Hyder Ali. This again shows application of mind both to fact and The appellant was found guilty of the offence under section 302 of the Penal Code; but surprisingly at the end of the judgment the High Court Division affirmed the order of conviction and sentence as passed by the trial court forgetting altogether that the conviction of the appellant was recorded by the trial court under section 302/149 of the Penal Code which is a completely different kind of conviction from one under section 302 directly where the liability is personal and in the former case the liability is vicarious.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Altaf Hossain Vs.

He further stated that realizing the fact that those persons might kill Shahid, he asked Shahid to leave the house and whereafter informed time that he was not in the house. Next he stated that ton the date of occurrence in the afternoon he went to Gaokhali Bazar to sell paddy. At that time, he heard sound of gun fire and saw people of the bazar running helter and skelter. While he was fleeing away he found the dead body of victim Shahid under a banyan tree and thereafter he left the bazar and went back to his home- statement of accused Zakir Hossain cannot be a basis for conviction him under section 302 of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

Convict-appellants must have known that they were running the risk of causing death of victim of crime Trisha and they had no excuse for incurring the risk and the act of the convict-appellants could not be at all characterised as an over haste act rather the same was a deliberate act and they had definite knowledge of the ultimate result of the acts which were eminently a dangerous acts.

So main ingredients of the section under w this case was filed have not been pro Moreover the grievous hurt as alleged by prosecution does not fall under ingredients of section 320 of the Code.

In order to find the person or persons guilty of offence under section 302 read with section 149 of The Penal Code prosecution must establish that<br/>the offence was committed by any member of unlawful assembly in prosecution of common object of the assembly or such as the members of that assembly knew to be committed in prosecution of common object.<br/><strong><em>The State Vs.

On the face of these inconsistencies it is difficult to rely upon their testimony.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs. Md.

P.W. 1 stated that the injury was inflicted on the right chest. P.Ws 2, 3 and 7 stated that the deceased told them that condemned prisoner Inflicted the dagger blow on the right chest. P.W. 6 however stated that the condemned prisoner inflicted the dagger blow without mentioning any particular part of the body. The medical evidence shows that the doctor found 2 injuries, one on the right lumber region of the abdomen and another on the right side of the abdomen and that in his opinion that the death was due to the 'wounds' Therefore, we find that the deceased sustained two injuries on the abdomen and not no the chest. The doctor did not find any injury on the right side of the chest or below the right chest of the deceased. The prosecution has not given any explanation as to how the deceased has sustained injuries on the abdomen or on the lumbar region. The medical evidence disproved the prosecution case that the condemned prisoner inflicted a dagger blow on the chest of the deceased. Therefore, we find that the condemned prisoner has been falsely implicated in the case out of grudge, and that no occurrence took place in the manner as stated by the prosecution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs. Md. Azizul Haque 12 BLT (HCD)-199</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 302</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Whether the Husband was not under an obligation to explain the death of his wife -benefit of doubtPW2, the father of the deceased, said that when he went to the house of the appellant and saw the dead body of his daughter the appellant was not present in his house. He further said that for 4/5 days before the occurrence he did not see the appellant. He did not know whether the appellant was in his house on the night of occurrence. Amongst the prosecution witnesses only PW3 said that the appellant was seen in the locality for 4/5 days before the occurrence. His such evidence is inconsistent with PW2. Moreover relationship of PW3 with the appellant was inimical. He was not an independent and disinterested witness. Furthermore his evidence does not prove presence of the appellant in his hut on the night of occurrence or at the material time. The other local witnesses said nothing about his presence in the scene. Thus the prosecution failed to prove that on the night of occurrence the appellant was living with his deceased wife in the same hut and the death of the deceased wife was within special knowledge of the accused husband. Therefore, the appellant was not under an obligation to explain the death of his wife and no adverse view could be taken against him, because the explanation given by the defence that the deceased committed suicide by hanging had been proved untrue. As the prosecution failed to establish the minimum requirement for convicting the accused husband for murdering his wife that he was in the house at the relevant time, in the context of afore cited cases (43 D.L.R. (AD) 92, 43 D.L.R. (AD) 65 and 1990 B.L.D. (AD) 228) we are of the view that the prosecution failed to prove beyond all shadow of doubt that none but the appellant had hands in the killing of his deceased wife. It is well settled that abscondence of the accused by it self is not conclusive to the guilt of the accused. (Vide 41 D.L.R. 11, 45 D.L.R. 660, 46 D.L.R. 575). So as benefit of doubt the appellant is entitled to get acquittal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abu Taker Vs The State 14 BLT (HCD)-85</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-302</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is well recognized that to bring forth murder charge against an indicted person the prosecution must prove the time, place and manner of occurrence beyond any pale of doubt and if prosecution fails to prove time, place and manner of occurrence as programmed beyond any shadow of doubt it quibbles to dust.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Rustum &amp; Ors Vs. The State 14 BLT (HCD)-435</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-302</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Benefit of Doubt -The High Court Division dismissed the appeal of the appellant upon observing that (1) P. Ws. 2-6 being present on the spot during occurrence duly recognized the appellant with light of moon which was shining at that night in the sky and (2) P.Ws.2-6 stated clearly that they saw and recognized the appellant as the assailant and that they had no difficulty to recognized the appellant "with the light of moon" (3) there is nothing in the evidence j P.Ws.2-6 to discard their evidence relation to recognition of the appellant during occurrence. But as it appears the High Co Division at the same time observed the P.Ws. 2, 4, 5 and 6 contradicted each other to the extent that P.W.2 stated that the appellant was facing north when he gave dagger blow in the chest of deceased Julfu Master and the appellant was wearing coloured shirt and Imam Hossain (since acquitted) was wearing a Panjabi, P.W. 5 stated that the appellant was facing west the time of inflicting injury and the appellant was wearing a genji and accused Imam Hossain had no wearing at that time P.W.6 stated that the appellant was facing south at the time of inflicting of blow dagger and the appellant and Imam Hossain had no wearing and so we are of the victim that the conviction of the appellant unwarranted as the basic principles criminal jurisprudence is that prosecution has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Moreover he irreconcilable contradictions mean the P.Ws. did not see the occurrence at under the fundamental scheme of criminal jurisprudence discrepancies, contradictions and omissions in the evidence of witnesses are to be taken into considerations otherwise error might creep up in the judgment resulting in the conviction of the accused. So, in view of the above and that Imam Hossain has been acquitted we are of the view that, the appellant is entitled to the benefit of doubt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abul Khair Vs.

Evidences on record speak of previous background of enmity between accused party and deceased party in respect of the house of convict-appellant Rustum. Ocular testimonies supplied by prosecution witness nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 can be conveniently characterized as tainted testimonies. Evidence of above prosecution witnesses who are very much interested and interrelated required corroboration by independent and impartial witnesses and the accounts could be accepted if those stood corroborated by evidences of independent and disinterested witnesses. There was no corroboration of the versions of interested prosecution witnesses by independent and disinterested witnesses.

Report cannot be brushed aside as there was no eye witness of the alleged murder of deceased Delowar who alleged to have committed suicide by taking poison.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs. Seema Begum &amp; Ors 15  BLT (HCD) 265</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section-302/34</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Benefit of Doubt -In a case of murder conviction can be given relying upon the evidence of only one witness, if the evidence of such witness is found to be above board, unimpeachable and consistent with the F.I.R. case and evidences of other P.Ws. The evidence of P.W.2 Ayesha Begum is found not consistent with the evidence of other P.Ws that in the night of occurrence condemned prisoner called deceased Delowar from his house and thereafter she along with other convict appellants tortured him into death. Further there is also no evidence to prove that there was illicit relation in between deceased Delowar and condemned prisoner Seema Begum so as to substantiate the prosecution case that out of this illicit relation and love convict appellants and one Humayun called deceased Delowar through condemned prisoner Seema Begum and thereafter tortured him to death and thereafter threw his body inside the Girl's School and that the convict appellants including the condemned prisoner and others administered poison inside the stomach of deceased Delowar through ????? ????.In this case the so called alamat "????? ????" was not seized by the I.O. though during the time of taking evidence P.W.2 in her cross stated that after prepertrating torture the convict appellants and others administered poison in the stomach of deceased Delowar with the help of "????? ????”. In such view of the fact and the evidences on record, we find that the prosecution has failed to prove the charge of the murder of deceased by the condemned prisoner along with convict appellants on the basis of the evidence of P.W.2 Ayesha Begum. On the contrary, deceased Delowar died as a result of taking poison as stated by the Medical Board consisting of 3 doctor who after receipt of the viscera repo opined that the death of the victim was d to organophosphorus poisoning which was ante mortem and suicidal in nature. In such view  of the  fact,  we  have  no other alternative but to held that the prosecution has  failed  to  prove  the  case beyond reasonable doubt for which the referen should be rejected and the criminal appeal and Jail appeal should be allowed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

The evidence of P.W.1 that she recognized the appellant among 21, assailants is not at all credible as she at first said that she had recognized none. Moreover she did not give means of recognition and did not disclose to anybody the fact of recognition of the appellant amongst killers of the deceased. There is corroboration of her recognition of appellant as the killer of her husband. So is unsafe to act on her such incredible testimony. Thus the prosecution miserably failed to prove the charge against the appellant. The Court below wrongly convicted him.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Panaullah alias Pana Vs The State. 14 BLT (HCD)15</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-304 Part-1 and Section-304 Part-II </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A case of gruesome double murder</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have already noticed and agree w the finding of the trial court that there was neither any object of murdering anybody nor was there any such intention. From the evidence of P.W. 14 Dr. Shah Jamai who held autopsy on the dead body of Fakku Mia. It is found that he received several grievous injuries including one on the chest inflicted by Harunur Rashid and another on the abdominal cavity which pierced the surface of the liver inflicted by unknown assailant and as such it cannot said that the death was the most likely result of the injury on the chest and the doctor also did not depose so. We therefore, hold that respondent Harunur Rashid by inflicting the injury on the chest of Fakku Mia resulting the death of the victim committed an offense under Sect-ion 304 Part 1 of the penal Code for causing the bodily injury as was likely to cause death and in fact the death was caused. The injury caused by the other respondent Jahirul Hoque alias Jaju was not on the vital part of Bakul Bibi and we have already noticed that there was no evidence to the effect that said Jahirul Hoque knew about the pregnancy of Bakul Bibi. Under the circumstances Jahirul Hoque committed an offence punishable under Section 304 Part-II of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>State Vs.

There may be other motives for inflicting such blows by the accused upon deceased. It further appears from the evidence of the prosecution witnesses that each of the I accused appellants has dealt only one blow by their knife or dagger. It is difficult to hold that by which blow death was caused or whether each of the blow is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death of deceased or whether as a cumulative effect of all injuries sustained by the deceased had died. Although the injuries are on the vital parts of the body inflicted by sharp cutting weapons never the less as the prosecution says that each accused dealt one blow each, therefore, in our view, the offence cannot be called a murder as defined in section 300 of the Penal Code of the necessary ingredients of murder appear to be missing. It is a manslaughter not amounting to murder. Therefore, the offence comes under section 304 Part 1 of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

When an accused is found to use a dangerous weapon to cause fatal injury on the vital part of the body like head in a consecutive manner certainly it will prove his intention to cause such bodily injuries as is likely to cause his death-which comes within the mischief of first part of Section 304 of the Penal code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Nasir Howlader Vs.

There is no evidence of any conspiracy or pre plan or premeditation on the part of the two appellants nor it could be proved that they inflicted any injuries upon the deceased nevertheless they joined Aynul Sheikh at the time of occurrence. There is however no evidence that the appellants intended to cause the death of the victim. From the facts and circumstances of the case we think that the acts of the two appellants constitute at best an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under Section 304, Part I of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Aynul Sheikh and Anr.

The State 14 BLT (AD)- 33</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section- 304 Second Part</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">On scrutiny and careful analysis of the evidences by the prosecution side, it appears to us that accused- appellant Shamsul Hoq did not foresee that throwing of brick towards victim Kastura Bibi would cause death to her and he had no intention to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as was likely to cause death. No doubt, victim Kastura Bibi sustained violent blow on the abdominal wall by the brick thrown towards her chest and got senseless but death occurred when accused Abdul Hoque (since deceased) pressed her on the neck resulting her spontaneous death. Death would not have occurred if accused Abdul Hoq would not have played the part of pressing victim Kasture Bibi on her neck. The accused appellant Shamsul Huq had no premeditated intention to kill the victim kastura Bibi and the intention to kill is lacking in this case. But, although, he had no intention to kill the victim, he must be attributed the knowledge that such throwing of brick was likely to cause her death and the act done by him was both rash and indiscreet. We are of the opinion that accused Shamsul Hoq did not commit culpable homicide amounting to murder under section 302 of the Penal Code but committed culpable homicide not amounting to murder and the charge under section 302 of the Penal Code fails but we find that the accused- appellant Shamsul Hoq is liable for commission of offence punishable under section 304 Part II of  Penal Code and he can be convicted thereunder.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Jabbar Vs. The State 6 BLT (HCD)-35 </em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-304 Part II</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is no evidence on record that besides the lathis, they had any other deadly weapons in their hands. They used lathis on the person of the deceased. In the facts of the given case, we are satisfied that they had no intention to cause the death of Abul Kashem. They caused the injuries, which are likely to cause death. Their intention of causing bodily injuries as are likely to cause death had not been proved by the prosecution by adducing evidence. It is not the death itself, which was intended, nor the effect of the injuries. They did not inflict injuries indiscriminately on the deceased. They inflicted two injuries to the deceased with lathis. In view of the above, we are on the view that their offence, comes within the mischief of second clause of Section 299 of the Penal Code, which is an offence punishable under part II of section 304 of] the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The Solicitor Vs.

The deceased wife had consent in such act of the accused husband. Therefore, we find that the appellant committed an offence punishable under section 314 part I of the Penal Code.

The court must come to a definite finding with reference to the evidence on the record about the nature of injury. An injury is grievous hurt if it falls within the meaning of grievous hurt as given in Section 320 of the Penal Code. There is no evidence that any of the injuries endangered the life of any of the victim. There was no fracture; the victims were discharged from the hospital after treatment of several days. There is no evidence to show that any of the victim suffered severe bodily pain for a period of 20 days or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits. So the conviction under Sections- 326 and 325 of the Penal Code is not proper and legal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bazul Rahman Howlader &amp; Ors Vs The State 7 BLT (HCD)-66</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section - 323</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nature of hurt each of them allegedly caused does not disclose their intention to cause death, nor such bodily injury which might likely to cause death.

It appears that the prosecution has not led any evidence t prove the ingredients of the offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code. The trial court as well as the High Court Division failed to appreciate this aspect of the matter and wrongly held appellant guilty of the offence under Section 420 of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

The initial intention to deceive must be established to justify a conviction for cheating. Intention of cheating shall have to be gathered from the facts of the case and its surrounding circumstances. Where there is no fraudulent intention of the accused from the beginning, there can be no question cheating. In the absence of mens rea, mere breach of contract cannot constitute cheating. Inability to fulfill a promise or contract does not amount to cheating.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mahbubul Alam Gazi Vs.

Where fraudulent intention of the accused from the very beginning in the disputed deal is not proved, there can be no conviction for cheating.

To hold a person guilty of the offence of cheating, the prosecution must show that the accused had criminal intention. Such a dishonest intention can not only be inferred but it must be proved by facts and circumstances of the case and evidence on record.

The complainant might not be present at the time of the illegal entry but he came to the scene thereafter and opposed the appellant who despite his protest, carried on the work of construction. So the ingredients of sections 441/447 of the Penal Code have been well established.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mohammad Ali &amp; Ors. Vs. A. F. M. Mazedul Huq khan Lohani &amp; Anr. 8 BLT (AD)-96</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section- 447 &amp; 427</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As far as the assessment of evidence is concerned, both the Courts below believed the complainant's case and the High Court Division committed no wrong in accepting the findings of the Court of fact. Causing of mischief having been proved the ingredients of the offence of criminal trespass are also satisfied. It is not correct to say that no criminal action lay merely because the complainant could bring an action in the Civil Court for violation of the order of temporary injunction. The Civil Court's order of injunction having not been disputed, it was no defence to the accused that they were co-sharers in the disputed land and the complainant's wife was not in exclusive possession thereof.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Alauddin &amp; Ors Vs. Md. Shah Alam Khan &amp; Anr 7 BLT (AD)-356</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 448</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Convict-petitioner has sentenced to one year's rigorous imprisonment, which is the maximum sentence -Held; The petitioner was aged only 17 at the time of occurrence and there is no specific act of violence attributed to him, the maximum sentence awardable under the section is felt to be inappropriate and unwarranted. It is not the rule of procedure that in the event of finding an accused guilty of an offence, he must be punished with the maximum possible sentence under that provision of law. The law provides the trial court with a discretion which must be exercised judicially. In view of the age of the accused petitioner and the evidence of the witnesses not disclosing any specific overt act, the court should have exercised the discretion and awarded a lesser sentence, which would be sufficient to give the accused a lesson that crime will not go unpunished. In my view, in the facts of the instant case, the ends of justice will be sufficiently met if the petitioner is sentenced to imprisonment for the period already undergone by him in custody in connection with this offence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Rafiqul Islam Vs.

Moreover when from above we find no proof and evidence for offence under Section 458 Penal Code there was therefore no probable chance for the next alleged offence under section 354 Penal Code to committee by the accused appellant.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mozammel Haque Vs.

But to secure a conviction for forgery in a case like the present it must be specifically proved that the executant by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication or by reason of deception practiced upon him did not know the contents of the document and in such state he was made to execute the document by the accused. Clearly there is no such evidence and the circumstances referred to by the High Court Division may be enough for a Civil Court not to rely on such document but for a conviction for forgery there must be clear evidence as to the above which are the ingredients of the offence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shawkat Hossain Akanda Chowdhury Vs.

The certified copy of the disputed deed was marked as Exhibit 12 wherein the name of Md. Sirajul Haque appeared and from this alone it cannot be conclusively concluded that it is this appellant Md. Sirajul Haque who identified a wrong person knowing that Bishnupada Roy was not the executant of the deed. Admittedly the certified copy of the forged deed having been filed there was no scope to examine the signature of appellant No.2 Md. Sirajul Haque. Thus, we hold that there was no legal evidence on record to connect appellant No. 2 Md. Sirajul Haque with the abatement of the forged deed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mohir Molla &amp; Ors. Vs.

The undisputed fact is that appellant No. 3 and others have executed the document and that therein they have made some untrue statements regarding the property relating to which they executed the Muktipatras. The documents i.e. Muktipatras having admittedly been executed by the appellant No. 3 and others the same is in no way can be said to have been brought into existence under the circumstances or situations mentioned in Section 464 in the presence whereof a person is said to make a false document." From the ratio of the cases referred to herein over it is seen that it has uniformly been held that making of false statement in a document by the executants thereof does not saddle him with the liability of committing forgery or that of making a false document.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Hazi Ibrahim Ali &amp; Ors.

After his arrest his wife Nurun Nahar Begum came to the Court of the Magistrate and talked to the accused petitioner and handed over Tk 3,093/- to him for depositing the money in the Certificate case. The accused petitioner after accepting the amount prepared a recall order and gave a photocopy of that order to Nurun Nahar. Khijir Uddin got released from the Thana on the basis of that falsi order-Held: In the present case it has been proved that the recall order was used bm Nurun Nahar Begum in getting Khijir Uddul released from the Thana. The accused petitioner was certainly an abettor in so far as Section 471 of the Penal Code is concerned.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Azizul Haque Vs.

Mere proof that certain document is a forged one is not sufficient to establish the offence under this section because no conclusion can be drawn from the document itself. .The onus to proof of the existence of every ingredients of the charge always rest on the prosecution which never shifts.

A mere promise to marry in the future does not warrant a conclusion that a false belief of marriage was caused in her mind. The prosecution has to prove that some form of marriage, which is not valid and legal, was gone through with a fraudulent intention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case there is absolutely no evidence to prove that the accused petitioner deceitfully induced any belief in complainant Asia Begum that she was the legally married wife of the accused and fed by such belief she surrendered herself to the carnal desire of the accused, leading to her conception and as such the conviction under Section 493 of the Penal Code is not maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

It is in evidence that P.Ws. 1 and 4 were detained by giving threat and apart these two witnesses of implicating Sekander by giving order to his son to kill Munir, there is no other evidence on record. It is also in evidence that Sekandar was all through in the Police Station. Such conduct of a person who gave order to kill also seems unlikely. P.W. 8 Gazi Mozaffar Hossain testified that while going Hashi Video he saw accused Habib Rattan who were assaulting Munir. He did not specifically mentioned as to giving of any order by accused Sekandar to kill Munir. It is on record that P.W. 8 testified that Munir's father and uncle went away. Although this witness heard cry for help from deceased Munir he did not hear accused Sekandar giving order. In that view of the matter, it is difficult to hold that Sekandar really gave order to his son Bijoy to kill Munir. Accordingly Sekandar is given the benefit of doubt.

In the latter cases if the Court imposes sentence of imprisonment, then while imposing fine as an additional punishment the Court should give its reason so that it may be scrutinized by the appellate court. While imposing the sentence of fine the basic principles to be kept in view shall be as here under:</p><p style="text-align:justify">1.

If there be any missing link the accused will escape through it, for in that case the prosecution case will not be proved upto the hilt. Ascendance of an accused by itself proves no guilt. Normally even an innocent person tries to keep out of the way if he learns of his false implication in a serious case reported to the police. It is a somewhat weak link in the circumstances for establishing the guilt of a person, Again marks of injury in the dead body does not involve an individual with the crime of murder. The appellant who is the brother of the victim might have absconded, if at all, for fear of harassment as the unnatural death of his sister took place in his house. It was incumbent on the Courts below to properly scrutinize the material circumstances for determining whether the chain of circumstantial evidence is so complete as to lead to the only conclusion of the appellants guilt. In our view, the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence in this case falls far short of the test required for sustaining conviction.

The prejudicial act thus alleged comes within the mischief of section 2(0 (viii)of the Special Powers Act whereas the prejudicial act stated in the initial order of detention is 'law and order' which comes within the ambit of section 2(f) (iii) of the Special Powers Act. Therefore, we find that there is no nexus between the initial order of detention and the memo containing of which only establishes that the detaining authority while issuing the initial order of detention did not apply judicial mind.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Naureen Aziz Mohammad Bhai Vs.

M. Ershad to the supporters of the Jatiya Party and as a result there were clashes between the police and the supporters of the Jatiya Party and so keeping him outside will be a threat to public safety and public order-Held: The alleged act cannot be said to be prejudicial to public order- The detention of the detent is declared to be without any lawful authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Hafiza Akhter Vs.

Other grounds for his detention that he is supplying state secrets to foreign countries by using his connection with the elites of the country, diplomats and by throwing lavish parties, that he is leading a perverted life, that he has misappropriated fifteen cores of Takas from commercial banks by fraudulent means, that he is involved in the killing of Sohel Chowdhury and Salman Shah, both film actors and that he is a man of bad repute are also vague and indefinite not supported by any material.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Naureen Aziz Mohammad Bhai Vs.

He is involve in Murgi Milon Murder case, A pistol with two magazines containing 19 rounds of bullets were recovered from his luggage. The detenu is involved in transferring of thousands of dollars to foreign countries. The officers of the Airport are afraid of the detenu and are helpless to deal with detenue and as a result huge financial loss is sustained by the Government. Besides that, the detenu is responsible for the instability of the academic atmosphere in the Dhaka University and it is he who supplies arms to the students, He imports arms through the sea and that there are several criminal cases pending against him such as Kotwali P.S. Case no 46(9)2000 under Section 326/302/34 of the penal Code, Cantonment P.S. Case No. 10(4)2001 under section 19(ka) of the Arms Act; that he was detained twice before.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Held : The grounds for detention is vague, unspecified, indefinite, and as such the detenu was prevented from making any effective representation to be considered for his release by the authority, We also find clear non-application of mind by the detaining authority in passing the order for detention of the detenu. We have given our anxious consideration to the facts and circumstances of the case and the relevant provisions of the consititution and the special powers Act. We hold that the detenu Amin Rasul Shagor alias Tikai Shagor is being detained in custody without lawful authotiry and in an unlawful manner.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

So according to us, the District Magistrate, Dhaka should pay the compensatory cost in the instant case of the detenu.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Korban Vs.

In the instant Rule the order of extension of the initial period of detention of the detenu for further period of 3(three) months passed by the government under Section 3(3) of the Act (Communicated by the Memo No.3332/ SHA:MA/NIRA-3) dated 27.12.2001 Annexure-'c' to the Writ Petition) has been challenged. No materials could be placed before that to show that the order passed under Section 3(3) of the Act is based on a report of an Advisory Board constituted under Section-3 and submitted complying with the provisions of Section 10,11 and 12 of the Act. Further we are of the view that orders relating to detention beyond 30 days passed under Section 3(2) approval is dependent on the report of the Advisory Board in terms of Section 11 and 12 of the Act and the government is empowered to extend the period of detention only under Section 12(1) of the Act and that too on the basis of the report of the Advisory Board.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Kudrat Alahi Khan Vs.

It further appears that Special Tribunal No. 1 Feni apart from being unaware of section 10 of the Cruelty to women (Deterrent Punishment) Ordinance, 1983 is also not aware of sections 4 and 9 of the Cruelty to Women (Deterrent Punishment) Ordinance, 1983.The Special Tribunal concerned is directed to frame fresh charges under sections 4 and 9 of the Cruelty to Women (Deterrent Punishment) Ordinance, 1983 and also under section 376 of the Penal Code as well as under section 376 of the Penal Code read with section 9 of the Cruelty to Women (Deterrent Punishment) Ordinance, 1983 against all the accused persons in the manner set out below.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Hadi Vs.

The expression used in sub section (1) of Section 27 of the Special powers Act is mandatory in nature. This Division in the case of Siraj Miah Vs.

In the present case cognizance was taken against these two appellants on the basis of a 'Narazi' petition which is on the very face illegal and agreeing with the said decision of this Division we hold that the learned Special Tribunal committed illegality and wrong by taking cognizance against these two appellants in he manner as aforesaid.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Lt.

The Magistrate during the investigation of the case can exercise the power of issuing the process warrant of arrest and granting bail as he exercise under the Code of Criminal Procedure in any other criminal case. Therefore even if the accused person is released on bail by the Magistrate who had no power to try the case sub- section 6(A) would be attracted and the procedure of sub­section 6 shall not apply. Consequently, the trial can be held in absentia which will not be without jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mizan &amp; Ors. Vs.

"Dowry" in Section 4 has therefore to be understood in its ordinary meaning namely, property brought by woman to her husband at marriage or vice versa.

This doubt is not an imaginary doubt. Benefit of doubt to the accused would be available provided there is supportive evidence on record. For creating doubt or granting benefit of doubt, the evidence is to be such which may lead to such doubt.

The danger of exaggerated devotion to the Rule of Benefit of doubt at the expense of social defence and justice demands special emphasis on the contemporary context of escalating crime which is rapidly growing and is assuming menacing proportion. The concept that hundred guilty men may escape but one innocent person may not suffer now-a-days requires legal scrutiny afresh in as much as course of Justice cannot be made sterile and deflected on the plea. It a guilty person goes unpunished and stand acquitted, Justice system shall break down and public shall loose confidence in the Judicial system which has, also got a public accountability. It is true to say with Viscount Simons that "miscarriage of justice" may arise from the acquittal of the guilty on less that the conviction of the innocent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs., Ershad Ali Skkder &amp; Anr 11 BLT (HCD)-104</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Benefit of Doubt</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Benefit of doubt means an advantage or behoof of doubt. Reasonable doubt must be a doubt, arising from the evidences or from the want of evidences and cannot be an imaginary doubt or conjectures unrelated to evidence. Doubts which are real, genuine, well founded, which a normal man with normal intelligence in a given circumstances would normally harbour are doubt that come within the fold of Reasonable doubt entitling one to Benefit of doubt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs. Ershad Ali Sikder and Ors. 12 BLT (HCD)-481</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Circumstantial evidence</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Principles relating to circumstantial evidence are well settled. In first place, each of circumstances on which prosecution relies must be affirmatively established. In second place, circumstances in their totality must be consistent and consistent only with the guilt of the accused. In the third place, circumstances must be incompatible with the hypothesis of innocence of the accused. It is profitable to state that circumstantial evidence may be and frequently is more cogent than the evidence of eye-witness. There is no Rule that if there is no eye­witness to an incident an offender cannot be held guilty of offence he committed and conviction cannot be awarded upon perpetrators of crime. It is no difficulty to procure and produce false eye-witnesses and, it is on the other hand, extremely difficult to produce circumstantial evidence of a convincing character and, therefore, circumstantial evidence is more convincing and cogent than evidence of eyewitness.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

Reasonableness of doubt must commensurate with the nature of the offence. Proof beyond Reasonable doubt shall not mean proof beyond the Shadow of doubt. The doubt shall not be an imaginary and fanciful doubt. Benefit of doubt to an accused would be available provided there is supportive evidence on record.

The offence, executes or lends to execute common object unless the common mission of that offence is involved in the common object.—The Phrase, thus, means that the offence committed was immediately connected with the common object of unlawful assembly of which the accused are members. The offence must have been done with a view to accomplish common object attributed to the members of unlawful assembly. Mere presence at the scene does not make one a member of unlawful assembly unless it is proved that he shared common object of unlawful assembly.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

Ayub Ali Sarder &amp; Ors. 12 BLT (HCD)-14</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Inculpatory and Exculpatory</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant cast there is no direct evidence as to who had murdered the victim near the Mirpur Bus Stand No. 1 where the victim was found lying unconscious in a pool of blood with stab injury, On being taken to the Hospital the doctor declared him dead. Death of the victim is not disputed and the same has been proved by the evidence of the doctor P.W. 5 who held mortem examination over the dead body of the victim and evidence of other witnesses. The question is who had murdered the victim with stab injuries as found by the doctor. Accused Saiful was arrested by the police sometime after the occurrence on the same right from near about the place of occurrence on the showing of P.W.I Roushan Ara Begum and taken to the P.S. on query from her he disclosed that at the time of calling and taking away the victim from his residence the other man with him was appellant Billal. He made a confessional statement in which he stated that he along with Miraj and Billal had gossiped with the victim in the field at 06.30 in the evening of 26.10.1992 (the date of occurrence) and then the victim went away to his house. Then he along with Billal went to the shop for taking tea. Then one man came there and inquired about the victim. Billal asked him to go and call the victim. He went to the house of the victim with that man. Victim addressed that man as Dulal and asked his to take his seat. Then Alam (Victim) went away taking Dulal with him. Then he came back. Then he heard that the victim was murdered. He went to the P.S. to see victim but did not find him there. Police arrested him after half an hour from in front of the shop.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Above statement is partly inculpatory and fits in with the prosecution case in that in the evening Saiful and Billal had gossiped with the victim in the filed and then the victim returned to his house and sometime thereafter at the instance of Billal Saiful called the victim form his house. But the remaining part of the confessional statement is exculpatory. So we are unable to agree with the submission of the learned Advocate of the appellant that the entire confessional statement of Saiful is exculpatory.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Billal Vs.

It affects the general current of public life. The expression "law and order: is wider in scope in as much as contravention of the law always affects order while "public order" has a narrower ambit and public order would be affected by only such contravention which affects the community or the public at large. When an order of detention is questioned, it is for the Court to apply well knows tests to find out whether the impugned activities upon which the order of detention is grounded fell under the classification of "Public order" or belong to the categOi^ of "law and order.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

Penal interest is extra liability incurred by a debtor for committing some wrong for making the payment when it should have been made to the person wronged. It is neither related with not limited to the damages suffered. Thus, when the liability to pay interest is founded on the doctrine of compensation, penal interest is a penalty founded on the doctrine of penal action.

Because the hierarchy of courts established under the law and constitution has as definite purpose and section 410 of the Code of Criminal procedure and Article 103 of the Constitution providing for appeal should not be construed as an idle formality or a decoration piece.
