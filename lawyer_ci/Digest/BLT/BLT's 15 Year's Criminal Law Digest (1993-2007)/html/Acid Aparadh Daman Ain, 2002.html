In such a case Court should reasonably infer that the story of recognition the assailants was a subsequent embellishment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Haq &amp; Ors Vs.

In absence of any evidence or means of ignition the identity of the accused is not established beyond reasonable doubt. So in case it is unsafe to convict accused.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Haq &amp; Ors Vs.
