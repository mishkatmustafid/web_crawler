Khandker Zillul Bari 14 BLT (AD)-91</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abscondence of an accused</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Abscondence of an accused in an incriminating circumstance connecting him  the offence and conduct of a person in abscondence after commission of crime is an evidence  to show that he is concerned in offence. BLT mere absconding cannot s be a circumstance to lead to an inference of guilt of accused. In Judicial confessional statement confessing convict-appellant Sukkur Ali marked convict Ramjan as the culprit who along with other culprits made the rickshaw halt and who demanded money from deceased and who offered Taka 40/- to him for taking breakfast. Since the commission of crime Ramjan was in abscondence and this abscondence is supportive evidence of his involvement in offence and an incriminating circumstance against him.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs Md. Gaus Meah @ Rana &amp; Ors. 13 BLT (HCD)-136</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A case of Gang Rape</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a case of gang rape or in other words, in case of rape if the number of rapist is more than one, usual conduct of the rapists would be that they would overpower the victim in such a manner so that the victim could not move and in that circumstances there might not be any sign of injury on the vagina as no resistance could be offered and the vagina might not be ruptured Absence of any injury on the private parts of the victim cannot lead to conclusion that no rape was committed. It must be borne in mind that penetration itself is sufficient to constitute the sexual intercourse to the offence of rape, Since the case is of gang rape, resistance was absolutely impossible as because woman is always weaker than man. Normally in almost all the cases accused is found to be one BLT in this case there were more than one accused persons and the circumstances and situation is quite different. It is in the testimony of P. W. 1 that since long days passed, alamats of rape could not be seized. The victim A was examined by P. W. 10 Dr. Nazrul Islam who on examination found chest pain, abdomen pain, physical assault, dyshuia etc. The possibility of alleged rupturing of vagina of the victim A in the event of commission of rape by five (5) persons on her could be gathered and elicited by the defence, even by the Bishesh Adalat itself in search of truth. The Bishes Adalat for that purpose, was expressly vested by section 165 of the Evidence Act with the right to put questions. BLT that was not done. The Bishes Adalat was not an expert on medical science and, therefore, it was absolutely incompetent to say anything on this subject and it travelled beyond its jurisdiction in assuming the function of a medical expert in recording the finding that in the event of commission of rape by seven (7) (actually five) persons. Vagina of victim A was required to be ruptured. The Bishes Adalat was also wrong in holding that it was not possible on her part to go to the room of the Principal of the college in the absence of any legal evidence to that effect. The Bishes Adalat imported its own views and there is no logic nor any reason to hold the said views. Reasons are the soul of law. The dicision of the Bishes Adalat is founded on mere suppositions, surmises and conjectures.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shamin Hossain Vs.
