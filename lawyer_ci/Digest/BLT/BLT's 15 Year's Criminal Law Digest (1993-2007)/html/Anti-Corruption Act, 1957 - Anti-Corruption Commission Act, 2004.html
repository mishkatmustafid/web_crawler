Vs. The State &amp; Ors. 4 BLT (AD)-58.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-3</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">We are conscious that no direction as prayed for by the petitioner for holding investigation can be given in this Writ petition, however, on perusal of the newspaper report, we agree with the learned Advocate for the petitioner that it contains some specific allegations against Respondent No. 1 about abuse of powers. The Respondent No. 1 at the relevant time held the responsible post of Secretary, Ministry of Works. Officers of the Bureau of Anti-Corruption are empowered under sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Anti-Corruption Act, 1957 to hold any enquiry and investigation in respect of the offence specified in the schedule to that Act. We are of the view that though normally police cannot act on the basis of any report in the newspaper, as the matter has been brought to the notice of this court in the form of an application under Article 102 of the Constitution, this court to ensure transparency and accountability of public servants, especially those who hold responsible position, may give a direction to the Respondent No. 3 to take steps for holding enquiry into the allegations as contained in the report published in the daily "Dinkal" on 27.07.2001 so-' far the allegations relate to the Respondent Nos. 1 and 1A and thereafter to proceed according to law. We are inclined to issue such a direction in consideration of the fact that under Section 3 of the Anti-Corruption Act, 1957, an officer of the Bureau of Anti-Corruption is empowered to make such enquiry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mohammad Hossain Advocate Vs.

So although an officer of the Anti Corruption Department is armed with power of a police officer under different section of the Criminal Procedure Code the person against whom an enquiry is being made ought to have protection provided by the Criminals procedure Code. Having found that the Bureau of Anti-Corruption has the power to issue orders and summons under Sections 94 and 160 CrPC.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Giasuddin Al-Mamun &amp; Ors.
