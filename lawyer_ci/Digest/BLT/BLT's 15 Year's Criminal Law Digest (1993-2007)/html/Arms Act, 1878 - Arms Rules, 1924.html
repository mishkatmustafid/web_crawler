It is no body's case that the appellant kept the incrimination fire arms and ammunition for sale or offered or exposed these fire­arms and ammunition for sale and as such, his conviction under section 19 (a) of the Arms Act, 1878 was bad in law and cannot be sustained- relied on 42 Cal, 115, 19 C.W.N. 706 16 Cr.

We find that though the circumstantial evidence is as such it appears in the mind as the first impression that the prosecution case is true, BLT on a scrutiny as has been done abode by us we find that P.Ws. are not unanimous regarding the reason for and manner of arresting the appellant resulting recovery of the revolvers. We hold that there is scope for getting benefit of doubt by the appellants.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Millon Samaddar Vs.

The State 10 BLT (HCD)-430</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section - 19(a)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">On perusal of the seizure list it appears that the same only discloses the fact of seizure of 3(three) country made light guns BLT from whose possession those were seized had not been mentioned. At the top of the seizure list it has been specifically mentioned :- "??? ?????? ???? :- ????-??????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ????? ??????? ???? ??????? ?????? ???? ?? ?? ? ??????? ?? ??????? ???? ?????“ From this seizure list it is evident that the bag into which those light guns were kept was found upon the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway at Bausia point and was not recovered from the control or possession of the accuse appellants, who were put on trial. Moreover it appear that out of the seizure list witnesses the only PW6 was  produced before the  Court  and was examined by the prosecution. PW6 in his examination-in-chief stated that “ ???? ?/?? ??? ??? ???? ??/??.?? ???? ??? ???? ???? ??? ????? ???? ?? ? ???? ????? ????? ??????? ?/? ???? ????? ??? ???? ??? ??? ???? ????? ???? ?????? ? ???? ??? ??? ?????? ????? ???? ???? ????????? ????? ???? ? ????? ?? ???? ??? ???? ??? ????" From the evidence it is crystal clear that the rexin back was seized from a local vehicle not from the possession of any of accused persons. This PW6 did not mention any name of the accused person in his examination-in-chief. The PWl PW2, PW3 and PW8 although gave some direct evidence against the appellants BLT those evidence did not find support from the seizure list. From the discussion mad above it is crystal clear that the incriminating articles were neither recovered from the exclusive possession of the accused appellants nor the appellant had excessive control over the spot recovery of those guns - the sentence awarded thereunder is not sustainable in law and is liable to be set aside.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Golam Mohammad Faruque &amp; Ors.

If an accused persons is charged with a substantive offence, his conviction may be altered to one of an offence for abetment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ful Miah &amp; Ors Vs. The State 15 BLT (HCD)322</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section -19A and Section 19(f)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is the prosecution case that from the possession of accused appellant Bami a country made pistol was recovered, which comes under the purview of the Section 19A of the Arms Act. From the possession of used Obating and Md. Jalal some live cartridges were recovered which are ammunitions within the meaning of the Arms Act and as such, not covered by the revisions of the section 19A of the Arms Act. BLT comes within the purview of and covered by the provisions of Section 19(f) of the Arms Act. The sentences awarded by the learned Judge of the Special Tribunal in lump to all the three accused-appellants to suffer 17 year's rigorous imprisonment is not justified.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bating &amp; Ors Vs The State 14 BLT (HCD) 97</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-19A and 19(f)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">On perusal of the other evidence on record it is evident that all the prosecution witnesses supported that one revolver and six cartridges were recovered from the possession of co-convict Monir Uddin. The Tribunal found the convict appellants Rafiqul Islam and Monir Uddin in joint possession of a revolver and bullets and cartridges which is not being supported by any evidence on record — We hold that the prosecution hopelessly failed to prove charge under section 19(f) and 19A of the Act as against the convict appellant Rafiqul Islam.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Rafiqul Islam Vs. The State 14 BLT (HCD) 416</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-19A and 19(f)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a case of like nature the control and possession of the incriminating article is essential for holding the accused guilty for the offence charged, BLT in the instant case the recovery of the incriminating articles has not been proved in as much as has been disproved, since some of the P.Ws. claimed that they handed over the incriminating articles to chowkider, some said to the secretary of the union parishad, BLT the informant himself claimed that he found the incriminating articles in the hands of accused appellant. More so the with-holding of the local union parishad chairman against whom there is specific allegation that he is the pioneer of this case, as he was the then local Zubo Dal Chairman started this false case against the accused appellant who happens to be a member of Chhatra league and this fact alone led us to hold that the prosecution with a motive withheld the important witnesses to prove the alleged<br/>recovery of the incriminating articles from control and possession of the accused appellant and as such the findings and decision of the learned Tribunal holding the accused-appellant guilty for the offence<br/>charged cannot be sustained.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Biplob Vs. The State 10 BLT (HCD)-334</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 19A &amp; 19(f)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the evidence of the PW 1 we have found that he did not recover the alleged arms from the exclusive possession and effective control of the accused-appellant and the evidence of PW 1 Sub-inspector of police was not corroborated by the other PWs . And none of them testified that the revolver and two live bullets were recovered from the possession and effective or actual control of the accused-appellant. More so, on going through the evidence of PW 1 we, find at the time of recovery the alleged arms and ammunition, he was not present in the place of occurrence. - We are therefore, constrained to hold that the prosecution has failed to prove its case against the accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt and therefore he is entitled to acquittal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Muklesur Rahman &amp; Ors Vs. The State 13 BLT (HCD) 175</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-19(a) and 19(f)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Conviction is quashed- mere recovery at the showing of the petitioner or mere brining out the Alamats from that place, cannot be itself a ground to held this petitioners guilt in possessing the illegal fire arm and ammunition.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Abul Hossain Vs. The State 7 BLT (HCD)-124</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sectio-19 (f)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The words, possession and control on the said section 19 (f) mean possession and control treating a fire arms as one's own property- the possession of the incriminating four pistols and ammunition by the appellant while he was living at Sena Bhaban was possessioned by him, of at all, possession of Government and not possession on his behalf treating the said pistols and ammunition as his personal property. So, his possession of the said pistols and ammunition while he was at Sena Bhaban as the resident of Bangladesh and thereafter for about a week was not possession and control within the meaning of section 19 (f) of the Arms Act, 1878- conviction under section 11 (f) for possession thereof has been bad in law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Hussain Muhammad Ershad Vs the State 3 BLT (HCD) 193</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-19(f)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since the seized 'daos' do not come within the mischief of Arms as defined in section 4 of the Arms Act, the trial of the accused appellant under section 19 (0 of the Act is illegal and the conviction and sentence passed upon him under section 19j (f) of the Arms Act cannot be sustained in Law and is liable to be set aside.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mizanur &amp; Ors Vs. The state 4 BLT (HCD)-139</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-19(f)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Benefit of doubt- It is for the prosecution to prove "possession" strictly in order to sustain a conviction under section 19(f) of the Arms Act. If there is any doubt as to "possession" the accused must be given the benefit of it. The prosecution case has. been grounded on the fact that after repeated] calls the accused-appellant opened the door; and on searching his body, whether inside the house, or on the courtyard or on the verandah, the Bayonet was recovered from body hidden on his waist under the lungi. Now the question is: Can it be at all believeable that hearing many calls from outside by police personnels and other people for opening the door of the house, the appellant opened the door keeping Bayonet on his waist under the Lungi to the same recovered from his body? The answer is: It is impossible and also improveable. It is the evidence that the accused-appellant did not open the door of the house at the first call BLT opened the after repeated calls. The appellant, opening the door of the house, took time to hide the Bayonet in any place the house. The appellant's first anxiety has been to keep the Bayonet in a place when the house was alleged to be of a dacoit. The prosecution version of the therefore, suffers from an inherent improbability and also an infirmity of a nature-the accused must be given the benefit of it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sukkur Ali Kha Vs. The State 6 BLT (HCD)-98</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-19(f) </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">On the question of mens rea every case should be decided on the basis of particular facts involved in each case. Ordinarily, it be sufficient for the prosecution to prove that an incriminating fire-arm or ammunition was in possession of the accused and if such possession is established y the prosecution the Court will presume existence of mens rea in the mind of the subject to the right of the accused to this presumption and proved that he not possess the incriminating fire-arm ammunition consciously, knowingly or ally-  in  the  present  case, the t was holding. 3006 inch calibre rifle and same cartridges under the incriminating  cartridges under a valid licence and all these were kept at Sena Bhaban where he was residing. It has also been proved that the appellant presented the rifle in question and 13 pieces of cartridges to the military museum on 26th November, 1987. Thereafter on 24.12.90 the incriminating 11 pieces of cartridges found at Sena Bhaban when the Inventory Committee as making inventory of the articles left there. The appellant asserted that these 11 pieces of incriminating cartridges had been left at Sena Bhaban by the person sorted out the cartridges on account of inadvertence or having filed to identify them and that these had been left there until 24.12.90 without his knowledge, consent and intention - the assertion made by the appellant to be reasonable in all probability these cartridges were left behind at Sena Bhaban from 26.11.87 till 24.12.90.without his knowledge, consent and intention. So, even in his cartridges were technically in his possession being at Sena Bhaban these were in his possession without any guilty intention or mens rea on his part- his possession  could  not  be  construed as possession within the meaning of Section-19(f) of the Arms Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Hussain Mohammad Ershad Vs. The State 3BLT (HCD)-193</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 19(f)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Possession of Arms It appears that the arms in question have not been recovered from possession of the appellants and admittedly they were not present at the place of occurrence; the arms and ammunitions were recovered from the possession of the arrested accused-persons and they disclosed the names of their other companions who are the appellants. In such view of the matter, the appellants cannot be held to be in possession of any arms.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Pannu Mollah and Ors. Vs.

To constitute offence there must be Mens Rea or guilty knowledge. Existence of Mens Rea or guilty knowledge is the <em>sine qua non</em> for offence for possessing weapon of crime.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Babul Vs The State 13 BLT (HCD)-339</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section - 19(f)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Special Tribunal Judge committed illegality in convicting the accused appellant Mukul Hossain under section 19A of the Arms Act in as much as from the evidence on record it is clearly found that from his possession only a 'Tojdani' with 5 round cartridges were recovered and owing to that reason he should have been only convicted under section 19(0 of the Arms Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.
