During that case the Trial Judge may call the witnesses mentioned in the police case, if they are not already examined on behalf of the complaint, as court witnesses under Section 540-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, so that they can be cross examined by both the parties.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the trial ended in conviction in the Complaint Case, the Public Procedure would consider whether prosecution of police case should be withdrawn with permission of the court or not.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the police case is taken up first for trial the complainant would be under handicap in so far as to cross-examining the witnesses for the prosecution.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Normally, the Public Prosecutor is to be in-charge of the case even if the trial is based on a Private Complaint.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Motaleb Mondal Vs.

P.W.I also in his deposition did not support the same through he was present by the side of his deceased son all through and shifted him to the hospital. It is well settled that through First Information Report is not substantive evidence, as the earliest recorded version of the prosecution case it has such importance. Had the deceased made any dying declaration as said by P.Ws.2, 3, 4, 8 and 9 such fact would find place in the First Information Report. Thus we find that the story of the dying declaration is a subsequent embellishment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Jabbar &amp; Ors. Vs.

It is well neigh settled that even if the Investigation is illegal or suspicious evidence must be scrutinized independently of the import of the Investigation. Otherwise, the Criminal Trial will plummet to the level of investigating officers ruling the roost. Court must have predominance and pre-eminence in Criminal Trials over action taken by Investigation Officers. Criminal Justice cannot be made a casualty for wrongs and defects committed by Investigating Officers in the case. If Court is convinced that testimony of a witness to occurrence is true, it is free to act on it albeit the Investigating Officers suspicious role in the case. If offenders are acquitted only on account of flaws or defects in Investigation, the cause of criminal justice becomes the victim, Criminal Justice is always to be salvaged despite defects in Investigation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

Though the convict appellant was enlarged on bail on 27.4.2005 BLT the bail order was sent to the office of the Deputy Commissioner, Lakshmipur on 7.5.2005as is evident from the margin of the order sheet dated 27.4.2005. The convict appellant was not released from jail before receipt of the bail order which in fact was not received earlier than on 7.5.2005 and as such the convict appellant served out sentence of more than 10 years on 7.5.2005. In view of the fact and circumstances of the case we consider it to be a fit case to invoke Section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the purpose of counting the period of sentence already undergone by the convict appellant before and after delivery of judgment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Gani Ganya Vs.

They had undergone considerable period in custody proceeding to their conviction and sentence. Some of them have been enlarged on bail subsequently. On consideration of the above, we are of the view that ends of justice will be met if the accused persons are given the benefit of section 35A of the Code of Criminal procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ful Miah &amp; Ors Vs.

Whereas, an order of detention is made if the authority is 'satisfied' that the detent had acted or is acting or is about to act prejudicial activities within the meaning of "Prejudicial-Act" under the Special Powers Act. This 'satisfaction' as referred to is that of the authority and its satisfaction cannot be replaced by that of a police officer. This 'satisfaction' of the authority is subject to judicial review and this Court can look into this subjective satisfaction of the authority objectively. In respect of these detents, the 15 Years Digest authority made the orders of detention, the moment the police officer made proposal for detention after arrest under section 54 of the Code. This shows that the report of the police officer replaced the "satisfaction" of the authority in making an order on detention. Therefore, it is beyond the schame of the detention law that an order of detention can be made in respect of a person on the basis of a report of the police] officered after he was arrested under section 54 of the Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

A summons on the other hand, is always addressed to the person who is required either to attend or to produce a document or thing. Therefore, it will appear that this power of issuance of summons or a warrant is neither an ordinary nor an additional power of a Magistrate under Section 36 and 37 of the Code of Criminal procedure. We are therefore of the view that no vesting of power is necessary upon any Tribunal or a Court for issuance of any process as per provision either under Section 68 or of Section 75.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Hayder Miah Vs.

In almost all such cases the local seizure list witnesses come to the witness box to state that they did not see the recovery of the incriminating articles and that they put their signatures /LTIs in blank papers for obliging the police officers. In such circumstances, the Court should not take too rigid a view regarding the provisions of Section 103 of the code in the absence of any special reasons.

In almost all cases they come to the court to say that they signed blank papers on the asking of the police and disown their presence at the time recovery of incriminating articles. In such circumstances, absence of evidence from local witness should not be blown too far.

BLT under special circumstances the Magistrate is competent to take action under Section 107 and 117 of the Code where the dispute if he satisfies if there is imminent apprehension of breach of the peace which demands an emergent action for keeping the peace. When in a case there is an apprehension of breach of the peace over and ancestral immovable property arising out of ancestral both the parties it is patently unjust and illegal to ask one of the parties to furnish a bond of good behaviour giving an undue advantage over him to the other party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Azhar Rahman &amp; Ors.

P.C. and appointing a receiver for the disputed land was passed by the learned Magistrate on 15.10.1985 i.e. more than 10 years before- The petitioners will get an opportunity to submit before the learned Magistrate whatever they have got to say with regard to their alleged possession in the disputed land and the alleged fraud said to have been committed by the second party in brining about the proceeding in question.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shahidur Rahman &amp; Ors.

P. C. which were upheld by the High Court Division on 22.1.96 in Criminal Revision No. 783 of 1991 and that the learned District Judge passed an order for maintaining status quo long after the order 12 had been passed by the Magistrate on 22.4.91. The ' concerned Magistrate therefore, did not commit any illegality in rejecting the petitioner's prayer for vacating the direction given on 6.8.97 for handing over the charge of the property in question to the receivers. It does not appear that the impugned judgment of the High Court Division suffers from any illegality.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shebail Mohanta Sree Kader Nath Achari Vs.

It is on record that the second party filed Title Suit No. 25 of 1993 in the Court of Subordinate Judge against the first party in respect of the disputed land.

Although pendency of a suit is not a bar in drawing up a proceeding if the learned Magistrate finds that there is serious apprehension of breach of peace over the case land, BLT if the Civil Court passes an order of injunction and has regulated the possession of the subject matter of the proceeding, the learned Magistrate does not retain any jurisdiction over the same subject matter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Afsar Ali Khan &amp; Ors.

Unless these preconditions are fulfilled, such as he shall make an order in writing stating the grounds of his satisfaction and secondly, he shall have to ask the parties concerned to submit written objection in support of their respective claim of possession therein a proceeding cannot be said to have been drawn up. In the instant case, the learned Magistrate issued show cause notice upon the second parties only and no show cause notice was issued upon the first party.

In this, case, from the evidence, of P.W. 44 and other witnesses, the most of the accused persons used to stay in Bangabhaban since 15th August, 1975 and in the name of an unwritten command council used to govern the country till they were made to leave on the 4th November, 1975, Still then they were not without influence. The accused Major Syed Farook Rahman tried to force a mutiny at Savar and Bogra Cantonment and the accused Major Khondaker Abdur Rashid tried unsuccessfully to take over the command of 2nd Field Artillery Regiment in 1976, Again, in 1980 they made another attempt to overthrow the Government BLT still no Government took any punitive action against any of them, rather, they were all given their arrear salaries. The accused Major Syed Farook Rahman even contested the Presidential Election in 1986 (P.W. 44). So the apprehension of the information about his own life and limb cannot be said to be unreasonable. Under such circumstances, the delay in lodging the FIR cannot vitiate the trial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs. Lt Col.

The statement made in the FIR can only be used for the purpose of contradicting and discrediting the informant under section 145, or corroborating him under section 157 of the Evidence Act, when he is examined as a witness (Agonoo Nagesia V State of Bihar, AIR 1966 SC 119)" Object of such first information report is to set the criminal law in motion by giving an information regarding commission of an offence to trace and bring the culprits to book (Hasib V State of Bihar, AIR 1972 SC 283). Acting upon a FIR, when the police upon investigation traced out the real offenders even including the informant they are statutorily required under section 173 of the Code to forward a report along with the accused to the Magistrate having power to take cognizance for trial. Under section 190 of the Code, it is the Magistrate who is only empowered to decide on the report and the materials sent as to whether to take cognizance of the offence against the accused sent up or not. In such case, we therefore find no statutory requirement to lodge suo moto a FIR and register another case thereupon on the result of successful investigation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdur Rouf @ Rab Howlader Vs.

The object of insisting upon prompt lodging of the report to the police in respect of commission of an offence is to obtain early information regarding the circumstances in which crime was committed, the name of the actual culprits and the part played by them. Delay in lodging First Information Report quite often results in embellishment and embroidery which are creature of afterthought.

Evidence of Informant PW. 1 before Tribunal demonstrated that in order to save her rapid husband, the convict-appellant made a departure from the factuality that came inn being in the earliest record of the case i.e. First Information Report. In this context it is posited that it could not be believed at all that a woman would lay a false written complaint in respect of the chastity of her daughter against her own husband if them would not have occurred any such heinous incident at all and if her husband would not have deflowered her deaf and dumb daughter, the victim of crime.

The learned Magistrate upon receipt of the said application recorded an order stating that the record of the case has already transmitted to the learned Sessions Judge for trial. From the above facts it appear to us that the application for retracting confession was made at a belated stage after more than two months of making confession. If the confession was obtained in oppression, there was no reason on the part of the accused to take such a long time for reaction. The injuries as noticed by D.W. 1 Mulla Nurul Islam on the person of the appellant were admittedly simple injuries which might be caused by friendly hands.

It appears from the judgment of High Court Division that have considered the pros and cons of the case on consideration of the evidence of the ling officer as well as the confessional lent and also considering several decisions of the Superior Courts of the Subcontinent came to the finding that the confessional statement is not true and voluntary.

The aforesaid witness recording the statement admitted in cross-examination that the accused signed the statement in English and was asked the questions in English and Urdu BLT he recorded the statement in Bengali. Under Section 164(2) of the Code such confessional statements are required to be recorded and signed in the manner as provided in section 364 of the Code. Section 364 of the Code provides that the whole examination including every question put to an accused and every answer given by him shall be recorded in the language in which he is examined and if it is not practicable it can be written in the language of the Court or in English and if the accused does not understand the language in which it is written it shall be interpreted to him in a language which he understands to enable him to get a chance to explain or add to his answers. On perusal of the confessional statement (Ext-9) it appears to us that the same has been recorded by P.W. 11 Dewan Jakir Hossain in Bengali which the accused appellant admittedly does not understand and that though the witness knew English, the said statement has not been interpreted to the accused in the said language or any other language consideration to the perfunctory manner in which the statement has been recorded without complying with the requirement of law, we are of the view that the aforesaid confessional statement.

Balmakund, AIR 1931 Allahabad 1 (F. B). The Full Bench approved the majority views taken by different Benches observing that those authorities actually established no more than "(a) where there is other evidence a portion of the confession may in the light of that evidence be rejected while acting upon remainder with the other evidence, and (b) where there is no other evidence and the exculpatory element is not inherently incredible, the court cannot accept the  inculpatory element and reject the exculpatory element." The Full Bench then answered the reference as follows: "where there is no other evidence to show affirmatively that any portion of the exculpatory element in the confession is false; the court must accept or reject the confession as a whole and cannot accept only the inculpatory element while rejecting exculpatory   element   as inherently incredible." The Supreme Court of India in the case of Nishi Kant Jha V The State of Bihar, AIR 1969 (SC) 422 approved the views of the Allahabad High Court. Our Appellate Division in the case of State Vs Lalu Mia and another 39 DLR (AD) 117 did not depart from the views taken by the F Bench in the case of Balmakund and t Supreme Court of India in the case of Nis Kanata Jha (supra).

The question now is what this sickness was? Answer must be "sickness was on account of torture carried out and third degree method used by Police upon convict-appellant."

From the form of the recording statement, it is clear that the Magistrate did not state when she started recording the statement. How much time she allowed the accused for reflection. So on scrutiny of the above confessional statement, it is difficult for us to hold that the same were recorded in full compliance with the provision of 164 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that the same is not voluntary and true.
