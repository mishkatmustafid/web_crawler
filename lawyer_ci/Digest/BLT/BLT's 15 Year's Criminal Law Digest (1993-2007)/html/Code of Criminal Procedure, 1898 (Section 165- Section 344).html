P. C. is undoubtedly a procedural law. The Criminal Procedure Code (Second Amendment) Act, 1992 (Act XLII of 1992) did not make any provision that the amendment brought in section 167, although a procedural law, will operate prospectively- operates retrospectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Kali Pada Dutta Vs.

BLT the accused cannot claim the privilege of bail as a matter of right. In the face of peculiar circumstances, delay in completion of investigation of the case is no ground to release the accused-petitioner on bail.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Major (Retd) M.

P. C. was the Sessions Judge who had directed further investigation into the offences after the expiry of the period mentioned in sub- section (5)- BLT with the amendment of Section 167 Cr. P.C. by Act 42 of 1992, the time limit for conclusion of investigation was done away with and the amendment being in respect of a Procedural Law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Govt. of Bangladesh Vs.

Jalaluddin &amp; Anr 6BLT(AD)-172</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-172</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Case diary—it appears that the High Court Division directed the Investigating Officer to put in an affidavit with copies of the pages of the diary which is against the provision of law and as such illegal. It cannot be said by any stretch of imagination that for transparency of investigation a case diary or any part thereof may be put in before any court of law by way of affidavit. Such contention is not supported by any law and the High Court Division by directing the Investigation Officer to swear affidadit along with copies of certain pages of the diary has acted illegally which cannot be supported.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bangladesh &amp; Ors.

The State 3 BLT (HCD)-162</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-173</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is on record that the case was twice investigated once by the local police and then by the Criminal Investigation Department and the investigation officers took into consideration the post-mortem report wherein Medical Officer opined that the death of the deceased was accidental and also the fact that the petitioner did not adduce any evidence before the investigating officer or the Criminal Investigation Department and also the other facts and circumstances of the case. The High Court Division it appears found that the Naraji petition of the petitioner was not supported by any materials. The High Court Division accordingly on consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case and relevant materials on record rejected the naraji petition—No illegality in Passing the impugned order.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Farid Miah Chowdhury Vs.

Such allowance in our view will encourage implication of a innocent person into false charge in the hands unscrupulous interested elements and it will frustrate the purpose of further investigation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ruhul Amin Kha Vs.

The police officer cannot avoid this responsibility. His responsibility is not over as soon as he completed the investigation and submitted the police report i.e. charge sheet. BLT his responsibility continues till the conclusion of the trial to see that no evidence in the case is lost by means of gaining over a witness or otherwise, which may happen in case of delay in holding trial of a case.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Daily Star &amp; Protham Alo Patrika Vs.

P.C. have not been sent to the trial along with the record. The learned Deputy Attorney General submits that those were kept with the prosecution for safety reasons BLT that submission cannot be accepted. If the prosecution fells that those may be interpolated they may pray for keeping those in the safe custody of the trial court. These statement are vital documents and these cannot be withheld from the defence. These may be necessary for the defence to make out their own case. The accused has every right to look into these statements before any hearing takes place. For the ends of justice and for transparency in the trial these documents cannot be withheld and what has been done in the present case cannot be supported by any stretch of imagination. The prosecution in such a case is bound to send the statements recorded under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure along with the police report to the trial court. They cannot withhold these. We fail to understand why in this case the prosecution is playing hide and seek. The attitude of the prosecuting agencies is far from satisfactory. If the prosecution wants transparency in the trial they must come with clean hands. Any withholding of such documents will definitely affect the result of the case and this will cause prejudice to the defence. It appears that hearing under section 265 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of the petitioners of Criminal Petition No. 69 of 2000 is yet to be completed and in such circumstances before that date the originals should be produced before the trial court and if the prosecution fails to produce those the court may take adverse view on the genuineness or otherwise of the statements.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Major (Retd.)

Section 173(3A) and Section 190(l)(b) of the Code including if necessary, the case diary itself, so as to satisfy himself about the prima facie evidence against the accused persons and also about the probabilities of their guilt—the Magistrate must examine those materials and apply his mind before taking decision under Section 190(l)(b) of the Code however painstaking such exercise may appear to be, otherwise, the purpose for insertion of Sub-Section 3A would be frustrated and will be a fruitless idle formality.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

The learned Magistrate also look cognizance of the offence without ascertaining as to whether the complaint discloses any offence referred to Section 195 (1) clause (b) or clause (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The trial of a case under the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 1995, should not be delayed in the manner as is being in this case although the informant appeared and filed several application for cancellation of bail of the accused Shamsunnahar. He being the informant is the first witness in this case but the first witness, although being present in Court, has not been examined till today. We depricate this kind of delaytory tactics by keeping the accused in hajat for an indefinite period without knowing when the trial can be concluded. In such facts and circumstances, we find that the accused appellant is entitled to get benefit of section 339C Cr. P. C. for the purpose of bail.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sohel Vs.

Subsequently by Act 42 of 1992, repeal of the said law on 1st November, 1992- Held: We must admit that the Act 41 of 1992 there is no reference about its) retrospective effect. So it appears that the accused petitioners have retained vested right in getting the case disposed of within 240 days on receipt of the case by the triaK court and since the learned trial court failed to dispose of the case within the stipulated time i.e. within 240 days the learned Assistant Sessions Judge ought to have entertained the petition and thereby stopped the proceeding and release the accused petitioner therefrom.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Moklesur Rahman &amp; Ors Vs.

This is, no doubt, a valuable statutory right of the accused and it is by no means an idle ceremony or a mere routine-work for the trial Court. This provision of law is intended for the benefit of the accused and as such the trial Court is under an obligation to properly comply with the requirement of law so as to avoid any possible prejudice to the accused.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Due to careless exercise made by the trial Courts, sometimes the provisions of Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure are rendered nugatory necessitating remand of a case to the trial Court for removing the legal deficiency, causing unnecessary prejudice to the accused as well as to the prosecution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Alhaz Nurul Alam Chowdhury &amp; Anr.

Admittedly there is no eyewitness to the occurrence and there was not corroboration of the confessional statement of the co-accused implicating the accused respondent the accused respondent implicating in the case. — In that view of the matter in order to secure substantial justice in the case we are inclined to set aside the impugned judgment setting the aside conviction and sentence and sending back the case to the trial from the stage of his examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure while rejecting the reference.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

This section confers a valuable] right of the accused and at the same time gives an opportunity to the court to: administer justice in accordance with fundamental principle of criminal justice. It is eminent that it is the duty of the court to] question accused properly and fairly; bringing home to his mind in clear and simple language the exact case he has to, meet and each material point that is sought] to be made against him and of affording him a chance to explain them if he can and so desires. Sub-section 3 of Section 342 of the Code contains necessary support to the legal position that answers given by the accused] during such examination are intended to be considered by the court. The words "it may! be taken into consideration in such inquiry! or trial " in sub-section 3 of Section 342 of the Code would amount to a legislative guideline for the court to give due weight to such answers though it does not mean that such answers could be made the sole basis of any finding.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

P.C. was that as per advise of the informant A. Latif, he took his elder sister Aleya for working an his house, that they jointly worked at his] house at monthly wage of Tk.500/- but he did not pay their wages regularly, that Aleya used to sleep in the house of A. atif while he was sleeping in the shallow machine room, that Latif had developed illicit relationship with Aleya, for which, she became pregnant and that he shirked the responsibility upon Sirajul after killing her.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Held: The evidence of extra judicial confession is always taken as very weak type of evidence. The Courts require some material corroboration to such a confessional statement but from the evidence on record we find that the witnesses disclose the uttering of the accused in different manners. The surrounding circumstances and the evidence P.Ws.l, 2, 3 and 12, indicate that the informant on suppressing the real incident has set up this story. None of them corroborates each other as to the manner, the mode and the place of making extra judicial confession by the accused. In that view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove at accused Sirajul Islam has made any extra judicial confession in the manner as stated by it and that the defence version is more probable than that of the prosecution. The learned Sessions Judge has totally ignored the inconsistent statements of P.Ws.l, 2, 3 and 12 as regards their stories that the accused Sirajul has made extra judicial confession in their presence and convicted the condemned prisoner on the basis of his inconsistent extra judicial confession.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>State Vs.

Convict-appellant in the written statement presented full picture of the case programmed by him and explained circumstances which led PW 1 and his family member to implicate him in the false case. Convict-appellant, also, under a list placed papers and documents in support of the contents comprised in the written statement. Learned Trial Judge did not at all care to take into account the written statement and the documents and papers enclosed in the written statement in support of convict-appellant's innocence. Learned Trial Judge did not write a single word not to speak a sentence on the written statement and documents and papers enclosed with the written statement. Non-consideration of written statement and documents and papers in support of written statement by learned Trial Judge and his absolute silence on those caused a prejudice of a grave nature to convict-appellant and by non-consideration the merit of the decision of the case had been materially affected.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Kazi Mahbubuddin Ahmed Vs.

P. C. allegedly made extra-judicial confession (basis of conviction) and as such it is held that he could not have opportunity to give his reply about the same and in view of such facts and circumstances the basis of conviction (as claimed by the Trial Court) appears to have vitiated the entire findings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Asiruddin @ Asir Dakat &amp; Ors.

Abul Kalam was not murdered rather Abul Kalam had been depicted as the assailant who had given a farewell to the life of Masudul Islam and Masudul Islam was done to death.

Again the essence of the testimonies of prosecution witnesses and other incriminating circumstances had n been at all put to the convict-appellants, close exploration of the examination of t" convict-appellants and other accused persons under section 342 of The Co indicates that a synopsis of the accusation brought home against the convict-appellants and other accused persons had been put.
