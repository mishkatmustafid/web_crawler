On death reference High Court Division confirmed the death sentence. Appellate Division commuted it to one of life imprisonment.

A fine is a kind of financial punishment as distinguished from physical punishment and it must, therefore, be paid by the counvict under all normal circumstances. The accused has no option to plead that he will undergo imprisionment for a term fixed be the Court in lien of payment of the fine. If the accused is allowed to exercise his option, he can easily avoid the payment of fine by undergoing imprisonment for a fixed term for default in payment of fine and thereby frustrate the very purpose of impositions of the fine and defeat legislative intent. Fine being a charge upon the property of a convict as a public due, it continues to be so even after his death and it is recoverable from his successor-in-interest under the provisions of Section-386 C.P.C. A duty is cast upon the trial court to ensure recovery of the fine as promptly as possible.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Ali Hossain &amp; Ors. Vs.

It provides that any person who has been sentenced by a Metropolitan Magistrate, or a Magistrate of the first class (a District Magistrate is a Magistrate of the! first Class) or any person is sentenced under section 349 or in respect of whom a sentence has been made under section 380 by a Magistrate of the first class, may appeal^ to the Court of Session. In case of an Assistant Sessions Judge passes any sentence not exceeding five years, the convict may appeal to the Court of Sessions. Only exception is that if a person is convicted under section 124 A of the Penal Code by a Magistrate, his appeal lies to the High Court Division. The convicts have already undergone their sentences before they are taken up for admission hearing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ayar @ Ayaruddin &amp; Ors Vs.

Where, however, the facts alleged by the prosecution do not amount to an offence the plea of guilty of an accused cannot stand in the way of his acquittal an section 412 of the Code cannot bar an appeal from his conviction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Skeikh Mujibur Rahman @ Razibulla &amp; Ors.

This on confers a general right of appeal and thought the co-accused can only appeal as to his conviction and not as to his sentence, yet the other accused can appeal as to both.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ayar @ Ayaruddin &amp; Ors Vs.

This right to prefer appeal lies with the Government as contemplated under Section 417A(1) of the Cods of Criminal Procedure and the same can be preferred before the High Court vision only.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Tajul Islam &amp; Anr.

The State 12 BLT (HCD) 434</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-421 and Section 423</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The essential difference between the dismissal of an appeal under this section and its dismissal under section 423 is that in the latter case the appeal is disposed of after trial, whereas in the former the court summarily dismisses it, refuses to try it at all.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ayar @ Ayaruddin &amp; Ors Vs. The State 12 BLT (HCD) 434</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section- 422</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Notice in a criminal appeal- In a criminal appeal, that a complainant cannot have a right of ordinance once an accused is convicted on the basis of the complaint.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Kamal Mia Vs. Aleya Begum &amp; Ors. 6 BLT (HCD)-90</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section- 423</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If it is found that the accused had suffered a substantial part of the sentence imposed upon him or her in the mistrial, the Court may not for ends of justice direct a retrial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is no question that the court has undoubted right to direct a retrial where there has not been a trial in accordance with law. We are of the view that having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and particularly in view of the fact that in the meantime (During pendency of appeal in this Court) the appellant has continued to suffer imprisonment, it is a fit and proper case in which the High Court Division should consider the case on merit also and then pass whatever order or orders it thinks appropriate in the interest of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Asiman Begum Vs. The State 7 BLT (AD)-133</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section- 423</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When it is found after a full trial that there was a mistrial of trial without jurisdiction, the Court of appeal before directing a fresh trial by an appropriate Court should also see whether such direction should at all be given in the facts and circumstances of a particular case. </em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If it is found that there was no legal evidence to support the conviction then in that case it would be wholly wrong to direct a retrial because it would then be an useless exercise. Further, the prosection should not be given a change to fill up its lacuna by bringing new evidence which it did not or could not produce in the first trial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Asiman Begum Vs. The State 7BLT (AD)-133</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-423 read with Children Act, 1974 Sections-6 and 66(1)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the scrutiny of the record, we find some redeeming features and vital facts record to find that the question of accused appellant of being a child within meaning of the Children Act, 1974 unfortunately the defence did not prop and specifically did not press the is before the learned Tribunal urging upon ' to direct an enquiry to ascertain as whether he comes within any exception entitling him not be tried by the Tribunal the usual course, and the learned Spec Tribunal trialed him and convicted him, we find from the charge sheet that accused appellant Md. Monir Hossain 14-15 years on the day of submitting charge sheet against him on 24.09.1998. It also found form order No.6 dated 22.12.1998 from the order sheet of the S that the prayer for the accused appellant specifically grounded on the question of being a 'minor'. In the facts of the case, found that the question of the accused appellant of being a child was before learned Tribunal  although not specific pressed for an answer. Since the convict against the accused appellant is one imprisonment for life and the age of accused appellant on the date of framing charges against him is a matter of importance touching the jurisdiction of Court, we fee find it necessary in the interest of justice that the learned Special Tribunal should direct an enquire to satisfy himself to whether accused appellant Md. Monir Hossain was a child below 16 years of on the date of framing charges against on 31.11.1999</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Monir Hossain @ Monir Hossain Vs. State 9BLT (HCD)-285</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-424 </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Duty of the appellate Court</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An appellate Court while disposing a criminal appeal must formulate points for determination and the decisions thereon with reasons. Merely saying that the appellate court agrees with the findings of the trial without referring to material evidence on record is not a proper judgment in the eye of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Soleman Momin &amp; Anr. Vs The State &amp; Anr. 9BLT (HCD)-35</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section- 426</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under the rules of the High Court Division the officer is to prepare paper book criminal appeals and the appellant has no responsibility in the matter  unless he volunteers in his own interest- The court cannot put a fetter on the right of appeal of an accused by asking him to prepare paper book nor can it be made a condition for granting or extending bail already granted.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Obaidul Hoque Vs. The State 2 BLT (AD)-1</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Appellant Division do not approve granting bail to the petitioner when the appeals pending in the High Court Division the Petitioner should have moved the High Court Division again for hearing the appeal without paper book and if it was not possible to permit him to remain on bail.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Obaidul Hoque VS. The State 2BLT (AD)-1</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section- 426</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The appellants along with 6 others were under section 302/34 of the Penal Code and were acquitted. Against  the said judgment and order of acquittal, the State filed government appeal before the High Court Division. In such circumstances it will not be fair and reasonable to put the appellants behind the prison bar when they have already got an order of acquittal from competent court after a full-fledged trial. It may also be mentioned that as a measure of punishment bail should not be refused in case when an order of acquittal has been passed appellants are entitled to bail.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Hafiz Howlader &amp; Ors Vs.

It was observed in that case that in an appeal against a short sentence (2 years ringorous imprisonment as in the present case) bail should be ordinarily granted in the exercise of a proper discretion because usually it takes time to hear the appeal and within passage of the Period of sentence the appappeal becomes infructuous. The The learned Judge would be justified in refusing bail if he could ensure the disposal of the appeal within a reasonable time i.e. within 3-6 months, otherwise the refusal of bail will be manifestly unjust.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>AM Uddin Vs.

The learned Judges failed to consider that a minor's refusal to go with her father is not at all a material consideration regarding her custody.

She was put to judicial custody by the learned Magistrate in April. 1997 when she was produced before him. Since then she has been staying in a prison house except for a few days when she came out therefrom on getting adinterim bail from the High Court Division. It is entirely unacceptable that a young girl who is an innocent victim of the alleged offence should remain in an unwholesome atmosphere of a jail for an indefinite period. It is not known when the trial will conclude which, we have been informed, has however, started. The young girl cannot be allowed to walk away from the prison house of her own, because she has not independent place to stay. The parties have not been able to provide any answer to our query whether she could be put in a safe neutral home pending disposal of the case. The welfare of the girl, in our opinion, should be the deciding factor in such a situation. The appellant produced a certificate from the school where the girl was reading which corroborates the statement of the appellant that his daughter was a minor at the relevant time. The radiologists opinion also supports the appellants case. Having considered all aspects of the matter we are satisfied that it will be fit and proper and in the best interest of the girl if she is released from custody and given to the care of her father.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bashu Dev Chatterje Vs.
