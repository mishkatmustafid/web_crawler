I. R. and the charge sheet has been submitted; under section 302/323/34 of the Penal Code] The accused- Petitioner remained absconding and his father filed an application for withdrawal of the! prosecution against him- the Government has decided to withdraw the prosecution of the accused petitioner- under instructions of the public prosecutor. Assistant Public Prosecutor filed an application for] withdrawal of the Prosecution against the accused petitioner-Learned Sessions Judge by an order, rejected the petitioner for withdrawal on the grounds inter alia that there was no material before the Government for withdrawal from the] prosecution that the petitioner was at that time a fugitive from law, that the order of the Government was mala fide- Held: I appears that both the High Court Division and the learned Sessions Judge applied the independent minds in considering whether in the circumstances of the case the government's decision to withdraw from prosecution is immune from interference not. Cogent reasons have been given by both two Courts below- petition is dismissed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Imon @ Omar Mohammad Ashraf Vs.

Md.

It appears that before start of the trial, the special public prosecutor prayed for withdrawal from the prosecution—the government's order does not contain anything that there was consideration by the authority of the materials before taking the decision for the withdrawal. The only word used for the withdrawal is — It is well settled that the consent mentioned in Section-494 of the Code of Criminal procedure is not to be given mechanically. The court is to exercise its function judicially before giving such consent which implies that the Court will have to examine the materials on which the Government decides withdrawal of a case. In the instant case no reason/ground has been assigned for the withdrawal of the case and there is no indication that materials were considered before taking the decision and the Division Special Judge committed illegality in allowing withdrawal under the aforesaid circumstances.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Srimati Protiva Rani Dey (Tirtha)Vs.

Exercise of such discretion cannot ordinarily be questioned. Of course the discretion must be shown to have been exercised judicially.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs. Md. Amir Hamza 13 BLT (AD) 08</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section -494</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The expressions "either generally or in respect of any one or more offences" used in this section according to us is very significant. Though the section does not circumscribe the powers of the public prosecutor, the essential consideration which is implicit to accord consent is that it should be in the interest of administration of justice. It is either that the prosecution will not be able to produce sufficient evidence in support of the charge or that it will be difficult to predicate, on information as revealed subsequently would falsify the evidence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

It is also found from the record that driver Rahim recognized the accused in the T.I. Parade. Although subsequently he made contradictory statements about recognition of accused in the T.I. Parade and sworn an affidavit before the Notary Public. The truth or falsity of this document will be gone into at the trial. This affidavit cannot have any] bearing at the present moment in considering the question of bail of the accused respondent. Further, we also find that the accused respondent was found last in the company of the deceased just 45 minutes before the occurrence and this statement was also supported by other witnesses in their statements under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. That part, in the FIR there is also a mention of clear motive of the murder. By now polices has submitted charge sheet against the] accused under Section 302/34 of the Penal Code and the case records has already been] transmitted in the Court of Metropolitan] Sessions Judge for trial and next date has] been fixed for framing of the charge on 19.11.2000.

All persons charged with non-bail-able offences must be treated equally unless, of course, there are spec: circumstances   which   need spec' consideration in a particular facts of a ca Granting of anticipatory  bail is extraordinary remedy and as such in the c of accusations of non-bail-able offences anticipatory bail should not be granted the person should be directed to seek under Section 497 of the Code of Crimial procedure. The discretion of granting anticipatory bail shall not be exercised in unscrupulous and frivolous petitions just to avoid the Normal legal procedure. On vague and general allegations anticipatory bail should not be granted which will make a short circuit of judicial administration and will help the commission of further offences in the society. Anticipatory bail should be granted by the High Court Division for a limited period or till filling of the charge sheet, whichever is appropriate in the circumstances of the case. After expiry of the period or filing of the charge sheet, as the case may be, the accused must appear before the court concerned and obtain fresh bail from the Court on the merit of the case.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

The State 11 BLT (HCD)-78</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section -497</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The word "appears", “Surrender", "Custody", “court"</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Word "appears", Thus, means the appearance of a person who is required to surrender to custody under an order of arrest made against him and, therefore, the accused is to appear physically before the "Court" and the "Court" means the Court of Magistrate which has power to take cognizance of the offence/ case. The "appearance" before "Court" as contemplated under Section 497 (1) of The Code is definitely not "High Court Division". "Appearance" before "Court", thus, cannot be construed as "appearance" before "High Court Division" and is to be construed as "appearance" before "High Court Division" and is to be construed as "appearance" before "Magistrate". The High Court Division, therefore, does not possess power under Section 497 of The Code of grant bail to an accused person when he/she appears on surrender. The Magistrate before whom the accused person appears on Surrender will deal with bail matter and exercise discretion judiciously either granting bail or refusing to grant bail.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mrs. Laila Jerin Alias Laila Akhtar.

If the petitioner has any genuine apprehension of his arrest in connection with any cognizable offence, he should have move the Session Judge under section 498 of the Code without moving this court first by passing the Sessions Judge, Who has concurrent jurisdiction in the matter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

Before granting bail in a non-bailable case, the court when the case is at the investigation stage, should take into consideration various matters such as the nature and seriousness of the offence, the character of the evidence in support of the prosecution, the severity of the punishment to which the accused may be subjected, the danger of the accused abusing the concession of bail by way absconding and tampering with the evidence, the larger interest of the public or the state, whether the grant of bail would thwart the course of justice and similar other considerations. None of the above considerations is a sufficient reason for the grant of bail but any one those considerations can be a good ground for the refusal of bail. Putting the whole thing succinctly, the only objective that a Court dealing with an application for bail must keep in view that in no case there be any impediment in the progress of investigation/trial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Major (Retd) M.

The nature of change is al; vital factor. The punishment to which party may be liable, if convicted, also b upon the issue, In a charge of murder where specific part is attributed to accused, High Court Division will spa" exercise discretion in granting bail, only in a very exceptional cases where life of an accused is in imminent danger established by Medical evidence that the discretion may be exercised in granting bail—-judging in the touchstone of the principles regulating grant or refusal of bail and taking into account the entire picture presented, gravity of the offence and fact and circumstances of the case we are of this considered view that the accused petitioner cannot be at all favoured with concession of bail.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Captain (Rtd) Nurul Huda Vs.

Even though a Gazette Notification was published showing accused Ramizuddin to be an absconding accused and ordering his trial in absentia, there is absolutely no material to show that accused Ramizuddin had any knowledge about the proceeding even since it was started against him, as at all material times he was abroad. There are also no materials to support the informant- petitioner's allegations that accused- respondent Ramizuddin contested the informant-petitioner's various applications at any time he was abroad- In that view of the matter we do not think that the discretion exercised by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, affirmed by the High Court Division, calls for our interference.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Nimar Ali Vs.
