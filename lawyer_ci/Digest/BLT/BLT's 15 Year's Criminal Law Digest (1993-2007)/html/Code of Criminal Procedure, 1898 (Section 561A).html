Biscuit and others Vs. The State 1 BLT (HCD)-78</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-561A</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A person accused in a criminal case can only prefer an application under section 561 A, for quashing the said proceeding if he becomes previously unsuccessful in his application either under section 265C or 241 A, otherwise his application under section 561A shall be premature.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Tarini Mohon Ghosh Vs Gobinda Prashad Das 3 BLT (HCD)-102</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-561-A </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Remand- Held: We are of the view that the trial with respect to the petitioner's is vitiated for non-compliance of the mandatory provision of law and it should go back on remand to the trial court for giving an opportunity to the petitioner to cross-examine the P. Ws. and to try the case with aspect to the petitioner only in accordance with law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Khaleque @ Mona Vs. The State 5 BLT (HCD)-155</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-561A</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The first F. I. R. which was lodged at Shan Thana on 19.4.90 ended in charge-sheet dated 17.3.90 and the accused persons which included the present petitioners were on trial before the learned Additional Sessions Judge under section 395/397 of the Code which ended in the conviction of petitioners. The second F. I. R. which lodged with Nalcity Police Station also ended in charge sheet which was submitted 12.89 and the present petitioners were paced on trial before the learned Special Tribunal under section 19(a) and (f) of the Arms Act. On application for quashing of the proceedings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Held: It appears that the facts alleged in the present case are precisely those facts which have been alleged by the prosecution in the earlier dacoity case. During continuation of the investigation the I. O. recovered the rifle which was taken away by the petitioners and that was the alamat of the dacoity case. It is not the case of the prosecution that independent of the taken away of the rifle, the present fire arm was recovered from the possession of these petitioners. The recovery of the rifle by the Inspector was a part of the investigation of the dacoity case and there is no independent occurrence or acts in the recovery of the rifle- The second trial which is sought to be quashed is involving the offence punishable under section 19(a) of the Arms Act. But as this case occurred during the same transaction or arose from the same facts already decided by the Sessions Judge this cannot be allowed to be proceeded further as there is an express prohibition under section 403(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Apart from the prohibition against double jeopardy in this section. Article 35 of the Constitution also has the similar prohibition. So reading the provisions of section 403(1) (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure together there can be no doubt that in the facts and circumstances of the case the second trial appeared to us to be unwarranted. Though the second trial that is the present proceeding is with respect of different offences that is recovery of fire­arms but that arose out of the same transaction which was the subject matter of the dacoity case which ended in conviction of the petitioners though the charge-sheet has been submitted under section 19(a) of the Arms Act but the fact remains that the recovered fire arms is the subject matter of the earlier case for which the petitioners ought to have been charge under the appropriate section of the Penal Code for possessing the alamats of dacoity which has not been done into a separate proceeding has been initiated by the prosecution- we hold that the proceeding is illegal.

The power of the Magistrate to add legal representative on the death of any of the parties in a proceeding under section 145 of the said Code during the enquiry stage as provided under section 145(7) of said Code would thus extend to a Criminal  Revisions  pending  before the higher courts while examining the legality of an order passed in the proceeding section 145 of the Code and the said proceeding id not abate or become infructuous merely on the death of a particular parry during  the  proceeding  whether at the enquiry stage or at a revisional stage.

It can not be said therefore, that the High Court Division was wrong in holding and acting on the premise that the disputes between the parties origin out of a joint work should be settled in the Civil Court and the Criminal Court should not take cognizance of such a dispute- the quashing of the criminal proceeding, in our opinion has not caused any miscarriage of justice in the special circumstances of this particular case.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ansarul Haque Vs.

The officer in charge of the railway police submitted final report whereupon the Upazila Magistrate by his order accepted the same and discharged the accused- the informant being aggrieved by the said order took a revision to the Sessions Judge, who by his order directed the Magistrate to make further enquiry into the matter. The accused then filed an application u/s561A Cr. P.

His order could not, in any view, be said to be an order without jurisdiction. That being so, it must be said that the application of the petitioners before the High Court Division under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure was wholly misconceived.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

In this case there is specific allegation that the alleged offence of rape was committed by a police personnel who allegedly committed rape was let off and respondent No. 2 has been charge sheeted. It is a case of public interest where there is allegation of overt act against the police personnel posted in the Court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and in the interest of transparency and visible administration of justice there is no impediment to a judicial inquiry as ordered by the High Court Division. The High Court Division has not committed any wrong in directing holding of judicial inquiry which will be in addition to the police report already submitted.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

This section emphasized that the Supreme Court in its High Court Division has the widest jurisdiction to pass orders for ends of justice and for that purpose to entertain applications not contemplated by the Code. The inherent power can be exercised for either of the 6 purposes mentioned in the section although the purpose stated are illustrative, exhaustive. The inherent power of the court is undefined and indefinable. It is well set that the paramount consideration exercising power under section 561A of Code of Criminal procedure is that such order will prevent abuse of the process any court or otherwise it would secure ends of justice. We hold that no illegality and wrong have been committed by the High Court Division in exercising its inherent power which has been initiated by respondent No. 1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

But after failure to do so, he did not take any further step whatsoever in the higher forum to get him added in the Civil Suit and he himself also did not file any Civil Suit. Another very important aspect of the case is that the complainant himself has. obtained a document of purchase in respect of some portion of the case land on 11.02.1990. So he is a later purchaser and the document of the accused persons being of 1978, it is an earlier one —Held : Under the aforesaid circumstances as we understand, only civil suit can resolve this legal conflict finally effectively and we find prima facie that the criminal liability cannot be pushed upon the accused-petitioners and consequently, trial if held against the accused-petitioners it will be an abuse of process of law and Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Moulana Abdul Hakim @ Abdul Makim &amp;Ors.

We have noticed that in the FIR the informant stated that his daughter was 17 years old and was a student of second year of Higher Secondary Certificate. In course of investigation of the case, the victim made a statement under Section-164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure wherein she stated that she was 18 years old. In the Kabinnama, her age has been mentioned as 19 years old. The occurrence took place of 16.11.1993 and at present, the victim is about 25 years old. Considering all these aspects, we are of the opinion that victim Nasima Aktar was not below 18 years old at the time of occurrence and therefore, the allegations made in the FIR do not attract Section-366A of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have also noticed the statement of the informant made before us that his daughter Nasima Aktar is now an expectant mother. Since the informant, father of victim, has accepted the marriage condisering the welfare of his daughter, although the offence charge in non-compoundable, we feel that the ends of justice will be secured if we accept the prayer made by the informant and record an order of compounding the offence. On the contrary, if we reject the prayer entail unnecessary harassment to the parties. Law encourages composition of offences and in the instant case we feel it necessary for carrying out the other provisions of the Code and also for doing justice for prevention abuse of the process of the court by invoking the inherent powers of the court —Accordingly we accept the application filed by the informant for compounding the offence and it is allowed for the interest of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shajedul Alam Chowdhury Vs.

Where the question of the custody of property like vessel in the present case, we are of the opinion that Magistrate instead of entering into investigating the title of the rival claimants, it is his duty to decide expeditiously who is the person prima facie entitled to possession thereof and handover its possession to him for avoiding great loss that has sustained when it was kept unused, for sustained when it was kept unused, for ensuring the vessel in the same condition as it was at the time of its seizure and to produce before the court as and required.

But in this case, the learned Magistrate has not followed this mandatory provision of law and rejected the petition on an erroneous ground which is not sustainable in law. The learned Magistrate even did not register a complaint case after receiving the Naraji petition which was obligatory on his part to register the same and ought to have proceeded with the case as a complaint case.

There is nothing in the FIR that at the time of taking loan in the petitioner made any promise with the complainant that he will return the money within a specific time or of date and we also do not find any allegation of inducement for getting the loan money from the complainant. Rather we find from the FIR that the accused took the money from the informant as loan for business purpose as such in the allegation we do not find any ingredient of instrustment or that the money was taken with any specific promise or inducement. Thus in the absence of such definite allegation it cannot be held that taking of money as loan and subsequent failure or refused by itself shall constitute criminal offence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

According to the accused, they were given entire termination benefits on calculation — Held : The complainants may take recourse to such remedies when the entitlement of complainants are ascertained, Since the Labour Court passed general order conferring termination benefits, it has no Jurisdiction to determine the quantum under section 26 of the employment of Labour (Standing orders) Act, 1965,. It can punish an offender for refusal or failure to comply with a definite order of ascertained sum. The complainants in the instant cases instead of proceeding under Section 26 of the Employment of Labour (Standing Orders) Act, which is the only provision applicable in their cases made the complaints under different sections including  Section  55  of the Industrial Relations Ordinance which is altogether different and the said provision is not at all applicable in the face and circumstances the case. Even, if it is assumed that proceedings were legally initiated under Section 55 of the Industrial Relation Ordinance, although it were required to be initiated under Section 26 of the Employment of Labour (Standing Order) Act, 1965, for the reasons as discussed above, we are of the opinion that the allegations made in the complaint do not disclose an offence either under Section 2(9<br/>of the Employment of Labour (Standing Orders) Act or under Section 55 of the Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1969.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Daily Banglar Bani Vs.

The Court is obviously could not shut its eyes to the apparent infirmities in the case and as such in order to prevent abuse of the process of the Court or otherwise to secure ends of justice, such exercise of jurisdiction becomes imperative in order to avoid any unnecessary harassment to the accused under the garb of dispensation of justice. But in doing so the Court could not enter into merit as to the allegation at the initial stage soon after the investigation unless the illegality is apparent on the face of the allegation which do not constitute an offence or there is legal bar to proceed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.
