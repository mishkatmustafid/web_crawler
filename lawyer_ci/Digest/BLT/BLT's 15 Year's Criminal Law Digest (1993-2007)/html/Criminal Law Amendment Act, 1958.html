In the absence of such sanction the whole proceeding before the learned Special Judge has been reduced lo an exercise in fertility causing unnecessary harassment to the accuses with the result that there has been no trial in the eye of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

By no stretch of imagination it can not be said that Managing Director or an employee of a Private Limited Company registered under Companies Act is a local authority or statutory corporation or a body corporate, therefore  a  Managing  Director  or an employee  of Private  Limited Company registered under the Companies Act, 1913 not be said to be public servant within ling of section 2(b) of the Criminal Amendment Act only because the firm was registered under the Companies Act to start functioning.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Khurshid Alam &amp; Ors.Vs.

S .P. was asked to submit a report upon holding an inquire into the complaint made- the grievance of the appellant is that the learned Special Judge Committed a two fold wrong (1) is not having acted in terms of the proviso to section 6(5) of the Act and (2) having called for a report, of all persons, from the A. S. P. when senior officers above him were complained against- Held: In the Present case it cannot be said that the learned Special Judge has acted with sound discretion in asking the A. S. P. to hold an inquire when admittedly officers much above him have been made accused in the case- The order passed by the learned Senior Special Judge is found to be wholly unsustainable in that he has failed to comply with the proviso to section 6(5) of the Act which, on all accounts, was a first step that was required to be taken by him, on receipt of the complaint.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mr. Abdur Rahim Vs.

O but meanwhile accused ceased to be a public servant and the 10 therefore without any sanction order from the Govt. submitted the charge sheet-Thus at the time of taking cognizance, the accused was not a public servant and therefore there was not necessary of any sanction from the Government for the prosecution of this accused-appellant- Relied on 27 DLR (AD) 35.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

It would not bind the successors of the deceased. But a criminal dispute as to ownership and possession of a property being of civil nature and as an\ finding in that regard by a court would bind even the heirs, the successors of the deceased ought to be implemented by court as a matter of its legal duty.

State 3 BLT (HCD)-187</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It appears that though final report submitted by the investigation officer the  court took cognizance against the petitioner cannot be said committed any illegality the fact remains non-examination of, informant and the investigating officer the prosecution in the case without explanation whatsoever highly prejudiced the petitioners in their defence as they deprived of their valuable right of examination- Prejudice is raised.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Hakim &amp; Ors Vs. The State 5 BLT (HCD)-32</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If it is found that the accused had suffered a substantial part of the sentence imposed upon him or her in the mistrial, the court may not for ends of justice direct a retrial. There may be other extenuating circumstances which may impel a court to take a lenient view in favour of the accused. But there is no question that the court has undoubted right to direct a retrial where there has not been a trial in accordance with law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Asiman Begum Vs. The State 6 BLT (AD)-279</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Doubtful- The evidence of P. Ws. are full of contradictions, inconsistencies and omissions and there is a departure from the fact as stated in written ejahar. Moreover it appears that all the P. Ws. are brothers, sisters and brother in- law. Not a single unrelated disinterested witness has been examined in the case. So non-examination of disinterested and vital witness makes the prosecution case doubtful.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The accused appellant Golam Hossain Pintu was the sitting member of the Union Parishad with the informant Chairman at the relevant time. In that view of the matter also it appears to us that it is an improbable matter that a sitting member will go to commit dacoity in the house of his own Chairman of the same village.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Pear Ali Khan Vs. The State 7 BLT (HCD)-59</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Doubtful by a perusal of the impugned judgment. It appears that the learned Assistant Sessions Judge has observed that this appellant Pear Ali could not produce any receipt showing his purchasing this camera as found in his possession. But the fact remains that the informant party also could not produce any receipt showing that they have purchased this camera nor did they describe the nature and feature of the camera in the list of stolen articles enclosed with the ejahar. In such a position and in the absence of identifying witness, we find that the Assistant Sessions Judge is not justified in convicting and sentencing the accused appellant Pear Ali only on the ground that he could not show any receipt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Pear Ali Khan Vs. The State 7 BLT (HCD)-59</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Evidence about the actual age of the accused petitioner- In the instant case we find that the accused appellant was regular student of class IX at the time of commission of the offence and he is aged about 14 years when the court examined him under Section 342 Cr. P. C. Except those there is no other evidence about the age of the accused appellant- we have reasons to accept the age written by the court as the approximate age of the accused appellant.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Shamim Vs. The State  7 BLT (HCD)-305</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Want of jurisdiction— trial of non-schedule offence with a schedule offence—the offence of kidnapping or abduction has been made a schedule offence under the Special powers Act. 1974 (Act XIV of 1974) as an offence under Section 4 of the Cruelty to Women (Deterrent Punishment) Ordinance, 1983 (Ordinance, No LX of 1983) and exclusively triable by a special tribunal established under the Act, On the other hand, an offecne under Section 494 of the Penal Code is made triable by a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Magistrate of First class. Trial of such non-schedule offence with a schedule offence of kidnapping or abduction is also not permissible.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Butul Rabidas &amp; Anr. Vs. The State 9 BLT (HCD)-145</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case the learned trial court as well as the learned court of appeal below failed to consider the defence case and the evidence and circumstances learning support to it in their true perspectives. It is well settled that if the defence plea appears to be reasonably true, although the accused may not be able to prove it, of reacts upon the entire prosecution case and the accused is entitled to get the benefit of doubt not as a matter of grace but as a matter of right. In this case the defence has succeeded in making the defence plea reasonably possible and the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubts, the accused petitioners are certainly entitled to acquittal on benefit on doubt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ugradev Paik Vs. The State  8 BLT (HCD)-8</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Conviction under Section-376 of the Penal Code—Circumstantial evidence —Benefit of doubt—It is an accepted maxim of law that man may lie but circumstances do not. This is why in the absence of any direct witness a well-knit chain of circumstances excluding all reasonable hypotheses of the innocence of the accused may alone form the basis of conviction against an accused. In our case under review, the vital circumstances surrounding the story of rape allegedly committed by accused Mansur Ali on victim Sufia Begum before the very eyes of Monowara Begum is by no means a matter which is amenable to reason and prejudice. It is unfortunate that this vital circumstantial evidence escaped the attention of the learned Special Tribunal while convincing the accused appellant on a charge of grave offence involving rape, for the facts and circumstances of the case an the inconsistencies and contradictions in evidence of the P.Ws. regarding condition of victim Sufia Beg immediately after the occurrence made wide room for doubts regarding the guilt the accused appellant. The inordinate del in lodging the FIR has not also b satisfactorily proved by the prosecution which makes the prosecution case worse, am, therefore, inclined to hold that prosecution has not been able to prove charge against the accused appellant beyond reasonable  doubts  and  the accused therefore entitled to the benefit of doubt</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mansur Ali Bepari Vs. The State 8 BLT(HCD)-164</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">We are of the view that this is a new fact brought to our notice at the time of hearing of the Rule. The petitioners may make prayer before the Metropolitan Sessions Court for ascertaining which of the statements were written by the I.O. anf which were not and then the court will be in position to find out the identity of the person or persons who wrote some of those statements. Then that court will also be of liberty to decide the legal consequences after ascertaining the fact.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Nurul Islam Monzoor &amp; Ors. Vs. The State 8 BLT (HCD)-1</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is no dispute that in all 130 metric tons of wheat were allotted in installments for construction and construction of road from Gouranga Bazar Balarhat and there is no dispute about the duty of the project implementation officer P.W. 8 who was in charge of supervision of the said project. We have already found earlier that this P.W. 8 failed to state as to when he visited the project in question nor he has come with any measurement book showing pre-measurement and post-measurement of the project in question. So, anything claimed by the prosecution regarding the completion of the project in question or alleged misappropriation of the wheat in question deserves no consideration without any proof about the pre-measurement and post-measurement of the project in question and since P.W. 8 the Project Implementation Officer who was in charge of the project in question failed to state as to when he visited the project in question and there being no scrap of paper to show the measurement and post-measurement of the project in question we are led to hold that the prosecution has hopelessly failed to prove about the alleged work done by the accused persons in respect of the project in questions. So the allegation of misappropriation of the wheat in question cannot be conceived of.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, it appears that the accused appellant, for the reason best known to them have deposited the claimed amount and as such there is no scope to hold the accused-appellants guilty for the offence</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Abdul Motaleb Mia Vs. The State 8 BLT (HCD)-181</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case the appellant-offender, was dozing and yawning in the Court room and the learned Magistrate proceeded under Section-480 of the Code of Criminal procedure and took cognizance against him wider Section-228 of the Penal Code. But he either framed any charge under Section­242 of the Code nor recorded the statement of the offender under Section-234 of the Code, as such, the mandatory provision of Section-481 of the Code were not complied with, it was fatal to the trial and rightly so held by the learned Sessions Judge in allowing the appeal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Moshiur Rahman Vs. The State 8 BLT (HCD)-209</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case, the facts as emerge from the order sheet, show that the offender though an accused, dozed of in his chair and also yawned from time to time but when charged with the offence of contempt promptly begged to be excused. The facts do not show that he was at all warned of his conduct and that in defiance of such warning he continued to doze and yawn recklessly and willfully with intent to shoe disrespect and also to interrupt the proceedings of the Court. In the facts and circumstances of the present case, when the offender begged to be excused the matter ought to have been dropped.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Moshiur Rahman Vs. The State 8 BLT (HCD)-209</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a criminal trial, the prosecution has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, on the basis of evidence. No doubt the victim if available generally is also a witness, but the case can still proceed even in the absence of the victim himself on the basis of evidence of other witnesses. As such, the judgment and order passed by the learned Sessions Judge in criminal revision is also illegal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mohammad Nazrul Islam Chowdhury &amp; Ors. Vs. Abul Bashar Chowdhury &amp; Ors. 8 BLT (HCD)-220</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">To prove the plea of alibi—We hold the view that the burden of proving a plea of alibi or any other plea specifically set up by accused who is the husband of the deceased or the wife or the in-laws of the deceased is on him of absolving him of criminal liability. This burden is a bit lighter than that of the prosecution, because the court is to consider his plea only after the prosecution leads evidence in support of the charge, and not before. When the prosecution failed to prove that the husband was in the house, when his wife was murdered, he cannot be saddled any onus to prove his innocence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Yunus &amp; Ors.

No/. 72 of 1988 without verifying the original thereof and thereby facilitated the commission of the offences. He ought to have been made an accused in the case as an abettor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Sirajuddin Sheik vs. The State 8 BLT (HCD)-22</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner tried to impress that as there was delay in the examination of the viscera by the chemical examiner his report can not be relied upon. But in support of his submission he failed to place any decision on this count. Further it appears that the chemical examiner deposed that poison was detected in the viscera. But during cross-examination it has not been suggested that due to late examination there may be defect on the result of such examination. When the chemical examiner was not confronted on the quality of viscera we find nothing to doubt or disbelieve the report</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Afzal Hossain Mondal Vs. The State 9 BLT (AD)-25</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is well settled that if a non-schedule offence is included in the trial of a schedule offence the trial does not necessarily become void or without jurisdiction entirely. But question may be raised as to whether the accused was prejudiced by such joinder and in a particular case there may be necessity to set aside such a trial and direct fresh trial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Aminul Islam @ Ranga &amp; Ors. Vs. The State 8 BLT (AD)-129</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Relating to the identification—a T. I. parade to be dependable must satisfy certain conditions. In the first place, the accused should be unknown to the identifying witness by name, secondly he must not having had any opportunity to see the accused after the occurrence in connection with which he is put up for identification and thirdly the identifying witness makes no mistake, except to a most negligible character, in matter of identification. If the accused w known to the witness by name from before of occurrence he would disclose the name the accused immediately after occurrence and at any rate to Investigating Officer and in that case question of his figuring as a witness in a T.I. parade will not arise. His identification the known accused in a test identification parade will thus become meaningless and similarly if the witness has had an opportunity to see the accused after the commission of the crime in relation to which the latter is put up for identification there will be no difficulty on the part of the witness to pick up the suspect from among any number of persons. If a witness makes a mistake in identifying a person placed in the T.I. parade, there is no guarantee that a similar mistake will not be committed by him with regard to other suspects. It may not be out of place to mention here that the delay which matters in a T.I. parade is the delay from the date of occurrence and not from the date of arrest of the accused as human memory fades with lapse of time and when the T.I. parade is held after long delay horn the time of commission of crime, the chances to mistake increases.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mirja Abdul Hakim &amp; Ors.

Ful Mia 7 BLT (AD) -337</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Trial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Evidence- Appreciation of- Non-seizure of the lantern- It is in evidence that there was a lantern in the shop of P. W. 2 Akkel Ali and there were also other shops in the vicinity of the place being a market place and the time being soon after dusk it is expected in natural circumstances that there would be light in and around the shop to carry on business transactions. Apart from this, all the eye witnesses stated that both the informant party and the accused came from the same village. Behula and the eye witnesses were also from the same village. All these eye witnesses stated that they knew Ful Mia from before. That apart, it is in the evidence of the eye witness that accused Ful Mia was also taking at the relevant time with them. So there can be no difficulty in recognizing the accused who was known from before. The learned Single Judge disbelieved the story of recognition primarily because the investigating officer did not seize the lantern from the shop of P. W. 2 Akkel Ali. It is very surprising that non- seizure of the lantern can be a material consideration for holding that the eye witnesses could not recognize the accused at the time of occurrence. The learned Single Judge was absolutely wrong in holding that recognition was highly doubtful by discarding the positive evidence of the eye witnesses and also the natural circumstances of the time and place of occurrence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

T .1. appearing in the loan bond in his name is not his signature or L. T. I. Under such circumstances, mere casual denial by a witness that he did not take any loan by executing the loan bond is not sufficient to hold that he did not actually take any loan executing the loan bond in the face of the clear assertion by the defence that the loanees are real persons who actually received the loans on executing loan bonds. In the circumstances, what is apparent in the face of the record has to be take as real unless the contrary is proved by convincing evidence.

In view of the above discussion and on careful consideration of position of eye witnesses it is very difficult to reply upon their evidence. In the face of omission on vital points and without giving sufficient reason and discarding those omissions and contradictions, relying upon investigation of the case and on some assumption, came to an erroneous finding against the accused persons.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On a careful consideration of the evidence on record particularly eye witnesses, we find and held that the prosecution have failed to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubt and that the appellants are entitled to get the benefit of doubt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Alam Howlader Vs.

Ws. found to have corroborated the same like a parrot. So, it appears that it has been well proved that accused-appellant Asiruddin made extra­judicial confession before a police personnel (P. W. 1) which was heard by private witnesses and others. In view of such facts and circumstances we are constrained to hold that the alleged extra-judicial confession made by accused-appellant Asiruddin followed by recovery of some pieces of bones by digging of earth by him (accused Asiruddin) is of no avail to the prosecution in as much the alleged extra­judicial confession cannot be treated as legal evidence in this case.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Asiruddin @ Asir Dakat &amp; Ors.

W. 1 the informant, victim herself admitted on dock that she went to police station on 6.11.2000 and reported the occurrence which was reduced to writing, but the same has not been brought on record inasmuch as the reporting which was made on 6.11.2000 prior to the present F. I.R. is the F. I. R. of this case and the present one should not be treated as F. I. R. inasmuch as the same may be treated as statement under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In absence of the F. I. R./G. D. entry or the statement about the occurrence so made by the informant-victim earlier on point of time (on 6.11.2000) at the local police station we are of opinion that the present F. I.

Seizure demonstrates that seizure was effected 15 A.M. on 3.8.1997. By the evidence of  PW 12 (investigating officer) the seizure incriminating dagger on 3.8.1997 stands bulldozed.

Although no arms were recovered from their possession it is apparent  that  they  were  with accused Mokim Gazi when revolver shots and cocktails were thrown at the police party. The accused petitioners therefore cannot claim exemption from the ambit of possession of arms and ammunition. There may not be separate arms and ammunition in the possession of the two accused-petitioners but when all of them were jointly together and the police party was receiving revolver shots and cocktails it cannot be said that the revolver and the cartridges recovered from Mokim Gazi were only in his exclusive possession.

In the meantime, the victim girl has been living with the accused respondent No. 2 and it has been stated in his concise statement that the girl has given birth to a son on 17.3.97 and they have been maintaining conjugal life peaceful. We do not know what would have been the fate of the case if the investigation of the case was not quashed by the High Court Division nor do we know what will be the outcome of the case if ivestigation is permitted to be started as of now. These considerations, however, do not weigh with us in deprecating the illegal and improper manner in which the proceeding has been quashed by the High Court Division.
