The appellants are in custody since 1990- Held: We have heard with some compassion mixed with pity the present plight of the foreigner- appellants and we feel that because of the special alien situation in which the two foreigner-appellants now find themselves in it will be proper for us to exercise our discretion a little more, as we find that this is a fit case, as it stands now, to administer justice tempered with mercy. We have accordingly decided that the sentence of two foreigner appellants may be reduced to rigorous imprisonment for 7 years.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Bernhard Rudigar &amp; Anr.
