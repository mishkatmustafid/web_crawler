It may be stated here that the defence is not always bound to give any explanation but if any explanation is given the court may consider it. The trial court after discussing and considering the evidence of witnesses found that Chapa was killed by somebody from inside the room and not by any one from outside the room through the window as claimed by the accused. The High Court Division in its turn held the same view. The High Court Division in clear terms held that it was not possible for any outside-miscreants to cause such injuries standing on nine inches wide carnish on the face and head of Chapa and kill her. The High Court Division thus in unequivocal terms expressed the clear view that the explanation given by the defence totally falls through and according to the High Court Division it was established that Chapa was killed in her room by the miscreants who were living within the house, went into her room, caused injuries in such manner that ultimately she succumbed to the injuries. In view of such concurrent findings of both the courts below on the basis of evidence on record we do not like to make further exercise on the point and we also are of the view that Chapa must have been killed by person/persons living inside the house on the night of occurrence.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>The State Vs.

P.Ws. 14 and 16 have stated that they got this information from P.W. 4 in their house and in hospital immediately after the occurrence. All other P.Ws. also heard from P.W. 4 that he saw these two accused running away from the place of occurrence-—This strong circumstance lends support to the presence of the accused persons at night in the plan of occurrence.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Md.

In this case besides the oral evidence the prosecution also relied upon the circumstantial evidence. Admittedly Niru died at the house of this condemned-prisoner, her husband and naturally there cannot be any eye witness of the occurrence from the side of her father nor the someone from the house of the condemned-prisoner would depose in support of the murder or on the factum of assault by this prisoner upon the deceased. In such a situation the prosecution had no other alternative but to rely on the circumstantial evidence. In such circumstances when the wife met with her death while she was in the custody of her husband it is he who is to explain how she met with her death. The defence tried to impress that she was assaulted at her father's house by her relations who thereafter kept her forcibly at the house of this condemned-prisoner but none of the prosecution witnesses or even D. W. 1 has admitted this. No other defence witness was examined to prove this defence version of the case. According to the defence she was kept in the house of the condemned-prisoner at the date of occurrence which he stated in his statement recorded under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He also stated that he saw his wife in injured condition. But he took no step for her treatment or inform any of the co-villager of the incident. It appears that he allowed his wife to die and even after her death he has not informed any of the co-villager or reported the matter to the police which is admittedly at a distance of 3 kilometers from his house. None of the inmates of the house also informed the police or took any medical help for saving the life of the deceased suggested that she was assaulted by the prosecution witnesses but no evidence was led in support of this suggestion. The witness produced by the condemned-prisoner also is silent as to the circumstances leading to the death of the deceased.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Abdul Motleb Howalder Vs.

The defence has not challenged that the accused were not present in the house of Malek Mia.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Where Dhan Mia died on the night of occurrence, no suggestion was given to that effect that they were elsewhere. A suggestion was given to P.W. 6 that Meherunnessa and her son Sibu were not present. Meherunnessa was not convicted for murder. As regards Sibu, P.W. 2 stated that she saw him. Therefore the complicity of appellants in the murder of Dhan Mia been established by the prosecution beyond any doubt. The prosecution also has been able to prove the first circumstance support of the prosecution case deceased Dhan Mia along with P.Ws. went to his father-in-law's house to bring wife Moina. P.W. 2 has satisfactorily proved that she stayed in that house and that she been all the accused at night in the east hut, thus is he second circumstance prove against the accused. After the murder of Dhan Mia, the accused got a false lodged through Meherun Nessa with the police stating that Dhan Mia committed suicide with malafide intention of screening them (accused) from legal punished although they believed that the information given to the police was false. This is another circumstance P.W. 11 holding examination on the persons of deceased found injuries and clearly opined that the death was due to the said injuries, the defence could not satisfactory explanation as to how Dhan sustained such injuries. This is an circumstance proved against the acc Since the plea taken by the defence has not been substantiated by them or injuries alternative, having found false in vie the medical evidence on record, and we find that the accused were present place of occurrence when the deceased the prosecution has been able to prove a strong circumstance of the complicity accused in the murder of Dhan Mia excluding all other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Yunus &amp; Ors.

Moreover, P.W. 17 found only one injury causing the death and that injury was caused by the appellant and the search for money was also made by the appellant as per the confessions then how the confessions could be treated to be inculpatory. As stated earlier, the Court found that there is not an iota of evidence on record from any of the witnesses examined by the prosecution implicating the appellant with the offence or any other accused persons. All three confessions if closely considered, do not inspire any confidence in anyjudicial mind. So, this a clear case of no evidence.

Then, in the early morning Firoja Begum found lying dead on the south bank of the canal and Abdur Rouf was also found lying with her, of course with a cut injury at his neck. Nobody came between them in the intervening time. It would not be difficult for him to strangulate her to death, when he was holding her.

The offence can be proved by circumstantial evidence also.
