Moniruzzaman  Vs. ANM Deydar-e-Alam &amp; Ors. 10 BLT (HCD)-415</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-138 </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case the cheque was presented to the bank after expiry of months from the date of drawing of 6 cheque. So, obviously this case under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act is not maintainable in view of restriction imposed by provision (a) to said section.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Alhaj M.A. Majid Vs. Md. Abdul Motaleb 10 BLT (HCD)-459</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section - 138</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The term "refer to drawer"- Criminal Liability</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The term "refer to drawer" is a  courteous way. adopted by the bank to show it's inability to honour the cheqve for want of funds. It is also found under the scheme of the Act the offer punishable under section 138 would complete only upon the failure by drawer to pay within fortnight receipt of notice from the payee dishonour of the cheque. When fails to make such payment within period specified in clause(C) proviso the offence is complete.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mrs. Nazma Begum &amp; Ors. Vs Habibullah &amp; Anr. 14 BLT (HCD)-08</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section - 138 read with Section - 141</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since the amount shown in cheque Ext-2 does not satisfy the demand of Tk.18,00,000= shown in the complaint petition in terms of agreement ext. certainly it will come within the scope of Civil Court; not in Criminal Court under section 138( 1) read with section 1141 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 as contended by the Petitioners Counsel</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Held: I find no scope to say that civil court is the only forum to agitate the grievances of the complainant as contended by the learned Advocate for the petitioner rather subsection (3) of section 138 gives additional authority to the civil court to satisfy the complaint if any other grievance are found to be left out.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mrs. Nazma Begum &amp; Ors. Vs. Md. Habibullah &amp; Anr. 14 BLT (HCD)-08</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-138</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It appears that the accused petitioners are being Managing Director and Directors of a private company, named 'Salex Apparel Limited' issued 2 cheques of Taka 6,50,000/- in favour of the complainant opposite party No.2 and on presentation, those cheques in the bank for encashment, were bounced and then, after due compliance with the formalities, which are required under the law, the complainant opposite party No.2 filed the petition of complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act against the accused petitioners and thereupon, the learned Magistrate took cognizance under Section 138 of the Act and therefore, we are of the view that the proceeding of the instant case does not suffer from any legal infirmity, rather it is well founded in law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sahajahan Bhuiya &amp; Ors Vs. The State &amp; Anr. 14 BLT (HCD) 398</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section—138(b)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Though the appellant presented the cheque on four dates but after the cheque was dishonoured for the last time on 26.10.2000, he served the required notice on 06.11.2000, well within, statutory period and as such filing of the instant complaint on 11.12.2000 cannot be regarded as illegal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Munshi Md. Rashed Kamal Vs. Abdus Salam and Anr. 13 BLT (AD) 158</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section - 138(C)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant both the cases, it appears that no date has been mentioned as to when the notice was served upon the accused petitioner. Furthermore after issuance of the notice dated 25.10.2004, the complainant again presented the cheque on 28.11.04 which was dishonored but no notice was issued upon the accused petitioner and as such the Criminal Proceeding against the accused petitioner are abuse of the process of the court and liable to be quashed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>S. P. Marma Vs. State &amp; Ors. 14 BLT (HCD)393</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Section -140</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It appears that when any offence under this Act has been committed by a company and it is proved that the offence has been committed with the consent or connivance by any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the  company,  such director, manager, secretary or other shall be deemed to be guilty of that offence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sahajahan Bhuiya &amp; Ors Vs.

Anisuzzaman Vs. The State &amp; Ors. 12 BLT (HCD) 22</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sections- 138 and 141 Read with The Penal Code, 1860 (XLV of 1860) Section- 420</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have carefully considered the provisions of section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which puts a bar on taking cognizance of an offence punishable under section 138 thereof except upon a complaint in writing made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque. It is clear that an offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is for dishonour of a cheque simpliciter for insufficiency of fund, etc., whereas an offence under section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating is a distinct offence. The rule of law about the peremptory application of the special law in place of the general law for trial of an offence hardly applies when the offences are distinct under the two laws.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.
