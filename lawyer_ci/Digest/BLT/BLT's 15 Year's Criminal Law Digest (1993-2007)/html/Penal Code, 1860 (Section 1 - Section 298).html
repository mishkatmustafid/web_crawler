The essence of that liability is to be found in existence of common intention animating accused leading to doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention. The distinct feature of section 34 is the element of "Participation in action".</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

If more than one person intentionally do an act jointly, it is just same as if each of them has done it individually. Common intention requires a prior concert of all the accused and the accused can be convicted if such an intention to commit the crime has been shared by all the accused.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The Solicitor Vs. Medher Ali &amp; Ors 12 BLT (HCD)-69</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-34</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Common intention on the part of all accused persons is very much absent. No evidence came forth that there had been prior concert or prior meeting and or pre-plan or there had been subsequent development of common intention amongst accused persons to wipe out Munir (PW 3) and Khaled. Charge of section302/34 and 325/34, thus, fell and conviction If offence of section 302/34 and 325/34 became unsustainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

It is a rule of evidence Hi does not create a substantive offence. The section gives statutory recognition to common sense principle that if more than persons intentionally do a thing jointly, it is just the same as if each of them had done it individually. A common intention presupposes prior concert, which requires a prearranged plan of the accused participating in an offence. Such pre-concert or preplanning may develop on the spot or during the course of commission of the offence but the crucial test is that such plan must precede the act constituting an offence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs Mehdi Hasan @ Modern &amp; Ors. 13 BLT (HCD)-151</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section -34</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The distinct feature of section 34 is the element of Participation in action</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A common intention pre-supposes prior concert. It require a pre arranged plan because before a man can be vicariously convicted for the criminal act of another the act must have been in furtherance of common intention of all of them, Accordingly, there must have a prior meeting of minds. Unless a common intention is established as a matter of necessary inference from the proved circumstance the accused person will be liable for his individual act and not for the act done any other person. For an inference of common intention to be drawn for the purpose of section 34 of the evidences, circumstance of the case should establish without any room for doubt that a meeting of minds and fusion of ideas had taken place amongst different accused and in prosecution of it over acts of the accused persons flowed out as if in obedience to the command of a single mind.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Criminal sharing overt or covert act by active presence or by distant direction making out certain measure jointness in the commission of act is the essence of section 34 of Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A person merely because he was present at or near the scene without doing anything could not be and convicted with the aid of section 34 for the offence committed by other accused persons.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Aminul Islam &amp; Ors Vs.

Unless a common intention is established, an accused person for an act will be liable for his individual act and not for the act done by other accused persons.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Touhid &amp; Ors Vs. the State BLT (HCD)-364</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sections-34 and 149</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sections 34 and 149 of the Penal Code are two distinct and separate of fences involving different ingredients and legal consequences. While section 34 of the Penal Code involves direct over-act on the part of the accused sharing a "common intention" for the commission of the offence, section 149 of the Penal Code is essentially a vicarious liability for being a member of an unlawful assembly with the "common object" for the committing the offence. These two offences are not of the same nature.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">An accused charged under sections 302/149 of the Penal Code, along with others, cannot be convicted under section 34 of the Penal Code without framing any charge there under.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abu Talukder Vs.

True it is that it the accused who has to raise the plea insanity and establish it during trial but it the prosecution who had to take the initiative to bring all relevant facts and special circumstances, if any, into light for ends justice and fair play, which were in existence prior to the commission of the crime.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Nikhil Chandra Haider Vs.

Md. Zahangir Alam 14 BLT (HCD)-156</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-120B read with Evidence Act, 1872 Section-10</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Conspiracy—Evidence of action or statements made by one accused —use against other accused</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per M. Ruhul Amin, J: In a case of conspiracy there must be prima facie evidence that a person was a party to the conspiracy before his act can be used against his co-conspirators. A conspirators acts and declarations are admissible against other conspirators on the same principle as the act or declarations of an agent are receivable against his principle. Strict proof of conspiracy is not necessary. The provision of law is that there should be reasonable ground to believe that the prisoner and the persons whose acts, statements or writings are sought to be given in evidence have conspired to commit an offence, Section 10 of the Evidence Act is intended to admit evidence of communications between different conspirators while the conspiracy was going on with reference to the carrying out of conspiracy, but it is not intended by the law as in section 10 of the Evidence Act to admit in evidence the confession of a co-accused, and put it on the same footing as communications passing between the conspirator or between a conspirator and other Evidence of declaration acts or writings of a conspirator is admissible against other conspirators on the principles that the thing done, written or spoken was something done in carrying out the conspiracy and was receivable as a step in proof of conspiracy. Criminal courts, on less than Civil Courts, exits for the administration of justice, and courts of both descriptions have inherent power to mould the procedure, subject to the statutory provisions applicable to the matter in hand, to enable them to discharge their functions as courts of justice. From this point of view that the overt acts may properly be looked to as evidence of the existence of a concerted intention, indeed, the conspiracy is usually closed bound up with the overt acts, because in many cases it is only by means of the overt acts that the existence of the conspiracy can be made out. The gist of offence of conspiracy lies not in doing the act or effecting the purpose for which the conspiracy is formed, not in attempting to do any of the acts nor inducing others to do any of the acts nor inducing others to do them but in the forming of the scheme or agreement between the parties conspiracy is a matter of inference reduced from certain criminal acts of the parties accused, done in pursuance of an apparent criminal purpose common between them. The offence of conspiracy under section 120B of the Penal Code is one which requires detailed and specific proof against each other of the accused that he individually participated in a particular design to do a particular criminal thing. In order to establish the charge of conspiracy the prosecution has to prove an agreement between the persons charged to do an illegal act. Agreement can be inferred from over acts and conduct. If it is proved that persons charged pursued by their acts the same object. One performing one part and the other performing another part with a view to attaining the object they were justified. The bare fact of associations with persons who were party to a criminal conspiracy is not of itself a sufficient foundation for the conviction of that person on a charge of conspiracy. There must be something to show that the association was of a suspicious character. There is no difference between the mode of proof of the offence of conspiracy and that of any other offence, it can be established by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence. The law requires specific proof against each of the conspirators participating in particular design to do a particular criminal thing. Unless a detailed and specific proof against each of the accused that they participated in a particular design to do a particular thing has been established, there can be no conviction under Sec. 120B. It is going a little too far to say that since they were all together they must have had a common object therefore they must have previous)}1 come to an agreement amongst themselves to commit the crimes. Mere evidence of association is not sufficient for an inference of conspiracy. In a  case of criminal conspiracy it is not necessary to prove that a conspirator was aware to all the acts his fellow conspirators committed in pursuance of the conspiracy. Since conspiracy is often hatched up in utmost secrecy it is impossible! to prove conspiracy by direct evidence. It] has often than not. to be inferred form the acts,! statements and conduct of the parties to their conspiracy, Thus if it is proved that the! accused pursued, by their acts, the same object by the same means one performing one part of the act and the other part of the same act so as to complete it with a view to attainment of the object which they were pursuing, the courts is at liberty to draw the inference that they conspired together t effect the object, It should, however, he remembered that where there is no direct evidence, for example through the evidence of an approver, and the case for the prosecution is dependent on circumstantial evidence alone, it is necessary for the prosecution to prove and establish sue circumstances as would lead to the only conclusion of a criminal conspiracy and rule out the theory of innocence. The prosecution is required  to  prove  the  charge of  conspiracy by cogent evidence, direct or circumstantial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per M. Fazlul Karim, J: From the character of the crime conspiracy, there may not be any dir evidence to establish the same but certain, specific facts, circumstances and material or record may lead such inference which leads to irresistible conclusion the occurrence was due to conspiracy who has been hatched up by different person different places.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per A.B. M. Khairul Haque, J:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The ingredient of the offence of criminal conspiracy are as follows :</p><p> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">I. There must be an agreement between two or more persons, a meeting minds, nor mere consensus.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">II. The said agreement is for doing an illegal act or by an act by illegal means.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A criminal conspiracy by its very nature is of secretive in character. There would hardly be and direct evidence of the evil design of the conspirator. The conspiracy can only be inferred from the circumstances and gathered from the depositions of the witnesses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It appears from the evidence on record |hat the entire Army, the Navy, the Air Force were loyal to the Government, only the troops from the 1st Bengal Lancer Regiment and 2nd Field Artillery Regiment ted by a handful of disgruntled officers committed the dastardly crime (P.W. 44, 45) Those disgruntled officers were also alive to such a threat to them. They were aware of the presence of Rakhi Bahini, the BDR, and the Police also. As such they took two steps immediately after the killings. Major Rashid rushed to the house of P.W. 44 Col. Safyet Jamil, Commander 46 Brigade and told him, not to take any action in respect of killing of the President of Bangladesh, more in the tone of command than in submission and the show of strength exhibited by Major Farook when he appeared with 4 (four) tanks in the Head Quarter of 1st Bengal Regiment. The purpose was to demoralize the Brigade (P.W. 44) and it had the desired result. The top brass of the Army was stunned and so much frozen that no action could immediately be taken by them. Although three infantry battalions remained 'stand to' in the meantime, Major Dalim started his announcements on the Radio about the murder of the President and taking over of power by the Army under the leadership of Khondaker Mostaq.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Brigadier Dastagir from Chittagong wanted to declare on the Radio that they would protect the Constitution and defy the Government under Khondaker Moataq (P.W. 47) in his cross examination). This was also a real possibility, not only from Chittagong but from other places also. It appears that this aspect was not overlooked by the accused persons. That was the reason the three Chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force were forced to read their oath of allegiance on the Radio, followed by the BDR and Police Chief.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It may be noted that rushing of all the accused to the Radio Station was not a mere coincidence but it had also an important purpose on the canvass of the grand scheme. The conspirators knew very well that mere killing of the President and others would not do. The armed forces and the people at large were also made to realize that the entire armed forces were behind the conspirators and the new Government. That was why the plan in respect of the Radio Station was so very important Major Ahmed Sharful Hossain (A-7) was the first person to reach the Radio Station with his tank at about 4-30 in the morning of 15th August and took control of the Radio Station (P.W. 14) Major Shahrior (A-2) went to the Radio Station at about 5-30 A.M. Major Dalim (A-6) rached there at about 5-30 so also Major A.M. Rashed Chowdhury (A-8) Captain Abdul Majed also reached the Radio Station at that time. Major Shahrior (A-2), Major A.M. Rahsed Chowdhury (A-8) Major Ahmed Sharful Hossain (A-7), Major Abdul Majed did not fire a shot or were engaged in any overt act but they by being indoctrinated by the fiery speeches of Major Farrok (A-l), Major Rashid (A-4), Major Dalim (A-6) allowed themselves to be brought into the web of conspiracy in furtherance of their common intention to achieve the objects of the said common intention, went to the Radio Station in order to stand and wait and also to lend their services to the other conspirators as and when needed. Otherwise those abovementioned 4 (Four) officers had no reason or plausible explanation to be in the Radio Station in the early morning at 4-30 to 5-30 on 15th August. The defence on behalf of Major Shahrior that he was on an Interned Security Duty (ISD) or that he got a fresh appointment on that early morning are all myths and abhorrent of common sense. Similarly, Lt. Kismat Hashem and Lt. Nazmul Hossain Ansar went out of the Cantonment with their tanks. Lt. Kismat Hashem was seen in the house of the late President and Lt. Nazrul Hossain in the bend of the old Race Course or in front of the Radio Station. They were in the night parade, as such knew about the purpose of deployment of the tanks, Where they went was immaterial, the moment, they took their tanks out of the Cantonment, they were acting in furtherance of the common intention of the conspiracy no matter where they went and where they were. The purpose of deployment of tanks was to show the strength of the conspirators and also to terrorize the people. Both the objects were successfully achieved. They even terrorized the 46 Briagade (P.W 44) not to speak of the common people. The defence on behalf of Major Ahmed Sharful Hossain (A-7), Lt. Kismat Hashem (A-12 and Lt. Nazmul Hossain Ansar that they move the tanks towards the city under orders of their commanding officer is not defense. They were present in the parade ground and heard the speeches. So the purpose was no secret. The 15 Years Digest</p><p style="text-align: justify;">troops were armed, the tanks were made ready for action, anybody would understand that this was not training in and around the city. They on realizing the purpose could have pulled themselves out of the mission, instead, they went along with it in furtherance of the common intention, Similarly, the firing of the cannon shells on the house of the then President on the orders of Major Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) (A-3) shows his direct participation in the murders of the victims</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

They are so blind that they do not have any interest in exploring the benefits of engaging a lawyer in the prevent legal system even in the midst of facing the death penalty. Their thinking is so narrow that they considered it to be a just action to kill two individual judges so as to abolish the prevalent legal system and thereby to establish or to facilitate the establishment of what they believe as the Islamic rule -The condemned convicts knowingly, and deliberately made the criminal conspiracy and in furtherance of the common intention generated from the conspiracy, they caused the bomb blast leading to the death of the two Judges.

True, the prosecution could not angle out them in so many words. From the evidence of PW 1 Bimal Kumar Das it appears that certain alamats were seized from PO house including a blood stained lungi of the accused Zahirul Alam Kamal. The accused Zahirul Alam Kamal has not given any explanation in the matter. In view of positive evidence that the blood stained lungi was that of accused Zahirul Alam Kamal, according to us, he cannot be solved of the responsibility of murder of (Chapa. Regarding two other accused-respondents however we do not find any such incriminating element to connect them with the murder though they, as well, are found responsible for causing disappearanceof the evidence. In such view of the matter we feel inclined to give benefit of doubt to the two other respondents-Nasiruddin Jamal and Zillul Bari so far as the charge against them under Section 302/34 of the Penal Code is concerned. They however cannot be absolved of the charge under Sections 201/34 of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.
