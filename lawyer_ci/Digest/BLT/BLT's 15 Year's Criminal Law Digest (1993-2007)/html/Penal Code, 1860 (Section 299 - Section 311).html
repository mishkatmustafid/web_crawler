But his previsous history of mental illness from time to time and his treatment at different places prior to the occurrence and the subsequent medical reports and opinions of the physicians, found in the records, show that the accused had been suffering from Schizophrenia. Although, no medical expert was examined in this regard but it is well known that a schizophrenic may look sombre or even apparently sober all the time but suddenly can commit acts of violence and such schizophrenic fits may not even last long always but sometimes only for few moments. But unfortunately, in this case, no Pshychiatrist was examined in Court in order to highlight the probable mental condition of the accused when he killed the victim, on the basis of the past history of mental illness of the accused and also on the basis of observations made on the accused in the Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Hospital and at the Pabna Mental Hospital no effort whatsoever was taken to ascertain the mental condition of the accused when the offence was committed in spite of revelation of his earlier history of mental illness. This is a failure on the part or the prosecution to prove the mental element of the accused when he committed the crime, Rather, the circumstances of mental illness of the accused from time to time preceding the occurrence, absence of any motive or reason to kill an unconcerned and innocent victim, his unconcerned attitude when he was apprehended immediately after the occurrence, subsequent diagnosis by the physician that he had been suffering from schizophrenia, all these facts and circumstances taken  together raise  a doubt  about the presence of mens rea, the essential ingredient of the offence of murder, in mind of the accused. This gives rise to reasonable doubt as to the guilt of accused within the meaning of Section 2 of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Nikhil Chandra Haider Vs.

All the members of unlawful assembly had knowledge the prosecution of the common object of unlawful assembly guns and other deadly weapons were to be used which might death. The accused persons were aggressors as they attacked the informant party with any provocation. From the weapons and nature of injuries received by deceased persons at the vital parts of bodies it is palpably clear that it  is a case of murder as defined under Section of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>State Vs.

Out of the said injuries two of them were on the chest and the cut injury was on the sub-costal region. On dissection, doctor found that both pleura injured from posteriority. Chest cavity contained full blood and both the lungs were founds injured. The defence has not at all challenged P.W. 5 that the injuries were caused with the intention of such bodily injuries to the deceased were not sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death the injuries No. 1, 3, and 4 were inflicted on the vital parts of the deceased and we are of the opinion that the injuries were caused with the intention of causing such bodily injuries which are sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the definition of murder, Exeption-1 as submitted by the learned Advocate is applicable only when there is "grave and sudden provocation inflicted the injuries neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill the deceased. The defence could not make out any case that the appellant lost the self control by the grave and sudden provocation of the deceased. Therefore exception-1 has not manner of application in this case.

However to prove this fact, prosecution has produced both oral and documentary evidence. The two post mortem reports (Ext. 15 and 16) and the two inquest reports (Ext.5 and 10) on the dead bodies of the two judges clearly speak of their death from bomb blast injuries. These documents are corroborated by the testimony of the three eye witnesses namely P.W.I, the informant Driver Sultan, and by P.W.I 1 Badsha, the milk seller who went to deliver milk to the Government quarters where the vehicle carrying the judges was standing, and also by P.W. 14 peon Mannan who was standing beside the vehicle. They witnessed the bomb blast. Moreover P.W.4 Pallabi Mukharjee the wife of deceased judge Pandey, P.W. 16 Sabir Hossain and P.W. 17 Jobair, being the two brothers and owners of the neighboring shop P.W. 18 and 20, being two local residents, testified that they had gone to the place of the blast immediately after the blast, and found the two Judges with serious injuries from the bomb blast. The relevant seizure list being Ext.-7 about seizure of the intact and broken stlcno &lt;ti$  as the remnant of the blasted bomb, the seizure lists Ext.4 and 8 showing seizure of the damaged microbus and the blood stained wearing apparels of the Judge Sohel Ahmed and also of the injured peon Mannan (P.W. 14) and production of those articles in court, further reinforce the fact of the death of the two Judges from the bomb blast. We find nothing on record to disbelieve these oral and documentary evidence, which sufficiently prove the death of the judges from bomb blast.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

I. R. does not mean that Mofizuddin, Abdul Karim and Mozaffar stated to P.

C- The High Court Division itself noticed that there were several serious juries on the body of the deceased but there is no evidence that the appellant had used more than one injury upon the deceased as noticed above. The High Court Division failed to notice that P. W. 11 the doctor had given his opinion that the death caused due to haemorrhage from all the id wounds. There is no evidence that the alleged axed blow by the appellant alone caused the death of Hyder Ali. It is, therefore, evident that the appellant could be convicted for causing the death of Hyder Ali. He could at best be held liable causing hurt with a dangerous (sharp­ing) weapon but not for causing the death of Hyder Ali.  The High Court vision, however, found that the appellant could not escape from the liability of inflicting such fatal blow which resulted in death of Hyder Ali. This again shows application of mind both to fact and The appellant was found guilty of the offence under section 302 of the Penal Code; but surprisingly at the end of the judgment the High Court Division affirmed the order of conviction and sentence as passed by the trial court forgetting altogether that the conviction of the appellant was recorded by the trial court under section 302/149 of the Penal Code which is a completely different kind of conviction from one under section 302 directly where the liability is personal and in the former case the liability is vicarious.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Altaf Hossain Vs.

He further stated that realizing the fact that those persons might kill Shahid, he asked Shahid to leave the house and whereafter informed time that he was not in the house. Next he stated that ton the date of occurrence in the afternoon he went to Gaokhali Bazar to sell paddy. At that time, he heard sound of gun fire and saw people of the bazar running helter and skelter. While he was fleeing away he found the dead body of victim Shahid under a banyan tree and thereafter he left the bazar and went back to his home- statement of accused Zakir Hossain cannot be a basis for conviction him under section 302 of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

On the face of these inconsistencies it is difficult to rely upon their testimony.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs. Md.

P.W. 1 stated that the injury was inflicted on the right chest. P.Ws 2, 3 and 7 stated that the deceased told them that condemned prisoner Inflicted the dagger blow on the right chest. P.W. 6 however stated that the condemned prisoner inflicted the dagger blow without mentioning any particular part of the body. The medical evidence shows that the doctor found 2 injuries, one on the right lumber region of the abdomen and another on the right side of the abdomen and that in his opinion that the death was due to the 'wounds' Therefore, we find that the deceased sustained two injuries on the abdomen and not no the chest. The doctor did not find any injury on the right side of the chest or below the right chest of the deceased. The prosecution has not given any explanation as to how the deceased has sustained injuries on the abdomen or on the lumbar region. The medical evidence disproved the prosecution case that the condemned prisoner inflicted a dagger blow on the chest of the deceased. Therefore, we find that the condemned prisoner has been falsely implicated in the case out of grudge, and that no occurrence took place in the manner as stated by the prosecution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

He further said that for 4/5 days before the occurrence he did not see the appellant. He did not know whether the appellant was in his house on the night of occurrence. Amongst the prosecution witnesses only PW3 said that the appellant was seen in the locality for 4/5 days before the occurrence. His such evidence is inconsistent with PW2. Moreover relationship of PW3 with the appellant was inimical. He was not an independent and disinterested witness. Furthermore his evidence does not prove presence of the appellant in his hut on the night of occurrence or at the material time. The other local witnesses said nothing about his presence in the scene. Thus the prosecution failed to prove that on the night of occurrence the appellant was living with his deceased wife in the same hut and the death of the deceased wife was within special knowledge of the accused husband. Therefore, the appellant was not under an obligation to explain the death of his wife and no adverse view could be taken against him, because the explanation given by the defence that the deceased committed suicide by hanging had been proved untrue. As the prosecution failed to establish the minimum requirement for convicting the accused husband for murdering his wife that he was in the house at the relevant time, in the context of afore cited cases (43 D.L.R. (AD) 92, 43 D.L.R. (AD) 65 and 1990 B.L.D. (AD) 228) we are of the view that the prosecution failed to prove beyond all shadow of doubt that none but the appellant had hands in the killing of his deceased wife. It is well settled that abscondence of the accused by it self is not conclusive to the guilt of the accused. (Vide 41 D.L.R. 11, 45 D.L.R. 660, 46 D.L.R. 575). So as benefit of doubt the appellant is entitled to get acquittal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abu Taker Vs The State 14 BLT (HCD)-85</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-302</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is well recognized that to bring forth murder charge against an indicted person the prosecution must prove the time, place and manner of occurrence beyond any pale of doubt and if prosecution fails to prove time, place and manner of occurrence as programmed beyond any shadow of doubt it quibbles to dust.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Rustum &amp; Ors Vs. The State 14 BLT (HCD)-435</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-302</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Benefit of Doubt -The High Court Division dismissed the appeal of the appellant upon observing that (1) P. Ws. 2-6 being present on the spot during occurrence duly recognized the appellant with light of moon which was shining at that night in the sky and (2) P.Ws.2-6 stated clearly that they saw and recognized the appellant as the assailant and that they had no difficulty to recognized the appellant "with the light of moon" (3) there is nothing in the evidence j P.Ws.2-6 to discard their evidence relation to recognition of the appellant during occurrence. But as it appears the High Co Division at the same time observed the P.Ws. 2, 4, 5 and 6 contradicted each other to the extent that P.W.2 stated that the appellant was facing north when he gave dagger blow in the chest of deceased Julfu Master and the appellant was wearing coloured shirt and Imam Hossain (since acquitted) was wearing a Panjabi, P.W. 5 stated that the appellant was facing west the time of inflicting injury and the appellant was wearing a genji and accused Imam Hossain had no wearing at that time P.W.6 stated that the appellant was facing south at the time of inflicting of blow dagger and the appellant and Imam Hossain had no wearing and so we are of the victim that the conviction of the appellant unwarranted as the basic principles criminal jurisprudence is that prosecution has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Moreover he irreconcilable contradictions mean the P.Ws. did not see the occurrence at under the fundamental scheme of criminal jurisprudence discrepancies, contradictions and omissions in the evidence of witnesses are to be taken into considerations otherwise error might creep up in the judgment resulting in the conviction of the accused. So, in view of the above and that Imam Hossain has been acquitted we are of the view that, the appellant is entitled to the benefit of doubt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abul Khair Vs.

The main allegation against this accused person is that he gave a blow on the P.W. 3 with his ramdao while he rushed there to rescue Sabuz but no injury certificate of P.W. 3 was produced in court or any physician was examined in support of the injury caused on the person of this witness.

Convict-Appellants cannot be said to have shared the alleged common intention of causing the homicidal death of deceased Masudul Islam and it is a very difficult exercise for the Court to conclude that the convict-appellants shared the common intention of murdering the deceased .

Evidences on record speak of previous background of enmity between accused party and deceased party in respect of the house of convict-appellant Rustum. Ocular testimonies supplied by prosecution witness nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 can be conveniently characterized as tainted testimonies. Evidence of above prosecution witnesses who are very much interested and interrelated required corroboration by independent and impartial witnesses and the accounts could be accepted if those stood corroborated by evidences of independent and disinterested witnesses. There was no corroboration of the versions of interested prosecution witnesses by independent and disinterested witnesses. It is not safe to rely on the evidences of highly interested and partisan witnesses to earn conviction on a charge under section 302/34 of Penal Code without corroboration, either ocular or circumstantial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Rustum &amp; Ors Vs.

Report cannot be brushed aside as there was no eye witness of the alleged murder of deceased Delowar who alleged to have committed suicide by taking poison.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs. Seema Begum &amp; Ors 15  BLT (HCD) 265</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section-302/34</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Benefit of Doubt -In a case of murder conviction can be given relying upon the evidence of only one witness, if the evidence of such witness is found to be above board, unimpeachable and consistent with the F.I.R. case and evidences of other P.Ws. The evidence of P.W.2 Ayesha Begum is found not consistent with the evidence of other P.Ws that in the night of occurrence condemned prisoner called deceased Delowar from his house and thereafter she along with other convict appellants tortured him into death. Further there is also no evidence to prove that there was illicit relation in between deceased Delowar and condemned prisoner Seema Begum so as to substantiate the prosecution case that out of this illicit relation and love convict appellants and one Humayun called deceased Delowar through condemned prisoner Seema Begum and thereafter tortured him to death and thereafter threw his body inside the Girl's School and that the convict appellants including the condemned prisoner and others administered poison inside the stomach of deceased Delowar through ????? ????.In this case the so called alamat "????? ????" was not seized by the I.O. though during the time of taking evidence P.W.2 in her cross stated that after prepertrating torture the convict appellants and others administered poison in the stomach of deceased Delowar with the help of "????? ????”. In such view of the fact and the evidences on record, we find that the prosecution has failed to prove the charge of the murder of deceased by the condemned prisoner along with convict appellants on the basis of the evidence of P.W.2 Ayesha Begum. On the contrary, deceased Delowar died as a result of taking poison as stated by the Medical Board consisting of 3 doctor who after receipt of the viscera repo opined that the death of the victim was d to organophosphorus poisoning which was ante mortem and suicidal in nature. In such view  of the  fact,  we  have  no other alternative but to held that the prosecution has  failed  to  prove  the  case beyond reasonable doubt for which the referen should be rejected and the criminal appeal and Jail appeal should be allowed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

The evidence of P.W.1 that she recognized the appellant among 21, assailants is not at all credible as she at first said that she had recognized none. Moreover she did not give means of recognition and did not disclose to anybody the fact of recognition of the appellant amongst killers of the deceased. There is corroboration of her recognition of appellant as the killer of her husband. So is unsafe to act on her such incredible testimony. Thus the prosecution miserably failed to prove the charge against the appellant. The Court below wrongly convicted him.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Panaullah alias Pana Vs The State. 14 BLT (HCD)15</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-304 Part-1 and Section-304 Part-II </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A case of gruesome double murder</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have already noticed and agree w the finding of the trial court that there was neither any object of murdering anybody nor was there any such intention. From the evidence of P.W. 14 Dr. Shah Jamai who held autopsy on the dead body of Fakku Mia. It is found that he received several grievous injuries including one on the chest inflicted by Harunur Rashid and another on the abdominal cavity which pierced the surface of the liver inflicted by unknown assailant and as such it cannot said that the death was the most likely result of the injury on the chest and the doctor also did not depose so. We therefore, hold that respondent Harunur Rashid by inflicting the injury on the chest of Fakku Mia resulting the death of the victim committed an offense under Sect-ion 304 Part 1 of the penal Code for causing the bodily injury as was likely to cause death and in fact the death was caused. The injury caused by the other respondent Jahirul Hoque alias Jaju was not on the vital part of Bakul Bibi and we have already noticed that there was no evidence to the effect that said Jahirul Hoque knew about the pregnancy of Bakul Bibi. Under the circumstances Jahirul Hoque committed an offence punishable under Section 304 Part-II of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>State Vs.

There may be other motives for inflicting such blows by the accused upon deceased. It further appears from the evidence of the prosecution witnesses that each of the I accused appellants has dealt only one blow by their knife or dagger. It is difficult to hold that by which blow death was caused or whether each of the blow is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death of deceased or whether as a cumulative effect of all injuries sustained by the deceased had died. Although the injuries are on the vital parts of the body inflicted by sharp cutting weapons never the less as the prosecution says that each accused dealt one blow each, therefore, in our view, the offence cannot be called a murder as defined in section 300 of the Penal Code of the necessary ingredients of murder appear to be missing. It is a manslaughter not amounting to murder. Therefore, the offence comes under section 304 Part 1 of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs.

When an accused is found to use a dangerous weapon to cause fatal injury on the vital part of the body like head in a consecutive manner certainly it will prove his intention to cause such bodily injuries as is likely to cause his death-which comes within the mischief of first part of Section 304 of the Penal code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Nasir Howlader Vs.

There is no evidence of any conspiracy or pre plan or premeditation on the part of the two appellants nor it could be proved that they inflicted any injuries upon the deceased nevertheless they joined Aynul Sheikh at the time of occurrence. There is however no evidence that the appellants intended to cause the death of the victim. From the facts and circumstances of the case we think that the acts of the two appellants constitute at best an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under Section 304, Part I of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Aynul Sheikh and Anr.

No doubt, victim Kastura Bibi sustained violent blow on the abdominal wall by the brick thrown towards her chest and got senseless but death occurred when accused Abdul Hoque (since deceased) pressed her on the neck resulting her spontaneous death. Death would not have occurred if accused Abdul Hoq would not have played the part of pressing victim Kasture Bibi on her neck. The accused appellant Shamsul Huq had no premeditated intention to kill the victim kastura Bibi and the intention to kill is lacking in this case. But, although, he had no intention to kill the victim, he must be attributed the knowledge that such throwing of brick was likely to cause her death and the act done by him was both rash and indiscreet. We are of the opinion that accused Shamsul Hoq did not commit culpable homicide amounting to murder under section 302 of the Penal Code but committed culpable homicide not amounting to murder and the charge under section 302 of the Penal Code fails but we find that the accused- appellant Shamsul Hoq is liable for commission of offence punishable under section 304 Part II of  Penal Code and he can be convicted thereunder.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Jabbar Vs.

They used lathis on the person of the deceased. In the facts of the given case, we are satisfied that they had no intention to cause the death of Abul Kashem. They caused the injuries, which are likely to cause death. Their intention of causing bodily injuries as are likely to cause death had not been proved by the prosecution by adducing evidence. It is not the death itself, which was intended, nor the effect of the injuries. They did not inflict injuries indiscriminately on the deceased. They inflicted two injuries to the deceased with lathis. In view of the above, we are on the view that their offence, comes within the mischief of second clause of Section 299 of the Penal Code, which is an offence punishable under part II of section 304 of] the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The Solicitor Vs.
