The deceased wife had consent in such act of the accused husband. Therefore, we find that the appellant committed an offence punishable under section 314 part I of the Penal Code. His act does not attract part II of the same section.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Raqib Sheikh Vs.

Shamir @ Shamir Khan and Shamsul Haque @ Shamsul Khan but none of the injured persons were in the hospital for twenty days and there is no evidence that the injured person failed to pursue their normal avocations for twenty days. P.W. 3 claimed that the sustained injury in the hand and was a hospital for seven days. The medical report has also not supported the prosecution allegation that these two appellants caused grievous hut as defined in section 320 of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

The court must come to a definite finding with reference to the evidence on the record about the nature of injury. An injury is grievous hurt if it falls within the meaning of grievous hurt as given in Section 320 of the Penal Code. There is no evidence that any of the injuries endangered the life of any of the victim. There was no fracture; the victims were discharged from the hospital after treatment of several days. There is no evidence to show that any of the victim suffered severe bodily pain for a period of 20 days or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits. So the conviction under Sections- 326 and 325 of the Penal Code is not proper and legal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bazul Rahman Howlader &amp; Ors Vs The State 7 BLT (HCD)-66</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section - 323</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nature of hurt each of them allegedly caused does not disclose their intention to cause death, nor such bodily injury which might likely to cause death.

But none of the neighbor of that Mollah bari are also witness of this case, -the medical certificate cannot be taken into evidence as the doctor was not examined. It is also found that no alamats like wearing apparels of the victims with blood stained cloths were sized to prove the alleged occurrence by the prosecution -Held; impugned judgment and order is based on conjecture, surmise, hypothesis and that the impugned judgment is not well reasoned basing on the judgment and order suffer from misreading and non-reading of the evidence which call for the interference by this court.

P.W. 1 we are of the view that though the doctor deposed that the injuries he found were grievous in nature but those injuries are not grievous as contemplated under] Section 320 of the Penal code, In view of the nature of the evidence we hold that the; prosecution failed to prove that P.W. m sustained grievous hurt. But the fact remains; that the prosecution witnesses consistently and uniformly proved that these appellants caused hurt on PW1 by using weapons of offence and from the evidence on record we are of the view that these appellants have committed the offence punishable under Section 324 and not under Section 326 of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Aminul Islam @ Ranga &amp; Ors.

Held: for jumping the bail the appellant should not have been convicted for the main offence under section 376 which was not proved against him and other accused and all other co-accused were acquitted.

Proof of murder would consequently consist of proof of committing culpable homicide . It would not be open to the accused to plead that he or they did not know that the cumulative effect of their conjoint violence would result in death.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State  Vs Md.Gaus Meah @ Rana &amp; Ors. 13 BLT (HCD)-136</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section -396</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Benefit of doubt</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The appellant had been convicted for his complicity in that offence on the basis of the evidence of recognizing him by P.Ws. 3 5 at the time commission of dacoity and confession of co-accused Nazimud P.W.3 said that at the time of dacoity in hut he recognized the appellant along with others by the light of night. It is understood what he meant by 'light night'. It is in the evidence of P.W.7 that night of occurrence was dark. P.W.3 did support presence of any light in his room. In absence of any light in the room recognition of the appellant and others by him was practicable P.W.5 said that he recognition the appellant and others at the time commission of dacoity in his —by the light of a cherag. But no cherag, the means of his recognition was seized by the Investigating officer. So presence of burning cherag in the hut of P.W.5 at the time of commission of dacoit therein is doubtful and accordingly recognition of the appellant P.W.5 had not been established free from doubt. Moreover P.W.s 3, 4 and 5 did not disclose about such recognition to anybody immediately after the occurrence. Had they recognized the appellant and others at the time of commission of dacoity in the respective huts and disclosed that fact after the occurrence it word find place in the F.I.R. So recognition of the appellant and others by P.Ws. 3 and 5 is subsequent embellishment, P.Ws. 3 and 5 themselves also did not support one another about recognition of the appellant and others. None of other inmate P.Ws of the — -house including the informant supported recognition of the appellant and others by P.Ws.3 and 5.

But in fact appellant Jahangir Alam was never absconded till he was excluded in the charge- sheet and that the dacoit who become unconscious could not be the appellant as that dacoit died subsequently.

Section 402 contemplates a stage when the whole project still lies in the realm of design and intention without there being any intent to give a concrete shape to the intention, but whenever someone of the persons assembled advances a step further by doing act amounting to preparation section 399 is then brought into play.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bura Yunus &amp; Ors Vs. the State 15 BLT (HCD)-383</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-406</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In order to sustain conviction under section 406 of the Penal Code there must be dishonest misappropriation by a person in whom confidence is placed as to the custody or management of the property in respect of which the breach of trust is charged and in the instant case the petitioner though took the loan to set up the machine from the Krishi Bank out never repaid the amount remaining the dues to be unadjusted, rather disposed of the mortgaged machine without the permission of the Bank.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

But in the examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure it is generally stated that while he was store keeper of Chalna Port misappropriation took place in the said store without specifying which one There is therefore lack of uniform evidence that all the five stores then existing at Khalishpur were under the charge of the accused- appellant. P. W. 2 Shafiqur Rahman clearly stated that the accused-appellant was in charge of general store (Shed No. 1) and Cement Store.

Here is a case where the prosecution half heartedly proceeded with the case. The appellate court failed to notice the gross defects in the case as advanced by the prosecution who have not produced and examined even the cited witnesses most of whom were from department itself. No explanation has also been given for this non-examination—the prosecution failed to prove the charge against this appellant beyond all reasonable doubt</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

The State 2 BLT (AD) 139</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-420</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case the informant was persuaded to pay taka five lakhs on the assurance of paying back the amount by a certain date and the accused issued a post dated cheque on the day the money was paid with advice to present the cheque to the bank on a certain date. Thereafter on two occasions the date of presentation of the cheque to the bank was deferred on the request of the accused, first by one month and lastly by another fifteen days. After the expiry of this twice extended period, the cheque was presented to the bank on 9.2.95 when it was dishonored and again presented on 27.2.95 when also it was dishonored for lack of fund .It is alleged that after dishonour of the cheque on two occasions when the informant went and demanded back his money, the petitioner threatened to kill the informant. The first information report makes out an allegation that the informant was persuaded by the petitioner to part with his money through a clever device and was ultimately threatened with murder for demanding repayment of the money. The initial intention to deceive appears on the face of the F. I. R. It cannot, therefore, be said that the F .1. R. does not disclose an offence under section 420 of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Nurul Islam Vs. The State 5 BLT (HCD)-208</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-420</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the case of the offence punishable for the offence of cheating there are two elements namely deception and dishonest inducement to do or omit to do something. In such a case the complainant or the informant would have to show not only that he was induced to do or omit to do a certain act but this inducement or omission has caused or was likely to cause him some harm or damage in body, mind, reputation or property and these are presumed to be the four cardinal assets] of humanity. For proving the offence under section 420 of the penal Code of prosecution must prove the deception of any person, fraudulently or dishonestly inducing such person to deliver any property to any] person or to consent that any person shall] retain any property and intentionally? inducing that person to do not omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived and such act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind,; reputation or property. From the evidence led before the trial court it appears that none of the witnesses deposed that this appellant induced P.W. 2 to execute kabala or to deliver the property to him. It appears that the prosecution has not led any evidence t prove the ingredients of the offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code. The trial court as well as the High Court Division failed to appreciate this aspect of the matter and wrongly held appellant guilty of the offence under Section 420 of the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

The State 8 BLT (AD)-210</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-420 </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In order to constitute the offence of cheating it must be established that someone is made to part with some property on the promise or representation of the accused to return something in lieu thereof, which the later had no intention to give. The initial intention to deceive must be established to justify a conviction for cheating. Intention of cheating shall have to be gathered from the facts of the case and its surrounding circumstances. Where there is no fraudulent intention of the accused from the beginning, there can be no question cheating. In the absence of mens rea, mere breach of contract cannot constitute cheating. Inability to fulfill a promise or contract does not amount to cheating.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mahbubul Alam Gazi Vs.

Where fraudulent intention of the accused from the very beginning in the disputed deal is not proved, there can be no conviction for cheating. Ordinarily a breach a contract does not entail any criminal liability, unless it is proved that the accused practiced initial deception in concluding the agreement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sujit Kumer Rudra &amp; Ors. Vs. The State 8 BLT (HCD)-407</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-420</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The essential ingredients for an offence of cheating is that on the basis of false representation, the complainant was deceived and he had no scope to examine the act of deception or false representation of the accused. To hold a person guilty of the offence of cheating, the prosecution must show that the accused had criminal intention. Such a dishonest intention can not only be inferred but it must be proved by facts and circumstances of the case and evidence on record. In the absence of such proof, the accused cannot be charged with guilty of cheating.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Alhaj Abdul Kashem Vs.
