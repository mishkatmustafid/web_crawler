The complainant might not be present at the time of the illegal entry but he came to the scene thereafter and opposed the appellant who despite his protest, carried on the work of construction. So the ingredients of sections 441/447 of the Penal Code have been well established.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mohammad Ali &amp; Ors. Vs. A. F. M. Mazedul Huq khan Lohani &amp; Anr. 8 BLT (AD)-96</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section- 447 &amp; 427</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As far as the assessment of evidence is concerned, both the Courts below believed the complainant's case and the High Court Division committed no wrong in accepting the findings of the Court of fact. Causing of mischief having been proved the ingredients of the offence of criminal trespass are also satisfied. It is not correct to say that no criminal action lay merely because the complainant could bring an action in the Civil Court for violation of the order of temporary injunction. The Civil Court's order of injunction having not been disputed, it was no defence to the accused that they were co-sharers in the disputed land and the complainant's wife was not in exclusive possession thereof.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Alauddin &amp; Ors Vs. Md. Shah Alam Khan &amp; Anr 7 BLT (AD)-356</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 448</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Convict-petitioner has sentenced to one year's rigorous imprisonment, which is the maximum sentence -Held; The petitioner was aged only 17 at the time of occurrence and there is no specific act of violence attributed to him, the maximum sentence awardable under the section is felt to be inappropriate and unwarranted. It is not the rule of procedure that in the event of finding an accused guilty of an offence, he must be punished with the maximum possible sentence under that provision of law. The law provides the trial court with a discretion which must be exercised judicially. In view of the age of the accused petitioner and the evidence of the witnesses not disclosing any specific overt act, the court should have exercised the discretion and awarded a lesser sentence, which would be sufficient to give the accused a lesson that crime will not go unpunished. In my view, in the facts of the instant case, the ends of justice will be sufficiently met if the petitioner is sentenced to imprisonment for the period already undergone by him in custody in connection with this offence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Rafiqul Islam Vs. The State 15 BLT (HCD) 94</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-458 and 354</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Doubtful—it is true that when according to evidence of P.Ws. 1, 3 and 5 two brothers of victim were sleeping in the same ghar beside the door and when according to evidence of P.W. 5 Dulal Hemron their parents were sleeping in the veranda of the ghar it was quite impossible and improbable on the part of any outsider to enter into to the ghar to commit rape on the victim alleged. Moreover when from above we find no proof and evidence for offence under Section 458 Penal Code there was therefore no probable chance for the next alleged offence under section 354 Penal Code to committee by the accused appellant.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mozammel Haque Vs.

Mobarak Ali Gazi. Vs. The State &amp; ors. 11 BLT (HCD)-312</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section- 464</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Essential ingredients- To constitute forgery intent of defraud is essential- where the act is done under the honest belief that the party doing it had a right to do so when in reality he had no authority to do so, there is no criminal intention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abul Kashem Bhuiyan Vs.

The commission of the alleged offences as stated above must have a nexus with the discharge or purported discharge of his official duties. Then and then alone the offences as described above may be treated as the offences within the schedule under the Criminal Law Amendment 1958 permitting trial of the ne by a Special Judge or Sr. Special Judge, if a public servant commits an offence, not in connection with the discharge or purported discharge of his offence cannot be deemed to be an offence under the Schedule as described above and the public servant committing the offence or offences not as such cannot be tried under the special law but any be tried in any ordinary court under the general law in his private capacity and in such cases, the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment ct, 1958 are not attracted and there is no question of trial by a Special Judge under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 or under Prevention of Corrupt Act, 11/47.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Khitish Chandra Das and Others Vs The State 1 BLT (HCD)-32</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) Prevention of Corruption Act- (Act 11 1947)- Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1958)- Section 6(B)-1) Para(B) of Schedule- use of forged marked sheets, e offence is not a schedule offence- No illegality conviction legal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Khitish Chandra Das and Others Vs The State 1 BLT (HCD)-32</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section- 467</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A document of transfer may be avoidable ton very many grounds including that it was (executed when the executant was lying ill or under the influence of the person claiming under the document. But to secure a conviction for forgery in a case like the present it must be specifically proved that the executant by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication or by reason of deception practiced upon him did not know the contents of the document and in such state he was made to execute the document by the accused. Clearly there is no such evidence and the circumstances referred to by the High Court Division may be enough for a Civil Court not to rely on such document but for a conviction for forgery there must be clear evidence as to the above which are the ingredients of the offence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shawkat Hossain Akanda Chowdhury Vs. The State 6 BLT (AD)-49</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-467/109</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is on record that the original forged deed was not produced before the trial court. The certified copy of the disputed deed was marked as Exhibit 12 wherein the name of Md. Sirajul Haque appeared and from this alone it cannot be conclusively concluded that it is this appellant Md. Sirajul Haque who identified a wrong person knowing that Bishnupada Roy was not the executant of the deed. Admittedly the certified copy of the forged deed having been filed there was no scope to examine the signature of appellant No.2 Md. Sirajul Haque. Thus, we hold that there was no legal evidence on record to connect appellant No. 2 Md. Sirajul Haque with the abatement of the forged deed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mohir Molla &amp; Ors. Vs.

It cannot be said that onus of proof was shifted upon the accused persons. Conviction is as such held justified.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Md. Kahar Ali Mondal and Other vs The State 1 BLT (AD)-44</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 468 and 468/109</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It being the definite case of the prosecution that appellant No.3 along with others have executed two Muktipatras in favour of the appellant Nos. 1 and 2 and another containing false statement relating to property leased out to the executants of the Muktipatras and others upon treating the property as vested property to the effect that the said property is the ancestral property of the recipients of the Muktipatras. The undisputed fact is that appellant No. 3 and others have executed the document and that therein they have made some untrue statements regarding the property relating to which they executed the Muktipatras. The documents i.e. Muktipatras having admittedly been executed by the appellant No. 3 and others the same is in no way can be said to have been brought into existence under the circumstances or situations mentioned in Section 464 in the presence whereof a person is said to make a false document." From the ratio of the cases referred to herein over it is seen that it has uniformly been held that making of false statement in a document by the executants thereof does not saddle him with the liability of committing forgery or that of making a false document.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Hazi Ibrahim Ali &amp; Ors. Vs. The State 11 BLT (AD)-39</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-471</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The accused petitioner was Bench Assistant in the Court of Thana Magistrate Kurigram. In that Court, a Certificate Case was started against Khijir Uddin and on the basis of the process issued by the court in the case Khijir Uddin was arrested. After his arrest his wife Nurun Nahar Begum came to the Court of the Magistrate and talked to the accused petitioner and handed over Tk 3,093/- to him for depositing the money in the Certificate case. The accused petitioner after accepting the amount prepared a recall order and gave a photocopy of that order to Nurun Nahar. Khijir Uddin got released from the Thana on the basis of that falsi order-Held: In the present case it has been proved that the recall order was used bm Nurun Nahar Begum in getting Khijir Uddul released from the Thana. The accused petitioner was certainly an abettor in so far as Section 471 of the Penal Code is concerned.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Azizul Haque Vs. The State 7 BLT (AD)-121</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-471</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">When there is no evidence at all that the accused Muzaffar Hossain Sarker knew about the alleged certificate nor did he use it for his promotion. Mere proof that certain document is a forged one is not sufficient to establish the offence under this section because no conclusion can be drawn from the document itself. .The onus to proof of the existence of every ingredients of the charge always rest on the prosecution which never shifts. But in the instant case the prosecution has totally failed to prove the onus reposed on it and no prima facie easel has been made out relating to the; commission of offence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Muzaffar Hossain Sarker Vs. The State 13 BLT (HCD)-372</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Secion-489(b)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where there was no evidence that the currency note in possession of the accused was of nature or description or look that a mere look at it would convince any person of average intelligence that it was counterfeit or forged; nor any such question was put to the accused during trial, the conviction and sentence of the accused under the section cannot be sustained in law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Almas Miah Vs. The State 11 BLT (HCD)-4</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-489(b)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Essential ingredients of the offence under the section are:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">i. the note found must be forged or counterfeit;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ii. one sells to, or buys or receives, or otherwise traffics in or uses such forged or counterfeit note as genuine; and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">  iii. he does so with the knowledge or having reason to believe the same to be forged or counterfeit. When all the ingredients are proved, only then it could be said the offence is established.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Almas Miah Vs.

A mere promise to marry in the future does not warrant a conclusion that a false belief of marriage was caused in her mind. The prosecution has to prove that some form of marriage, which is not valid and legal, was gone through with a fraudulent intention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case there is absolutely no evidence to prove that the accused petitioner deceitfully induced any belief in complainant Asia Begum that she was the legally married wife of the accused and fed by such belief she surrendered herself to the carnal desire of the accused, leading to her conception and as such the conviction under Section 493 of the Penal Code is not maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

The accused petitioner, the present General Secretary of Chittagong City Auto Owners Association, with malicious intention of defaming him in the eye of the society, published an advertisement in the Daily Azadi falsely alleging that while the respondent was vice president of the said Association, collected subscription from each bus every day and misappropriated about Tk.-l crore within 18 years- Held: The High Court Division came to a finding on the basis of the evidence on record that the respondent as Vice President had no connection with the collection of subscription or maintenance of accounts. He was simply to preside over the meeting of the Association in the absence of the President. The High Court Division also found that the impugned publication was made with the malicious intention of defaming the respondent in the eyes of society- We do not find any ground for interference.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>A.
