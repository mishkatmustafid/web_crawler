It is in evidence that P.Ws. 1 and 4 were detained by giving threat and apart these two witnesses of implicating Sekander by giving order to his son to kill Munir, there is no other evidence on record. It is also in evidence that Sekandar was all through in the Police Station. Such conduct of a person who gave order to kill also seems unlikely. P.W. 8 Gazi Mozaffar Hossain testified that while going Hashi Video he saw accused Habib Rattan who were assaulting Munir. He did not specifically mentioned as to giving of any order by accused Sekandar to kill Munir. It is on record that P.W. 8 testified that Munir's father and uncle went away. Although this witness heard cry for help from deceased Munir he did not hear accused Sekandar giving order. In that view of the matter, it is difficult to hold that Sekandar really gave order to his son Bijoy to kill Munir. Accordingly Sekandar is given the benefit of doubt. On a careful consideration of the evidence on record we are inclined to give benefit of doubt to accused Sekandar.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Mahmudul Islam @ Ratan Vs.

We, however, lay down the fundamental principles regarding the sentence of fine. Penal Code fixes both imprisonment and fine for certain offences and imprisonment or fine for other offences. In the latter cases if the Court imposes sentence of imprisonment, then while imposing fine as an additional punishment the Court should give its reason so that it may be scrutinized by the appellate court. While imposing the sentence of fine the basic principles to be kept in view shall be as here under:</p><p style="text-align:justify">1. The accused has derived pecuniary gain from the crime; or</p><p style="text-align:justify">2. The fine is specially needed to deter or correct the offender; or</p><p style="text-align:justify">3.

He is not expected to conduct all the cases pending for trial.

Prosecution case as emerged from the evidence of Informant PW 1 is that condemned prisoner with dagger in hand dealt blow on the chest of deceased Delu Mia and, thereafter, forcible laid Mujibul Huq (PW 2) on the mud and with dagger laid strike on latter's (PW 2) upper portion of the belly. Mujibul Huq was aged 36 years at the time of his giving evidence in court on 19.3.1998 and he was about 32 years at the time of incident. Prosecution case did not make a halt here and it went far that condemned prisoner, there-after, with dagger laid strike on the person of Ibrahim (PW 4), though PW 4 Ibrahim himself did not give testimony that condemned prisoner laid strike on his person with dagger. Now the question is. Is it possible on the part of an old man aged about 80 years (here the condemned prisoner) to take the most active part in commission of crime on laying dagger blow on a man aged about 55 years (here deceased Delu Mia) and, thereafter, taking out of that dagger from the chest of that person (deceased Delu Mia) forcibly made another person (PW 2 Mujibul Huq who was 32 years old) lie down on the mud and, strike with that dagger on the upper portion of the belly of that person (PW 2 Mujibul Huq) when the young sons of the alleged killer (condemned prisoner) were present in the scene of occurrence?
