There being thus no valid ground.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mostafizur Rahman Vs.

It has been alleged that the detenu is a notorious terrorist and he is a criminal bent of mind. It has further been alleged in the ground of detention that he is an active member of gang of criminals within the area of Ranigaon Union Parishad under Chunarughat Police Station, and the detenu along with his group members has been committed train dacoity, high way robbery, the offence of killing, lifting of cows and stealing of trees of Forest Department within the area of B. baria, Chunarughat, Hobiganj Bahubal and Sree Mongal and by committing various crimes he has created a reign of terror in the area -Held: It appears to us that the grounds are to be vague and indefinite in nature as they back in material particulars, and therefore for the vagueness of the grounds the detenu has been deprived of making any effective representation to the detaining authority as completed under provision of law. In that view of the matter the order of detention is bad in law and as such the same should be declared being without any unlawful authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.
