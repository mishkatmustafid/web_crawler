Although sentence is essentially a matter of discretion for the trial Court where no minimum is set by law, yet the Court is required to exercise the discretion judicially and not capriciously.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Alhaz Nurul Alam Chowdhury &amp; Anr.

The Sate 6 BLT (HCD)-82</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Principle of Circumstantial Evidence</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Suspicion—the principle of circumstantial evidence to prove the guilt of an accused is that all the circumstances must themselves be proved beyond all reasonable doubt and the chain of circumstances should be so that the innocence of the accused in incompatible with the circumstances. If there be any missing link the accused will escape through it, for in that case the prosecution case will not be proved upto the hilt. Ascendance of an accused by itself proves no guilt. Normally even an innocent person tries to keep out of the way if he learns of his false implication in a serious case reported to the police. It is a somewhat weak link in the circumstances for establishing the guilt of a person, Again marks of injury in the dead body does not involve an individual with the crime of murder. The appellant who is the brother of the victim might have absconded, if at all, for fear of harassment as the unnatural death of his sister took place in his house. It was incumbent on the Courts below to properly scrutinize the material circumstances for determining whether the chain of circumstantial evidence is so complete as to lead to the only conclusion of the appellants guilt. In our view, the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence in this case falls far short of the test required for sustaining conviction. Suspicion, however, strong cannot be the basis of conviction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Osman Gani Vs.
