Govt, of Bangladesh &amp; Ors 12 BLT (AD) 205</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section- 2(f) (VIII) </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Whether the detaining authority while issuing the initial order of detention did apply judicial mind.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It appears that the main prejudicial act alleged against the detent in the memo containing the grounds is that he is injuring the 'economic and financial interest of the country' by smuggling and illegal dealing in currency. The prejudicial act thus alleged comes within the mischief of section 2(0 (viii)of the Special Powers Act whereas the prejudicial act stated in the initial order of detention is 'law and order' which comes within the ambit of section 2(f) (iii) of the Special Powers Act. Therefore, we find that there is no nexus between the initial order of detention and the memo containing of which only establishes that the detaining authority while issuing the initial order of detention did not apply judicial mind.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Naureen Aziz Mohammad Bhai Vs.

Golam Hossain Vs. The State 3 BLT (HCD)-95</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section- 3(1)(a)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The grounds on which the detention order was passed are that the detent although is not a regular practicing lawyer was engaged as an Advocate by the Ex-President Mr. H. M. Ershad and in the name of taking instruction he used to meet the Ex-President who is an accused in Criminal cases and also meet in court in the recreation room attached to the Court but instead of taking instruction in connection with the Criminal cases he used to act as illegal agent and used to supply information variable and in writing- the detent helped in deteriorating the law and order situation by supplying the information received from Ex- President Mr. H. M. Ershad to the supporters of the Jatiya Party and as a result there were clashes between the police and the supporters of the Jatiya Party and so keeping him outside will be a threat to public safety and public order-Held: The alleged act cannot be said to be prejudicial to public order- The detention of the detent is declared to be without any lawful authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Hafiza Akhter Vs.

Other grounds for his detention that he is supplying state secrets to foreign countries by using his connection with the elites of the country, diplomats and by throwing lavish parties, that he is leading a perverted life, that he has misappropriated fifteen cores of Takas from commercial banks by fraudulent means, that he is involved in the killing of Sohel Chowdhury and Salman Shah, both film actors and that he is a man of bad repute are also vague and indefinite not supported by any material.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Naureen Aziz Mohammad Bhai Vs.

The State 8 BLT (HCD)-134</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-3(2)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The grounds of detention are that the detenue is an illegal arms holder, notorious murderer, terrorist and god-father of gold smuggling of Zia International Airport. He is involve in Murgi Milon Murder case, A pistol with two magazines containing 19 rounds of bullets were recovered from his luggage. The detenu is involved in transferring of thousands of dollars to foreign countries. The officers of the Airport are afraid of the detenu and are helpless to deal with detenue and as a result huge financial loss is sustained by the Government. Besides that, the detenu is responsible for the instability of the academic atmosphere in the Dhaka University and it is he who supplies arms to the students, He imports arms through the sea and that there are several criminal cases pending against him such as Kotwali P.S. Case no 46(9)2000 under Section 326/302/34 of the penal Code, Cantonment P.S. Case No. 10(4)2001 under section 19(ka) of the Arms Act; that he was detained twice before.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Held : The grounds for detention is vague, unspecified, indefinite, and as such the detenu was prevented from making any effective representation to be considered for his release by the authority, We also find clear non-application of mind by the detaining authority in passing the order for detention of the detenu. We have given our anxious consideration to the facts and circumstances of the case and the relevant provisions of the consititution and the special powers Act. We hold that the detenu Amin Rasul Shagor alias Tikai Shagor is being detained in custody without lawful authotiry and in an unlawful manner.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

He cannot curtail the liberty of a person by whimsical exercise of power given to him. He is not supposed to put his signature and seal on a police report without applying judicial mind. He is not supposed to pass "parrot like orders in a light hearted fashion."</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Korban Vs.

So according to us, the District Magistrate, Dhaka should pay the compensatory cost in the instant case of the detenu.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Korban Vs.

It is an order which follows from non- execution of an order passed under section 3(1) (a). It is therefore a consequential order and not an independent offence.

In the instant Rule the order of extension of the initial period of detention of the detenu for further period of 3(three) months passed by the government under Section 3(3) of the Act (Communicated by the Memo No.3332/ SHA:MA/NIRA-3) dated 27.12.2001 Annexure-'c' to the Writ Petition) has been challenged. No materials could be placed before that to show that the order passed under Section 3(3) of the Act is based on a report of an Advisory Board constituted under Section-3 and submitted complying with the provisions of Section 10,11 and 12 of the Act. Further we are of the view that orders relating to detention beyond 30 days passed under Section 3(2) approval is dependent on the report of the Advisory Board in terms of Section 11 and 12 of the Act and the government is empowered to extend the period of detention only under Section 12(1) of the Act and that too on the basis of the report of the Advisory Board.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Kudrat Alahi Khan Vs.

The accused appellants were not found with any objects or articles indicating that they had crossed the border so that an inference may also be made that the currency notes found their possession were also brought from outside Bangladesh, Mere possession Bangladeshi currency near the border area is not sufficient for conviction under the section charged and it must be shown with a certain degree of certainly that the said currency was brought from across the border to bring the act within the mischief of the said section.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

It further appears that Special Tribunal No. 1 Feni apart from being unaware of section 10 of the Cruelty to women (Deterrent Punishment) Ordinance, 1983 is also not aware of sections 4 and 9 of the Cruelty to Women (Deterrent Punishment) Ordinance, 1983.The Special Tribunal concerned is directed to frame fresh charges under sections 4 and 9 of the Cruelty to Women (Deterrent Punishment) Ordinance, 1983 and also under section 376 of the Penal Code as well as under section 376 of the Penal Code read with section 9 of the Cruelty to Women (Deterrent Punishment) Ordinance, 1983 against all the accused persons in the manner set out below.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Hadi Vs.

The expression used in sub section (1) of Section 27 of the Special powers Act is mandatory in nature. This Division in the case of Siraj Miah Vs. Bangladesh and another reported in 32 DLR(AD) 34 had held that cognizance of an offence under the special Powers Act by a Special Tribunal is possible only on the submission of a written report by a police officer not below the rank of Sub-Inspector. In the present case cognizance was taken against these two appellants on the basis of a 'Narazi' petition which is on the very face illegal and agreeing with the said decision of this Division we hold that the learned Special Tribunal committed illegality and wrong by taking cognizance against these two appellants in he manner as aforesaid.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Lt.

Therefore even if the accused person is released on bail by the Magistrate who had no power to try the case sub- section 6(A) would be attracted and the procedure of sub­section 6 shall not apply. Consequently, the trial can be held in absentia which will not be without jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mizan &amp; Ors. Vs.

Without passing such an order the senior Special Tribunal could not have treated the appellant as an absconding accused under sub- section (6A) of Section-27, because on absent person should not be too readily assumed to be an absconder without fixing a date for his appearance and without directing his sureties to produce him.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Neser Ahmed Vs. Govt. of Bangladesh 5 BLT (AD)-231</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-27(6)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case we do not find from the order sheet that the Tribunal has issued any notice for publication in daily newspaper as reared under Section 27(6) of the Special Powers Act rather the Tribunal relied on the notice published in daily newspapers by the order of the Magistrate before sending the record for trial, So we are of the opinion that the trial of the case held by the Special Tribunal relying on the notice published by the Magistrate was not in accordance with the provision of Sub Section (6) of Section 27 of the Special Powers Act and as such the trial held in absentia was Proper and legal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Samsul Alam Vs.

I. who has submitted the police report after investigation recommending discharge of the accused appellant having no prima facie case against him and there after sent the case record to the Special Tribunal for passing necessary order- the learned Special Tribunal without passing necessary order, fixed the matter for having at a longer date after more than a month and at the same time rejected the prayer for bail of the accused appellant without applying his judicial mind to the facts and circumstances of the case- the Special Tribunal was not justified in refusing the prayer for bail-appeal is allowed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

An offence under Section 342 of the Penal Code which is not included in the schedule of the Special Powers Act cannot be the basis of conviction as the same is a non-schedule offence. Hence, the learned Judges of the High Court Division acted wrongly and without jurisdiction in convicting the appellants under Section- 342 of the Penal Code when the same is not triable by the Special Tribunal at all.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdur Rahman &amp; Ors.
