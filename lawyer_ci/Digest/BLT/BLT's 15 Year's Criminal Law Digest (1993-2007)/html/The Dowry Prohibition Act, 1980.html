There being no specific evidence that other accused appellants demanded dowry, they are entitled to be acquitted from the charge.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Akramul Islam &amp; Ors Vs.

"Dowry" in Section 4 has therefore to be understood in its ordinary meaning namely, property brought by woman to her husband at marriage or vice versa. It must be held therefore that in the Bangladesh Act the legislature has taken care to see that not only the taking or giving of dowry or abatement thereof before or at the time of marriage is made an offence but also the demand thereof after the marriage.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abul Basher Howlader Vs.

She has been living with the father who is likely to be aware of the occurrence. But father of PW 1 did not come to depose as witness to support the allegation. It is abnormal and also unnatural. Evidence of PW 1 is the sole and only evidence on the point. There has not been any corroboration q demand of dowry from any independent witness -convict petitioner who entitled to get benefit of doubt.</p><p><strong><em>Nibash Chandra Sarker Vs.
