Mobility, vigilance training alertness, imbibed with sense of honesty patriotism and dedication to duty is the call of the hour. It is for the Government of the day to come forward and take appropriate steps in this regard. Otherwise! it may be too late.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs. O. C. Kafrul &amp; Ors 11 BLT (HCD)-511</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>General Observation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In respect of Mr. Shamshul Alam Khan, the then Metropolitan Additional Sessions Judge, 3rd court, Dhaka.<br/>An accused cannot be convicted on surmise. There must be direct or very strong circumstantial evidence to prove the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt. We are of the view that in passing death sentence upon an accused against whom there is no iota evidence or materials before him, the learned Judge has adequately demonstrated that he is not capable of exercising judicial function. In such view of the matter, in the great interest of the credibility of our judicial system, we would strongly recommend that appropriate action should be taken to immediately remove Mr. Shamshul Alam Khan, the then Metropolitan Addition Sessions Judge, 3rd Court, Dhaka fro service in any judicial capacity. We also recommend that inquiries be made regarding his efficiency and integrity.</p><p><strong><em>The State Vs.
