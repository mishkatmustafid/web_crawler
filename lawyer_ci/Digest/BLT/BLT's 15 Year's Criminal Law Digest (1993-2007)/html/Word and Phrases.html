Literal meaning of "alibi" is "elsewhere". In law this term is used to express that defence in a criminal prosecution where the party accused in order to prove that he could not have committed crime charged against him, offers evidence that he was in a different place at that time. The plea taken should be capable of meaning that having regard to time and place when and where he is alleged to have committed the offence he would not have been present . The plea of "alibi" postulates the physical impossibility of the presence of accused at the scene of offence by reason of his presence at another place.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs Md.

Lokman Patwary 2 BLT (AD)-142</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bail and Anticipatory Bail</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The word bail is generally meant a temporary release of the arrested or imprisoned person upon providing surety with the undertaking that his/ her presence on a particular day or place is secured. By anticipatory bail we mean bail in anticipation of arrest. The distinction is that bail is granted after arrest and anticipatory bail is granted in anticipation of arrest, and therefore, effective at the very movement of arrest, In other words unlike a pre-arrest order of bail, it is a pre-arrest order of release.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs. Abdul Wahab Sha Chowdhury &amp; Ors. 9 BLT (AD)-112</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Benefit of Doubt</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the shadow of a doubt. This doubt is not an imaginary doubt. Benefit of doubt to the accused would be available provided there is supportive evidence on record. For creating doubt or granting benefit of doubt, the evidence is to be such which may lead to such doubt. The law would fail to protect the community, the society if fanciful possibilities are admitted, thus, deflecting the course of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>M. Shamim Hossain (Shamim) V.s. The State 7 BLT (HCD) -89</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Benefit of Doubt</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The cherished principles or Golden thread of proof beyond Reasonable doubt which runs through the web of our law field should not be stretched morbidly to embrace every hunch and degree of doubt. The danger of exaggerated devotion to the Rule of Benefit of doubt at the expense of social defence and justice demands special emphasis on the contemporary context of escalating crime which is rapidly growing and is assuming menacing proportion. The concept that hundred guilty men may escape but one innocent person may not suffer now-a-days requires legal scrutiny afresh in as much as course of Justice cannot be made sterile and deflected on the plea. It a guilty person goes unpunished and stand acquitted, Justice system shall break down and public shall loose confidence in the Judicial system which has, also got a public accountability. It is true to say with Viscount Simons that "miscarriage of justice" may arise from the acquittal of the guilty on less that the conviction of the innocent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs., Ershad Ali Skkder &amp; Anr 11 BLT (HCD)-104</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Benefit of Doubt</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Benefit of doubt means an advantage or behoof of doubt. Reasonable doubt must be a doubt, arising from the evidences or from the want of evidences and cannot be an imaginary doubt or conjectures unrelated to evidence. Doubts which are real, genuine, well founded, which a normal man with normal intelligence in a given circumstances would normally harbour are doubt that come within the fold of Reasonable doubt entitling one to Benefit of doubt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs. Ershad Ali Sikder and Ors. 12 BLT (HCD)-481</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Circumstantial evidence</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Principles relating to circumstantial evidence are well settled. In first place, each of circumstances on which prosecution relies must be affirmatively established. In second place, circumstances in their totality must be consistent and consistent only with the guilt of the accused. In the third place, circumstances must be incompatible with the hypothesis of innocence of the accused. It is profitable to state that circumstantial evidence may be and frequently is more cogent than the evidence of eye-witness. There is no Rule that if there is no eye­witness to an incident an offender cannot be held guilty of offence he committed and conviction cannot be awarded upon perpetrators of crime. It is no difficulty to procure and produce false eye-witnesses and, it is on the other hand, extremely difficult to produce circumstantial evidence of a convincing character and, therefore, circumstantial evidence is more convincing and cogent than evidence of eyewitness.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs. Md. Ainul Haque 14 BLT (HCD) 234</em></strong></p><p><strong>Control</strong></p><p>"Control" in section 19(f) of The Act means that the offender must have such power over the weapon that he can direct its custody, production, use or disposal in some manner.</p><p>"Control" in context means power or ability to regulate the keeping or possession or use or disposal of the weapon. "Control" may be essential for possession and unless one has control over an article one may not be said to be in possession of it but one can have control over an article without being in possession of it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Babul Vs The State 13 BLT (HCD)-339</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Crime</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">"Crime" is, therefore, stated as an act or omission which is prohibited by law as injurious to the public and punished by law. Crime is wrong of a public character and it possesses element of evil which affect the public as a whole and not merely an individual. To put it differently, crime is an act deemed by law to be harmful to the society in general, even though its immediate victim is an individual.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shamim Hossain Vs. The State 7 BLT (HCD)-89</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Crime</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">"Crime" can be defined as an act that subjects the doer to legal punishment,. "Crime" may, also, be defined as the commission of an act specifically forbidden by law and it may be an offence against morality and social order.</p><p><strong><em>Md. Alfu Miah &amp; Anr. Vs. The State 10 BLT (HCD)-331</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dagger</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An article to bring under the definition of "Daggar" it must be a "stabbing weapon" with pointed and edged blade and it must be, also a "deadly weapon".</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Nepoleon Knondker @ Lepu &amp;Anr. Vs The State 10 BLT (HCD)-290</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Doubt</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Doubt, thus, must be of a reasonable man and reasonable doubt is that degree of doubt which would permit a reasonable and just man to come to a conclusion. Reasonableness of doubt must commensurate with the nature of the offence. Proof beyond Reasonable doubt shall not mean proof beyond the Shadow of doubt. The doubt shall not be an imaginary and fanciful doubt. Benefit of doubt to an accused would be available provided there is supportive evidence on record. For creating or granting Benefit of doubt will be such as may lead to such doubt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs. Ershad Ali Sikder &amp; Anr 11 BLT (HCD)-10</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>General Observation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Narcotic Control Act deals with narcotics and not with "Food and Beverage" under which the petitioner No. 1 was registered. The Pure Food Ordinance, 1959 deals, to some extent, with this matter under which the petitioners are not permitted to produce and marketing their "Crown" and "Hunter" containing this level of alcohol as Food and Beverage.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Crown Beverage Ltd. &amp; Ors Vs Board of Investment &amp; Ors 12 BLT (HCD) 295</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>"In Prosecution of common object"</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The words "in prosecution of common object" must be strictly construed as equivalent to "in order to" attain common object. The offence, executes or lends to execute common object unless the common mission of that offence is involved in the common object.—The Phrase, thus, means that the offence committed was immediately connected with the common object of unlawful assembly of which the accused are members. The offence must have been done with a view to accomplish common object attributed to the members of unlawful assembly. Mere presence at the scene does not make one a member of unlawful assembly unless it is proved that he shared common object of unlawful assembly.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The State Vs. A. S. I. Md. Ayub Ali Sarder &amp; Ors. 12 BLT (HCD)-14</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Inculpatory and Exculpatory</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant cast there is no direct evidence as to who had murdered the victim near the Mirpur Bus Stand No. 1 where the victim was found lying unconscious in a pool of blood with stab injury, On being taken to the Hospital the doctor declared him dead. Death of the victim is not disputed and the same has been proved by the evidence of the doctor P.W. 5 who held mortem examination over the dead body of the victim and evidence of other witnesses. The question is who had murdered the victim with stab injuries as found by the doctor. Accused Saiful was arrested by the police sometime after the occurrence on the same right from near about the place of occurrence on the showing of P.W.I Roushan Ara Begum and taken to the P.S. on query from her he disclosed that at the time of calling and taking away the victim from his residence the other man with him was appellant Billal. He made a confessional statement in which he stated that he along with Miraj and Billal had gossiped with the victim in the field at 06.30 in the evening of 26.10.1992 (the date of occurrence) and then the victim went away to his house. Then he along with Billal went to the shop for taking tea. Then one man came there and inquired about the victim. Billal asked him to go and call the victim. He went to the house of the victim with that man. Victim addressed that man as Dulal and asked his to take his seat. Then Alam (Victim) went away taking Dulal with him. Then he came back. Then he heard that the victim was murdered. He went to the P.S. to see victim but did not find him there. Police arrested him after half an hour from in front of the shop.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Above statement is partly inculpatory and fits in with the prosecution case in that in the evening Saiful and Billal had gossiped with the victim in the filed and then the victim returned to his house and sometime thereafter at the instance of Billal Saiful called the victim form his house. But the remaining part of the confessional statement is exculpatory. So we are unable to agree with the submission of the learned Advocate of the appellant that the entire confessional statement of Saiful is exculpatory.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Billal Vs. The State 9 BLT (AD)-41</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>"Law and Order' and "Public Order'</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is a difference between "Law and order" and "Public Order" The concept of "Law and order" is not identical with the concept of "Public order" "Public Order" is an aggravated form of disturbance of public peace. It affects the general current of public life. The expression "law and order: is wider in scope in as much as contravention of the law always affects order while "public order" has a narrower ambit and public order would be affected by only such contravention which affects the community or the public at large. When an order of detention is questioned, it is for the Court to apply well knows tests to find out whether the impugned activities upon which the order of detention is grounded fell under the classification of "Public order" or belong to the categOi^ of "law and order.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Afzal Hossain Vs. Ministry Home Affairs 10 BLT (HCD)-1</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>"Liberty under the Law"</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Liberty under the law - in a maxim recognized thought the whole world. The liberty of the citizen is in existence in so far as it is sanctioned and controlled by law and constitution. This liberty must not be interfered with under the guise of public interest, law order, public safety and public order.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Afzal Hossain Vs. Ministry Home Affairs 10 BLT (HCD)-1</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Per-incuriam</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A decision can be said generally to be given per-incuriam when the Court has decided a case in ignorance of a law applicable in the case or when the court has decided a case through ever sight of law applicable in the case, which were not considered and if considered, would have otherwise result. The expression "per incuriam" is a Latin word which means "through inadvertence" or "through want of care" According to P.S. Osborn's a Concise Law Dictionary "A decision of the Court is not a binding precedent if given per incuram Le. without the Court's attention having been drawn to the relevant authorities".</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abul Kalam Khan Vs. Reaz Morshed &amp; Ors. 10 BLT (HCD)-104</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>"Pendency of proceeding"</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any proceeding can be pushed forward even to the last ladder of hierarchy that is before Apex Court the Appellate Division and Proceeding before Apex Court for a final decision shall demonstratively be, also, a proceeding.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Mafizul Islam Sarker Vs. Sunil Chandra Biswas &amp; Ors. 12 BLT (HCD)-16</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Penal Interest </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Penal Interest is not same as "interest". Penal interest is extra liability incurred by a debtor for committing some wrong for making the payment when it should have been made to the person wronged. It is neither related with not limited to the damages suffered. Thus, when the liability to pay interest is founded on the doctrine of compensation, penal interest is a penalty founded on the doctrine of penal action. Penal interest can be charged only once for one period of default and therefore cannot be permitted to be capitalized.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Uttara Bank Ltd. Vs. Mrs. Ayesha Siddique &amp; Ors. 12 BLT (HCD)-106</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>'Petitioner'</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The term 'petitioner' as quoted in Article 49(4) of the Order, 1972 as (amendment) does not mean the petitioner himself and may be some body on his behalf and this part of the said order in our view is directory.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>G.Q. Chowdhury Vs. A.B.M. Fazle Karim Chowdhury &amp; Ors 13 BLT (AD) 12</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rape</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The word "rape" literally means forcible seizure and that element is characteristic feature of offence. Therefore, it can be said that rape is forcible ravishment of a woman/girl without her consent. To put simplest definition of rape is having sexual intercourse with a woman/girl without her consent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Wasim Miah &amp; Ors. Vs. The State 12 BLT (HCD)-40</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>"Sentence"</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 66(2)(d) of constitution of Bangladesh —The word "sentence" as employed in the aforesaid Article, in my opinion, means the final sentence passed by the Court either on the appeal or revision in the High Court Division and also on appeal before the Appellate Division pursuant to a leave petition filed by the aggrieved party. Because the hierarchy of courts established under the law and constitution has as definite purpose and section 410 of the Code of Criminal procedure and Article 103 of the Constitution providing for appeal should not be construed as an idle formality or a decoration piece. In other words, the date of conviction and sentence pronounced by the trial Court should not be taken to be the stating point for the disqualification to operate against the convict sitting Member on account of such conviction in a criminal case involving moral turpitude.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Hussain Muhammad Ershad Vs.
