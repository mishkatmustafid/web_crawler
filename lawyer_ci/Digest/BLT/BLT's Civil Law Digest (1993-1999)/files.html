Placing is the cause, vesting is the consequence. If placing goes, vesting also falls through. So whether it is Article 10( 1A) or Article 4(a), the result Is the same. If there is a lawful placing, vesting takes place under Article 10(1A) and a double vesting takes place under Article-4(1). But if the placing itself was unlawful, the vesting did not take place, either under Article- 10( 1A) or under Article-4(1).

Tapashee was asked by the Sangstha but Tapashee did not care to reply — The project was also discussed by the Martial Law Investigation Committee and the disbursed amount — the Sangstha claims a sum of Tk 64.46 lakhs due upto 1.1.1983. Held : In the face of such grave allegations Tapashee chose for reasons best known to it not to give any reply to the series of letters addressed to it by the Sangstha and remain silent which was trying to salvage the project. There cannot be any manner of doubt that the Sangstha in the aforesaid circumstances became entitled to repayment of the loan under Article 32. That being so, there can also be no doubt that the Sangstha was fully entitled to proceed against the opposite party respondents No.1-5 under Article 33 for realisation of the loan. Thus in any case it must be said that the High Court Division upon a mistaken view of the law and facts wrongly held that Article 33 was not attracted in the case of the aforesaid opposite party-respondents.

The appointment of a guardian, therefore, of minor heirs of defendant who died during pendency of suit is absolutely necessary. A minor cannot be considered to be a party to suit unless he is properly represented in a suit by a duly qualified and competent guardian. When a minor has legally become a party to the suit, only then the court would acquire jurisdiction to decide the case.

The appellate Court is also required to set aside the material findings of the trial Court with reference to the evidence on record adverting to the reasons assigned by it.

We also find that the application by the respondent under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code has not yet been disposed of. It is also a fact that the alleged existence of a daughter of Khairunnessa was canvassed for the first time before the High Court Division and that also without any support of evidence. Again, all throughout haziras were filed before the trial court on behalf of the deceased defendant Khairunnessa till 20 July 1985 when Nurul Islam made an application disclosing her death. It is obvious that the plaintiff had no inkling of the death of Khairunnessa till 20 July 1985. It is only in or about the middle of November, 1985 that the plaintiff seems to have the definite knowledge of the death of Khairunnessa without leaving any heir behind. He then came up with an application on 17 November 1985 praying for an1endmnt of the plaint by way of substituting the Government for Khairunnessa, The learned Assistant Judge, however passed an order on 22 December 1985 recording of abatement of the suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The plaintiff made the application for setting aside the abatement after the order was passed on 22 December 1985 which is within 14 days of the order. The learned Judge of the High Court Division completely overlooked these facts and set aside the order of the learned Assistant Judge dated 13 August 1987. The learned Single Judge laid unnecessary stress upon certain averments in the written statement which were only matters of contest between the parties at the trial and had no bearing upon the abatement. In our opinion the impugned judgment of the High Court Division is a product of non application of judicial mind and suffers from patent illegality.

The inherent power conferred under section 151 of the Code can be available in a case where there is no other provision for providing a redress. Power under section 151 of the Code can be invoked by a court only when the court is satisfied that prevention of the abuse of the process of the court is necessary or when ends of justice demand that the wrong complained of would be remedied. In the name of ends of justice, the remedy provided in the Code itself cannot be allowed to be negative and also to be thwarted. The court, of course, under section 151 of the Code preserves the power to set aside order passed under misapprehension of facts when true facts are brought to light. The court also got the inherent power to vacate any order obtained by misleading the court and practicing fraud upon it. The court, in the exercise of the power under section 151 of the Code, also, can correct the unintentional or inadvertent mistake committed by it.

The decree of the trial court having been modified by the High Court it merged into the decree of the High Court. Hence, the question of drawing up of a modified decree on 9.8.93 in the light of the judgment and decree of the High Court in First Appeal is wholly illegal and without jurisdiction. It is found that the modified decree was passed on 22.3.1960 and to avoid the question of limitation a modified decree was again drawn up by the trial court on 9.8.93 and which is so obvious that it was obtained from a court by fraudulent means. Even if, it is admitted that a mistake was committed by the executing court Itself even then there are innumerable authorities of this court to hold that any error or wrong committed by the court itself can be corrected in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure to secure the ends of justice and to prevent the abuse of process of court. Thus, the execution proceeding is apparently barred under Article 182 of the Limitation Act. The plaintiff did not take any steps within three years from the modified decree of the High Court nor he kept alive the decree by taking steps to execute the decree within 12 years from the date of the final modified decree.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thus in order to avoid the bar of limitation the plaintiff fraudulently got the modified decree drawn up by the trial court. Hence the application under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure is maintainable in the facts of the present case.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Further, the plaintiff got decree for 8 Anna’s share of the suit property as modified by the High Court. In the execution proceeding the application was filed by the decree- holder for partition and for possession. Without filing a partition suit the executing court cannot also pass an order for possession when the decree itself does not contemplate such possession by partition of the property by metes and bounds. This exercise of jurisdiction by the executing court is palpably erroneous and without jurisdiction. [Paras- 10 &amp; 11]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>M. Majid Vs.

In exercise of their right the appellants well within the period of limitation submitted the required application for substitution furnishing all the required particulars and the same having been allowed by the court they also prosecuted both the Misc.

From the date of acceptance of the appellant’s said application there was no legal existence of the deceased plaintiff in the case record, whose name could not have been retained by the trial court in the plaint when the suit was restored to its file and number.

The case of the plaintiff opposite party is that he got the suit property from his father Poyer Mamud Mondal and fufu Powchhari Bibi by way of settlement on obtaining dakhilas in the year of 1345 B.B.. which facts are stoutly denied by the present petitioners. It has been contended in the application under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure that the original tenants Poyer Mamud Mondal and Powchhari Bibi never settled the suit land with the plaintiff and the plaintiffs claim of title by way of settlement is false. It has further been asserted that as co-owners of the suit property by inheritance like the plaintiff the petitions have been owning and possessing the suit property in ejmali. It was also contended in no uncertain terms that the plaintiffs’ papers in respect of the alleged settlement are totally false and fabricated. It thus appears that vital interests of the petitioners are involvement in the suit and they have definite say in the adjudication of the suit and they are interested in the result of the suit for declaration of title in the suit land. in the face of the clear and specific assertions made by the petitioners it is evident that vital interests of the petitioner are involved in the suit and as such their presence in the suit is necessary for proper adjudication of the controversies between the contending parties.

It means it was an existing law till the 13th November, 1996. When a statute is repealed by the Parliament its disappearance from the statute-book takes place from the date of repeal, either prospectively or retrospectively according as the legislature prescribes. But if as statute is declared void ab initio by the Court its disappearance from the statute-book takes place retrospectively from the date of enactment of the repealed statute, never prospectively. If a statute is declared void ab initio by a Court no rights accrue at all. No obligation or liability generates from the void law. But a repealed statute retains accrued rights and obligaions, unless avoided specifically or by necessary implication. In the present case no Court of law has earlier pronounced that the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 is void ab initio. The Parliament was therefore free to pass a declaratory statute declaring that the said Ordinance was void from the very beginning; but it did not do so. It preferred to treat the said Ordinance as an existing law and repealed it. The High Court Division made a basic mistake in holding that the Parliament has legally repealed a void law, little giving thought that a void law has to be declared void by a declaratory statute and a repeal can only be made of an existing law in case of repeal the Repeal Act is itself liable to be repealed by the same Parliament or subsequent Parliament, reviving the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975; but when a Court declares the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 void ab-initio the Parliament cannot re-enact the same legislation afresh. It will be struck down as unconstitutional. It is buried forever. This distinction was lost sight of by the High Court Division.

But once the Government takes a decision to reinstate him in service, whether by way of executing an otherwise inexcusable decree or by its own volition, without re-appointing him or giving him any break in service, the respondent will be deemed to be in service throughout the period of his removal.

I it clearly appears that Harendra Lal Saha and others became the owners of the suit property and they possessed the same and sold the same to Mrs. Parveen Akhter by registered sale deeds in 1981—the rent receipts together with the continuous record as right vide exhibits I series may be treated as collateral evidence of title in favour of the plaintiff. Now, if we consider the oral as well as documentary evidence as stated above, we find that this Harendra Lal Saha and others acquired right and title over the suit property. The documents by which the heirs Harendra Lal and Jagannath transferred the suit land to Parveen Akhter and the registered document by which Parveen Akther transferred the land to the present plaintiffs are not disputed at all. So it is held that the learned Subordinate Judge failed to consider the material evidence or record as stated above and he has arrived at a wrong finding and as such it cannot be sustained.

There was no evidence that the tahsiider who allegedly gave the settlement had any authority to do so. The Dakhilas produced by the plaintiff were also not properly proved and the trial court wrongly exhibited the ‘fordi’ and Dakhilas as the basis of settlement as there was no proper proof of them — We may add that there is nothing on record to relate Ext.4 to the settlement claimed by the plaintiff. Agaib, the hukumnama and other documents of settlement in favour of the plaintiff were for the plaintiff to produce. In the absence of proof of existence of the said documents the defendants could not be supposed to be in a position to produce them.

But obviously the assessments were not a closed transaction and the Appellate Joint Commissioner of Taxes had the whole question of assessment open before him. If there was a subsequent circular of the National Board of Revenue requiring the assessing officer to treat the evidentiary value of an audit report in a particular manner then that circular was as much binding on the Appellate Joint Commissioner of Taxes as upon the original assessing officer because the assessment had still not attained a finality.

The trial Court and the appellate court cannot assume the role of a fresh fact-finding body over which either the Enquiry Officer or the punishing authority has already made their respective exercises in a domestic proceeding. We find with dismay that the trial court while setting out the parameter of its enquiry stated in the very beginning that if in this suit the plaintiff can prove satisfactorily that there was a dacoity in the godown of TCB then it will be taken that he had not misappropriated the milk food in question. That was a wrong approach adopted by the trial court and to our regret the erroneous conception persisted upto the High Court Division which ought to have known better. The simple issue in this suit was whether the punishing authority had followed the procedure in differing with the findings of the Enquiry Officer, whether it gave reasons for differing with the findings of the Enquiry Officer, whether the plaintiff was informed of the reasons and whether the plaintiff got a further opportunity to meet the reasons given by the punishing authority.

The only question that can be decided under Art. 3—whether a person is qualified to be deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh. The notification indicates that the government did not ask the right question, namely, whether the respondent was a permanent resident in Bangladesh on 15 December, 1972.

There is no power under Article 3 for denuding a person of his citizenship for the offence of collaboration with the Pakistan Occupation Army. Indeed, there is nothing in P.O. No 149 of 1972 which authorised the Government on the date of the impugned notification to disqualify a citizen on the ground of collaboration with the Pakistan Occupation Army.

Secondly, even if the allegations are correct, citizenship law does not deny citizenship to those who opposed the creation of Bangladesh and even killed freedom fighters and were engaged in murder, rape, etc. There were many Muslims (and Hindus as well) who opposed the creation of Pakistan Citizenship law did not deny them citizenship. They deemed to be citizen of Pakistan if they had permanent residence in the territory of Pakistan and did not leave the same. Bangladesh also followed the same principle. In Bangladesh, collaborators and Razakars were prosecuted under the collaborators order P.O.

The trial court decreed the suit of respondent No. 2 with a direction on the BSC to reinstate him in his service as the Secretary of the Corporation. There is the simple direction given by the trial court which was upheld upto the Appellate Division. Respondent No. 2 in all his applications of joining made a prayer for fixing his seniority and that is why the appellant sought the opinion of the parent Ministry and the Legal Adviser in the matter. Immediately the opinion of the Legal Adviser was sought for without any delay and on 19.5.1994 respondent No. 2 was directed to submit a normal and proper joining report. It thus appears that within 112 months from the first letter praying for joining as Secretary, the appellant directed respondent No. 2 to file a normal joining report and to join as Secretary of BSC, but respondent No. 2 without joining moved the High Court Division in a contempt proceedings on 5.5.1994. Respondent No. 2 did not even wait for 112 months but moved the High Court Division in contempt. In the background of the admitted fact and correspondence it is difficult to hold that the appellant had wilfully shown any disrespect and disobedience towards the order of the court. As the matter was not a simpie joining report the appellant in bonafide and good faith immediately sought clarification of the Ministry and the opinion of the Legal Adviser, as directed by the Ministry. In those correspondences there was nothing to show that any contumaciousness was shown regarding the implementation of the order of the court. There was also no delay or laches on the part of the appellant in taking effective steps in implementing the courts order. We do not find that the conduct of the appellant was such of flouting the order of the court deliberately and to treat the court’s order with some degree of hatred or malice—in this case the appellant challenged the contempt Rule and filed a Counter Affidavit setting up his defence upon alternative facts and circumstances in which he acted under a bonafide and good faith. As a matter of fact he had no authority also to fix the question of fixation of seniority and promotion. Thus, in the facts of the present case probably no apology was sought for as he was in fact acting with honest belief for clarification. The apology in this case would have shown that he had committed the offence of contempt. In the present case, It appears that within 112 months of the filing of the joining report respondent No. 2 was asked to join. There was in fact no delay and no attempt was made to obstruct the order of the court. In the facts and circumstances as indicated above, we have no hesitation in our mind in holding that no contempt was committed by the appellant.

The suit property never lost its character of an undivided homestead because there had admittedly been not partition by metes and bounds by any previous arrangement.

His service was declared as surplus by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by a memo date 23.6.76 and his name was forwarded to the Ministry of Establishment for absorption.

The respondents could not then have been heard to say that the post of Inspector and the post of Upper Division Assistant are higher or lower posts, entailing higher or lower degrees of responsibility. The Inspector of Taxes and Upper Division Assistant being equivalent posts both for purposes of grade and scale of pay the appellant was entitled from 22.11.76 to 30.6.77 to count his previous service for fixation of seniority, in terms of the Establishment Division’s Memo dated 20.3.79. But both the appellant and the respondents missed the essential point in the entire litigation, namely, that on and from 1.7.77 the amalgamation of Upper Division Assistant and Inspector of Taxes into the same grade and scale of pay was done away with, making it a thing of the past, and obliterated event, leaving no trace of any vested right that may have accrued upto 30.6.77. From 1.7.77 an Upper Division Assistant and Inspector of Taxes are not equivalent posts, either in respect of grade or in respect of scale of pay. The appellant will not be considered to have been absorbed in an equivalent post. Yes, he was absorbed in an equivalent post in 1976, but the equivalence “ceased to exist” from 1.7.77. Because of the respondents’ inability to bring into sharp focus this vital legal aspect of the matter the judgment of the Appellate Tribunal has made a foray into redundant considerations, like the distinction between the duties of an Upper Division Assistant and an Inspector of Taxes. The basic legal position is that from 1.7.77 the appellant remains absorbed in a post different in grade and scale of pay from the post of Upper Division Assistant and therefore with no assistance from the Establishment Division Memo dated 20.3.79 and the various other Government Memos brought to our notice by Mr. Abdur Rab Chowdhury can the appellant in any way be permitted to count his previous service from 29.9,70 to 2 1.11.76 for fixation of his seniority.

By citizen it is now meant a person who is a member of an independent political community having rights and obligation under the constitution and law of that country, what sovereignty is to a state. citizenship is to a person. Sovereignty gives a state membership in the family of nation and citizenship gives a person membership in the political community of his country. Citizenship, the status of being a citizen, is a term of Municipal Law, Nationality, the status of being a national, is a term of international law. Citizenship, though not mentioned as a fundamental right in our Constitution, is to be considered as the right of all rights as on it depends one’s right to fundamental rights expressly provided for a citizenship In part III of the Constitution.

All nations of a state are not citizens though citizens must be nationals. A national of a state may not possess full civil or political rights, but a citizen must possess full civil or political rights. The provisions of the Act of 1951 and P.O. 149 of 1972 are to be read together to get a complete picture of the law of citizenship in Bangladesh.

In other words, it can be stated that the facts that are alleged in the plaint and which are required to be proved without proof of which the plaintiff would not be entitled to a judgment, constitute the cause of action. Equally It can be said that a cause of action presupposes the existence of a right In the plaintiff which right has either been infringed or is threatened to be infringed. The right must be a substantive right, or it may pertain only to procedure, but the right must be there. Whether any particular facts constitute a cause of action has to be determined with reference to the facts of each case and with reference to the substance rather than the form of the action. Cause of action cannot be construed in an isolated way and the whole averments made in the plaint are to be seen and taken together to see whether any cause of action has been disclosed or not.

The Govt. of Bangladesh does not challenge the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division. The relevant authority on being satisfied that the original owner, Pran Gopal. is a Bangladeshi decided that his property was wrongly listed as vested property arid accordingly passed the order to release the property from the list of vested property in exercise of their authority under the relevant law.

Section 81A(2) stated positively how the rights and liabilities of nonagricultural tenants other than those who have become tenants under the Government by virtue of compulsory acquisition of land shall be determined. The NAT Act has not been mentioned to be a governing law in respect of such tenants of nonagricultural land under the Government. Hence, on both accounts, under section 85(2) of the NAT Act and section 8 IA(2) of the SAT Act, the ouster of NAT Act from the categories mentioned therein are complete. Section 24 of the NAT Act has no manner of application to lands of Dhanmondi Residential Area.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Md. Mosaddeque Hossain Vs.

If it were to be so, then an absurd situation will arise; for example, if an order of dismissal is passed with immediate effect and kept under the pillow of the maker, then the dismissed person cannot attend office from the next day because it has become effective as soon as the order was passed. Nothing can be more offensive to common sense than to suggest that the order will be operative without the person knowing that an order was passed against him—We think it is a sound proposition that an order to be effective must at least be communicated to the person concerned and the date of actual receipt is not material for the said purpose. In the present case, it is apparent that there was no communication of the order of dismissal until 4.1.87. MW No. 9 having been repealed in the meantime, the light had gone out of the order. The order was not communicated to the respondent when there was light in It. The respondent was communicated about the order at a time when no light could be put in the order. Therefore the order of dismissal qua the respondent was not an order under the MLO. It could not be effective against him at any time.

Deputy Secretaries are being considered for promotion to the selected posts of Joint Secretary. Additional Deputy Commissioners and the like are being considered for a promotion to the selected posts of Deputy Secretary. They have already put in a number of years in Government service which is basically different from working as a Pilot in a Commercial Airline. Evaluation of their efficiency, conduct, discipline, comprehension, initiative, zeal to work, honesty, personality and various other requirements of service have been recorded each year in their respective ACRs. That ought to be the most dominant and persuasive document for the purpose of evaluating the candidates’ eligibility for the promotion post. The marks fixed for interview should be minimum so as not to upset the accumulated credits achieved by the candidates over the years in their respective ACRs by a momentary impression created in the minds of the Interview Board before which the candidates cannot possibly appear for more than a few minutes. There is a strong need to protect the public servant from the propensity of politicisation of administration by a party Government by keeping the marks for interview as minimum as possible so that the scope of arbitrariness and the possibility of pick and choose are absolutely minimised. We would therefore agree with the ultimate decision of the learned majority Judges of the special Bench that allocation of 40% marks for interview in the context of the situation obtaining in our country and in the context of the finding that the guidelines were arbitrarily and that 15% marks for interview under the circumstances would be a safe marking system for protecting the neutral character of public service.

In one sentence the learned Judge’s of the High Court Division held that “the evidence of PWs 2- 5 didn’t inspire any confidence.” This is indeed a perfunctory assessment of the evidence on record by a court of fact and consequently the modification of the trial Court’s judgment has been done in a slipshod manner.

On a close scrutiny of the Bainapatra deeds it appears that one Bainapatra deed had been written on a stamp paper and another written on a cartridge paper purchased in the year 1969. Exhibit-8 is a kabala deed dated 4.8.71 which was executed by defendant No. 7 in favour of the father of defendant nos. 1-5. It is recited in the said kabala deed that following the alleged agreement, defendant No. 7 transferred the suit land in favour of the father of the defendant nos. 1-5. Exhibit-4 is a deed of reconveniance executed by the father of defendant nos. 1-5 in favour of defendant No. 7. From the above, it reveals that at the time of the alleged execution of the Bainapatra deeds, the defendant No. 7 was not the owner of land, and, as such, the Bainapatra deeds by a person who was not the owner of the land got no legal force and also legal existence in the eye of law. In the written statement filed on 27.9.1996 by the defendant nos. 1-5, defendant Nos. 4 and 5 had been shown as minors but in the Bainapatra deed exhibit-F, it was not at all recited that the defendant No. 5 had been minor at that time. Exhibit-i, a School Certificate duly proved by the Head Master of the concerned school is an evidence to show that the defendant No. 5 was born only on 24.6.1974. The matter, thus, became manifestly clear that the defendant No. 5 was not at all born on the date of the alleged execution of Bainapatra i.e., in the year 1971. Both the courts below on a proper consideration and discussion of the legal evidence and other materials on record came to the positive finding that the Bainapatra deeds Exhibits-F and Fl are totally false and are acts of forgery. On consideration of the materials on record I do not find any reason to disagree with above the findings arrived at by the courts below.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Zamiruddin Ahmed Vs.

After disposal of the suit by order dated 6.5.87 there remainers title sense in fixing 13.5.87 for considering the petitioners’ application for staying further proceedings of the suit.
