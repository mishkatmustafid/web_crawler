It is for the first time before the Administrative Appellate Tribunal that the objection as to defect of party was raised. The objection having been raised at the appellate stage an application was filed by the respondent for proper description of the party by impleading ‘Bangladesh Krishi Bank’ as a party. In that view of the matter, the submission of the learned Advocate Is too technical and for which the respondent should not suffer. Apart from this technical objection, we also find that both the tribunals below found that due opportunity was not accorded to the respondent to plead his case before the Board of Inquiry for which the respondent was materially prejudiced in his defence. In that view of the matter, there is nothing for our interference with the impugned judgment of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal.

Thereafter on 15.4.90 he submitted an application for reemployment in the Bank. The authority, rejected his application for re-employment by order dated 16.3.92—Held : It is clear that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is attracted when the person is in the service of the Republic of any statutory public authority but in the present case the former service of the respondent had ceased to exist and the question of re-employment is an issue wherein the respondent has no legal claim in the service of the appellant Bank. It is purely a matter of discretion for the appellant to re-employ the respondent and if, for any reason the appellant does not feel inclined to re-employ the respondent, that matter cannot be brought within the jurisdiction of the Administrative Tribunal not being covered by the Provision of Section 4(2) of the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980.

In the present case, condonation principle should apply. [Paras-20 &amp; 21]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Md. Ali Emdad Vs.
