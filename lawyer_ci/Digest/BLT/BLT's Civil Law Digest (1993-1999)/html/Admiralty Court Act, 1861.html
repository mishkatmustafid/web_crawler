Under Section 6 the owner or consignee or assignee of any bill of lading can file an Admiralty Suit— It is true that the plaintiff has filed the suit claiming the amount for loss/damages of the consignment by the negligence of defendant No. 1 or its master and crews but all disputes from the port of loading to the port of delivery arose out of various contracts. So it is not correct to say that the claim of compensation for damages is independent of any contract. Thus, the learned Admiralty Judge was correct in holding that the suit is not maintainable in Admiralty Jurisdiction on this count as well.

But written statement was promptly filed in the Principal cause along with a counter claim for an amount for which cross cause was subsequently filed—it has not in any way prejudiced any legal right that can be said to have accrued to the plaintiff of the Principal cause—it would be just and proper if the plaintiff of the Principal cause is required to furnish a Bank Guarantee of the equal amount which the defendant of the Principal cause has furnished.

A dispassionate and balanced approach to the vital aspects of the case and the law bearing on the subject is a precondition for administering even-handed justice. Law, equity and good conscience demand that justice should not only be done but it must also be seen to have been done. [Para- 141</p><p><em><strong>Md. Hanif Sheikh Vs. Mst.
