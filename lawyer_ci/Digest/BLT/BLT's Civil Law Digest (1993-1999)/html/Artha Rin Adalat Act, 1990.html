And Article 102 of the Constitution having wider scope is available against an interlocutory order passed by Artha Rn Adalat.

The nature and function of the Artha Rin Adalat coupled with Its power and authority clearly indicate that it is a special forum of limited jurisdiction and not an ordinary civil court right to review like the right of appeal is a substantive right and not a mere matter of procedure — the power to review is not an inherent power. It must be conferred by law either specifically or by necessary implication no application for review under Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure lies in the Artha rin Adalat. The review application was not entertalnable by the Artha Rin Adalat and as such, Incompetent.

Applying this proposition in the facts of the instant case as set out In the plaint there seems to be no escape from the conclusion that the defendant has a debt to the plaintiff which is concurrently found to be a financial institution and that being so it must be held that the suit filed by the plaintiff in the Artha Rin Adalat for realizing the said debt which is a loan; under Section 2 (Kha) is quite maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Saudi Bangladesh kid. &amp; Ors Vs.

Accordingly, the Artha Rin Adalat, under the provision Artha Rin Adalat Act cannot legally pass any order as to how the suits filed under the general law would proceed simultaneously or otherwise with suits filed in Artha Rin Adalat under the provision of Artha Rin Adalat, obviously if any such order is passed that cannot be said to have been passed under the Artha Rin Adalat Act and that order cannot get the benefit of section 5 of the Artha Rin Adalat Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As such we hold that the Artha Rin Adalat acted beyond its jurisdiction conferred by section 5 of the Artha Rin Adalat Act—impugned orders are amenable to revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 C.P.C.

Although the effect of a set off or counterclaim is that of a plaint in a cross suit, Order-7, Rule-11, C.P.C will not apply in rejecting such set off or counterclaim. Plaintiff may have recourse to section 151 of the C.P.C. for such rejection. Alternatively, plaintiff may bring the maintainability of the set off or counterclaim as an issue of law under Order 14 Rule 2 C.P.C. which may be decided first. In view of the patent inadmissibility of the counterclaim within the framework of Adalat Act, plaintiffs’ application under Order-7 Rule -11 can be treated as one under Section-151 C.P.C.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Sultana Jute Mills Ltd.

Section- 7 of the ARA Act provides for a Special Period of Limitation of 30 days for preferring an appeal against the judgment of the decree of the ARA. The cross-objection filed beyond thirty days was rightly rejected by the High Court Division as time barred—in view of Section-6 of the ARA Act a defendant can only challenge the decree of the ARA by filing an appeal under Section-7 of the Act—and is liable to pay necessary court fee and observe other formalities—the petitioners are not entitled to file any cross- objection, under Order-4l, Rule-22 of the Code of Civil Procedure—the petitions are dismissed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Md.

If any other meaning Is given to section 7, then this section will mean that the judgment is appealable but the operative portion of the judgment, namely, the order, will have to be challenged otherwise than by way of appeal. Such an incongruous result cannot be contemplated in any law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Sardar Jart-A-Alam Vs.

The petitioner appeared and contested the case stating, inter alia, that he was not a defaulter. On the date for further examination of the petitioner, an application was filed on behalf of the petitioner seeking leave of the court to ask him two specific questions, namely (1) what was the time of repayment of the loan sanctioned by the Krishi Bank and how this time has been given? and (b) was the payment of installment re-scheduled by the Bank and if so what are the re-scheduled dates? The tribunal rejected the said application, the High Court Division observed that the petitioner should be allowed to give his reply in question No. 1, without saying anything about question No. 2.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Held: It is difficult to appreciate why the Tribunal rejected the prayer for the aforesaid 2 questions to be put to the petitioner because his case apparently was that he was not a defaulter. In order to substantiate his defence, he cannot bring any relevant fact on the record. Evidently the answers to the two questions will be relevant for the purpose of his defence. The petitioner should have been allowed to reply to both the questions. [Para-7]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Abdur Razzak Ashis Vs. Elec.
