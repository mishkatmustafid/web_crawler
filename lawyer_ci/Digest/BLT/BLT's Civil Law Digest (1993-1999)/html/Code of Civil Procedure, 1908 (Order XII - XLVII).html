The plaintiff having been adversely affected by the suspension order has filed the suit and as such it cannot be said that he has no cause of action to file the suit. Further, whether the suit is barred under Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, or not is a matter which could be mooted as an issue in the suit. Thus it cannot be said that there is no cause of action and the suit is barred by any law. [Para-61</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Alhaj B. N. Khan (Degree) College Vs. Md.

The plaintiffs prayed for declaration that they are entitled to get the suit lands derequisitioned in their favour and also for a decree of khas possession— Held: Since no act of the Corporation has been challenged by the plaintiffs in the suit, they were not required to serve any notice as contemplated under Section 74 of the Ordinance of 1961 and the plaint also cannot be rejected for non-service of notice under the said section of the said Ordinance.

It is posited here that the contention raised is a question of maintainability which does not come within the four walls of the provisions of Order-Vu, Rule-il of the Code and this question of maintainability can be agitated by the defendant-petitioner at the time of hearing of the suit.

However if the observations as made by the Special Bench of the High Court Division to the effect that the suit is barred by principles of res-judicata reached its finality, then however the petitioners could argue that the aforesaid view should be read along with the plaint but since a civil appeal has been filed against the above orders on dated 10.3.97 and 19.6.97 of the Special Bench passed in F.M.A. No. 81 of 1996 and the same is pending for hearing in the Appellate Division, at the (the) aforesaid view of the Special Bench of the High Court Division cannot be read along with the plaint of the present suit. However when the suit may be taken up for hearing defendants will be at liberty to raise this issue of res judicata relying on the judgments passed in Writ Petition No. 3734 of 1992 along with observations made in F.M.A. No. 81 of 1996 and under the provision of Order 14 Rule 2 C.P.C. the learned Subordinate Judge may be postponing other issues of fact, hear this issue of law regarding maintainability of the suit on the principles of res-judicata.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Chairman, RMUK Vs.

The said application was rejected by the trial court holding that the counter claim was made under the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure which is applicable in the proceedings of Artha Rin Adalat—Held: we have examined the provisions of the Act and there is no Provision for making counter claim by a defendant—Even if it were held that the Civil Procedure Code is applicable in the instant case then also the trial court acted illegally and without jurisdiction in as much as the counter claim raised by the defendant do not come within the perview of Rule-6 of Order 8 as the sum claimed by way of damage is not an ascertained amount.

In our case under review the plaintiff clearly stated in the plaint that Lakshman Mondal had died in this country as a citizen of the erstwhile East Pakistan leaving the plaintiff as his only heir to succeed him and he led evidence to prove the said assertion by the unchallenged oral and documentary evidence and there being no contrary evidence on record, the learned Courts below clearly erred in law in dismissing the suit ignoring the positive evidence on record by resorting to hypothetical assumptions and the same has resulted in error in the impugned decision occasioning failure of justice.

It appears further that admittedly there are series of transaction in between the parties at different places and countries starting from Rangoon and ultimately the vessel was arrested when it was discharging business at Haldia in India by order of the Court. In such circumstances where the plaintiff withdraw the suit, the prayer of the defendant to proceed with the counter claim treating it as plaint is not maintainable.

Therefore, after rejecting the application for issuance of warrant without passing further order directing the parties to get ready passing of the order of dismissal of the suit is hit by Order 9 Rule 3 of the Civil Procedure Code. It is held that a suit cannot be dismissed Order 9 Rule 3 of the Code. When the plaintiff made an application in the court as referred above treating the posijon as absence of the plaintiff, which is apparently illegal.

Case No. 71 of 1984 did not examine any witness in support of his case. Except his uncorroborated statements incorporated in his application under Order 9 Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure there is absolutely nothing on record to prove that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing before the Couft when the case was called for hearing and this led to the dismissal of his case for default. In the absence of any evidence before him providing necessary satisfaction that the petitioner was really prevented by sufficient cause from appearing before the Court on the fateful day, the learned trial Court clearly erred in law in allowing Miscellaneous Case No. 71 of 1984 completely ignoring the mandatory provisions of Order 9 Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

One of the basic principles of the adversary procedure followed in our court system is that as far as possible. No proceeding be conducted to the detriment of a person in his absence. One exception to this principle is that when the defendant, duly served with summons, does not avail himself of the opportunity to appear, the court may proceed in his absence under Rule-6(1)(a) of Order-IX. There being no mandate as such to make ex parte’ decree the court may order for fresh service of summons on the defendants or adjourn the matter suo motu. If the court is satisfied that the summons was duly served on the defendant may proceed to decide the matter. [Para- 11]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Alfu Miah and others Vs.

It was further observed that ‘the trial court must set out the point for determination and the reason for determination and this will again be arrived at on evidence on record and the evidence on record must establish the case of the plaintiff which again must show a cause of action. It is true that there Is no hard and fast rule for writing an ex parte judgment.

It is crystal clear from this order dated 11.8.86 that defendant No. 2 was surreptitiously made defendant No. 3 subsequently by an unscrupulous zealot by interpolation which is easily discernible from a cursory look at the order sheet and this fact is further magnified by Order No. 16 dated 28.8.86 wherein it was specifically mentioned that the next date of the suit was fixed on 11.9.86 for service return of summons upon defendant No. 2 by usual process as well as by registered post. After that there is no order in the entire order sheet indicating that summons was ever served upon defendant No. 2 in the usual course. There is also no clear proof on record to find that summons by registered post was duly served upon defendant No. 2. Although by order No. 33 dated 24.5.87 the trial Court in a casual manner found that notice upon defendant No. 2 was served by registered post under the provisions of Section 19(b) sub-clause (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure but except this stray observation made in the order sheet there is no other material on record, to prove that summons was duly served upon defendant No. 2 either by the usual process or by registered post. From this it is manifestly clear that no summons was served upon defendant No. 2 as required by law—Held: In the instant case, since there was no due service of summons upon defendant No. 2 (petitioner) impugned decree is liable to be set aside.

The appointment of a guardian, therefore, of minor heirs of defendant who died during pendency of suit is absolutely necessary. A minor cannot be considered to be a party to suit unless he is properly represented in a suit by a duly qualified and competent guardian. When a minor has legally become a party to the suit, only then the court would acquire jurisdiction to decide the case.

We also find that the application by the respondent under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code has not yet been disposed of. It is also a fact that the alleged existence of a daughter of Khairunnessa was canvassed for the first time before the High Court Division and that also without any support of evidence. Again, all throughout haziras were filed before the trial court on behalf of the deceased defendant Khairunnessa till 20 July 1985 when Nurul Islam made an application disclosing her death. It is obvious that the plaintiff had no inkling of the death of Khairunnessa till 20 July 1985. It is only in or about the middle of November, 1985 that the plaintiff seems to have the definite knowledge of the death of Khairunnessa without leaving any heir behind. He then came up with an application on 17 November 1985 praying for an1endmnt of the plaint by way of substituting the Government for Khairunnessa, The learned Assistant Judge, however passed an order on 22 December 1985 recording of abatement of the suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The plaintiff made the application for setting aside the abatement after the order was passed on 22 December 1985 which is within 14 days of the order.

The learned Single Judge laid unnecessary stress upon certain averments in the written statement which were only matters of contest between the parties at the trial and had no bearing upon the abatement.

The review can never be allowed to be utilized as an opportunity for rehearing a matter which is closed by a decision recorded by a Judge.
