Without reversing the findings of the courts below on the grounds mentioned in Section 115 C.P.C the High Court Division has no jurisdiction to disturb the final findings of facts.

The inherent power conferred under section 151 of the Code can be available in a case where there is no other provision for providing a redress. Power under section 151 of the Code can be invoked by a court only when the court is satisfied that prevention of the abuse of the process of the court is necessary or when ends of justice demand that the wrong complained of would be remedied. In the name of ends of justice, the remedy provided in the Code itself cannot be allowed to be negative and also to be thwarted. The court, of course, under section 151 of the Code preserves the power to set aside order passed under misapprehension of facts when true facts are brought to light. The court also got the inherent power to vacate any order obtained by misleading the court and practicing fraud upon it. The court, in the exercise of the power under section 151 of the Code, also, can correct the unintentional or inadvertent mistake committed by it. The court also preserves the Inherent power to vacate any order if the same is passed under misapprehension of law.

The decree of the trial court having been modified by the High Court it merged into the decree of the High Court. Hence, the question of drawing up of a modified decree on 9.8.93 in the light of the judgment and decree of the High Court in First Appeal is wholly illegal and without jurisdiction. It is found that the modified decree was passed on 22.3.1960 and to avoid the question of limitation a modified decree was again drawn up by the trial court on 9.8.93 and which is so obvious that it was obtained from a court by fraudulent means. Even if, it is admitted that a mistake was committed by the executing court Itself even then there are innumerable authorities of this court to hold that any error or wrong committed by the court itself can be corrected in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure to secure the ends of justice and to prevent the abuse of process of court. Thus, the execution proceeding is apparently barred under Article 182 of the Limitation Act. The plaintiff did not take any steps within three years from the modified decree of the High Court nor he kept alive the decree by taking steps to execute the decree within 12 years from the date of the final modified decree.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thus in order to avoid the bar of limitation the plaintiff fraudulently got the modified decree drawn up by the trial court. Hence the application under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure is maintainable in the facts of the present case.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Further, the plaintiff got decree for 8 Anna’s share of the suit property as modified by the High Court. In the execution proceeding the application was filed by the decree- holder for partition and for possession. Without filing a partition suit the executing court cannot also pass an order for possession when the decree itself does not contemplate such possession by partition of the property by metes and bounds. This exercise of jurisdiction by the executing court is palpably erroneous and without jurisdiction. [Paras- 10 &amp; 11]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>M. Majid Vs.

From the date of acceptance of the appellant’s said application there was no legal existence of the deceased plaintiff in the case record, whose name could not have been retained by the trial court in the plaint when the suit was restored to its file and number.

The case of the plaintiff opposite party is that he got the suit property from his father Poyer Mamud Mondal and fufu Powchhari Bibi by way of settlement on obtaining dakhilas in the year of 1345 B.B.. which facts are stoutly denied by the present petitioners. It has been contended in the application under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure that the original tenants Poyer Mamud Mondal and Powchhari Bibi never settled the suit land with the plaintiff and the plaintiffs claim of title by way of settlement is false. It has further been asserted that as co-owners of the suit property by inheritance like the plaintiff the petitions have been owning and possessing the suit property in ejmali. It was also contended in no uncertain terms that the plaintiffs’ papers in respect of the alleged settlement are totally false and fabricated. It thus appears that vital interests of the petitioners are involvement in the suit and they have definite say in the adjudication of the suit and they are interested in the result of the suit for declaration of title in the suit land. in the face of the clear and specific assertions made by the petitioners it is evident that vital interests of the petitioner are involved in the suit and as such their presence in the suit is necessary for proper adjudication of the controversies between the contending parties.

But in view of the peculiar facts that after about 25 years the plaintiff has sought for Specific Performance of Contract dated 15.4.70 in respect of an apparently joint property without making one of its admitted co-sharers namely, respondent No.1, as a party to the suit, the learned Judge of the High Court Division upon proper consideration of the material facts has rightly held that the case of respondent No.1 clearly come within the exception of the general principle of addition of party in a suit for Specific Performance of Contract and that he is a proper party to be added as a defendant in the suit for proper adjudication of the real dispute as to whether the bainapatra in question is a fake one and as to whether there was any family settlement as alleged in the plaint by the plaintiff on the basis of which the contract in question with defendant Nos. 1-3 was entered into.

Since the petitioners were not at the scene when the suit was filed but they became Interested in the result of the suit subsequently, they cannot be made co-plaintiff, over the head of the unwilling plaintiffs. But they should be made defendants in the suit to have their full say in the matter for protecting their interest. [Para-7]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

A suit for declaration of title recovery of possession and/or for partition is essentially based on a common claim of the plaintiff which may call for aforesaid different relief or reliefs in different situations — by adding a relief for partition in a suit for declaration of title and possession there was no alteration to the foundation of the suit and as such the fundamental character of the suit remained the same, there being thus no question of changing the nature and character of the suit appeal allowed.

Petitioners for declaration of plaintiffs title in eight katha of land and for recovery of khas possession of petitioners No. 1 and 2 and another—During the cross-examination the plaintiff opposite party filed an application for amendment of the plaint — In the plaint it has been clearly stated that a boundary wall existed between the land of the plaintiff and the defendant petitioners. The plaintiff should have made a prayer in .the plaint for demolition of the existing boundary wall between the plaintiffs and the petitioner’s land. It appears that plaintiff omitted to make a prayer for the same. As such the plaintiff j.1iould not be allowed to make a prayer by way of amendment at this stage as contended by the learned petitioners Counsel—Held : In the application for amendment there was a prayer made for demolishing of the wall and the super structure raised thereon. In the absence of any statement in the plaint that the defendant petitioner disposed the plaintiff opposite party from the suit land and in absence of any prayer for demolishing the existing wall in the plaint we are of the view that the amendment proposed could at last change the character of the plaint which is not permissible under the law — the order passed by the learned Subordinate Judge is set aside.
