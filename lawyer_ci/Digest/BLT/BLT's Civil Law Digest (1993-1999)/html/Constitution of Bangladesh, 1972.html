No Court can similarly direct the President to make rules, because the rule-making power of the President is identical with that of the Parliament — the impugned notifications dated 10-10-91 and 4-12-91 we find that those were issued under orders of the President, i.e., in terms of Article 55(4) of the Constitution and have been issued by the authority competent to frame rules, i.e.. by the President under the proviso to Article 133. These notifications have the precision of rules and are general in nature in their application to promotion to the posts of Joint Secretary and above and Deputy Secretary and they have the force of law. They are not grayish in nature. There has been no constitutional derailment and we can only express a wish that maximum matters pertaining to the service of the Republic should be brought under the umbrella of law or rules under Article 133, but it might be useful to remember that in spite of the existence Qf Article 309 in the Indian Constitution for nearly half a century, neither the Union Government nor a State Legislature has so far made any comprehensive law to regulate the recruitment or conditions of services relating to employment under the Union or a State Government.’ (Basu, Commentary on the Constitution of India, Silver Jubilee Edition, Vol. M.P. 14).
