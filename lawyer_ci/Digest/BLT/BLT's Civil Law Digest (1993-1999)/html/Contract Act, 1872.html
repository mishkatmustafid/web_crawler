In the absence of any evidence of force, coercion or intimidation, the provisions of section 23 of the Contract Act cannot be attracted in a case—Held : This approach of the learned Single Judge is not correct, because if for withdrawing and compromising a non-compoundable case an agreement is entered into between the parties then the same is against public policy and the bar of section 23 of the Contract Act is attracted.
