There is also no specific date given by the defendant when the original owner left this country— appeal is allowed. [Para-7]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Anwara Khatoon Vs.

It means it was an existing law till the 13th November, 1996. When a statute is repealed by the Parliament its disappearance from the statute-book takes place from the date of repeal, either prospectively or retrospectively according as the legislature prescribes. But if as statute is declared void ab initio by the Court its disappearance from the statute-book takes place retrospectively from the date of enactment of the repealed statute, never prospectively. If a statute is declared void ab initio by a Court no rights accrue at all. No obligation or liability generates from the void law. But a repealed statute retains accrued rights and obligaions, unless avoided specifically or by necessary implication. In the present case no Court of law has earlier pronounced that the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 is void ab initio. The Parliament was therefore free to pass a declaratory statute declaring that the said Ordinance was void from the very beginning; but it did not do so. It preferred to treat the said Ordinance as an existing law and repealed it. The High Court Division made a basic mistake in holding that the Parliament has legally repealed a void law, little giving thought that a void law has to be declared void by a declaratory statute and a repeal can only be made of an existing law in case of repeal the Repeal Act is itself liable to be repealed by the same Parliament or subsequent Parliament, reviving the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975; but when a Court declares the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 void ab-initio the Parliament cannot re-enact the same legislation afresh. It will be struck down as unconstitutional. It is buried forever. This distinction was lost sight of by the High Court Division.

The court must proceed on sound principles. [Para-9]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>F Alam &amp; Ors. Vs. Zobaida Nahar &amp; Ors. 5 BLT (AD)-88</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Estoppel or Waiver of Legal Dues</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It appears to us that the decree which the respondent obtained was an inexcusable decree. He could not have compelled the Government to reinstate him in service on the basis of that decree. If he wanted his full relief he should have preferred an appeal against the said decree re-agitating the question of his reinstatement in service, arrear salary and promotion. But once the Government takes a decision to reinstate him in service, whether by way of executing an otherwise inexcusable decree or by its own volition, without re-appointing him or giving him any break in service, the respondent will be deemed to be in service throughout the period of his removal. Invalidation of the order of removal by the Government itself means as if no order of removal was passed. The incumbent continues in service. Being in service, salary is his due. There can be no waiver of his legal dues. The question of estoppel also does not arise. [Para-16]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Government of Bangladesh Vs.
