Subsequently several years thereafter on 27.10.86 the Government made an amendment by Gazette Notification, saying that there was mistake in the previous Gazette Notification regarding the quantum of the land arid in place of .45 acres .51 acres is to be read—Held: Unless the property is requisitioned under section 3 of the Act it cannot be acquired without the proposal of the Deputy Commissioner. No provision of correction or amendment of the previous Gazette Notification by a subsequent Gazette Notification has been provided therein—subsequent Gazette Notification is illegal.

That having not been done the so called acquisition and requisition is without jurisdiction. [Para-3]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>M. A. Razzaque Vs.

In such a case the doctrine of legitimate expectation will have no bearing. This delay of gazette notification under Section 5(7) of the Act by itself will not ipso facto give any right to the writ petitioners to get release of the land from requisition.

Contention was raised that ex parte decree was not in accordance with law. [Para-3]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Alfu Miah and Others Vs. Bangladesh 1 BLT (AD)-25 .</p></div></div>
