The said Abdul Wahab Howlader executed a deed of gift in favour of the plaintiffs on 27.7.64 and delivered the possession but the said deed could not be registered due to certain difficulties. The defendants claimed the title over the suit land as a residuary sharer. Hence the plaintiff filed the title suit for declaration of title in respect of suif land—the learned trial court in consideration of oral and documentary evidence and materials on record decreed the suit. Against the said decree the defendants preferred appeal. Learned Appellate Court allowed the appeal by reversing the decree of the trial court—Held: That the plaintiffs, being in exclusive possession over the statutory period of limitation from the date of institution of the suit by the plaintiffs in the year 1984 and to the complete ouster of the defendants for about 20 years from the suit property have acquired a valid title even on the basis of the defective deed of gift being an unregistered one. It further appears that the defendant could neither challenge the said unregistered deed Ext. 1 nor file any suit to establish their alleged right in the suit property within the statutory period of 12 year and it is further held that the defect of the plaintiffs deed of gift has been cured with the passage of time and the plaintiffs imperfect title has been perfected by the said period.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><em>Amirunnessa &amp; Ors Vs. Abdul Mannan Howlader &amp; Ors. 3 BLT (HCD)-245</em></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong style="line-height:1.6em">Section-6</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">Document—Plaintiff instituted the suit for declaration of title and also for a declaration that the suit property cannot be treated as vested and non-resident property (Enemy Property) alleging, inter alia that one Jagat Chandra Karmaker was the C. S. recorded owner of the suit property. After his death his son Gopal Karmaker inherited the said property. This Gopal Karmaker transferred the suit property to one Harendra Lal Saha and Jagannath Saha. After the death of Harendra Lal Saha his property was inherited by his two sons Chandi Gopal Saha and Ashutosh Saha. One Parveen Akter purchased the suit property by registered deeds from Chandi Gopal Saha, Ashutosh Saha and Jagannath Saha. From this Parveen Akther plaintiff- appellants had purchased the suit property while the plaintiffs were possessing the suit land, they came to know that the property in question was declared as vested and nonresident property—learned Subordinate Judge dismissing the suit holding that the plaintiffs failed to produce any document to show the transfer in between Gopal Karmaker and Harendra Lal Saha and others—</p><p style="text-align:justify">Held : The averments made in the plaint and the evidence of P.W.I together with the written statements of defendant No. 2 and the evidence of P.W. I it clearly appears that Harendra Lal Saha and others became the owners of the suit property and they possessed the same and sold the same to Mrs. Parveen Akhter by registered sale deeds in 1981—the rent receipts together with the continuous record as right vide exhibits I series may be treated as collateral evidence of title in favour of the plaintiff. Now, if we consider the oral as well as documentary evidence as stated above, we find that this Harendra Lal Saha and others acquired right and title over the suit property. The documents by which the heirs Harendra Lal and Jagannath transferred the suit land to Parveen Akhter and the registered document by which Parveen Akther transferred the land to the present plaintiffs are not disputed at all. So it is held that the learned Subordinate Judge failed to consider the material evidence or record as stated above and he has arrived at a wrong finding and as such it cannot be sustained.

Class, Marine Court, Dhaka. It is really unfortunate that deposition of those persons who deposed in a criminal proceeding before the Marine Court was relied upon by the Admiralty Judge. Under section 33 of the Evidence Act that proceeding was not between the same parties. As a matter of fact, Ext. 25 series is not admissible in this admiralty proceeding and Ext. 25 series cannot be legally accepted as the basis for determining the market value of the vessel and consequently the passing of the decree of Tk. 80,10,000/- is without any legal evidence and the same cannot be awarded in favour of the plaintiff as has been done by the learned Admiralty Judge.

The provision as to the burden of proof is founded on the Rule <em>‘el incumbit probatio, qui dicit non qui negat’</em>- the burden of proving a fact rests on the party who substantially assents of the affirmative issue and not upon the party who denies it; for a negative is usually incapable of proof’. This Rule is derived from the Roman Law and is supportable not only on the ground of fairness but also upon that of the greater practical difficulty which is involved in proving a negative than in proving an affirmative. This Rule is an ancient Rule founded on consideration of good sense and should not be departed from without strong reasons.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><em>Mohammad Azim &amp; Ors Vs.

The plaintiff claimed that she took settlement of suit land by means a ‘Dhol fordi’ and Dakhila grarted by the Midnapur Zamindari Company Ltd. — The appellate court summarised its findings by way of stating that PW 1 and PW2 were not competent witnesses while the witnesses of the alleged settlement Kalipada Ghose and Korban Au were not cited as witnesses. There was no evidence that the tahsiider who allegedly gave the settlement had any authority to do so. The Dakhilas produced by the plaintiff were also not properly proved and the trial court wrongly exhibited the ‘fordi’ and Dakhilas as the basis of settlement as there was no proper proof of them — We may add that there is nothing on record to relate Ext.4 to the settlement claimed by the plaintiff. Agaib, the hukumnama and other documents of settlement in favour of the plaintiff were for the plaintiff to produce. In the absence of proof of existence of the said documents the defendants could not be supposed to be in a position to produce them. Thus the High Court Division had obviously given a wrong onus and drawn an incorrect presumption of genuineness of Ext. 4.

So, the earlier part of the proceedings remains totally unexplained for reasons best known to the plaintiff. The conspicuous absence of the plaintiff from the scene without any justifiable reason appears to be a mystery that has not been dissolved any cogent explanation and on that count the learned Court of appeal below was perfectly justified in drawing an averse presumption under section 114(g) of the Evidence Act.
