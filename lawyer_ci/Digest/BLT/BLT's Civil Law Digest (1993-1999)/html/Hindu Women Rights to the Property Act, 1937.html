The High Court Division found the seizure of gold ornaments to be mala fide and illegal and as such we do not like to consider the question of imposition of costs in the facts of the present case. Every public official must act within the four corners of law. [Para-6]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Collector of Customs Vs.
