It is true that the Appellate Tribunal is not subordinate to the High Court Division but judicial decorum, propriety and discipline demand that when an interpretation of law is given by the High Court Division all Courts and Tribunals in Bangladesh should abide by such interpretation until the said interpretation is set aside or varied by the Appellate Division. It will give rise to anarchical situation if a Tribunal were to give its own interpretation of law when the matter is settled by a decision of the High Court Division passed in its constitutional jurisdiction. The Tribunal has no authority to sit on judgment over the decision of the High Court Division in such matters. It may express its own opinion but will be always obliged to follow the decision of the High Court Division in the absence of any contrary opinion of the Appellate Division on the subject.
