A high officer of the Government at the far end of his career with a long service record without any allegation of blemish prior to the present incident should have been dealt with more consideration and objectivity. An honest person would prefer dignity more than anything else. In the facts of the present case, it has appeared to us that these considerations have suffered a great deal because of the lack of objectivity. [Para-9]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>S. A.
