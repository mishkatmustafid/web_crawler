In the absence of any prescribed period of limitation, no question can legally be raised that a revisional application under Section 115 C.P.C is barred by limitation if it is filed beyond 90 days; but as a matter of practice and prudence, the High Court Division before exercising its discretionary power under Section 115 C.P.C should satis1r itself that no unconscionable delay has been caused wilfully in filing such revisional application.
