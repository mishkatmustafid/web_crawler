In the meanwhile, Rule 10 of Rules, 1975 was amended on 30.12.97. The impugned orders were passed on 10.6.98 and 17.6.98 whereby the area in which a Nikab Registrar has been licensed was further curtailed. The orders having been passed after amendment of Rules 10 of Rules, 1975, those are not retrospective in nature. As a matter of fact those are prospective in nature—The petitioner’s licence as a Nikah Registrar has not at all been revoked/affected but under the second proviso of Section 4 of the Act his area has been curtailed which the Government is authorised under the law to do.
