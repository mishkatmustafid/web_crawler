It is true that a point of law can be raised even at the appellate stage but it is important that if an objection as to defect of party is taken it should be raised at the earliest opportunity so that the appellant has opportunity to correct it.

Every access to justice should not be miused as a license to an untenable application. The arms of law cannot be stretched to untenable proceedings. If application of the present nature is allowed to go merrily and unchecked there will be no end of laying applications and applications after rejection and rejection of the applications and the litigant public will choose to settle the controversy in the same court without availing the remedy available by way of appeal and revision before the Higher Court. The law and procedure cannot be allowed to be eroded at the sweet wishes of the litigant public who attempts to get the controversy resolved in the manner he desires.

It can be relaxed and a partial partition allowed, where it is not proved that the parties will be prejudiced or inconvenienced by such partition.

Therefore, we cannot make a difference between the Government and a private party in giving effect to the said Principle of Law. [Para - 111</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A.D.C. (Rev) Vs. Mohammad Khairullah &amp; Anr 5 BLT (HCD)- 119</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Practice and Procedure</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">When a judgment is delivered by majority it is necessary to draw up an Order of the Court specif ring the particular orders passed by the learned majority Judges as Order of the Court which is also signed by the learned Judge or Judges in the minority. In the present case an Order of the Court has been drawn up to which the learned minority Judge is also a signatory, but it has only been stated in the Order of the Court that ‘in view of the majority judgment both the Rules are made absolute and the application in Writ Petition No. 813 of 1993 is allowed.” That order hardly makes any sense, because the writ petitioners did not succeed on all the challenges on which Rules Nisi were issued. [Para - 59]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Ministry of Establishment Vs. Shafiuddin Ahmed &amp; Ors. 6 BLT (AD) 2</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Practice and Procedure</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a suit of Government Servants kind the Trial Court and the Appellate Court are not required to sit in judgment over the findings of either the Enquiry Officer or the punishing authority as no Court has jurisdiction to act as an appellate authority sitting on appeal over the findings of a domestic tribunal. No Court has the jurisdiction to substitute its own finding for that of the Enquiry Officer or the punishing authority, as the case may be. The trial Court and the appellate court cannot assume the role of a fresh fact-finding body over which either the Enquiry Officer or the punishing authority has already made their respective exercises in a domestic proceeding. We find with dismay that the trial court while setting out the parameter of its enquiry stated in the very beginning that if in this suit the plaintiff can prove satisfactorily that there was a dacoity in the godown of TCB then it will be taken that he had not misappropriated the milk food in question. That was a wrong approach adopted by the trial court and to our regret the erroneous conception persisted upto the High Court Division which ought to have known better. The simple issue in this suit was whether the punishing authority had followed the procedure in differing with the findings of the Enquiry Officer, whether it gave reasons for differing with the findings of the Enquiry Officer, whether the plaintiff was informed of the reasons and whether the plaintiff got a further opportunity to meet the reasons given by the punishing authority.
