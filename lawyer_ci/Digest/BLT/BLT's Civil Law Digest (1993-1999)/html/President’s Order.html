By virtue of clause (I) of Article 4 of Presidents Order No. 69 of 1972 Bangladesh was deemed to be substituted for the Province of East Pakistan, but clause (2) left an option to the Government of Bangladesh not to be impleaded in which case the suit was to abate as a whole if it was not maintainable against the rest of the defendants. In this case bereft of the Government of Bangladesh there are no parties against whom the suit could continue. The Government having submitted a written application to the court stating that it would not be a party to the proceeding the suit as a whole abated with effect from the date of submission of such application.

The only question that can be decided under Art. 3—whether a person is qualified to be deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh. The notification indicates that the government did not ask the right question, namely, whether the respondent was a permanent resident in Bangladesh on 15 December, 1972. It was not made in exercise of power under Art. 3 and it, therefore, must be held to be ultra-vires. [Para-27]</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Prof. Golam Azam tried to come back to Bangladesh, his time for fifty years from his birth. He surrendered his Pakistan passport. He took an oath of allegiance to Bangladesh against whose independence he worked although the liberation was in 1971. He resided in Bangladesh for more than 14 years, never visiting Pakistan or any other country. It was a case of the return of the native back to his ancestor’s his Pakistani passport. His wife and 7 children are Bangladeshi citizen by birth. He has got properties in this country. [Para-6]</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">But Government’s view is mainly based on the respondent’s political conduct during the liberation struggle and after. There is complete unanimity on all hands that the political conduct of the resident was wholly irrelevant for deciding the question under Article 3 of P.O. No 149 of 1972. There is no power under Article 3 for denuding a person of his citizenship for the offence of collaboration with the Pakistan Occupation Army. Indeed, there is nothing in P.O. No 149 of 1972 which authorised the Government on the date of the impugned notification to disqualify a citizen on the ground of collaboration with the Pakistan Occupation Army. Such P.O. was never intended to punish an alleged collaborator of the said Army by stripping him of his citizenship. [Para-79]</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The argument of the learned Attorney General is long on emotion and short on law. First, his commentaries on the criminal aspect of the political antecedents of the respondent were never tested in a court of law. Secondly, even if the allegations are correct, citizenship law does not deny citizenship to those who opposed the creation of Bangladesh and even killed freedom fighters and were engaged in murder, rape, etc. There were many Muslims (and Hindus as well) who opposed the creation of Pakistan Citizenship law did not deny them citizenship. They deemed to be citizen of Pakistan if they had permanent residence in the territory of Pakistan and did not leave the same. Bangladesh also followed the same principle. In Bangladesh, collaborators and Razakars were prosecuted under the collaborators order P.O. No 8 of 1972, but they were not denied the citizenship of Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;">Bangladesh Vs.
