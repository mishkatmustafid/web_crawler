Strictly speaking, the question of promissory estoppel may not arise in this case but in view of the fact that the project was approved earlier and under that approval, respondent No.1 acted after taking loan from other government financial institutions arid other banks, it now appears to us that the Government could not be allowed to work inconsistently, whimsically and capriciously to the prejudice of respondent No.1 when the project was approved by the another lawful Government agency at an earlier point of time.

Afzal C.J: The more important point, however, is that a verse of the Quran has to be understood not in isolation, and less with a shallow knowledge of language and certainly not with the interpretative techniques of man made laws but with the help of, first, the Prophet’s (Allah’s peace be upon him) teachings and practices and subsequently by the enunciation’s of Islamic jurists and scholars. LPara-34] M. t-Iefzur Rahman Vs. Shamsun Nahar Begum &amp; Ors. 7BLT (AD)-33 Per Mustafa Kamal, J: The learned Judges of the Privy Council rightly refrained themselves from putting their own construction on the Holy Quran because they were non-Muslims. They abstained from opposing the express ruling of commentators of great antiquity and high authority because they were not qualified to do so. A person who ventures to interpret the Holy Quran (1) shall be a Muttaqi (2) must have a wide knowledge of Hadith in connection with the Prophet’s (s) interpretation of the Holy Quran and with the statements of his sahabis (companions) and their successive companions (3) have a knowledge about those parts of the Holy Quran which have been repealed or substituted (4) have a knowledge about the significance of each Ayat (5) have a knowledge about Ilmul Kirat (6) have a profound knowledge of the Arabic language, grammar, diction etc. as the Holy Quran was revealed in the Arabic language (7) must have a thorough knowledge of all the major commentaries and works of different schools of thought (8) must be a faqih and other qualifications as well, not necessarily limited to and special preserves of Ulemas.

Shamsun Nahar Begum &amp; Ors. 7 BLT (AD)-33</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Principle of Law of Undue Influence</strong></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Defendant No. 1 was undoubtedly in a dominant position on account of his high official position and close association with the Martial Law Authority at the relevant time and the plaintiff had a helpless role to play in the face of pressure from the Martial Law Authority. The bargain obtained by defendant No. 1 in the compromise petition was clearly unconscionable because the plaintiff had to give up his rightful claim in the contractual land. The burden of proof that the compromise was not attained by undue influence, therefore, lay squarely upon defendant No. 1 which he has miserably failed to discharge.

Farooq Sobhan &amp; Ors 7BLT (AD)-389</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Principle of Law in a case of fraud and collusion </strong></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Though the defendant pleaded a case of fraud and collusion he did not lead any evidence to prove the same. Mere statement in the written statement is not enough nor it is an evidence by itself unless such statement is proved by leading evidence by its maker.

Selirn 7 BLT (HCD)-21</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Principle of Natural Justice</strong></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Termination’s under Regulations (I) &amp; (II) of the Bank Regulation cannot be termed as punishment and as such no notice need be served upon for passing the orders of termination. Termination simpliciter not being a punishment which is contemplated in Regulation 22, the question of giving notice or a pre-hearing does not arise. In such a case there is no scope for making any grievance on the ground of violation of the principle of natural justice either.

Mohammad Abdul Mannan 2 BLT (AD)-1O1</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Principle of Equity, Justice and Good Conscience</strong></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The plaintiffs having performed the formalities required for pre-emption under the Mohammedan law and it having been found that a single piece of immovable property was transferred to defendant No. 1 by two kabalas, the High Court Division ought to have maintained the decree for pre-emption as passed by the courts below by modil,ring the order of pre-emption and defecting the plaintiff- appellants to pay the consideration both for the land and structures as contended by the appellants learned counsel.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Held In our opinion, is not also in conformity with the Principles of Equity, Justice and Good Conscience because the plaintiffs never expressed their desire for pre-empting the structures also at or about the time when the transfer was made.

Case No. 25 of 1969 which arose out of the suit, the same was good enough substitution of the heirs of deceased defendant No. 3 for the suit itself and no further application for substitution ‘as necessary in the suit. The plaintiff is only required to file an application for correction by recording the names of the legal representatives of defendant No. 3 in the plaint and register.

The letter of credit shall not be valid until there was “irrevocable agreement to reimburse’ from the Saudi Fund for Development. The contract itself clearly shows that the letter of credit opened by the plaintiff would be subject to approval by the Saudi Fund for Development and, such an approval having not come from the Saudi Fund for Development, the letter of credit and also the contract could not be operative in consequence of which the bank guarantee, in the facts and circumstances of the case, was not encashable.

Applying the correct principle regarding the appreciation of the evidence the Court has the right to believe or disbelieve a witness or a number of witnesses but it has no right to ignore the evidence of a party in coming to his decision. Non-consideration of a material witness or a material piece of evidence of the witnesses of a party or any important document is a serious legal infirmity which renders the impugned decision unsustainable in law.

The power of review or revision can only be vested in the Court, the tribunal or the body discharging function(s) of judicial or quasi judicial nature by the statute under which the said body acts or discharges function(s) of judicial or quasi judicial kind or nature. The Court, the Tribunal and the body discharging function(s) of judicial or quasi judicial nature shall have to have sanction of law in the exercise of power of revision or review of its judgment or order. More so while the judgment or order of an appellate court, tribunal or body has been made final by the statute under which the appellate body exercises its appellate power. If the Court, the Tribunal or the body performing function(s) of judicial or quasi judicial nature exercises power of revision or review or in other words revise or review its order in the absence of being not vested with the same it acts without jurisdiction or in other words in a manner not authorised by law.

When there is a specific provision of law for giving relief to an aggrieved party but the requirements of law are not met, the Court has no power to doll out gratuitous relief in the name of “interest of justice” or “ends of justice”. The Court must not use these expressions lightly and capriciously as it would tend to defeat justice but use the same accordingly to sound judicial principles for ensuring real justice.

Chitta Ranjan Halder &amp; Ors. 6 BLT (HCD)-88</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Principle to the award of interest</strong></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It appears that the Managing Director of the defendant-company died on 3-5-83 and after his death the company failed to run their business and were thus unable to pay any interest, Even then the decretal amount remains fully paid in 1990. After a passage of 7 years from the satisfaction of the decree we are not inclined to impose the contractual rate of interest upon the judgment-debtor. We are of the opinion that the interest ofjustice will be sewed if the defendants are directed to pay interest at the rate of 6% on the decretal sum with yearly rests from the date of institution of the suit till the date of decree in two equal yearly installments—With regard to interest from the date of decree till realisation we find that the discretion of the Court is even wider in this area and considering the facts and circumstances of this particular case as already noticed we think that no interest should be paid on this score.

In case of injunctions the Court must always be very cautious in speci1iing the property so that on account of vagueness disputes do not erupt. [Para-6]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Md.

The selection will have to be made by the executive only. The Court will only inquire whether the selection has been made following the tradition, custom and usage which govern such selection. If so made the judiciary will not intervene. If extraneous considerations have influenced the executive decision the court has certainly the power to declare the selection to have been made without lawful authority.

It is also well established principle of law that fraud vitiates all judicial proceeding. Thus contravention of the provision of law, cannot be a valid ground for allowing an order obtaining by fraud to stand. When the trial court itself on consideration of the materials on record was satisfied that a fraud had been committed in obtaining the ex parte decree it was the duty of the trial court to set aside the ex parte decree. The failure of the trial court in the performance of its legal obligations ought not to have been maintained by the High Court Division in affirming the finding of the trial court.

Although oral agreement is not barred by any law it has to be looked at with some suspicion unless proved by very reliable evidence and circumstances. In Ouseph Varghese V. Joseph Aley, (1969) 2 SCWR 347 the Supreme Court of India discouraged a decree for specific performance of a contract on the basis of an agreement supported solely by oral evidence.
