It was in fact a special arrangement made for those who voluntarily want to retire on getting certain monetary and other financial benefits—the special arrangement being not a law cannot be said to be illegal and unconstitutional. [Para-5]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Md. Nurul Haque Vs. Ministry of Communications &amp; Ors 6 BLT (AD)-212</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-9 (2)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The appellant was appointed as an Assistant Communication Engineer in the Civil Aviation Department and it is his case that by dint of merit he was gradually promoted to the post of Director, Civil Aviation Authority. In 1985 the Government formed Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh by abolishing the Department of Civil Aviation by Civil Aviation Authority Ordinance, 1985, about 2000 employees of the Civil Aviation Department were transferred by the Government to the newly created Authority — They formed a Samannya Parishad and launched a movement for withdrawal of the Ordinance of 1985 — The appellant contended that on the basis of the secret report the Government retired the appellant under section 9(2) of Act XII of 1974, mala fide and in colourable exercise of power.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Held: The enquiry was made after a Gazette Notification. It was, therefore, not a secret enquiry as alleged by the appellant. It was a public and open enquiry. The persons who were appointed to conduct the enquiry were all responsible high officials of the Government against whom no complaint has been made by the appellant — The final Authority who took the decision to retire the appellant was supposed to know that a retirement under section 9 (2) of the Act is not a punishment at all — We do not think that under the special circumstances of this case it was a colourable exercise of power or a misuse or abuse of power, as urged by the appellant. [Para- 19]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Abu Taleb Vs. Govt of Bangladesh 3 BLT(AD)-231</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 9 (1) Proviso</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The respondent had not completed 25 years of service at the relevant time and as such his option for retirement was not exercised as per law. That being so, the proviso to section 9(1) of the Act that the option once exercised shall be final and shall not be permitted to be modified or withdrawn cannot be said to be applicable to the respondent. [Para- 15]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation &amp; Ors Vs. Md. Mafizur Rahman &amp; Ors 2 BLT (AD) – 49</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-2 Read with Section-35 of The Intermediate and Secondary Education Ordinance, 1961</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The appellant’s tenure of office is admittedly governed by Section 35 of East Pakistan Ordinance No. XXIII of 1961. In that view of the matter, appellant cannot be asked to retire on completion of 57 years of age, as Act No. XII of 1974 is not applicable to a person who holds any office the tenure of which is determined by or under any law. [Para-7]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Dewan Abdul Khaleque Vs. Ministry of Education &amp; Ors 6 BLT (AD)-81</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><u>Public Servants (Dismissal on Conviction) Ordinance, 1985</u></strong></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-3 (3) and</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BADC Disciplinary Case Procedures, 1977</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Clause-11 (4) (6)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The respondent was dismissed from service under the provisions of the BADC Disciplinary Case Procedures, 1977 — the Ordinance No, V of 1985 is prospective and not retrospective in operation. Therefore the provision of the said section 3(3) is of no avail to the respondent on the facts of the case — the dismissal of an incumbent takes effect from the date of order and not from the date of verdict of conviction and dismissal order is to remain valid unless the order itself is declared void by a court.
