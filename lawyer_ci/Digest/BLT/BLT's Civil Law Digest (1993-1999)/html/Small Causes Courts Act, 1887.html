The High Court Division has rightly taken the view that the title of the plaintiff to the suit property is itself clouded and the registered lease deed Ext. 1 was not acted upon in as much as admittedly there was no payment of rent in terms as the said lease deed. The suit therefore involved a serious question of title and in the absence of a proper suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession a simple S. C. C. suit under the circumstances does not lie. [Para-7]</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Bablu Mia Vs.

In such a case the question of title to the disputed premises is not relevant at all once a relationship of landlord and tenant is pleaded by the plaintiff—the landlord cannot be thrown out of the Court of Small Causes on the plea of tenant’s title on which the landlord’s claim does not depend.
