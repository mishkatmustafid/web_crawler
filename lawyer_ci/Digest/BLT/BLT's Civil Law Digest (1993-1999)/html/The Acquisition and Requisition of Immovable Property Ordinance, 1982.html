[Para- 19]</p><p><strong><em>Bangladesh Vs. Subash Chandra Dos &amp; Ors 2BLT (AD)-30</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section – 12</strong></p><p>(a) Requisite fund not being placed by the requiring body within time, the acquisition proceeding abated under section 12 (1) of the Ordinance with effect from 18-12-84 by a Gazette notification dated 13.1.55 and a fresh L.A. proceeding bearing the same number was started once again in respect of the case land. The appellant claimed Tk. 1,50,00,000 as compensation under section 12 (3) of the Ordinance as damages suffered by the owner consequent upon the abatement of the L.A. proceeding. Although the Arbitrator awarded a sum of Tk. 6,50,000/- in partial acceptance of the claim, the Arbitration Appellate Tribunal (District-Judge) disallowed this claim rightly on the ground that the provisions of section 12 (3) of the Ordinance are applicable only in a case of simple abatement of acquisition and not in a case when abatement is followed by a further proceeding for acquisition of the same land. [Para-4]</p><p><strong><em>Khaled Akter Vs. Bangladesh 2BLT (AD)-59</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>(b) Matters to be considered are : first, the damage must be suffered in consequence of the abated notice or any proceeding thereunder; secondly, the damage suffered has to be specifically pleaded and proved and there cannot be any objective standard of the damage. It will vary from case to case; thirdly, the owner can also recover costs incurred by him in the prosecution of the abated proceeding. [Para-71]</p><p><strong><em>Khaled Akter Vs. Bangladesh 2BLT (AD)-59</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>(c) Case land being in the effective control of respondent No. 2, handing over of possession to the appellant’s father was only a paper transaction. As the appellant never enjoyed physical possession of the case land, the award of interest from the date of taking possession does not arise. [Paras-15 &amp; 16]</p><p><strong><em>Khaled Akter Vs. Bangladesh 2BLT (AD)-59 </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Section-34 Read with Section-5 of The Limitation Act, 1908</strong></p><p>Appeal against the Award of Arbitrator—From a plain reading of section 34 of the Ordinance it is manifestly clear that no special period of limitation for preferring an appeal before the Arbitration Appellate Tribunal has been prescribed.</p><p>The Ordinance No. 11 of 1982 is special law. As such in the absence of any such special period of limitation prescribed in the Ordinance for preferring an appeal before the Arbitration Appellate Tribunal, general law of limitation codified in the Limitation Act comes into play and section 5 of the Limitation Act is applicable in such cases.
