Therefore the presumption of right, title and possession on the basis of C.S. Khatian did not hold good any more. [Para-9]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Taleb Ali Pramanik &amp; Ors. Vs.

Khatians: In view of the fact that the suit property as a debutter property of the deity and there is absolutely no basis of its becoming the secular property of a former shebait Suresh. The mere recording of the suit property in the name of the Suresh in the S.A. Khatian is evidently wrong and without any foundation whatsoever and the same cannot affect the plaintiffs right, title, and interest in the suit property any way. There is no dispute to the proposition that the C.S. Khatians has a presumption of correctness under section 103 (b) of the B.T. Act while the S.A. Khatians has no such presumptive value.
