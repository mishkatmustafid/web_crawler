While discharging his duty as such he came to know the order of impugned retirement. issued by the Deputy Commissioner at the instance of the Commissioner, Chittagong Division. This order was challenged by the respondent in writ petition, inter alia, on the ground that no show cause notice was served upon him before passing the said order of retirement—High Court Division found that the retirement being a kind of punishment it was necessary for the authorities to give a show cause notice to the writ- petitioner before retiring him from his office. This having not been done, there was a violation of the principle of natural justice— Held : High Court Division has rightly interfered with the order of retirement of respondent No. 1 upon good and valid reasons. There has neither been any error of law nor miscarriage of justice. [Para-6]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Mr. Ana Ram Tripura Vs.
