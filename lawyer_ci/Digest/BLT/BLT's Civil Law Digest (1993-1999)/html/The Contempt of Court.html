Having gone through the entire matter, we got the impression that an inexperienced young Deputy commissioner, as the appellant then was, became distraught with the many Court proceedings involving him and the administration and in making his official report gave vent to his vengeful feelings by making objectionable remarks against the local judicial officers. He should not have done it. We know he would not have done it with little more experience and guidance. Not only a Government official, high or low, but everybody should try to uphold the image of the Court, not for the sake of the Court but for the sake of the society, for their own sake—warned to be careful in future.

The reportings by the contemner to the authorities against the local judicial officers are considered to malign the judicial officers which come under the mischief of contempt of court — relied on 7 DLR 34. (Para-9]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Kurigram District Judgeship Vs. Mr Md. Abdul Haque, D.C. 5 BLT (HCD)-194</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Contempt of Court</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the whole counter—Affidavit of the contemner-appellant. there was not a single word of expression of sorrow, repentance, remorse or apology of any kind.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The basis for filing this contempt petition before the High Court Division was that respondent No. 2 was not allowed to join as Secretary of BSC after the final disposal of his case before the Appellate Division. The trial court decreed the suit of respondent No. 2 with a direction on the BSC to reinstate him in his service as the Secretary of the Corporation. There is the simple direction given by the trial court which was upheld upto the Appellate Division. Respondent No. 2 in all his applications of joining made a prayer for fixing his seniority and that is why the appellant sought the opinion of the parent Ministry and the Legal Adviser in the matter. Immediately the opinion of the Legal Adviser was sought for without any delay and on 19.5.1994 respondent No. 2 was directed to submit a normal and proper joining report. It thus appears that within 112 months from the first letter praying for joining as Secretary, the appellant directed respondent No. 2 to file a normal joining report and to join as Secretary of BSC, but respondent No. 2 without joining moved the High Court Division in a contempt proceedings on 5.5.1994. Respondent No. 2 did not even wait for 112 months but moved the High Court Division in contempt. In the background of the admitted fact and correspondence it is difficult to hold that the appellant had wilfully shown any disrespect and disobedience towards the order of the court. As the matter was not a simpie joining report the appellant in bonafide and good faith immediately sought clarification of the Ministry and the opinion of the Legal Adviser, as directed by the Ministry. In those correspondences there was nothing to show that any contumaciousness was shown regarding the implementation of the order of the court. There was also no delay or laches on the part of the appellant in taking effective steps in implementing the courts order. We do not find that the conduct of the appellant was such of flouting the order of the court deliberately and to treat the court’s order with some degree of hatred or malice—in this case the appellant challenged the contempt Rule and filed a Counter Affidavit setting up his defence upon alternative facts and circumstances in which he acted under a bonafide and good faith. As a matter of fact he had no authority also to fix the question of fixation of seniority and promotion. Thus, in the facts of the present case probably no apology was sought for as he was in fact acting with honest belief for clarification. The apology in this case would have shown that he had committed the offence of contempt. In the present case, It appears that within 112 months of the filing of the joining report respondent No. 2 was asked to join. There was in fact no delay and no attempt was made to obstruct the order of the court. In the facts and circumstances as indicated above, we have no hesitation in our mind in holding that no contempt was committed by the appellant.
