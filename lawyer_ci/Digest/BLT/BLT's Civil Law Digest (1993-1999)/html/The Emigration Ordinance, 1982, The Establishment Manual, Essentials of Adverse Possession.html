Section 14(1) makes satisfaction’ of the Government a precondition of the exercise of power there under. The order of cancellation at least must show that the Government was satisfied as to the necessity of cancellation of the license for violation of any of the conditions stated therein. [Para-21]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Whether the statutory show cause notice as served on the respondent under section 14(1) of the Emigration Ordinance, 1982 is legal and valid by majority decision — the order of cancellation of the respondent’s licence (Annexure “H”) does not show that the Govt. was either “satisfied” as required under section 14(1) or that the respondent’s long representation was ever brought to its notice. The order, on the face of it, thus, was a bad order in the eye of law. [Para-22]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Govt. of Bangladesh &amp; Ors Vs. Md.

Respondent Nos. 2-6 who are among the 73 directly recruited Class-i officers have added themselves as parties in the tribunal cases, but the rest have not. We do not think that it will be in consonance with the principle of natural justice to deny them a hearing when a question of seniority is being raised 15 years after their recruitment. The Appellate Tribunal rightly decided the point. [Para- 12]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Md. Hafizuddin &amp; Ors Vs.
