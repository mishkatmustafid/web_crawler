[Para—10]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) The preamble of a statute is not ordinarily on independent enactment able to confer any right or to restrict or widen the enacting part which is clear and unambiguous. Even the preamble is to be disregarded when there is conflict between section and preamble and in that case express provisions of the section are to be given lull effect.

But while deciding the cases of the subjects enumerated in section 5 it is clear that Family Courts will follow the personal laws of those subjects.

The Ordinance is indeed procedural in nature. [Para-21]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under section 5 of Ordinance of 1985 the wife can claim past maintenance for the child if she has been supporting the child in the same household without any contribution from the father. But if she does not claim separate maintenance for the child, the court will consider the overall needs, keeping in view the fact that she has been supporting a child in the same household. In either case, the claim is subject to Article 120 of the Limitation Act. [Para-321</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Jamila Khatoon Vs.
