Kazi Abdul Hye 6 BLT (AD)-8.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule-7 (2)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Respondent was a permanent employee of the Public Health Engineering Department, having been posted last at Kushtia Sadar. He obtained leave from 1-7-76 to 3-7-76 on account of the illness of his father who along with his mother and his wife and children were at that time living at Magura town. He applied for extension of leave till 8-7-76. Thereafter he himself fell ill and applied for extension of leave. He reported for duty on 1-10-77 but came to learn that by an order dated 25.4.77 he had been discharged from service with effect from 1-7-76. He challenged the order of discharge on the ground that no proceedings were instituted against him for unauthorized absence or on any other allegations — held : Admittedly there is no dispute that the appellant sent a show cause notice to the respondent asking him to show cause why he shall not be removed from service on the charge of prolonged and continued absence from duties — for purposes of sending a show cause notice containing charges against him the appellant was not obliged to send the same to his fleeting address at Magura of even to cause the notice to be published in a newspaper — if the appellant had acted without appointing an enquiry officer in view of the preposterous facts presented by the respondent, then it cannot be said that the action taken was wholly without authority or in violation of the 1976 Rules.

The respondent was compulsory retired from his service by the appellant on 20 February, 1985 — The Administrative Appellate Tribunal found that the respondent was giving of misconduct but allowed the appeal and set aside the order of retirement on the ground that the departmental proceeding falls within the mischief of Rule 7 (11) of the Rules of 1984 as the said proceeding was not completed within the time limit prescribed by this Rule — Held: In the present case, the respondent having not been served with the charge sheet under the Rules of 1984, sub-rule (ii) of Rule 7 is not applicable in the case of the respondent —we hold that the Administrative Appellate Tribunal grossly misinterpreted rule (ii) of-Rule 7 of the New Rules of 1984 and wrongly made the same applicable in the present case — Appeal is allowed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Additional General Manager &amp; Anr Vs.

After serving out the sentences of imprisonment and after payment of fine the respondent filed various representations to the Government for his re-instatement but ultimately the authority dismissed the respondent from service — the respondent filed Administrative Tribunal case, against the order of dismissal. The Administrative Tribunal dismissed the case. But the Administrative Appellate Tribunal allowed the appeal holding that the order of dismissal was passed illegally</p><p style="text-align: justify;">— Held: We have gone through the impugned order of dismissal. The authority in view of the conviction of the respondent of a criminal offence decided whether the respondent should be punished under 1985 Rules and in fact decided to dismiss him from service under Rule 4(3) (a) of 1985 Rules. As no proceeding needs to brown up arid no opportunity needs to be given to the respondent for showing cause against the proposed penalty (under Rule 25 (3) of 1985 Rules) the Government passed the order of dismissal straightway. We find no illegality in it and the Appellate Tribunal was obviously on the wrong in finding the impugned order to be illegal.
