The import of a car or jeep free from duty etc. may offend the sense of decency and dignity of a section of the people outside of the Parliament but if the Parliament thinks that it is commensurate with the quality and quantity of work of the Member of Parliament in the discharge of his/her duties as a Member of Parliament, the outsiders may bemoan the lack of sense of decency on the part of Parliament to enact such a legislation, but it certainly cannot be said that it is unconstitutional. What looks indecent to others may in fact be constitutionally permissible. [Para-7]</p><p style="text-align:justify"><em>Dr Ahmed Husain Vs.
