Even if the children prefer to live with the mother due to natural affection or attachment for her, that would not in any way affect the liability of the father to maintain the children. If the father objects to the custody of the children and want to assert his own legal right, the proper course for the father would be to apply for his custody, but so long as the custody of the children remains with the mother, he cannot on any plea refuse to pay maintenance for the children.

In the previous verse it has been stated that in the case of a pregnant woman her period of Iddat will be till delivery. It is therefore apparent that the maintenance has been related to the period of Iddat. The interpretation given by the learned Judges is thus apparently in conflict of the aforesaid verse—from the above, it is clear that the interpretation given by the learned Judges is not and cannot be acceptable because it brings conflict and even on the general criterion of interpretation as they also would not deny that a document should be read as a whole, the interpretation of the learned Judges must be rejected. [Paras-39 &amp; 40]</p><p style="text-align:justify">Per Mustafa Kamal, J : The relevant Suras and Ayats of the Holy Quran on iddat, reconciliation, maintenance and mata’ a after pronouncement of talaq are to be found in Sura Al-Baqarah 12:228, 237, 241J, Sura At-Talaq [65: 1-6], SuraAl-Ahzab 33:49 and Sura Al-Nissa 14:351. The Holy Quran divides divorced women into 6 categories— Separate provisions have been made in the Holy Quran for no or separate periods of iddats and maintenance for each of the above categories of divorced women [Paras-10l &amp; 102]</p><p style="text-align:justify">Per Latifur Rahman, J: In the Holy Quran there is no clear direction for payment of maintenance to a divorced woman. Verse 228 of Surah Baqarah translated in Bengali reads as follows:</p><p style="text-align:justify">“EBOND TALAK PRAPYOGON NIJEDER TIN RITU PORJONTO OPEKKHA KORBE” -  This is a direction of Allah as contained in the Holy Quran. Iddat is a period of waiting. After divorce the marriage tie between the husband and wife is dissolved and after the dissolution of marriage there remains no obligation between the parties outside the contract of marriage, but due to the period of iddat outside the contract of marriage an obligation for payment of maintenance has been created according to Muslim Law .... There being no direction of payment of maintenance during the period of “Iddat” in the Holy Quran, one is bound to follow the other sources of Islamic law for a guidance on the question of granting of maintenance to a divorced woman, [Paras- 1 50&amp; 155]</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>M.
