It is the bounded duty on the part of the learned lawyer to attend to that case in the court or he can make such other arrangement for the proper representation of the case of his client in the court, The learned lawyer owes a duty not only to his client but also to the court —A learned lawyer owes a sacred duty to the society not to encourage shady cases by which courts might be over burdened denying justice to the genuine litigants. The learned members of the Bar as the officers of the court and also as the companion of the cause of justice may have valuable contribution to the cause of justice if they screen out frivolous and fraudulent litigation’s and refuse to accept them saving the courts from being over flooded with frivolous, fraudulent and misconceived cases. It is expected that the co-operation of the Bar will be readily forthcoming in this regard.
