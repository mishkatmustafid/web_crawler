Tara Chand Modi, A1R1958A11374, to say, ‘The words “in accordance’ mean in conformity or ‘as provided for’“. So does Mitra in Legal and Commercial Dictionary, 4th Edn., Vol. 20A, ‘in accordance with’ is used as an equivalent of ‘not repugnant to, ‘not in conflict with’ or ‘not inconsistent with’.

Biswas and Mitra (afore quoted) quote Balkrishna v. State of Madras, A1R1961 (SC)1 152, to say, “The words “subject to” have reference to effectuating the intention of the law and the correct meaning is “conditional upon”. So does Perm’s Judicial Dictionary, Vol. (iv), quoting another unreported Indian Supreme Court case. Words and Phrases (afore quoted), Vol. 40, describes “subject to” as meaning ‘conditional upon’ or ‘depending on’, or ‘subordinate to’ or ‘inferior to’.

The notice must not be vague or in bare language merely repeating the language of the statute—The principle of a meaningful show cause has been highlighted when a person is called upon to meet or explain some charges brought against him — in not giving specific facts with particulars in the show cause notice, the rule of fairness which is a part of the principle of natural justice has been offended.

Giasuddin Chowdhury &amp; Anr 5 BLT (AD)—274</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pre-emption</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Pre-emption is a kind of purchase in preference according to category. When the question of purchase comes, the seller or transfer must have some right or saleable interest in the holding without that what the buyer will get by pre-emption, whatever may be the nature of transfer. So against fictitious transfer pre-emption cannot be allowed. If pre-emption is allowed in respect of fictitious transfer, it will illegally affect the share and interest of the real co-sharers, which cannot be allowed by a court of law.

Petitioner filed a review petition against the order of dismissal on 20. 6. 84 to the President and CMLA, that before the review application was disposed of the post of CMLA was abolished—vide notification dated 12.10.91 respondent No. 2 constituted a forum to examine and consider petition.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">review application— the forum in a meeting on a careful consideration of the petitioners case found nothing against the petitioner and recommended for his reinstatement on setting aside the order of dismissal, and petitioner was informed about the rejection of the review application on 1.2.94—</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Held : In the instant case from the impugned order we find that no reason whatsoever was assigned in refusing to accept the recommendation of the committee except for a general observation that no sufficient grounds for the acceptance of the review was found. This in our opinion is a slipshod and non-speaking order which offends the idea of justice. [Para-12]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Md. Gholam Mostafa Miah Vs.

Court of Settlement 5 BLT (AD)-100</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Citizenship</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The term “citizen” derived from the Latin word “civics” is no longer understood in the narrow sense of earlier times as an inhabitant of a city or a freeman having a family in a city or as the representative of a city in parliament. By citizen it is now meant a person who is a member of an independent political community having rights and obligation under the constitution and law of that country, what sovereignty is to a state. citizenship is to a person. Sovereignty gives a state membership in the family of nation and citizenship gives a person membership in the political community of his country. Citizenship, the status of being a citizen, is a term of Municipal Law, Nationality, the status of being a national, is a term of international law. Citizenship, though not mentioned as a fundamental right in our Constitution, is to be considered as the right of all rights as on it depends one’s right to fundamental rights expressly provided for a citizenship In part III of the Constitution. [Paras-7 &amp; 8]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Bangladesh Vs. Prof. Golam Azam &amp; Ors. 3 BLT (AD)-3</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the international standpoint, the nationality is the status and quality of belonging to particular nations or states. All nations of a state are not citizens though citizens must be nationals. A national of a state may not possess full civil or political rights, but a citizen must possess full civil or political rights. The provisions of the Act of 1951 and P.O. 149 of 1972 are to be read together to get a complete picture of the law of citizenship in Bangladesh. [Paras- 160 &amp; 162]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Bangladesh Vs. Prof. Golam Azam &amp; Ors. 3 BLT (AD)-3</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Citizenship may be acquired by birth or by naturalisation. A person who is deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh under Article 2 of the order is not required to take any oath of allegiance unless he is elected or appointed to any office mentioned in the third schedule of the Constitution. A naturalised citizen is however, required to take oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh. IPara-71</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Bangladesh Vs. Prof. Golam Azam &amp; Ors. 3 BLT (AD)-3</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cause of Action</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is now well settled that suspension as a prelude to the disciplinary action as not a punishment and as such it does not give rise to any cause of action and in the instant suit from exhibit cha (8) it is crystal clear that the plaintiff opposite party No. 1 has been placed under suspension in pursuance of resolution dated 1.7.90 wherein it has been resolved by the Governing Body that they would constitute and appropriate committee for taking disciplinary action against the plaintiff opposite party No. 1 in view of the allegations levelled against him and in that view of the matter we held that the instant suit suffers from want of cause of action but unfortunately both the courts below surely missed this point. [Para-14]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Dhwiat Degree College Vs. M. A. Samad &amp; Ors. 5 BLT (HCD)—1 10</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cause of Action</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The expression “cause of action”, thus, means the entire bundle of facts which a plaintiff has to prove in order to be eligible for the grant of relief. In other words, it can be stated that the facts that are alleged in the plaint and which are required to be proved without proof of which the plaintiff would not be entitled to a judgment, constitute the cause of action. Equally It can be said that a cause of action presupposes the existence of a right In the plaintiff which right has either been infringed or is threatened to be infringed. The right must be a substantive right, or it may pertain only to procedure, but the right must be there. Whether any particular facts constitute a cause of action has to be determined with reference to the facts of each case and with reference to the substance rather than the form of the action. Cause of action cannot be construed in an isolated way and the whole averments made in the plaint are to be seen and taken together to see whether any cause of action has been disclosed or not. It is the plaint as a whole which is to be construed and not the terminology or for that matter, a few stray references. [Para-70]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Mohammad Azun &amp; Ors. Vs.

Interest is payable in half yearly rests, first payment becoming due on the date six months after from the date of opening the first letter of credit. In the terms and conditions of the schedule of agreement the question on penal interest was incorporated by way of liquidated damage @ 1% in the event of the borrowers failing to pay when due, any instalment of the principal of the loan/credit, interest, commission or any other costs, charges and expenses which the borrowers are liable to pay under this agreement. The interest payable under this sub- clause shall be computed for the period of default. [Para- 16]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Delta Jute Mills Ltd Vs.

The suit having been filed on 10.8.86 well within the period of 12 years from 13.4.76 is not barred by limitation. [Para-6]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Mostafa Ali Mridha Vs. Md Raquibullah &amp; Ors. 7 BLT (AD)-258</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Decree</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A ‘decree’ by definition means the formed expression of an adjudication which so far as regards the court expression it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final.

Bangladesh &amp; Ors. 3 BLT(AD)-14</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Domicile</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">“By domicile, we mean home, the permanent home.” Domicile has been defined as that place where a man has his true, fixed, and permanent home and principal establishment, and to which whenever he is absent he has the intention of returning. The permanent residence of a person of the place to which he intends to return even though he may actually reside elsewhere. A person may have more than one residence but only one domicile. It is his legal residence, as distinguished from the temporary place of abode, or his home. [Para- 160]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Bangladesh Vs. Prof Golam Azam &amp; Ors. 3 BLT(AD)-3</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dwelling House</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case admittedly the plaintiff is not residing or ever reside in Kha schedule property which was purchased by defendant No.2. There is no evidence that it was a family dwelling house. But it transpired that those were occupied by some other persons though under the plaintiff and defendant No. 1. It is in evidence that the plaintiff was residing at Sherpur town after the death of her husband and then. she shifted to Narayanganj. So by no stretch of imagination that it cannot be found that the Kha schedule property is the dwelling house of the plaintiff. [Para- 12]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Bina Roy Chowdhury Vs.

The character of the debutter property cannot be changed by the Shebait of anyone else. [Para-29]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Hindu Devi Lakshmi Gobinda Jew Vs. Govt of Bangladesh &amp; Ors. 7 BLT (HCD) – 133</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Forgery</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">When a person is to be found guilty for forgery of a document, there must be an original document first, when an original document is substituted by another fabricated document, or if a document is created by a ficticious person and not by a genuine person it may be called a forgery.

D Goiwn Nabi &amp; Anr 3 BLT (HCD)-1</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fact of Fraud</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Fact of fraud is a matter of inference from proved facts and circumstances of each case and the evidence received by the court. Each circumstance by itself may not tell much, but when a bundle of circumstances are taken together they may bring into light a fraudulent or dishonest plan to commit fraud. [Para-14]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Govt. of Bangladesh &amp; Anr Vs. Mashiur Rahman &amp; Ors. 6 BLT (AD)-73</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>‘Government’</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The word “Government” thus, denotes the person or body of persons administering the laws and governing the State. “Government” is the body of persons charged with the duty of governing and exercising certain powers and performing of certain duties by public authorities or officers together with certain corporations exercising public function. [Para-23]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>M. Habibur Rahman &amp; Ors Vs.

Therefore, as a sale cannot be completed without price is paid, Heba-bil-ewaz also cannot be called valid unless ewaz is paid. [Para- 14]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Md. Nurul Islam &amp; Ors. Vs. Azimom Bewa 6 BLT (HCD)-1 16</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Heba-bil-Ewaz</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The learned Subordinate Judge appear to have committed serious error of law as he considered the admission of the plaintiff that she put her L.T.I. in the heba-bil-ewaz but he failed to consider the circumstances in which she had to put her signature and she disordered, the heba-bil-ewaz by saying that fraud having been practised upon her and she did not know about the contents of the deed and she put her signature in good faith on the sale of 15 decimals of land and her signature was collusively used in the heba-bil-ewaz and further no exchange was proved or established. The learned Judge committed serious error of law in not considering the circumstances as such his findings are not sustainable in law. Furthermore the plaintiff as the owner and having been in possession although challenged the heba-bll-ewaz as such burden is lying upon the defendant to prove that the heba is genuine. [Para-5]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Jobeda Khatoon Vs. Shorab Hossain &amp; Ors. 7 BLT (HCD)-290</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Injunction</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An injunction is a writ framed according to the circumstances of the case commanding an act which the court regards as essential to justice or restraining an act which it esteems contrary to equity and good conscience. In other words, an injunction is a form of equitable relief and it is to be issued in aid of equity and justice and not to aid injustice. [Para- 17]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>M/S Gloland Put. Ltd. Vs. Govt. of Bangladesh 7 BLT (HCD)-214</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Law on injunction—Balance of convenience and Inconvenience</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The prayer of the defendant for temporary injunction—The question is if defendant no. 2 appellant has made out a prima facie case in support of the prayer against plaintiff respondent no. 1 on whose behalf there is an affidavit-in-opposition in respect of handing over and taking over charge of the office of the Managing Director. This paper dated 4.7.1996 is about handing over charge of the office of the Managing Director to plaintiff-respondent no. 1 Khawja Zaki Ahsanullah by M.R. Siddique the Company Secretary, who according to plaintiff-respondent no. 1, was acting as Managing Director in his absence. There is another paper dated 24.12.1996 indicating that plaintiff-respondent no.1 has correspondence with Sonali Bank to get credit for running the affairs of the Jute Mills and this letter was sent by the Bank to plaintiff- respondent no. 1, who was addressed as Managing Director of the Jute Mills on 24.12.1996. There is another letter from the Commissioner of Customs and Excise dated 28.8.1997 informing-respondent no. 1 that it is not the responsibility of the collectorate determine as to who is the legal Managing Director of the Mills and this paper addressing the Managing Director of M/s. Nowab Askarl Jute Mills is addressed and sent to twin House, Shahbagh, Dhaka which seems to be the address of plaintiff- respondent no. 1. All these papers are indicative of the fluid condition of the affairs of the Jute Mills and of the Company. The trial Court will have to consider all aspects of the case and take evidence to decide and dispose of the suit at an early date. At the moment it appears that the appellant has failed to make out a prima facie case in support of his prayer for temporary injunction. In this view of the matter, we need not consider the balance of convenience and inconvenience. [Para- 10]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Nawab Khawja Habthullah Askari Vs.

The question of iddat for women arises on other occasions as well as on the death of husband, on periods of abstinence from sexual Intercourse and on periods of abandonment of prayers and fasting by women, but it arises also when there is a pronouncement of talaq. The purpose of iddat after divorce is four fold, first, to allow the parties to reconciliate and to give the divorce a go by in the cases of Talaq Ahsan or Talaq Hasan, secondly, to ascertain whether the woman is carrying any offspring of her husband in the womb or not, so that the legitimacy of the child remains beyond dispute, thirdly, to prevent re-marriage of the woman during the period of iddat in order not to forestall reconciliation and to avoid future controversies on legitimacy and fourthly, to make arrangements for the maintenance of the woman during the period of iddat.

The judge made law or the consensus is that in order to satisfr about the existence of “prima facie” case. the pleadings must contain facts constituting the existence of right of the plaintiff and its infringement in the hands of the defendants.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">.A good “prima facie’ case means a case where the plaintiff has a fair question to raise at the trial and the suit is not likely to fail on a technical flaw.

Though the plaintiff performed his part of obligation in all respects, the defendants failed to perform their part of obligation and as a result there was a breach of contract on the part of defendant No. 1, the plaintiff-petitioner claimed in the money suit compensation and damages — The plaintiffs suit for compensation and damages was partly decreed by the Trial Court. The Trial Court held that the seller acted illegality by not making physical delivery of the vessel to the buyer-plaintiffs as per terms of MOA—on appeal the High Court Division rejected the contention of the means acceptance on delivery and allowed the appeal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Held: The High Court Division has rightly held that in spite of clause 5 of the MOA the plaintiff had no obligation to accept the vessel in terms of clause 3 of the MOA, to see that the vessel answers the description given in the MOA.

Both the High Court Division and this Division too, upon granting leave, are competent to decide this question. We have held that the High Court Division, before endorsing the amount of compensation as allowed by the trial court totally failed to consider the evidence on record in so far as the plaintiffs claim of damages in schedule B of the plaint is concerned and also overlooked that there was no legal evidence worth the name in support of the plaintiffs claim of alleged loss and damage. We have also found that there was no evidence of actual loss and damage sustained by the plaintiff and the High Court Division cannot confirm the trial court’s assessment of compensation merely ‘for ends of justice for assessment of compensatory/special damage is a legal exercise based on evidence on record and not an exercise in compassion and sympathy.

If it were to be so, then an absurd situation will arise; for example, if an order of dismissal is passed with immediate effect and kept under the pillow of the maker, then the dismissed person cannot attend office from the next day because it has become effective as soon as the order was passed. Nothing can be more offensive to common sense than to suggest that the order will be operative without the person knowing that an order was passed against him—We think it is a sound proposition that an order to be effective must at least be communicated to the person concerned and the date of actual receipt is not material for the said purpose. In the present case, it is apparent that there was no communication of the order of dismissal until 4.1.87. MW No. 9 having been repealed in the meantime, the light had gone out of the order. The order was not communicated to the respondent when there was light in It. The respondent was communicated about the order at a time when no light could be put in the order. Therefore the order of dismissal qua the respondent was not an order under the MLO. It could not be effective against him at any time.

Deputy Secretaries are being considered for promotion to the selected posts of Joint Secretary. Additional Deputy Commissioners and the like are being considered for a promotion to the selected posts of Deputy Secretary. They have already put in a number of years in Government service which is basically different from working as a Pilot in a Commercial Airline. Evaluation of their efficiency, conduct, discipline, comprehension, initiative, zeal to work, honesty, personality and various other requirements of service have been recorded each year in their respective ACRs. That ought to be the most dominant and persuasive document for the purpose of evaluating the candidates’ eligibility for the promotion post. The marks fixed for interview should be minimum so as not to upset the accumulated credits achieved by the candidates over the years in their respective ACRs by a momentary impression created in the minds of the Interview Board before which the candidates cannot possibly appear for more than a few minutes. There is a strong need to protect the public servant from the propensity of politicisation of administration by a party Government by keeping the marks for interview as minimum as possible so that the scope of arbitrariness and the possibility of pick and choose are absolutely minimised. We would therefore agree with the ultimate decision of the learned majority Judges of the special Bench that allocation of 40% marks for interview in the context of the situation obtaining in our country and in the context of the finding that the guidelines were arbitrarily and that 15% marks for interview under the circumstances would be a safe marking system for protecting the neutral character of public service.

On a close scrutiny of the Bainapatra deeds it appears that one Bainapatra deed had been written on a stamp paper and another written on a cartridge paper purchased in the year 1969. Exhibit-8 is a kabala deed dated 4.8.71 which was executed by defendant No. 7 in favour of the father of defendant nos. 1-5. It is recited in the said kabala deed that following the alleged agreement, defendant No. 7 transferred the suit land in favour of the father of the defendant nos. 1-5. Exhibit-4 is a deed of reconveniance executed by the father of defendant nos. 1-5 in favour of defendant No. 7. From the above, it reveals that at the time of the alleged execution of the Bainapatra deeds, the defendant No. 7 was not the owner of land, and, as such, the Bainapatra deeds by a person who was not the owner of the land got no legal force and also legal existence in the eye of law. In the written statement filed on 27.9.1996 by the defendant nos. 1-5, defendant Nos. 4 and 5 had been shown as minors but in the Bainapatra deed exhibit-F, it was not at all recited that the defendant No. 5 had been minor at that time. Exhibit-i, a School Certificate duly proved by the Head Master of the concerned school is an evidence to show that the defendant No. 5 was born only on 24.6.1974. The matter, thus, became manifestly clear that the defendant No. 5 was not at all born on the date of the alleged execution of Bainapatra i.e., in the year 1971. Both the courts below on a proper consideration and discussion of the legal evidence and other materials on record came to the positive finding that the Bainapatra deeds Exhibits-F and Fl are totally false and are acts of forgery.
