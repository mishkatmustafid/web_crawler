It is not disputed by the petitioners that the school has not been functioning and the number of students are not increasing. The school is imparting education to the students and rendering services to the community in general. Getting the future generation of the country trained up and imparting education to maximum number of students and children is the State policy of education.

Ultimately National Board of Revenue passed the impugned order dated 29.7.91 refusing to grant ante-dated seniority to the petitioner in spite of the recommendations of the Ministry of Establishment and the Public Service Commission. This impugned order is in fact the order of a higher administrative authority as because the officers of the taxation department are under the administrative control of the National Board of Revenue and the National Board of Revenue is in fact the final higher administrative authority for the purpose of granting ante-dated seniority to respondent No. 1. Hence the question of filing any appeal to higher administrative authority for the purpose of granting ante-dated seniority to respondent No. 1 does not arise. The representation of respondent No I having been turned down by the National Board of Revenue, which is the higher administrative authority in the case of respondent, the question of preferring any further appeal does not arise in the facts of this case.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Govt, of Bangladesh &amp; Anr.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="entry-content"><p><b>Citation:</b>  9BI.T (AD)-226,  9 BLT (AD)-2</p><p><b>Subject:</b>  Bangladesh Civil Service Seniority </p><p><b>Delivery Date:</b>  1970-01-01</p><!DOCTYPE html><p> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Bangladesh Civil Service Seniority Rules, 1983</u></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section-3</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The case filed before the Administrative Tribunal is not maintainable in law as necessary parties who were adversely affected by the order were not brought before the court in accordance with law. The cause title of the application of respondent No. 1 clearly shows that 29 directly recruited Assistant Commissio­ners of "faxes were not at all made parties in the case and no notice was individually served on them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mahbubur Rahman &amp; Ors. Vs. Taslimuddin Ahmed &amp; Ors. 9BI.T (AD)-226</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule-3(e)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 1982 there were two advertisements, one on 10.06.1982 for regular batch and another on 22.12.1982 for Magistrates to BCS (Admn: Admn) Cadre, Respondent Nos. 2-61 were actually recruited through earlier advertise­ment. Public Service Commission, on the basis numerical numbers to all BCS Exams so far held, and according to this, respondent Nos. 2-61 belongs to 1st BCS Exanimation whilst the appellants batch belong to 2nd BCS Examination. This being the case appellants are as a batch junior to the respondents-- as a matter of fact. Rule 3(e) of the BCS Seniority Rules, 1983 is not applicable for determining the seniority of the appellants as well as of respondent as they were directly recruited on the basis of two different advertisements, whereas Rule 3(e) is applicable only in case of determining seniority involving lateral entrance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>A.H.M. Mustain Billah &amp; Ors. Vs. Bangladesh &amp; Ors.  9BLT (AD)-2.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule-3(g)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Whether amended provision of Rule-3(g) was not given retrospective effect and as such it was not applicable in the case of appellants and the respondents who were appointed in 1983 and 1984.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Held: As a matter of fact there was no need to give retrospective effect to the amended provision of sub-rule 3(g) because the seniority position of the respondents was always above the appellants batch. Government always reserves the right to fix seniority according to existing rules and principles. Sub-Rule 3(g) was nothing new as identical provision was already there in the general principle of the seniority, 1970. This incorporation in the BCS Seniority Rules 1983 was necessary to fulfill legal requirement as it has protected the seniority of all officers of all cadres belonging to first BCS examination not only of respondent Nos. 2-61. Therefore, sub-rule 3(g) was incorporated not only to give benefit to respondent Nos. 2-61. Further, the President is clearly empowered under the provision of Article 133 to  make rules prospectively and retrospectively and in that view it cannot be argued that Rule 3(9) of Rule . 1982 cannot apply retrospectively in the case of respondents who were appointed in 1984 and the appellants who were appointed in 1983 and Rule 3(g) was not applicable with retrospective effect in the case of the appellants and the respondents. It will also be seen that the dispute regarding seniority of the officers of 1982 regular batch and that of 1982 special batch having arisen after amalgamation if 1992, Rule 3(g) which came into operation in 1985 will apply in determining the seniority of the officers of these two batches and the question of giving retrospective effect of Rule 3(g) does not strictly arise.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>A.H.M. Mustain Billah &amp; Ors. Vs. Bangladesh &amp; Ors. 9 BLT (AD)-2.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule-3(g) read with Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Articles-27, 29 &amp; 31</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The correct position is that the appellants sat for a TEST of 300 marks only (100 marks psychological test and 200 mark viva voce) arranged by the Public Service Commission to recruit personnel against 650 post of Magistrates to fill up urgent vacancies created due to the introduction of upazila system and for this BCS (Recruitment) Rules had to be amended. This test was distinctly different from the regular BCS Examination of 1600 marks which the respondents appeared and come out successful. PCS's advertisement dated 22.12.1982 under which the appellants were appointed clearly mentioned that their appointment was not to be considered as placement in the cadre direct.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The conditions in their offer of appointment (Annexure C) and the subsequent amendment of BCS (Seniority) Rules. 1983 (Annexure D) incorporating sub-rule 3(g) (Annexure E) are not at all contrary to the condition stipulated in the advertisement dated 22.12.1982. The advertisement spelt out that the appellants, as usual, would not be entitled for placement in the BCS (Administration) Cadre straightway: because, the Government was fully aware that the test conducted for their recruitment was not in view, a regular BCS Examination. This implications of the advertisement has been made clearer in the offer of appointment — the effect of unifying the two services and issuance of Notification dated 04.04.1994 has in no way violated the fundamental rights of the appellants guaranteed under the above two Articles of the Constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>A.H.M.

Therefore, a subsequent omission b\ way of amendment in a procedure cannot be of any consequence in respect of the proceeding against the appellant.

In this case, the bank in its prudence ought to have taken effective steps to dispose of the imported goods soon after its release from the port in 1977, on information to the defendant-borrower. The delay in such disposal in 1981 shows inefficiency on the part of the officials of the bank, during which period the dues of the bank mounted to the prejudice of the defendant while the quality of the goods continued to deteriorate.

Here in the present case earlier order of this Division was to maintain status quo in respect of composition of the Board of Directors of the Bank and a copy of that order was sent to Bangladesh Bank by UCBL and in such a situation the Bangladesh Bank is bound to honour the order passed by this Division.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bangladesh Bank &amp; Ors.

If a person without the existence of any such relevant objective phenomenon fancies something and then forms an opinion concerning any question or issue such opinion is neither a reasonable opinion nor a reasonable person holds such an opinion. We have already noticed that the "opinion" of respondent No. 1 concerning the appellant is based on the inspection report and the report and recommendation of the Standing Committee. So it cannot be said that the "opinion" held by the respondent No. 1 concerning the appellant is not a reasonable opinion of a reasonable person.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdur Rahim Chowdhury Vs.

Such opinion must be formed on the basis of relevant materials on record and not fancifully without any such material nor on the basis of irrelevant materials.

Then a show cause notice was issued upon the petitioner on 9.5.93 directing him to demolish the unauthorized construction within 7 days of receipt. From the show cause notice dated 9.5.93 (Annexure-2 to the affidavit-in-opposition) it appears that the direction was given to demolish the entire building but without giving any reason for satisfaction of the RAJUK authority for issuing such notice for demolishing of the building constructed on approved plan. It appears from annexure-2 to the supplementary affidavit of the petitioner that within 7 days of receipt of the show cause notice the petitioner replied to the same but after about 2 and 12 months, respondent No. l served another notice directed to demolish the 2 storied bidding within 7 days holding the reply not satisfactory. In that notice also no ground was given for which the entire building would be liable to be demolished, although the same was constructed on approved plan of RAJUK. Admittedly the petitioner replied to the show cause  notice  and  according to Section-3B of Building Construction Act. 1952 the petitioner was required to be heard in persons but without affording him any such opportunity of being heard the RAJUK authority in violation of. Section-3B(3). long after expiry of 15 days served the notice on 17.8.93 upon the petitioner directing him to demolish the entire building.

In October 1992, the plaintifflodged a notice of appeal against the award before the appellate forum ofdefendant No. 3 On 12.01.1993 it also took a civil action against the award in1993 Folio No. 41 before the High Court of Justice at England.

Since on his ownshowing that he does not have the shares of Albert David (Bangladesh) Ltd. heis not a share holder of the said company, as such, the question of tiling asuit on behalf of the Albert David (Bangladesh) Ltd. does not a rise because inone hand he cannot say that he is not the share holder of the company but onthe other hand he has interest in it. cannot be accepted.

In a suit for partition, after tiling of the report alongwith the case map, field book, saham list by the Advocate Commissioner finaldecree takes effect and thereafter remains nothing to be done. In a pre-emptionproceeding under Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. thequestion of co-shareship in the tenancy is relevant, but in Section 24( 1) ofNon-Agricultural Tenancy Act the co-shareship in the land is material. In thatview of the matter, the passing of the final decree in a partition suit finallydetermines the right of the co-sharers in the land.

The speaker deriveshis power of certification under Article 81(3) which is hedged with a conditionthat "Every Money is presented to the President for his assent, shall beara certificate under his band "that" (the underlining is mine) it is aMoney Bill" and such certificate shall a be conclusive for all purposesand shall not be questioned in any court. The expression "that" it isa Money Bill is not an "idle expression or mere formality" It meansthat the speaker must satisfy himself that what he is presenting for the assentof the President is in fact a Money Bill. And this satisfaction  must be  derived  from the enumeration given under Article81(l)(a) to (f) read  with  Article 81(2)  and  88  ofthe Constitution. Furthermore, Article 7(1) which is the "touchstone" of the constitution ordains in no uncertain term that "AllPowers in the Republic belong to the people and their exercise on behalf of thePeople shall be effected only under, and by authority of this Constitutionwhile under Article 7(2) it is sanctified to be the "Solemnexpression" of the will of the People and the "Supreme law of theRepublic". Now the question is, have the people invested the speaker withthe power or in other words is the speaker empowered to certify a Bill as aMoney Bill which in fact is not a Money Bill? The answer must be "no"The Power conferred upon the Speaker under Article 81(3) must be exercised onbehalf of the people and must be effected only under, and by authority, of theConstitution. This sacred document (the Constitution) has not authorized orinvested any one specially the constitutional functionaries of the state whoare under oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution to issue afalse certificate transgressing the presidential Prerogative under Article80(3) of the Constitution. This constitutional Power cannot be negated anddenied by any one at his sweet will or whim. There must be a clear andunambiguous conferment of such power by the Constitution itself. In the factsand circumstances of this case Particularly the way the extract Bill was sentto the President for his recommendation to be introduced in the House, the waythe Home Minister deliberately misled the House saying that the Presidentrecommended the Bill as a Money Bill (Which it was not) and the way the Speakersent the Bill for the assent of the President after it was passed by theParliament as a Money Bill certifying that the Bill (P.S.A.) was a Money Billknowing fully well that it was not so under Article 81(1) of the Constitution,I am left with but only one conclusion that it was a ploy to preempt theprerogative of the President (under Article 80(3) to prevent him from refusingor withholding his assent to the Bill and returning it back to the Parliamentbecause it did not answer the description (a) to (f) of Sub-Article (1) ofArticle 81 of the Constitution.

It is also found that no collusion or connivance exists between the petitioner and the respondent with regard to the subject matter of the suit namely, the dissolution of their marriage. Moreover. since the respondent after being served with the summons has not contested the suit, the averments of the petitioner have been - proved by the evidence on record. Since the two minor children are in custody of the petitioner and living with her ever since she left the matrimonial home, I consider it to be in the best interest of the children that they should continue to remain in the custody of the petitioner unless the respondent can show any valid reason why they should not continue to remain in the custody of the petitioner-petitioner's case proved.

There was nostatement in the plaint or in the deposition that the originals were lost ordestroyed.  Further from the evidence onrecord it was found by the learned Judges of the High  CourtDivision that plaintiff Nos. 3. 4, 6 and 14 were not born at the time ofauction sale and as such the question of auction purchase in the name of unbornperson does not arise.  The learned Judgesthemselves also saw the photocopies Ext. 2 and 2a (as marked by lower appellatecourt) and found that those photocopies were different from those filed in thetrial court. The learned Judges or the High Court Division rightly reversed thefinding of the lower appellate court. It further appears from the record thatthe certificate case was started in 1959-60, but the plaintiffs claimed to havepurchased the suit land on 16.06.1979 and got possession on 20.02.1981. Thesale was set aside by the certificate officer and the lower appellate court didnot consider this aspect at all. The basic document of title of the plaintiffsbeing of a highly doubtful nature the learned Judges committed no illegality insetting aside the Judgment of the lower appellate court and restoring those thetrial court. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><b><i><span style='Cambria","serif"'>Kazi Abdul Khaleque&amp; Ors.

The petitioner has already appeared and filed a written statement denying his marriage with her. He has got every opportunity to challenge the 'Kabinnama' and the solemnization of the marriage on the very same grounds on which he on 22.10.2000 filed Title suit No.296 of 2000 before a Subordinate Judge. Family Court has got every jurisdiction to decide as to whether the "Kabinnama" in question is a genuine and valid document or not and whether any marriage between the petitioner and Opposite Party No. 1 was ever solemnized or not before it decides to grant any decree for dower and /or maintenance. In such a suit for a decree for dower and/or maintenance, no declaration in respect of the "Kabinnama" or cancellation of the "Kabinnama" is at all necessary. Family Court therefore cannot be expected to wait for the final decision of a title suit on like issues as nobody can surely say when such title suit would find the end of the tunnel. Moreover, it would be acting to frustrate the very purpose of the Ordinance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Shafiqul Haque Vs.

A textile manufacturing company is generating goods and it may not be immoral from the point of view of financial policy to alios the directors of such a company to be represented on the Board of a financial institution in which the textile manufacturing company may have a shareholding interest.

The hard reality is that the quality of the judges of Division, though are of a satisfactory level, all are not equal. Some are more brilliant may be left behind and the less competent may be elevated to the Appellate Division simply because he was appointed a judge of this Division at an earlier point of time than the others. This will have the following effect on the highest judiciary: firstly the most brilliant judges may be left behind though they could make better contribution to the judiciary. Secondly, if seniority-cum-merit becomes the criterion then right after the appointment of a judge in this Division he will do his best to improve the quality of his judgment and his overall performance as a judge and there will be a sense of competitiveness among the judges in performing their judicial duties. This will immensely benefit the nation as a whole and the judiciary in particular and the most meritorious will move ahead the less meritorious.

The High Court Division though acted under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure they could have acted under Order 41(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure. This amendment it appears has escaped the notice of the learned Advocate who appeared on behalf of the respondent before the High Court Division and also of the said Division. In view of the clear provision of the Rule and in view of the fact that Section 29(1) of the Local Government (Union Parishad) Ordinance 1983 relates to issuance of notice in the election petition which has been done in the present case we hold that no illegality and wrong has been committed by the High Court Division.

The intention of Legislature in bringing about amendment in Ordinance of 1983 by amendment act of 1993 was to disqualify a person from holding any public office when he stood as defaulter on the day of election and not on the day of presenting Nomination paper.

It is final when such adjudication completely disposes of the suit'". In a suit for partition, after filing of the report along with the case map, field book, saham list by the Advocate Commissioner final decree takes effect and thereafter remains nothing to be done. In a pre-emption proceeding under Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, the question of co-sharership in the tenancy is relavent. But the Section 24(1) of Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act the co-shareship in the land is maternal. In that view of the matter, the passing of" the final decree in a paretition suit finally determines the rights of hte co-sharers in the land. Hence, the application for the pre-emptor-respondents on the basis of co-shareship is not maintainable. [Para-14]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Shafiuddin Chowdhury Vs.

And the word 'co-sharer' in the phrase 'co-sharer in the land' is the key to find whether the preemptor is entitled to preempt. A final decree passed in a partition suit or amicable partition though separates and divides the land for the purpose of possession but does not ipso facto terminate co-ownership in such land till subdivision of the holding and distribution of rents takes place only in accordance with law. Subdivision of a holding and distribution of rents may also take place in a revenue survey subsequent to the cadastral survey with or without the plot or plots divided into different small plots. As stated above, such subdivision may also takes place at the instance of one or more of the co-tenants of the holding in accordance with the provisions of S. 1 17 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950. Such subdivision always terminates the joint tenancy or more precisely co-sharership in the land, no matter whether the land is subdivided or separated or not and after such subdivision, the old co-owners of the holding in such land cannot be deemed to still continue as co-sharer in the land within the meaning of S.24(1)of the Act, 1949.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>S.M.

So, the design of respondent No.l is not a new or original one.  The respondent's design is therefore, liable to be called on all the grounds stated in Section 51A(1)(a) of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mr. Yar Mohammad Vs.

In that view of the matter it appears that he has failed to fulfil the condition precedent for filing an application under section 51 of the Act.

Therefore, it appears that the respondent No.1 by suppressing the fact that a similar design had already been registered as back as in 1994 obtained the registration of their design by committing a fraud upon the Controller of Designs. It further appears that the respondent No.2 also failed to discharge - the legal duties cast upon him and after proper scrutiny failed to discover the fact that the design applied for already registered.Thus, the registration given by the respondent No.2 in favour of the respondent No. 1 being registration No.01638 dated 14.5.96 in class-1 is neither a new nor an original design and it has previously been published in Bangladesh and also registered by the petitioner in 1994.

This is thecorrect and legalistic position, but during the rush that follows a briskpolling it may not be possible for Presiding Officer or the Assistant PresidingOfficer to follow Article 31(2)(d)(e) in its full letter and spirit and theymay have to opt for satisfying the said Article in substance by putting theofficial mark on the back of the ballot papers leaving a part of the officialmark in the ballot paper and the remaining part of the same in the back of thecounterfoil. If, however, the ballot paper does not contain any official mark,either in part or in full the Presiding Officer has no option but to exclude itfrom count. The impression of a part of the official seal on the back of aballot paper is a shortening of the elaborate procedure under Article31(2)(d)(e) under pressure of circumstances.

Further, from theelection petition we do not find that the election-petitioner made anyallegation as to the illegal counting of votes by the Presiding Officer of CharBaleswar polling centre.

Waqf means and includes any permanent dedication by a person professing the Muslim faith of any property for any purpose recognized by Islam as religious, pious or charitable. It is no doubf a trust. After the creation of the waqf. the title of such property vests absolutely in Allah or in the charities created in His name. A mutawalli or mutawallis are appointed to carry out the waqf. The position of a mutawalli is not that of an ostensible owner but a mere manager. He is obliged to do only that what he was instructed for in the waqf-deed by way of administration and management of the waqf. No action of such mutawalli beyond the authority as given in the waqf-deed or which are intended to result in the waste or loss of the waqf property will be valid or bing the waqf.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Haftzuddin Ahmed Vs.

First, he must be satisfied that sueh transfer is necessary for improvement and benefit of the waqf. Then, he will have to obtain a sanction of the Government. But Section 56 is not generally intended to empower a mutawalli to transfer any part of the waqf property by way of sale, mortgage or exchange, or by lease for more than five years. That is, he can only lease out for a period of five years only. In case of an absolute transfer, no sueh transfer could be valid without prior sanction of the Administrator. Again the proviso warns that even sanction cannot validate a transfer, which is in contravention of a law or otherwise invalid. So, the sanction is not sacrosanct. Even a transfer with sanction may not be valid either for contravention of the law or when the sanction itself was not valid. Moreover, we could not find any reason for not to read the conditions or limitations as provided in Section 33 that before granting sanction the Administrator must be satisfied that such transfer was necessary for the improvement and benefit of the waqf in Section 33 for a transfer by a mutawalli in Section 56 and/or granting sanction by the Administrator in Section 57. Underlining implied limitation must not also be forgotten that the law was never interded to validate a transfer even with sanction, which ultimately results in injury, waste or loss of the waqf.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Hafizuddin Ahmed Vs.

The lower appellate court further held that in respect of the acquired land, the court cannot direct the Government to lease out the suit land to the plaintiffs simply because their predecessors-in-interest as the original owners had been in possession even after acquisition. It does not appear either from the judgment of the trial court or from the lower appellate court that the plaintiffs had ever made out any ease under section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, namely that no award regarding compensation for acquisition of the land was prepared by the Government or the original owners did not receive any compensation for acquisition in question. It appears that the learned Judge of the High Court Division upon making out a third case, on consideration of section 16 of the said Act. has wrongly reversed the decree of the lower appellant court and decreed the suit wrongly holding, inter alia, that although the land had been acquired by the Government as far back as in 1941 the same did not absolutely vest in the Government free from all encumbrance because the Government did not take physical possession thereof in pursuance of the acquisition in question. Moreover the learned Judge of the High Court Division was not justified in considering the trial court's finding that defendant No.l is a monthly tenant in respect of the suit land, overlooking that the lower appellate court rightly held that the plaintiffs, who have no right, title and interest in the suit land, had no legal authority to induct defendant No.l as a monthly tenant in the suit land.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Govt of Bangladesh &amp; Ors.

Such a Co-sharer will deem of continue as such co-owner in both holding as well as in land so long holding will continue to be joint. [Para-21]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>S.S.

They liked all other individuals are human beings. They are neither robots nor do they live like monks or runs in a cloistered monastery nor do they live in an ivory tower detached from he society shutting their eyes and closing their ears no evil hence cannot afford to say that "we wee no evil and hear no evil. If any doing so in my opinion that would be pernicious, immoral, unethical and most of all conduct unbecoming of a judge specially if he happens to be a judge of a constitutional Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Afzalul Abedin &amp; Ors.

In such a case benefit will be derived by a large number of people in contrast to a few. PI I. considers the interest of others and therefore, the court in a public interest litigation acts as the guardian of all the people whereas in a private case the court does not have such power. Therefore, in public interest litigation the court will lean to protect the interest of the general public and the rule of law vis-a-vis the private interest.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>E.T.V.

Proceedings for contempt are initiated for the purpose of protecting the image and dignity of the court itself. The purpose of proceedings in contempt of court is to keep the stream of justice unsullied and to maintain the confidence of the public at large in the fair and impartial administration of justice by the court of law in a proceedings under contempt there cannot be both justification and an apology.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

The condition of womenfolk has also improved in the rural areas to a great extent both in education and social perspective. This process, hopefully will continue. A daughter is not pardanashin if she can read and write and if she can not read and write, that is a course upon the parents and the society.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Moulana Ruhul Mannan Helali Vs.

An expectation to become legitimate therefore should not be shorn of lawful begetting. The concept of legitimate expectation cannot be given such wide interpretation so as to allow any wishful hope without lawful root. In the instant case we have found that as a result of mere recommendation of the petitioner to the government for selection as the best Chairman of the district, he is said to have entertained an expectation not based on any legal ground neither borne out by lawful begetting and as such his expectation, however firm it was. cannot be termed to be legitimate expectation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md Hajizul Islam Vs.

It literally means without a name, that is nameless or fictitious and is to denote a transaction which is really done by a person without using his own name That is. not in the name of real purchaser, but in the name another. In every such benami transaction there are three persons concerned; the vendor, the real purchaser and the name lender.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ali Azam Vs.

In the alleged transaction it appears that the name of the real purchaser as well as his alleged benamder are appeared in the kabala deed. So apparently the instant transaction is not a benami transaction within the meaning of the words 'benami' "benamder" and "benami transaction."</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ali Azam Vs.

It gives an opportunity the journalist and the people to express their personal views on subjects of their having public interest. Through these, they can ventilate their grievances and demand redress. The newspaper is the best means through which the Government may know it defects in administration and so correct its ways for well being of the people. It is one of the very important things in the life of a civilized nation. It is the medium through which public opinion expresses itself. The press is free to after criticism on the functioning of the court or its officials as the very idea of the open the British System is to make it appear to the world at large to how the courts of the country are functioning. We believe that in this modern world, news media is one of the strong pillar which furnishes information of loopholes of the administration and its machineries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Daily Star &amp; Protham Aloq Partika Vs 'The State. 9BLT (HCD)-91</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>"Whoever marries"</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section-494 of the Penal Code Act, 1860— the world "whoever marries appearing" in the section must mean whoever marries validly.

Further, Section 5 of Act II of 1947 speaks of the offences as mentioned in the schedule of the Act to be tried by Special Judges. In the schedule we find sections 403 and 477A of the Panel Code with which the accused has been charged for committing misconduct as a public servant.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>IFIC Bank Ltd.

For a remedy is also right in the wider sense of the word, a secondary right, a remedial or procedural right as it is often called, and limitation undoubtedly extinguishes -such a procedural right. A person can enforce his substantive right, even though time barred, if there are other legal remedies available for the enforcement of the same. But, in the present case the remedy being enforceable in law and there being no remedy available under the law, this primary or substantive right of the plaintiff was lost by the law of limitation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Idris Ali Bhuiyan Vs.
