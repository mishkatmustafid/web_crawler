The Section 33 of P.O. 129 of 1972 provides for entertainment of such application only by the District Judge, who is given the exclusive jurisdiction to deal with such application for realization of respondents due money. The Artha Rin Adalat has no jurisdiction to entertain an application under Section-33 of P.O. 129 of 1972.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdur Razzaque Chowdhury &amp; Ors Vs.
