We also find that the committee did not make any inquiry to find out any breach of terms or conditions subject to which the sanction was granted or any statements ever made by the petitioners, which were not correct. The decision of the committee also does not show what directions were given to the petitioners, which they were bound in law to comply with but did not comply. In the absence of any such finding, just by saying for repeated non-compliance with the notice, the committee was not empowered to cancel the sanction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>A Rouf Chowdhurv &amp; Anr.
