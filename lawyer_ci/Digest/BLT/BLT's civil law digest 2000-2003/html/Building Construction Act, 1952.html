RAJUK cannot now cancel the sanction in such an arbitrary manner without giving notice claiming that due to mistake and misrep­resentation the building plans were sanctioned and permission was given for construction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Rajuk &amp; Ors.

But according to notice he was to produce the said before the authorize officer. Then a show cause notice was issued upon the petitioner on 9.5.93 directing him to demolish the unauthorized construction within 7 days of receipt. From the show cause notice dated 9.5.93 (Annexure-2 to the affidavit-in-opposition) it appears that the direction was given to demolish the entire building but without giving any reason for satisfaction of the RAJUK authority for issuing such notice for demolishing of the building constructed on approved plan. It appears from annexure-2 to the supplementary affidavit of the petitioner that within 7 days of receipt of the show cause notice the petitioner replied to the same but after about 2 and 12 months, respondent No. l served another notice directed to demolish the 2 storied bidding within 7 days holding the reply not satisfactory. In that notice also no ground was given for which the entire building would be liable to be demolished, although the same was constructed on approved plan of RAJUK. Admittedly the petitioner replied to the show cause  notice  and  according to Section-3B of Building Construction Act. 1952 the petitioner was required to be heard in persons but without affording him any such opportunity of being heard the RAJUK authority in violation of. Section-3B(3). long after expiry of 15 days served the notice on 17.8.93 upon the petitioner directing him to demolish the entire building. So, it is apparent from the above factual position that the whole action  of the  respondents  were  not only malafide but also illegal and without lawful authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mohammad Amir Hossain Vs.
