His furthercontention is that as the vendor left for India as per provision of StateAcquisition and Tenancy Act the property vested in the Government—it appearsthat the High Court Division considered the judgment of the trial court and thecase of the present petitioner. It was found b\ the High Court Division that insuch a suit the petitioner is not a necessary party as he is a third party. Itwas also found that in such ac suit only consideration is whether the vendorshave executed 'Bainapatra' or not. In the suit, the Government who hasallegedly taken over the property has entered appearance and contesting thesame. The High Court Division found that in such a situation the presence ofthe present petitioner in the suit is not necessary—we are of the view that theHigh Court Division as well as the trial Court rightly rejected the petitionfiled under Order I Rule 10 read with section 151 of the Code of CivilProcedure.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><b><i><span style='Cambria","serif"'>Md.

Since on his ownshowing that he does not have the shares of Albert David (Bangladesh) Ltd. heis not a share holder of the said company, as such, the question of tiling asuit on behalf of the Albert David (Bangladesh) Ltd. does not a rise because inone hand he cannot say that he is not the share holder of the company but onthe other hand he has interest in it. cannot be accepted. Even if he is assumedto be a shareholder, strictly speaking, he has no right in the assets of thecompany or cannot normally represent it. The right of a shareholder is only tothe extent of dividends if declared. The contention on behalf of the appellantis that since the notice was issued on him he has a legal right to file thesuit. The notice-dated 11.08.1997, as we have already found, was in respect ofhis holding of his office of directorship in the Pubali Bank Ltd. the questionof liabilities, as such, is irrelevant. In this connection, it should beremembered that it is not the relief, which is claimed; rather it is therelief, which can be given to the plaintiff that has to be looked into andconsidered in a plaint. Mere issuance of a notice by the Bangladesh Bank who isnot a creditor, enclosing a letter of Pubali Bank Ltd. for the purpose removinghim from the post of its directorship, will not clothe the plaintiff with thenecessary legal right to file this suit for declaration with regard to hisliabilities, which is an entirely different matter.
