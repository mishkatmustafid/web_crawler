Explanation to Section 2(2) provides that "a decreeis preliminary when further proceedings have to be taken before the suit can becompletely dispose of. It is final when such adjudication completely disposesof the suit." In a suit for partition, after tiling of the report alongwith the case map, field book, saham list by the Advocate Commissioner finaldecree takes effect and thereafter remains nothing to be done. In a pre-emptionproceeding under Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. thequestion of co-shareship in the tenancy is relevant, but in Section 24( 1) ofNon-Agricultural Tenancy Act the co-shareship in the land is material. In thatview of the matter, the passing of the final decree in a partition suit finallydetermines the right of the co-sharers in the land. Hence, the application forthe pre-emptor-respondents on the basis of co-sharership is not maintainable.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><b><i><span style='Cambria","serif"'>Md.

Further, the judgment of the lower appellatecourt is based on certain surmises and conjectures as the lower appellate courtthat if the pre-emptor and her husband were requested to purchase the landbefore pre­emption then probably either the pre-emptor or her husband ought tohave been a signatory either in the agreement or in the kabala.
