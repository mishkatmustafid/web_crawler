Such requirement does not appear to extend the obligation to give fresh notice for an adjourned meeting for transaction of the unfinished business of the last meeting. Business to be transected in the adjourned meeting also appears to be notified in the notice dated 08.04.99. It is difficult to sa\ on the agenda decisions taken could not validly be taken. Such meeting and the decisions taken therefore cannot be said to be invalid for violation of any law or the article of the company. Even re-election of the three directors in question in the same meeting also cannot invalidate the whole proceedings of the board meeting.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mr. S.I.
