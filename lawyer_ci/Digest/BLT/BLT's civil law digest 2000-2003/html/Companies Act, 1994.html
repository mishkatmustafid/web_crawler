So under the garb of recommendation Board ofDirectors cannot reject the candidature of any person for these election to theoffice of the director of the Bank. In our considered view the word "recommended"means power of the Board to point out defects, if any in the candidature of aperson for the office of director for consideration in the Annual GeneralMeeting to avoid complications in such meeting and not the power to reject anycandidature on the ground of defect real or fanciful. It is for the AnnualGeneral Meeting to consider defect, if any. in the candidature of a person andto take a decision over the same and not for Board of Directors to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><b><i><span style='Cambria","serif"'>ASF Rahman and Anr.
