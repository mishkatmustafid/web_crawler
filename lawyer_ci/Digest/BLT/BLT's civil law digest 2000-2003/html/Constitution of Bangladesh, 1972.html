The speaker deriveshis power of certification under Article 81(3) which is hedged with a conditionthat "Every Money is presented to the President for his assent, shall beara certificate under his band "that" (the underlining is mine) it is aMoney Bill" and such certificate shall a be conclusive for all purposesand shall not be questioned in any court. The expression "that" it isa Money Bill is not an "idle expression or mere formality" It meansthat the speaker must satisfy himself that what he is presenting for the assentof the President is in fact a Money Bill. And this satisfaction  must be  derived  from the enumeration given under Article81(l)(a) to (f) read  with  Article 81(2)  and  88  ofthe Constitution. Furthermore, Article 7(1) which is the "touchstone" of the constitution ordains in no uncertain term that "AllPowers in the Republic belong to the people and their exercise on behalf of thePeople shall be effected only under, and by authority of this Constitutionwhile under Article 7(2) it is sanctified to be the "Solemnexpression" of the will of the People and the "Supreme law of theRepublic". Now the question is, have the people invested the speaker withthe power or in other words is the speaker empowered to certify a Bill as aMoney Bill which in fact is not a Money Bill? The answer must be "no"The Power conferred upon the Speaker under Article 81(3) must be exercised onbehalf of the people and must be effected only under, and by authority, of theConstitution. This sacred document (the Constitution) has not authorized orinvested any one specially the constitutional functionaries of the state whoare under oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution to issue afalse certificate transgressing the presidential Prerogative under Article80(3) of the Constitution. This constitutional Power cannot be negated anddenied by any one at his sweet will or whim. There must be a clear andunambiguous conferment of such power by the Constitution itself. In the factsand circumstances of this case Particularly the way the extract Bill was sentto the President for his recommendation to be introduced in the House, the waythe Home Minister deliberately misled the House saying that the Presidentrecommended the Bill as a Money Bill (Which it was not) and the way the Speakersent the Bill for the assent of the President after it was passed by theParliament as a Money Bill certifying that the Bill (P.S.A.) was a Money Billknowing fully well that it was not so under Article 81(1) of the Constitution,I am left with but only one conclusion that it was a ploy to preempt theprerogative of the President (under Article 80(3) to prevent him from refusingor withholding his assent to the Bill and returning it back to the Parliamentbecause it did not answer the description (a) to (f) of Sub-Article (1) ofArticle 81 of the Constitution.
