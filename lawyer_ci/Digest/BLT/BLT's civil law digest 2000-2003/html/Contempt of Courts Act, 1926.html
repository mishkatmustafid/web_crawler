This case should serve as a reminder to all concerned that the court will not hesitate to deal with a member of the subordinate judiciary if he is not cautious, restrained, respectful and deferential with regard to the highest judiciary. We highly disapprove of the manner and the language with which the offending article was written and warn the author that any repetition of the same will be | visited with punishment of even a greater scale, not to be condoned on any plea whatsoever.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ashak Kumar Karmaker Vs.

Many a times. The statements arc no doubt critical, in general, of the Courts and also of lawyers. The statements are also not accurate, factually. In matters of bait, the weaknesses in the process of investigation by the police, failure of the law officers appearing for the prosecution and the loopholes in the judgment delivery system as were pointed out in the submissions of the learned Counsels on both the sides were not reflected. Failure of the administration in handling the situation was also missing in the statements. But. the statements based on inaccurate assessments of situation, however gross misreading those may be. cannot be tantamount to be contempt of court. Moreover, in the absence of mens rea. no contempt is established.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mainul Hossain &amp; Ors. Vs.

But for taking this decision, an indefinite period cannot be allowed. The Government must take this decision within a reasonable period which may be 3 or 4 months but should not exceed six months. The Failure or refusal ipf the government to implement or give effect to the judgments and orders of the courts (even if these are declaratory in nature like those of the present case) within this reasonable periods amounts to wilful disobedience to or flouting of courts orders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Wahidul Haque Vs.
