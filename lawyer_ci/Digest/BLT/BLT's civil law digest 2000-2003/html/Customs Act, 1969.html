It is further notices that section25A) subsequently amended by E 16 of 1999 with effect from 1st July 1999) thatat the relevant time the section contained non-instinctive clause like"Notwithstanding anything contained to any other section this Act whichmeans that in included section 30A of the customs Act.

So the decision in51 DLR (AD) 40 appears to us to be not correctly decided due to the failure ofthe then Attorney General to point out the distinction between 42DLR(AD) 167and 48DLR(AD) 199 on the one hand end the case of Mustafizur Rahman on theother. Even he failed to bring to our notice the case of Khairul Bashar Vs.Collector of Customs. 50DER225 in which High Court Division correctly noticedthe distinction between exemption under Section 19 of the Act and declaration oftariff value under Section 25(7) of the Act and did not follow the ratiodecedent of 42 DLR (AD) 167 and 48 DLR (AD) 199 and held that importer acquiresno vested right in the invoice value or the tariff value existing at the timeof opening of letter of credit. We therefore review our opinion expressed inthat decision in 51 DLR (AD) 40 and hold that no vested right is acquired bythe importer to pay sales tax and custom duty on the basis of tariff valuedeclared by notification in force on the date of opening the letter of credit. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><b><i><span style='Cambria","serif"'>Bangladesh &amp; Ors.Vs.

Thoseprovisions have no manner of application in case of supply of spare parts,machineries, provisions and necessaries to a vessel in distress. Defendant No.1 was in distress condition at Mongla port and required the supply ofmachineries and spare parts for proper maintenance of the said vessel. It alsorequired provisions and laundry services for the use of its officers and crews.There is no legal bar to our knowledge in the Customs Act to the supply of suchgoods and services to the ship in distress and anchored at any port inBangladesh. Commissioner of Customs has been impleaded in the suit as defendantNo. 9 but he did not enter appearance nor raised any objection to the supply ofmachineries, spare parts, provisions and laundry services to the vessel by theplaintiff. His silence shows that the supply of above goods and services to ashop in distress was not objectionable. So the learned Judge of the High CourtDivision was not justified to refuse a decree to the plaintiff appellant on theground that the goods and services were not supplied with the approval of theCustoms officer on board the vessel.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><b><i><span style='Cambria","serif"'>Md.
