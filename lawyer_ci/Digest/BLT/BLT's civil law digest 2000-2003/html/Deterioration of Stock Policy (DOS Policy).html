If the expression "action' is construed as meaning "suit" only the expression 'action' becomes redundant. The meaning has to be construed strictly keeping in mind that the terms of the policy is drawn up by the insurer and the interest of the insured depends on the interpretation of the terms. The expression 'action' in the circumstances means and includes legal notice and not suit. The insured has taken action by making his claim through legal notice. We therefore do not agree with the High Court Division that the word "action' in clause 8(b) means only 'suit'.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Chalna Marine Products Ltd. Vs.
