Secondaryevidence was wrongly admitted without any cogent explanation. There was nostatement in the plaint or in the deposition that the originals were lost ordestroyed.  Further from the evidence onrecord it was found by the learned Judges of the High  CourtDivision that plaintiff Nos. 3. 4, 6 and 14 were not born at the time ofauction sale and as such the question of auction purchase in the name of unbornperson does not arise.  The learned Judgesthemselves also saw the photocopies Ext. 2 and 2a (as marked by lower appellatecourt) and found that those photocopies were different from those filed in thetrial court. The learned Judges or the High Court Division rightly reversed thefinding of the lower appellate court.

Thesale was set aside by the certificate officer and the lower appellate court didnot consider this aspect at all.
