Shafiqul Haque Vs.

The petitioner has already appeared and filed a written statement denying his marriage with her. He has got every opportunity to challenge the 'Kabinnama' and the solemnization of the marriage on the very same grounds on which he on 22.10.2000 filed Title suit No.296 of 2000 before a Subordinate Judge. Family Court has got every jurisdiction to decide as to whether the "Kabinnama" in question is a genuine and valid document or not and whether any marriage between the petitioner and Opposite Party No. 1 was ever solemnized or not before it decides to grant any decree for dower and /or maintenance. In such a suit for a decree for dower and/or maintenance, no declaration in respect of the "Kabinnama" or cancellation of the "Kabinnama" is at all necessary. Family Court therefore cannot be expected to wait for the final decision of a title suit on like issues as nobody can surely say when such title suit would find the end of the tunnel. Moreover, it would be acting to frustrate the very purpose of the Ordinance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md. Shafiqul Haque Vs.

The court of appeal below in the premises, has committed error of law in holding that the said dispute cannot be adjudicated upon by the family court. I am of the view that the family Court has rightly directed the defendant No. 1 to give 5 bighas of land as dower.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Most. Rowshan Ara Begum Chowdhury Vs.

The "Decision"' may be both interlocutory and final. The decision rendered by the Family Court is final decision/judgement setting the controversy and determining the rights of the parties in the suit on consideration of the facts, issues and legal aspect and the same is not an interlocutory order-a decree will be drawn up by the Family Court after the pronouncement of the judgement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ms. Farhat Rahman Vs.
