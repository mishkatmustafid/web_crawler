If the writ petitioner was aggrieved by the order of deduction from its bills it could immediately raise a dispute and refer the same for arbitration under clause 25 of the contract between itself and the said Board. The matter would have taken its usual course in terms of the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Chairman, Bangladesh Water Development Board &amp; Anr. Vs.
