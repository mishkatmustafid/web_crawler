Facts remain that the petitioner is entitled to the benefits allowed by the labour Court and we find no infirmity as to the claim as the petitioner is entitled to approach the labour court being the authority under Section 15 of the Payment of Wages Act. 1936 for realisation of his benefits, thus enforcing his right guaranteed or secured to him i.e. which are legally due upon his retirement from the service under the provision of Payment of Wages Act, 1936. It would operate as hardship and futile exercise of application of legal provision, if the heirs of the deceased workers are put to a protracted litigation afresh for realization of the benefits of their lather who after successful completion of 31 years service with the petitioner retired from the service. This Court can, as well for doing complete justice, in any cause treate the said application under Section 25(1)(b) as an application under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936 for realization of the benefits consequent upon retirement of the deceased worker.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>BWDB &amp; Ors.
