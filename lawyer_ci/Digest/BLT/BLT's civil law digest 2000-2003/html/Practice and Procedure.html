No. 128 of 1972 is an independent substantive and procedural provision regarding bar of entertainment of a suti on grounds different from those described in order VII. Rule 11 C.P.C. Article 34 (5) specifically lays down that if the prayers in the suit are of the description contained in Article 34 (5)(a)(i) or (ii) or (iii) then the suit will not be entertained. In an ordinary civil surt the plaint is rejected, inter alia, where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law". Therefore in an application under Order VII Rule 1 1 C.P.C. the statement in the plaint has to be looked into to determine if the suit is barred by any law. But under Article 34(5) it is not the statement in the plaint but the reliefs claimed in the suit under Artilce 3495) (a) (i) or (ii) of (iii) which will determine whether the suit is entertainable or not. Under Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. it is the statement in the plaint which is the determining factor, but under Article 34(5) it is the relief claimed which is the determining factor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangsta Vs.

It must follow aome guidelines which are germane to the Customs Act and not alien to it and should also pay heed to the recommendations of the Tariff commission when protective customs duty is involved. It is not necessary for the committee to invite all the importers and exporters of all imported and exported items to consider their papers and documents. The committee, as presently constituted, is representative enough to come to an objective decision. In coming to a decision in respect of each item the committee must have in its possession contemporaneous documents to how that the international market price of a particular item of import or export has either gone up or down during the interim period between the last meeting of the committee ant the impugned meeting—the guidelines followed by the committee as stated earlier are not extraneous and that those are germane to the Customs Act in determining tariff value.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>M/S.

And while they are still absconding the Government decided to withdraw from the prosecution which was allowed. It is now well settled that such withdrawal is subject to consent by the trial Judge and when the accused person are still absconding the discretion ought not to have been exercised by the Divisional Special Judge in the preset case.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Srimati Protiva Rani Dey (Tirtha) Vs.

It is the duty of all court to protect the sanctity of the due process of law. No body should be allowed to abuse the process of a court of law and to temper with the public justice system.

Or any one can bring the incident of contempt as an information to the notice of this Division. On consideration of the information if it prima facie appears that there has occasioned a contempt of court, this Division may take cognizance upon such report. The interview of the Prime Minister was reported in media, both electronic and print, throughout the length and breath of the country on 17 July. 2000. The Appellate Division as well as this Division did not to take any notice of such statements. One month thereafter, three applications, one after another were filed by three sets of people. It seems to me filed one application was not thought sufficient to break the slumber of the judiciary. With the equal trust but in larger number other two applications were also tabled to reject the motions. In the absence of anv law or rule, and in the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we could not refuse to hear the interveners. (Per Mr. Justice Md.

The High Court Division found that the Government had not taken a final decision in the light of the recommendation of the review forum and as such the review application filed is still pending cannot be accepted. The law on the point is clear. If the review authority find something to interfere with the decision passed under Martial Law Order No. 9 of 1982 then and then only the same may be recommended and not otherwise. There is nothing in the law to hold that the review authority is bound to intimate the petitioner of their decision.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Dr. Monoranjan Das Vs.

The plaintiff is to prove his case irrespective of the defence version of the case and from the materials on record it appears that the plaintiff failed to prove genuineness of their documents and also their possession. This aspect of the matter escaped the notice of the High Court Division in the aforesaid Second appeal and in such circumstances the finding of the High Court Division is wrong and cannot be sustained.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Golzar Ali Pramanik Vs.

Some 400 students have been prosecuting their studies in the University. The said respondent has fulfilled most of the conditions required under the Act. And the Grants Commission, as a matter of fact, has also given their opinion in favour of according permission to respondent No.1 Univeristy. Private Universities under similar conditions have already been granted provisional permission and they have been functioning under administrative orders of the Government. In the circumstances permission in the nature of administrative order in respect of this university seems to be a formality which should be forthcoming form the Government in no time in accordance with the application dated 21 May 1995 and the law then in force and in terms of the letter of the Grants Commission dated 14 October 1997.<br/><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bangladesh &amp; Ors.

If any law provides for any remedy to any wrong done in respect of anything in exercise of power under that law by creating a forum ordinarily that remedy is to be availed of by the aggrieved person. Writ petition is an extraordinary remedy provided by the High Court Division to an aggrieved person when no other equally efficacious remedy is provided by law to him because whenever there is a wrong done to a person he should have a remedy against the same.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bangladesh &amp; Ors.

That apart the Rule was not ready for hearing as the substitution petition was pending for disposal. Further, from the impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division it appears that there was total non-application of judicial mind to those material facts.
