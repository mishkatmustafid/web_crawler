This is thecorrect and legalistic position, but during the rush that follows a briskpolling it may not be possible for Presiding Officer or the Assistant PresidingOfficer to follow Article 31(2)(d)(e) in its full letter and spirit and theymay have to opt for satisfying the said Article in substance by putting theofficial mark on the back of the ballot papers leaving a part of the officialmark in the ballot paper and the remaining part of the same in the back of thecounterfoil. If, however, the ballot paper does not contain any official mark,either in part or in full the Presiding Officer has no option but to exclude itfrom count. The impression of a part of the official seal on the back of aballot paper is a shortening of the elaborate procedure under Article31(2)(d)(e) under pressure of circumstances. We repeat what we stated in thecase of Abdul Matin Ms. flection Tribunal, 31 DLR (AD) 331. "The standardof care which is required with such strictness as in putting the official markand initial may, due to bonalide error, tall short but that should not effectthe valuable right of franchise" and further "It cannot be that thelegislature requires a voter to be vigilant regarding the performance of dutiesby the Government functionaries". We, therefore, hold that the Tribunalwas justified in not excluding the ballot papers from counting which containeda part of the official seal, because the law has not demanded in a mandatorylanguage the presence of a full seal on the ballot paper before its exclusionfrom count.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><b><i><span style='Cambria","serif"'>Mou.

Neither the Tribunal northe High Court Division has any jurisdiction to add any other extraneousrequirement other tlltlll those contained in sub-clause (i)-(iv) of Clause (4)of Article 36. These sub-clauses do not require that a ballot paper is to beexcluded from the count if it does not contain the Code number or the signatureor initial of the Assistant Presiding Officer. The High Court Division actedwithout jurisdiction in excluding the ballot papers of both the appellant andthe election-petitioner containing the aforesaid omissions. Further, from theelection petition we do not find that the election-petitioner made anyallegation as to the illegal counting of votes by the Presiding Officer of CharBaleswar polling centre. We have quoted the points for determination by theflection Tribunal. There is no point for determination on illegal counting ofvotes at Char Baleswar polling centre. The election -petitioner raised otherspecific allegations in connection with the centre and the Tribunalspecifically found those allegations not to have been proved. In suchcircumstances, the recounting of votes of Char Baleswar polling centre wasuncalled for and without jurisdiction and was an unnecessary roving fcexercise. The High Court Division did not apply its mind to the contendingissues between the parties. Its rejection of the valid ballot papers of theapplicant at Char Baleswar polling centre without even seeing them was whollywithout jurisdiction and its rejection of valid ballot papers of the appellantat Bhairampur polling station was also without j urisdiction.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><b><i><span style='Cambria","serif"'>Mou.

Thusthe Election Commission has got the authority to decide the matter. Withoutentering into the question as to whether the authority exercised by the ActingChief Election Commissioner is a quasi judicial order or an order in itsadministrative capacity, it can be safely said that there was no delegation by theElection Commission itself to perform such function under the Order we are ofthe view that the Acting Chief Election Commissioner had acted Coram non judicein exercising his power in this particular case.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><b><i><span style='Cambria","serif"'>Jatiya Party Vs.Election Commission &amp; Ors. 10 BLT(AD)-4</span></i></b></p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span> </div></div>
