Thus it appears that the payment of bonus made by the assessee is hit by the proviso to section 10(2)(x) of the Act. Therefore it appears that both the A.J.C.T and the 'Tribunal taking a correct view of law and facts upheld the decision of the D.C.I. Therefore we are of the opinion that the payment of Six months bonus was unjustified.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>M/S Dacca Ware House Ltd. Vs.

Therefore, our answer it that the Tribunal was not justified in the facts and circumstances of the case to disallow the amount of Tk. 58,500.00 which has been spent for replacement of the compressor and the same appears to be a revenue expenditure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>M/S Dacca Ware House Ltd.

XXIII of 1973 Section-3</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">By notification No. HCD-37/73/950/1973 all workers of the Sector Corporation were allowed festival and incentive bonus and since the respondent assessee paid the bonus to the employees as per provision of the Government under the provision of the above Ordinance and notification, the question of earning profit of bonus did not arise. We are in agreement with the view expressed by the High Court Division. As payment of bonus to employees is incentive for service rendered by them, such payment of bonus as directed by the government is not dependent on profit.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Commissioner of Taxes &amp; Ors.
