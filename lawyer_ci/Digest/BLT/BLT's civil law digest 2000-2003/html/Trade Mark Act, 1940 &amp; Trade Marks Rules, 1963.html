Thus, it appearsthat prima facie there is no phonetical or visual resembleness between themarks applied for and the registered mark. It further appears that at thehearing stage before the Registrar the appellant expressed their desire todelete the device of coat of arms from their lebel and in that view of thematter it appears to as that the Registrar ought to have proceed with theapplications for registration after allowing the appellant to delete the deviceof coat of arms from their lebel.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><b><i><span style='Cambria","serif"'>Sudhir Kanti Shil Vs.Registrar of Trade Marks 9 BLT(HCD)-74.</span></i></b></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif"'> </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style='Cambria","serif"'>Section-14(1) read with Trade Marks Rules, 1963 Rule-24(1)</span></b></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif"'>In the present case theelements of rule 25(1) are missing and as such the instant appeal ismaintainable without any grounds of decision. In the instant case in responseto the notice served upon him under Section 14(1) of the Act the appellant didnot take any steps whatsoever till the impugned order was passed by theRegistrar and in that view of the matter it appears that the Registrar outstepped his authority in disposing the same on merits on the,ground that themark offends the provision of Section 10(1) and 8(a) of the Act. In the factsand circumstances of the case the Registrar ought to have resorted to rule24(1) and treat the application as abandoned. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><b><i><span style='Cambria","serif"'>Md.
