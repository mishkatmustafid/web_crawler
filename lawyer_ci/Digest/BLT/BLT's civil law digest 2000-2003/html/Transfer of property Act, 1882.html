He inquired at least in the local Sub-Registrar's office to know if the land had any charge or encumbrance or not to establish his bona fide. He would naturally try to gel all the documents of title and possession from his vendor. Onus is very heavy on him. There is no onus on the otherside — the defendants 1 and 2 pleaded that they were bona fide purchasers for value without notice of the Ekrarnama. But they did neither plead nor lead any evidence that they took any steps to ascertain the title of their vendor, defendant 3 or their purchased land. i.e. the suit land did not have any charge or encumbrance. They did not make any inquiry even in the local registration office. They did not want to get the documents of title or possession. In their deeds, exhibit A(2) and A(3) though executed and registered about four years apart. It is written in verbatim, to trace the title the defendant 3 is Lwi` m~‡Î gvwjK `Lj`vi I gvwjK e‡U| This vital fact of purchase from the plaintiff was deliberately suppressed exhibits A(2) and A(3, Purpose was very clear, not to divulge the knowledge about the Ekrarnama.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In his deposition, defendant 1 as DW-1 stated that the plaintiff transferred the land to the defendant 3 by an out and out sale. In cross examination, he admitted that defendant 3 on being asked told him that the original Kabala was lying with the plaintiff. He did not try to obtain the Kabala. Defendant 2 as DW-2 deposed in the same vein that original Kabala was with the plaintiff and he did not try to get the Kabala. Both of them however, stated that they purchased seeing the copy of the Kabala, But they did not adduce the copy to probe their bona fide.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Mrs. Wahida Begum &amp; Ors.

The finding of the trial court that the deed of re-conveyance is hit by doctrine of lis pendents under section -52 of the Transfer of Property Act was rightly arrived at.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Jahangir Alam Vs.

But, Exts. Uma seris clearly show those were issued during the Pendency of the proceeding for pre-emption. If it is so, such mutation or subdivision is not based on any lawful order of a Revenue officer. Because the order admittedly obtained without service of notice upon the pre-emptor and his brothers and sisters must be also hit by the doctrin of lis pendans under Section 52 of the transfer of property Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Harunur Rashid Vs.

The law permits for such a document.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Asmat Ali Vs.

In that view of the matter allowing more that one months notice to determine the tenancy has not contravened any of the provision of the Transfer of property Act or the terms of Ext. 1 as there was no alteration or variation thereof and the same is valied compliance with the agreement between the parties and thus the notice determining the tenancy is also a valid one.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sontosh Mukar Das Vs.

In a case of forfeiture of tenancy for denial of title, written notice of lessor's intention to determine the lease is not compulsory and must be optional as the notice is not a part of the cause of action for such eviction and that the cause of action is the denial of the landlord's title resulting determination of the tenancy by forfeiture.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Zohra Khatton &amp; Ors.

In view of such facts, though the suit land was recorded in the name of the defendants, I am of the opinion that such record will not stand on the way in getting a decree by the plaintiffs in the suit since the plaintiffs have acquired a heritable, non-ejectable right in the suit land, particularly when the said S.A. record which was prepared after I960, after the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act 1949 came into force. I am further of the view that the plaintiffs have acquired a right which cannot be said anything less than title in the suidand.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ramjan Mia &amp; Ors.
