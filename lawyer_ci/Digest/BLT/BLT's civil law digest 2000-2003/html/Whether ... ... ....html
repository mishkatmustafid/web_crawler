The lower appellate court further held that in respect of the acquired land, the court cannot direct the Government to lease out the suit land to the plaintiffs simply because their predecessors-in-interest as the original owners had been in possession even after acquisition. It does not appear either from the judgment of the trial court or from the lower appellate court that the plaintiffs had ever made out any ease under section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, namely that no award regarding compensation for acquisition of the land was prepared by the Government or the original owners did not receive any compensation for acquisition in question. It appears that the learned Judge of the High Court Division upon making out a third case, on consideration of section 16 of the said Act. has wrongly reversed the decree of the lower appellant court and decreed the suit wrongly holding, inter alia, that although the land had been acquired by the Government as far back as in 1941 the same did not absolutely vest in the Government free from all encumbrance because the Government did not take physical possession thereof in pursuance of the acquisition in question. Moreover the learned Judge of the High Court Division was not justified in considering the trial court's finding that defendant No.l is a monthly tenant in respect of the suit land, overlooking that the lower appellate court rightly held that the plaintiffs, who have no right, title and interest in the suit land, had no legal authority to induct defendant No.l as a monthly tenant in the suit land.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Govt of Bangladesh &amp; Ors.

The learned Jude in so holding rightly relied upon the decision in the case of Akhlasur Rahman &amp; ors. Vs. Safarullah &amp; ors. 14 BLD(AD) 20. In Akhlasur Rahman this Division held "that the right (right of preemption) can be waived or relinquished at an earlier date than on date of actual completion of sale under the law or thereafter".

The contesting defendant did not challenge the genealogy as asserted by the plaintiffs. In that view of the matter, the final curt of fact recorded a finding that after settlement and transfer Taherun Nessa retained .04 decimals of land in the jote and that the plaintiffs being the heirs of Taherun Nessa are in ejmali position in facts it is not necessary that the plaintiffs is to pray for declaration of title the recovery of possession but a simple suit for partition is quite maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abdul Malek Khan &amp; Ors.
