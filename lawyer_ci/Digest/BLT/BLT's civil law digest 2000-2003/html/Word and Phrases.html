Keeping these principles in view we are of the opinion that the provision of Order 1 1, Ride 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure is directory in character and the court is yet possessed of powers to extend time in a proper case.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bisheswar Bhattacharjee Vs, Shantimoy Bhattacharjee &amp; Ors 8BLT(AD)-61</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bonafide requirement</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The expression "Bonafide requirement" connots an element of "must have" which the petitioner failed to prove.

The Rule is derived from the Roman law and is supportable not only on the Ground of fairness but also upon that on the greater practical difficulty which is involved in proving a negative than in proving an affirmative.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>S.

The principal object behind all legal formalities is to safeguarded these paramount interest of justice and mere technicalities unless offering an insurmountable hurdle should not be allowed to defeat the ends of justice. The English system of administration of justice on which our own is based may be to a certain extent technical but the defect of that system should not be taken too strict—adherence to procedure defeats course of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>S.

Custody of Title deed came from the side of defendant opposite party. In the original plaint there was no statement as to the custody of Title deed. The plaintiff as P.W. 1 on 18.04.1994 on the witness box in anwer to a question stated that he would produce Title deed subsequently. The reply is produce here in verbatim D³ `wjj c‡i Rgv w`e Record manifests that subsequently by way of an amendment which was allowed by the court on 30.04.1994 statement was incorporated that the wife of defendant took away the said Title deed from the wife of the plaintiff with the plea that the same would be returned back but the said Title deed was not returned back, From this, the point had been crystallized that the attempt made by the plaintiff to explain custody of Title deed was very much an afterthought matter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>S.

It is to be issued in aid of justice and not to aid injustice. Temporary injunction is mere provisional in its nature and its sole object is to preserve the subject matter in controversy without determining the rights of the parties and to prevent the doing of an act whereby the subject matter of the right in the suit property or controversy may be in danger.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Abu Mohammad Yousuf &amp; Ors.

Granting of revenue holiday to the plaintiff involving crores of taka without and justifiable reason is a classic example of wanton discrimination and mis-use of discretion in managing the affairs of the state. The publie functionaries must be cautious in doling out charities by way of granting revenue holidays to individuals or establishments against public interest. The question of transparency and public accountability cannot be ignored at the pleasure of an individual or a group of individuals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Expert Engineering Vs.

They knew that their country is not rich but expected that social justice shall be established and the people shall be provided with the bare minimum necessarities of life the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh envisages a welfare state and makes all citizens have got equal rights in every sphere of life including food, shelter, healthcare, education and so forth which is of fundamental in nature.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Kalam and Ors.

The Courts all over the world in deciding an issue give importance always to the overall interest of the people at large which commensurate with sense of social justice in a welfare state.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Bangladesh Soya Protein Project Ltd.

None of the fundamental rights like rule of law is subject to mechanical measurement. They are measured in our human institution i.e. the courts and by human beings i.e. the Judges by applying law. Therefore, there will always be an element of discretion to be used by the court in giving standing to the petitioner, from the above, it appears that the courts of this jurisdiction has shifted its position to a great extent from the traditional rule to standing which confines' access to the judicial process only to those to whom legal injuries caused or legal wrong is done. The narrow confines within which the rule of standing was imprisoned for long years have been broken and new dimension is being given to the doctrine of locus standi.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>ETV Ltd.

In order to complete the negotiation, the concerned bank must make the necessary payment against the draft and /or the documents. This incident of payment made the bank which received the documents a negotiating bank, without which the said bank would not be a negotiating bank but may be a collecting bank to collect the payment from the issuing bank as an agent of the seller—the word 'negotiation' clearly envisages the purchase of draft and documents by the concerned bank, even a promise to pay at a later date, would not do there must be a corresponding payment to the beneficiary on receipt of the draft and the documents by the concerned bank, to make it a negotiating bank.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>National Bank Ltd.

If the holding is recorded in the name of more than one person, then, each of such person to his succession-in-interest is the co-sharer to each other in such land. Such a Co-sharer will deem of continue as such co-owner in both holding as well as in land so long holding will continue to be joint. [Para-21]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>S.S.

BADC. 11 BLT (AD)-151</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Public interest Litigation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The nature of public interest litigation (Called PIL hereinafter) is completely different from a traditional case which is adversarial in nature where PH. is intended to vindicate rights of the people. In such a case benefit will be derived by a large number of people in contrast to a few. PI I. considers the interest of others and therefore, the court in a public interest litigation acts as the guardian of all the people whereas in a private case the court does not have such power. Therefore, in public interest litigation the court will lean to protect the interest of the general public and the rule of law vis-a-vis the private interest.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>E.T.V.

(AD)-18</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contempt of Court</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Contempt of Court has not been defined either in the constitution or in any other statute, but there has been judicial interpretation thereof. Proceedings for contempt are initiated for the purpose of protecting the image and dignity of the court itself. The purpose of proceedings in contempt of court is to keep the stream of justice unsullied and to maintain the confidence of the public at large in the fair and impartial administration of justice by the court of law in a proceedings under contempt there cannot be both justification and an apology.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md.

The condition of womenfolk has also improved in the rural areas to a great extent both in education and social perspective. This process, hopefully will continue. A daughter is not pardanashin if she can read and write and if she can not read and write, that is a course upon the parents and the society.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Moulana Ruhul Mannan Helali Vs.

An expectation to become legitimate therefore should not be shorn of lawful begetting. The concept of legitimate expectation cannot be given such wide interpretation so as to allow any wishful hope without lawful root. In the instant case we have found that as a result of mere recommendation of the petitioner to the government for selection as the best Chairman of the district, he is said to have entertained an expectation not based on any legal ground neither borne out by lawful begetting and as such his expectation, however firm it was. cannot be termed to be legitimate expectation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Md Hajizul Islam Vs.

It literally means without a name, that is nameless or fictitious and is to denote a transaction which is really done by a person without using his own name That is. not in the name of real purchaser, but in the name another. In every such benami transaction there are three persons concerned; the vendor, the real purchaser and the name lender.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ali Azam Vs.

In the alleged transaction it appears that the name of the real purchaser as well as his alleged benamder are appeared in the kabala deed. So apparently the instant transaction is not a benami transaction within the meaning of the words 'benami' "benamder" and "benami transaction."</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Ali Azam Vs.

It gives an opportunity the journalist and the people to express their personal views on subjects of their having public interest. Through these, they can ventilate their grievances and demand redress. The newspaper is the best means through which the Government may know it defects in administration and so correct its ways for well being of the people. It is one of the very important things in the life of a civilized nation. It is the medium through which public opinion expresses itself. The press is free to after criticism on the functioning of the court or its officials as the very idea of the open the British System is to make it appear to the world at large to how the courts of the country are functioning. We believe that in this modern world, news media is one of the strong pillar which furnishes information of loopholes of the administration and its machineries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Daily Star &amp; Protham Aloq Partika Vs 'The State. 9BLT (HCD)-91</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>"Whoever marries"</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section-494 of the Penal Code Act, 1860— the world "whoever marries appearing" in the section must mean whoever marries validly.

Further, Section 5 of Act II of 1947 speaks of the offences as mentioned in the schedule of the Act to be tried by Special Judges.

For a remedy is also right in the wider sense of the word, a secondary right, a remedial or procedural right as it is often called, and limitation undoubtedly extinguishes -such a procedural right. A person can enforce his substantive right, even though time barred, if there are other legal remedies available for the enforcement of the same. But, in the present case the remedy being enforceable in law and there being no remedy available under the law, this primary or substantive right of the plaintiff was lost by the law of limitation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Idris Ali Bhuiyan Vs.
