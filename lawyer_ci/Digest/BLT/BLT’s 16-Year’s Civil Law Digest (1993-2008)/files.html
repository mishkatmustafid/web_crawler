By order dated 26.05.92 the learned District Judge transected the case to the Court of the Subordinate Judge Arbitration Court at Dhaka who was for the first time found in appeal that he did not have such authority to dispose the case.

It may be noted that any person may apply for the certificate but it is always expected that an heir of the deceased should make the application. A succession certificate is not the final adjudication of the question as to who is the next heir and as such, entitled to the estate of the deceased. Granting of a certificate merely clothed the holder with an authority only to recover the debts of the deceased and to give valid discharge. In law nomination or declaring one as the next of kin for official record does not operate as a transfer or assignment of the securities or debts, or more particularly the estate of the deceased. Similarly, aw decided in the case of Krishnamacharia v Venkatamma, ILR 36 Madras 214 and that of in re Estate of C V Nayagan, 1936 Rang 466, the Court is always empowered to grant a succession certificate to a minor on his application through his mother.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Muhaiminul Hassan Khan Vs.

The nature and function of the Artha Rin Adalat coupled with its power and authority clearly indicate that it is a special forum of limited jurisdiction and not an ordinary civil court right to review like the right of appeal is a substantive right and not a mere matter of procedure — the power to review is not an inherent power. It must be conferred by law either specifically or by necessary implication no application for review under Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure lies in the Artha Rin Adalat. The review application was not entertainable by the Artha Rin Adalat and as such, incompetent.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sultan Alam Vs Rupali Bank 2BLT (HCD)-l 18</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-2(Ka) read with Bangladesh Commerce Bank Ltd. [Act No. XII of 1997]</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section —13</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Though Bangladesh Commerce and Investment Limited was neither a financial institution nor a commercial bank but even then sanctioned loan to the defendant No.1 and so the entire transaction being illegal suit does not lie; as contended by the learned counsel for the Petitioners —The High Court Division observed that section 2(Ka) of Artha Rin Adalat Ain (Act IV of 1990) defines “Financial Institution” as a financial institution licensed under the Financial Institution Act, 1993 and the Preamble of Act XII of 1997 clearly states the reason for reconstitution of the erstwhile Bangladesh Commerce and Investment Limited as it, being a non-banking financial institution licensed by the Bangladesh Bank, functioned to the detriment of the interest of the depositors and customers and so the erstwhile Bangladesh Commerce and Investment Limited was a licensed financial institution within the meaning of section 2(ka) of Artha Rin Adalat Ain; besides under section 13 of the above Act 12 of 1997 all assets and liabilities of erstwhile Bangladesh Commerce and Investment Limited vested in the newly constituted respondent No. I and the newly constituted respondent No.1, being a financial institution within the meaning of Artha Rin Adalat Ain, the Adalat committed no error in taking the view that Bangladesh Commerce Bank Limited was re-constituted by Act XII of 1997 as a commercial bank and the defendants having taken loan from its predecessor i.e. Bangladesh Commerce and Investment Bank/ the suit was filed before the Adalat was maintainable —Held; It is thus evident that Act 12 of 1997 covered the loan which was granted by Commerce Bank and Investment Limited to the defendant No.1. Further the above Commerce Bank and Investment Limited, which became defunct in the year 1992 did not file the above suit. So we are of the view that the High Court Division on applying the principle of law as applicable in the present case arrived at a correct decision which does not suffer from any illegality or infirmity so as to call for any interference.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M/s.

Applying this proposition in the facts of the instant case as set out in the plaint there seems to be no escape from the conclusion that the defendant has a debt to the plaintiff which is concurrently found to be a financial institution and that being so it must be held that the suit filed by the plaintiff in the Artha Rin Adalat for realizing the said debt which is a ‘loan’; under Section 2 (Kha) is quite maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Saudi Bangladesh Ind. &amp; Ors Vs.

It also appears from the averments made in the plaint and the papers placed on the record that said loans were given to the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 to enable them to lift the fertilizer which they have purchased in advance from the defendant Nos.3 and 4 who got the allotment of the fertilizer from defendant No.7. In our opinion upon making advance sale of the fertilizer the defendant Nos.3 and 4 had hardly anything to do except facilitating the defendant Nos. l and 2 to lift the fertilizer, which the defendant Nos.3 and 4 did as regard the fertilizer in question. From the papers on the record it is seen that the defendant Nos.3 and 4 to make the agreement of advance sale fruitful they did everything to enable the Bank and the defendant Nos.1 and 2 to lift the fertilizer from Respondent No.7 —Held; In the background of the materials on record and the discussions made hereinbefore in our view it cannot be said that defendant Nos.3 and 4 obtained loan from the Bank or received any financial facilities from the Bank and that they are also not the guarantors in respect of the loan made available by the defendant Nos.

The Section 33 of P.O. 129 of 1972 provides for entertainment of such application only by the District Judge, who is given the exclusive jurisdiction to deal with such application for realization of respondents due money.

P.C. lies for rejection of that counterclaim and whether a writ petition or civil revisional application will lie to the High Court Division, A defendant cannot claim in a written statement a set off or counterclaim against the plaintiff in a suit filed under the Artha Rin Adalat Act. The bar to claim a set off or counterclaim is not expressly contained in the Artha Rin Adalat Act, but it is implied-ly contained in section 5(1) read with section-2 (ka), 2 (kha) and sections-5(4) and 5(5) thereof. Although the effect of a set off or counterclaim is that of a plaint in a cross suit, Order-7, Rule-11, C.P.C will not apply in rejecting such set off or counterclaim. Plaintiff may have recourse to section 151 of the C.P.C. for such rejection. Alternatively, plaintiff may bring the maintainability of the set off or counterclaim as an issue of law under Order 14 Rule 2 C.P.C. which may be decided first. In view of the paten inadmissibility of the counterclaim within the framework of Adalat Act, plaintiffs application under Order-7 Rule -Il can be treated as one under Section- 151 C.P.C.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sultana Jute Mills Ltd.

Section-7 of the ARA Act provides for a Special Period of Limitation of 30 days for preferring an appeal against the judgment of the decree of the ARA. The cross-objection filed beyond thirty days, was rightly rejected by the High Court Division as time barred— in view of Section-6 of the ARA Act a defendant can only challenge the decree of the ARA by filing an appeal under Section-7 of the Act—and is liable to pay necessary court fee and observe other formalities—the petitioners arc not entitled to file any cross objection. under Order-4 I, Rule-22 of the Code of Civil Procedure—the petitions are dismissed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M.

Placing is the cause, vesting is the consequence. If placing goes, vesting also falls through. So whether it is Article 10(1A) or Article 4(a), the result is the same. If there is a lawful placing, vesting takes place under Article 10(IA) and a double vesting takes place under Article4(1). But if the placing itself was unlawful, the vesting did not take place, either under Article-l0(1A) or under Article-4(l).

Sub-Rule 3(g) was nothing new as identicalprovision was already there in the general principle of the seniority, 1970.This incorporation in the BCS Seniority Rules 1983 was necessary to fulfill legalrequirement as it has protected the seniority of all officers of all cadresbelonging to first BCS examination not only of respondent Nos. 2-61. Therefore,sub-rule 3(g) was incorporated not only to give benefit to respondent Nos.2-61. Further, the President is clearly empowered under the provision ofArticle 133 to make rules prospectively and retrospectively and in that view itcannot be argued that Rule 3(9) of Rule 1982 cannot apply retrospectively inthe case of respondents who were appointed in 1984 and the appellants who wereappointed in 1983 and Rule 3(g) was not applicable with retrospective effect inthe case of the appellants and the respondents.

All the members of the committee and the Academic Council unanimously approved the decisions taken by the Disciplinary Committee—High Court Division held that the respondents having not been given any opportunity to show cause to explain the allegations made against them, there has been a violation of the principle of natural justice in awarding the punishment of expulsion forever and as such the said punishment cannot be legally sustained—Held : We have considered the whole situation, particularly the concern of the college authorities to maintain congenial atmosphere in the college and hospital for which the impugned action was said to be taken. Even so, we have not been able to persuade ourselves to agree that the respondents have been fairly treated to the authority before imposing. So to say, a kind of death sentence as far as their educational career is concerned—we find no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><strong>M.

The case of the plaintiff opposite party is that he got the suit property from his father Poyer Mamud Mondal and fufu Powchhari Bibi by way of settlement on obtaining dakhilas in the year of 1345 B.B., which facts are stoutly denied by the present petitioners. It has been contended in the application under Order I Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure that the original tenants Poyer Mamud Mondal and Powchhari Bibi never settled the suit land with the plaintiff and the plaintiffs claim of title by way of settlement is false. It has further been asserted that as co-owners of the suit property by inheritance like the plaintiff the petitions have been owning and possessing the suit property in ejmali. It was also contended in no uncertain terms that the plaintiffs’ papers in respect of the alleged settlement are totally false and fabricated. It thus appears that vital interests of the petitioners are involvement in the suit and they have definite say in the adjudication of the suit and they are interested in the result of the suit for declaration of title in the suit land.

Thereafter on July 10, 1988 plaintiff filed petition seeking amendment of the plaint by inserting some facts as well as an additional relief i.e. b (1) seeking declaration that the deeds bearing Nos.l6157 and 16158 dated 27.10.1969 showing transfer of the property at 62 BCC Road to Ali Ahmed Khandker and Wali Mohammad Siddiqui by Jatindra Mohon Roy alias Sachindra Mohon Roy is forged, fabricated and that the transfers by the said Ali Ahmed Khandker and Wali Mohammad Siddiqui, to the defendant Nos.1 and 2 are illegal and not binding on the plaintiff. This prayer for amendment was allowed on November 19, 1988 —the plaintiff having had realized that in the absence of a declaration as was sought for in relief (b) (1) the other reliefs prayed for in the suit even if granted would not be complete one and thus the plaintiff having had sought for relief against the recipients of the deeds dated October 27, 1969 the recipients thereof were required to be made party and having had not impleaded the recipients of the deeds of October 27, 1969 the suit was certainly bad for defect of party so far the same concerned with relief (b)(1).</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A N M W Nabi &amp; Anr Vs.

In a suit for declaration of title it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove his exclusive possession. There is nothing on record to show that the plaintiff is in possession upon any portion of the suit land. Admittedly the plaintiff was a co-shaerer to the suit holding. Order 2 Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that every suit shall include the whole of the claim which the plaintiff is entitled to make in respect of the cause of action but a plaintiff may relinquish any portion of his claim in order to bring the suit within the jurisdiction of any Court. Thus in the instant suit, the plaintiff being not in possession ought to have sought two relieves, one for declaration of ejmali possession with defendant and thereafter for partition by metes and bounds in the suit land. That has not been done in the instant suit.

The return of acknowledgement dues with postal endorsement clearly showed that notices were refused by the defendants. It is on record that along with service of summons, simultaneously notices with postal acknowledgement dues were sent in the correct addresses of the defendants. Apart from this, the defendants stated that they came to know about the ex parte decree from one Dinabandhu in presence of Rabindra Nath Biswas but curiously enough the said Dinabandhu was not examined by the defendants.

At the time of trial the plaintiff made out a case that his father had taken the lease for his (plaintiff’s) benefits and interest during his infancy. The departure in the evidence from the plaint has not been of such a dimension that the defendants were unfairly taken by surprise. The defendants suffered these evidence to be taken.

The plaintiff has not denied the execution of the joint declaration with defendant no. 2 on 01.08.1991 nor he was denied his liability to pay for the period from 01.08.1991 period either before 01.08.1991 or after 03.02.1993 and the relief sought for in the plaint is sufficient to address its grievances. The proposed amendment to add further of C-I, that the joint declaration dated 01 .08.1991 to be declared void ab inition and be cancelled and C-III that, defendant No.2 and/or no 3 to be declared liable and responsible to pay the money to be assessed by Defendant No. 1 in different adjudication orders on the basis of Import General Manifest are not at all necessary for adjudication of the aforesaid real issues. Further relief of C-II for a money decree for a sum of Taka 3,90,735 and C-IV a decree of mandatory injunction directing defendant No. 2 and 3 to pay the penalty and other amount to be assessed by Defendant No. 1 are equally not necessary. Because if the plaintiff succeeds to fix the responsibility of Defendant No. 1 and or No. 3 and gets a decree accordingly then, pursuant to the decree the Defendant No. 1 would be obliged to return gets a decree realized from the plaintiff on 07.02.1999 and would need no mandate from the court to realize the dues from the agent found responsible. Besides, in view of the principles enunciated in the above cited Messers Malik &amp; Haq and another V. Muhammad Shamsul Islam Gopal Das V Mul Raj in a suit for a decree of declaration an amendment for adding further relief of a money decree cannot be allowed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bangladesh Shipping Lines Ltd.

The plaintiff also sought to include certain facts relating to filing 10 case in the Courts and also sought to include facts relating to death of plaintiff’s father John Gomez leaving behind 2 daughters, sons and wife and the said sons were minors. The plaintiff also claimed to include that they acquired title in the suit land by adverse possession also and sought to amend the valuation of the plaint at Tk. 40,000/- in place of Tk. 2,000/- and to pay advalorem court fees. The plaintiffs also sought to include a prayer for declaration of their title on the basis of adverse possession. On a perusal of the Statements sought to be included in the plaint by way of amendment it does not appear that such amendment would in any way change the nature and character of the suit or the proposed amendment are in any way barred by any law. The proposed amendment may be inconsistent with the plaint case as made out by the plaintiff but that will not disentitle to plaintiff to an order of amendment of the plaint.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Elezabeth &amp; Ors.

The amendment so sought and allowed by the trial Court has completely changed the color of the claim of pre-emption and thereupon after closure of evidence pre-emption is sought on a new ground.

The said application was allowed in part allowing the prayer for adding declaration of title but rejecting the prayer for amendment incorporating the prayer that the decree in Other Suit No.26 of 1983 is fraudulent, void and not binding upon the plaintiff on the ground that the suit is beyond the pecuniary jurisdiction, of the learned Subordinate Judge.

It is, also, to be remembered that amendment must not alter the fundamental character of the suit, that is, the edifice on which the suit is based.

Save and except the said assertion there is no other case brought before the Court for getting an order for appointment of receiver. The order of status quo in respect of possession was passed on contest on 13.4.1999 and that after that order the plaintiff being in possession was receiving rent from the shop keepers and that he took an attempt to repair shops. The defendant-opposite parties being not in physical possession and having accepted the order of status quo in respect of possession in the suit shops were not entitled to make application for appointment of receiver long after about 7 years of the status quo order was passed. Order-40 Rules 1(2) is clear bar in allowing the prayer for appointment of receiver.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

Such order as has been passed under the impugned judgment and order is not an order of dismissal of appeal rather it is a final order setting aside the order of status quo passed by the trial court without giving an opportunity to the respondent to which she was entitled to.

As the High Court Division remanded the case for fresh trial with liberty to the parties to adduce evidence to prove their cases the order of remand was made legally we do not find that the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division occasioned any failure of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Amal Bhushan Singha Vs, Khalokuzzaman. &amp; Ors. 7BLT (AD)-311</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Order-41 Rule-23</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Remand—We hold that the Division Bench ought to have either dismissed the appeal for default or ought to have adjourned it to some other date as it was a part-heard appeal or could have passed other orders but it was certainly not authorised to consider the appeal in the absence of the appellant and decide it on merits.

We also find that the application by the respondent under Order I Rule 10 of the Code has not yet been disposed of. It is also a fact that the alleged existence of a daughter of Khairunnessa was canvassed for the first time before the High Court Division and that also without any support of evidence. Again, all throughout haziras were filed before the trial court on behalf of the deceased defendant Khairunnessa till 20 July 1985 when Nurul Islam made an application disclosing her death. It is obvious that the plaintiff had no inkling of the death of Khairunnessa till 20 July 1985. It is only in or about the middle of November, 1985 that the plaintiff seems to have the definite knowledge of the death of Khairunnessa without leaving any heir behind. He then came up with an application on 17 November 1985 praying for amendment of the plaint by way of substituting the Government for Khairunnessa. The learned Assistant Judge, however passed an order on 22 December 1985 recording of abatement of the suit. The plaintiff made the application for setting aside the abatement after the order was passed on 22 December 1985 which is within 14 days of the order. The learned Judge of the High Court Division completely overlooked these facts and set aside the order of the learned Assistant Judge dated 13 August 1987. The learned Single Judge laid unnecessary stress upon certain averments in the written statement which were only matters of contest between the parties at the trial and hart no bearing upon the abatement.

It was the case of the plaintiffs that land described in schedule ‘Kha accreted in 1935 to the C.S. Plots. If that assertion of the plaintiffs is accepted then it would have been quite natural to have the mention of the accreted land in the kabalas of the years between 1943 and 1968 and there would been mention of said fact upon referring to the plot(s) to which there was accretion of land and the quantity thereof, but conspicuously in the deeds of the years 1943- 1968 there is no mention of the plot of the accreted land nor quantity of land accreted to particular C.S. plot and also there is no mention of quantity as stated hereinbefore. It was the definite case of the defendants that there was no existence of accreted land till 1963 i.e. at the time when the S.A. record was made final. Had there been any accretion of land to the C. S. plot during S. A. survey the same would have surely been recorded in the S.A. Record which was published on 1.8.1963. In the aforesaid state of the matter it has been observed by the trial Court that there was no reason to believe that the accreted land was in existence in 1963. It may be mentioned that during the period between 1935-1947 no rent was paid by the plaintiffs in respect of the land said to have accreted to the C.S. plots — The trial Court on consideration of the entire materials on record arriving at the finding that plaintiffs have no title and possession in the land in suit and that accreted land settled with the defendant Nos.6-8 was the khas land of the Government. Since the plaintiffs have no right, title and interest as well as possession in the land in suit, the suit as framed is not maintainable as per provision of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act —Held: on reading the judgment of the High Court Division it is seen that the said Division did not at all applied its mind to the reasonings and findings of the trial Court while disposing of the suit and that also was not collect in arriving at the finding that the trial Court was unaware of the law laid down by this Division in the case reported in 31 DLR (AD) 195. Since the trial Court addressed itself to all the points involved in the suit and that in addressing itself to the points involved in the suit the trial Court was not in error we are of the view the High Court Division was not correct in setting aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M.A. Hashem &amp; Ors Vs.

The reason upon which the review application was rejected must be held to be unconscionable and erroneous and so also was the memo of the Ministry of land impugned in the writ petition.

It aims at maintaining a proper balance between any adverse effect, which the court’s decision may have on the rights, liberties or interests of persons, and the purpose which the court pursues in its judgment. It involves the exercise of balancing relevant considerations like, the balancing test, the necessary test and the suitability test. This concept involves the court to evaluate whether proportionate weight has been attacked to one other consideration relevant to the decision. As a ground judicial review it is absolutely a new concept to our jurisprudence.

There is real distinction between a mere erroneous decision and an error apparent on the face of the record. Error apparent on face of record is an error which can be seen by a mere perusal of record without reference to any other matter and to find out error one has not to scrutinize the evidence or record but it should be self evident from a perusal of record itself and can be pinpointed without elaborate examination.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Haji Md.

On the date for further examination of the petitioner, an application was filed on behalf of the petitioner seeking leave of the court to ask him two specific questions, namely (1) what was the time of repayment of the loan sanctioned by the Krishi Bank and how this time has been given? and (b) was the payment of installment re-scheduled by the Bank and if so what are the re-scheduled dates?

It seems that before filing of this present application the judgment debtor has also preferred similar application before this court which went up to Appellate Division and that was rejected. Therefore under this circumstances the application alleging that excess land is going to be delivered is just a decree to make delay in executing and delivering the possession of the decreetal land. Therefore the executing court must not make further delay in delivery of possession in respect of decreetal land by appointing an Advocate Commissioner after demarcating the boundary in respect of 55 Bighas of land as per schedule within one month from the date of receipt of this order.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bikram Baral &amp; Ors.

When the petitioner himself consented to the execution of the decree by endorsing “no objection” he is debarred from raising the question of service of notice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

And quotable set off can be claimed in a case where cross demands arise out of the same transaction may not arise out of the same transaction hut they are so connection in the nature or circumstances that it would be inequitable to allow one party to separate suit or proceedings. Granting of set off however rests entirely with the discretion of the Court, No party, of course, as of right can claim such set off. It is needless to say that the discretion is to be exercised judicially. In such view of the matter the claim of the judgment debtor for adjustment.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Shankar Lat Das Vs.

As the Court below acted in a manner, which is not provided in law, the process of execution of the decree will be delayed to the prejudice of the petitioners decree holders.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Haji Jahanara Begum &amp; Ors.

For the purpose of the Rule, the court of the Subordinate Judge and Artha Rin Adalat and the Court of the Subordinate Judge are not the same Courts.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">BCIC Vs.

The Executing court got no power to order stay of execution where the suit is against Decree Holder filed by Third Party. Since, the petitioner is not a party to the suit and the decree and Execution case he got no legal right or character to maintain any application under Rule 29 of Order 21 of the Code to stay further proceeding of Title Execution case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Rotis chandra Das Vs.

Since by the impugned order the petitioner No. 1 has been sentenced to undergo civil imprisonment for 15 days the age of the petitioner No. 1 is of no relevance. In that view of the matter I am of the view that in the instant case no lenient view can be taken simply on the ground that the petitioner No. 1 is aged about 60 years and fact remains that he has violated the courts order and ousted the plaintiff opposite party from the suit land.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Madhu &amp; Ors Vs.

Hajera Khatun and ors 36 DLR (AD) 183 executing court attached the properties of the judgment debtors for alleged disobedience of a decree for perpetual injunction. District Judge in revision set aside the order of the executing Court holding that an application under order 21 rule 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure was not maintainable. On further revision under the repealed provision of Section 115(3) of the Code. High Court Division made the rule absolute. Leave was granted at the instance of the judgment debtors by this Division to consider the question whether a petition under order 21 rule 32 of the Code was maintainable. The appeal was allowed and the case was sent back to the trial court to give an opportunity to the parties to prove that the defendants Judgment debtors had willfully disobeyed the order of injunction impliedly holding the order of injunction impliedly holding that application under order 21 rule 32 of the Code was maintainable. A Division Bench of the High Court Division with one of us and presided over by Ismail Uddin Sarker J. heard a reference made by D. M. Ansaruddin Ahmed J. to resolve the conflicting decisions of different Single Benches as to the maintainability of an application under order 21 rule 32 of the Code. The said Division Bench relying on the aforesaid decision of this Division held that such an application is maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Zainal Abedin &amp; Anr.

Any objection against such allotment that might be raised to such allotment must have been met with before the preliminary decree was made final. Once a final decree is passed on the basis of such allotment and after exhausting all procedures against such final decree by way of appeal or otherwise, when such decree was put into execution for possession of the lot allotted to the decree-holder, and the application did not suffer from any defect, it is the duty of the executing Court to deliver possession to the decree holder under sub-rule (1) of Order 21 Rule 35 of the Code, and if necessary, by removing all obstructions or obstacles put up by the judgment-debtors.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mirza Abdul Ban Beg &amp; Ors Vs.

The High Court Division rightly held that the principle of resjudicata is not applicable in such proceeding.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sonali Bank Vs. S.

The order was communicated to the said Commercial Court for taking necessary steps. By his order dated 15.03.1997 the Subordinate Judge, First Court again requested the Commercial Court No. 1 to take steps in light of his order dated 22.07.1989 On further prayer of the petitioner dated 25.03.1997, the Subordinate Judge. First court wrote a letter to the said Commercial court requesting him to remit the decreetal amount of Taka 58,08,215 out of the fixed deposit. The steps taken and the procedure followed by the Subordinate Judge. First Court we are afraid fulfilled the requirements of Order XXI Rule 52 of the Code to make the attachment valid. Because, to effect a valid attachment in respect of the fixed deposit, it was necessary to issue a prior notice under Rule 52 of Order XII of the Code as the notice is a condition precedent to the order of attachment as is stated in Kanhayalal Hanmantrao v Reginald Mathalone, AIR 1951 Nag 52, and Then Mal v Income Tax Officer 67 CWN 916 We could not find any such statutory notice was ever issued by the Subordinate Judge before attaching the fixed deposit which is already in the custody of the Commercial Court No. 1 by prior attachment. The communication of the order dated 22.07.1989 of the Subordinate Judge to the Commercial Court No. 1 is not sanctioned by the Rule.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

C. P. C. be disposed of afresh in accordance with law reviewing the impugned order passed by the Executing Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mohiuddin Ahmed Vs MIDAS &amp; Anr 16 BLT (HCD)290</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Order —21 Rule—58</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The learned executive Court without carrying on any investigation into the prayer has rejected the said application only on the reason that the present petitioners are sons, daughter and wife of the judgment debtor</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">This provision imposes duty upon the Executing Court for holding a true investigation mandatorily but in the instant case without executing any investigation the court has rejected the application of the present petitioner summarily by a non speaking order. In view of the non-speaking order and that the impugned order having passed without having any investigation, we are of the view that the impugned order has been passed not in accordance with the provision of order 21 Rule 58 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mst.

But such possession such be independent of the judgment debtor and not through the judgment debtor within the meaning of Rule-61.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mohammad Yunus Mia &amp; Ors.

I find that the executing Court proceed not in accordance with the provision of order 21 Rule 100(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

Opposite parties No. 1-5 claim that they are in possession of the suit land on the basis of purchase from sole plaintiff Lal Mohon by registered deeds and that they have acquired interest in the suit land. Therefore, they claim that they may be allowed to prosecute the suit since Lal Mohon is dead—Held: No question of substitution of the opposite parties No. 1-5 under Order 22 Rule 3 C.P.C the death of sole plaintiff Lal Mohon arises at all, firstly because, they opposite parties are not the legal heirs of the deceased Lal Mohon nor successors of the deceased nor are they executors or administrators of the deceased’s estate appointed by the deceased and as such, they are not legal representatives within the meaning of 2(11) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Secondly since the heirs of Lal Mohon are already on record on question of abetment arises at all —l am of the view that Order 22 Rule 10 C.P.C is the only provision of law on which, they may be allowed to be substituted and leave to be granted to continue the suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Abu Taher Bhuiyan Vs.

During pendency of these cases opposite party No. 2, 13 &amp; 22 died leaving behind heirs. The petitioners of all these cases filed petitions for striking out the name of the deceased opposite parties — the trial court rejected the prayer for striking out the names of deceased opposite parties on the ground that the case already abated for not substituting the heirs of those deceased opposite parties—the lower appellate court set aside the order of abatement the High Court Division affirmed the appellate order — Held The High Court Division rightly held that the amendment made by the Calcutta High Court before 1947 is a part of Bangladesh law and are effective as other laws in Bangladesh—the heirs of the deceased defendants were not necessary parties because their predecessors in spite of receipt of notices of the original cases did not appear and file any application for ratable pre-emption as co-petitioners—petition is dismissed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Most T.

Since evidently the final decree was passed against deceased defendant No. 5 Abdus Salam, after two months of his death without bringing his legal representatives on record by way of substitution, it is to be held that vital interests of the petitioners have been adversely affected in effecting the final decree in their absence.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Kabirunnessa &amp; Ors Vs.

Thereafter, the suit was transferred to the Court of Munsif at Birganj and was renumbered as Other Class Suit No. 5 of 1984. This was recorded in the Order sheet of the said Court on 30.9.1984. It appears from the order sheet that on 2.12.1984, the defendants made their appearance and 10.12.1984 was fixed for settling date of the suit. By the Order No. 5, dated 10.12.1984, the settling date was again fixed on 25.12.1984. In the meantime earlier on 12.12.1984, the heirs of the plaintiff filed an application divulging the date of death of the plaintiff on 28.9.1984 and prayed for amendment of the plaint by substituting them in place of the deceased plaintiff. This shows that there was no laches on their part in appearing and making the application for substitution on the very first opportunity. Even if we assume that the sole plaintiff died on 28.7.1984 but because of the transfer of the suit obviously no petition could be made within the statutory period of 90 days and the learned Assistant Judge was well justified in holding that there was substantial cause for which the heirs of the sole deceased plaintiff could not make their appearance earlier within the statutory period of limitation specially when the materials on record do not disclose culpable negligence or mala fides on their part.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Hafizuddin &amp; Anr Vs.

To substantiate the legal representatives of the deceased party on setting aside abatement, the applicant is required to prove that he had no earlier knowledge about the death of the deceased party and he had no laches and negligence in making the prayer for setting aside abatement. In view of the fact that abatement is essentially a technical default, which may deal a shattering blow to his claims, the court is usually inclined to consider an application for setting aside abatement liberally, unless there are gross laches and negligence on the part of the applicant.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Garakh Nath Shib Thakur Vs.

He gave them the benefit of section 5 of the limitation Act and set aside the order of abatement in his discretion to achieve the ends of justice—The application for substitution after setting aside abatement filed in the present case substantially contains the prayer for condonation of the delay describing circumstances.

The appointment of a guardian, therefore, of minor heirs of defendant who died during pendency of suit is absolutely necessary. A minor cannot be considered to be a party to suit unless he is properly represented in a suit by a duly qualified and competent guardian. When a minor has legally become a party to the suit, only then the court would acquire jurisdiction to decide the case. Decree passed against an unrepresented minor defendant being a decree against a person not a party to the suit would be without jurisdiction, null and void.

Investigation leads a Commissioner to go beyond what he sees on the spot and to find out the truth on behalf of the court by collecting evidence and examination of witnesses, which from its peculiar nature can be best had from the spot. Such evidence enables the Court understands or assesses the fact in issue or which clarifies or explains any point, But the Court cannot direct such Commissioner to decide any issue, which ought to be decided by Court on evidence, Assistance of the Commissioneris necessary to elucidate any ambiguous or cryptic point, which cannot be clarified by direct evidence in Court. On the other hand, a person authorized under Rule-7 of Order 39 of the Code has got no power to collect such evidence. He will go to the spot to examine the subject matter of suit or to do anything in respect of such subject matter as the Court directs him to do, and inform back to the Court.</p><p><strong><em>Arif Iftekhar Ali &amp; Ors.

The appeal was dismissed but the High Court Division while maintaining the same found that as Abul Kasham Hawlader was not present in the country during the pendency of the previous suit and the Miscellaneous proceeding thereto and hence the impugned judgment and decree is not binding upon him as the same was fraudulently obtained-Held; A decree in a suit declaring that the decree is passed in Title Suit No.49 of 1958 dated 6.12.1958 is fraudulent and not binding upon the plaintiff is not a devisable one and as such aforesaid finding of the High Court Division is unwarranted because the decree against other plaintiffs that has been maintained was opposed to law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Shamsun Nahar Begum &amp; Org.

Explanation to Section 2(2) provides that ‘a decree is preliminary when further proceedings have to be taken before the suit can be completely dispose of. It is final when such adjudication completely disposes of the suit.” In a suit for partition, after filing of the report along with the case map, field book, saham list by the Advocate Commissioner final decree takes effect and thereafter remains nothing to be done. In a pre-emption proceeding under Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, the question of co-shareship in the tenancy is relevant, but in Section 24(1) of Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act the co-shareship in the land is material. In that view of the matter, the passing of the final decree in a partition suit finally determines the right of the co-sharers in the land. Hence, the application for the preemptor-respondents on the basis of co-sharership is not maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md. Shafiuddin Chowdhury Vs.

Staff (Service) Rules, 1965 ceased to play any role in controlling, governing and regulating the service of any employer or officer of Uttara Bank Limited and termination order issued on 19.09.1981 was under a dead (Service) Rules and dead law and that termination order is absolutely a nullity and without jurisdiction. When an order is nullity, ultravires and without jurisdiction validity of that can be very much challenged under the Ordinary Civil Jurisdiction in as much as the Civil Court or any Tribunal got the authority to see and examine whether action taken or done in any proceeding is a nullity and Quarum Non Judice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Uttara Bank Limited Vs.

The issues are essentially civil in nature. Under Section 9 of the Code all suits of civil nature will lie in civil courts unless the same is specially barred by specific provision of law.

On 18.11.1982 the plaintiff was dismissed from service under the service rules of the Bank.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Held I find from the record that after the plaintiff was put under suspension, proceeded with under the Banks Old Service Rules and finally dismissed from service on 18.11.1982 under the Bank’s Service Rule No. 39. His departmental appeal was also dismissed under Rule not 43 on 25.091984. All though he was proceeded with under the Service Rules of the Bank. This is permitted under Section-3 of the SO Act, On 18.111982 when he was dismissed for service, the defendant Bank was not brought within the ambit of the AT Act, So the plaintiff had no scope to seek remedy under the AT Act, 1981, Equally, as the plaintiff was not dismissed under any provision of the SO Act. 1965 he had also no right to go to the labour court established under the Industrial Relations Ordinance —the plaintiff opted to sue in a Civil Court and he is quite entitled to proceed with his suit in the Civil Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sonali Bank &amp; Ors.

Pursuant to the order of the respondent No. 3 respondent 1 started Money Execution No. 06 of 1998 for recovery of the insured amount in the above Court. Thereafter the appellant instituted the above T S No. 30/1999 in the same Court for declaration that the order of respondent No. 3 dated 28.Ol.1998 vide letter No. ll21/53/197172 asking the appellant to pay insured amount to the respondent No.1 is illegal, malafide, void and not binding upon the appellant—we do not have any doubt that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the appellant has no right to sue in a civil Court for the simple reason that an insurer does not have any such right under the law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Homeland Life Ins.

One essential but of the applicability of section 10 C.P.C. is whether the decision in the earlier suit will operate as resjudicata in the subsequent suit.

So the writ petitioner-respondents cannot seek relief against the said sale deed dated 09.11.1989 by filing another Writ Petition No. 4127 of 1992. Principle of resjudicata under Section 11 of the Code is applicable in a writ proceeding as the same is also a civil proceeding. We are, therefore, of the view that relief claimed in writ Petition No. 4127 of 1992 filed by the writ petitioner-respondents against the appellants of both the appeals was baited by the principle of constructive resjudicata for implied refusal of their claim in respect of the self same sale deed dated 09.11.1989 in writ Petition No. 798 of 1990.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Govt. of Bangladesh &amp; Ors.

The defendant in the said suit including the plaintiff-respondent No. 1 denying the claim of alleged mortgage, it may be mentioned here that; the bank also did not claim that on 17.3.1988 the mortgage executed a memorandum of deposit of title deed on 9.3.1989 executed another agreement for creating further charge on the deed for the loan of Coast Marine Lines Limited. Admittedly no issue on the basis of the said denial of the parties was framed regarding the disputed nature of mortgage as alleged in the said Artha Rin Adalat Suit. D.W.I Mr. Azfar Ahmed an officer of the Bank and tadbirkar has deposed in that suit that the plaintiff respondent No.1 was not a surety and that defendant No.4 did not keep the land in question as security for the loan but the instant case was a suit for the declaration, inter alia, that the plaintiffs property was not subject-matter of security in respect of the loan, the subject-matter of Artha Rin Adalat Suit No.147 of 1992.— Held; in the instant suit as we have found that no such issue was framed regarding the subject-matter of present suit and decision was arrived at and the issue of the present suit was not directly or substantially an issue in the previous suit so as to render the present suit barred by the principle of resjudicata. The High Court Division was not also unmindful as to the question of res judicata to operate as a bar in the instant suit and the trial Court as well on consideration of the material on record arrived at a finding that the suit is not barred by res-judicata.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The Oriental Bank Ltd.

Similarly objection as to pecuniary jurisdiction which is for the purpose of Court fee and availing a forum of appeal / revision is mostly of formal nature and the Court with higher pecuniary jurisdiction could decide a suit of lower pecuniary value and would not render the decree void.

A review I never contemplated to be rehearing of a case for re-opening a closed chapter. It is available only under certained well defined circumstances, namely, where some important evidence has been discovered which could not, in spite of due diligence, have been known to the party to be produced at the time of hearing or the court has overlooked some important question of fact and law, which would have a direct bearing on the decision of the case or there is otherwise some apparent Mistake or error on the face of the record. The ground that the court has fallen into error in deciding an important question or that an important ground was not urged at the original hearing cannot be the ground for review.

Review is not an appeal, or, to put it differently, Review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision stands corrected. Not mere error of fact and law, but error apparent on the face of the record is a ground for Review. Review lies only on a patent error. There is real distinction between a mere erroneous decision and an error apparent on the face of the record. Error apparent on the face of record is an error which can be seen by mere perusal of record without reference to an’ other matter and to find out such error one has not to scrutinize the evidence or record but it should be self-evident from a perusal of the record itself and can be pinpointed without elaborate examination.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Farmisi Khatun Vs.

But as a matter of long standing practice one has to exercise vigilance and promptness in invoking the revisional jurisdiction at the earliest opportunity without causing any inordinate delay. Preferably within 90 days from the decree or order complained against as has been prescribed for preferring an appeal to the High Court Division from any decree or order of a court subordinate to it — relied on 39 DLR (AD) 205.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A.D.C.

In the absence of any pleading and without understanding the disastrous implication or consequence of his reasoning learned Additional District Judge most illegally based his finding upon such statements made in cross-examination as a reason for the deceased Shahabuddin Ahmed Khan for declaring opposite party No. 1 as the next of kin.

The Court of appeal below has considered that no question of any partition in the suit is necessary, as the plaintiff has claimed the entire suit land and more so, the suit the entire suit was for declaration of title.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Nurul Haque &amp; Anr.

We have already mentioned that the defendant for his entitlement to buy out the share of the plaintiff in the land of C. S. plot No. 366 has not lead any evidence to establish the fact that the land in suit is part of the dwelling house of the undivided family or in other words part of the dwelling house of the defendant No. 1. The High Court Division was unmindful of the fact that defendant No. 1’s prayer under Section 4 of the partition Act could only be allowed upon establishing of the fact that the land in suit is part of his dwelling house or that the land in suit contiguous to the defendant’s homestead or that defendant needs the land in suit for convenient use and occupation of his dwelling house. But the defendant did not establish any one of the facts stated above. It may also be mentioned that defendant has not taken exception as regard the occupation of the land of C. S. plot No. 366 by the other  stranger purchasers who purchased the land of the plot in suit from the wife of the defendant No. 1 subsequent to plaintiff’s purchase. As seen from the judgment of the appellate court that it was contended from the side of the defendant No.1 that the strangers, one of whom purchased the land from the wife of the defendant No. 1, are “compromising person” and as such they have been accommodated by the defendant No. 1 and others. Legally the said contention is not sustainable since provision of Section 4 of the partition Act does not contemplate that a member of an undivided family will take exception in respect of a buyer who has purchased the part of the dwelling house of his undivided family but will not take exception in respect of the other stranger buyers who are not his kith and kin, as in the instant case, who have purchased the land of the dwelling house of undivided family.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Maleka Khatun &amp; Ors Vs.

The appellate court appears to have discussed each witness both for the plaintiff and for the defendants and also the documents in coming to its conclusion that the plaintiff could prove his title and possession but the circumstances proved that the registered lease deed dated 3 April 1957 in favour of the defendants was a collusive document since the landlord had not right to lease out the land at that time. Furthermore the defendants failed to prove any farog in confirmation of which the lease deed is said to have been executed. But the learned Judge of the High Court Division did not consider any of the above aspects of the case. Those apart the High Court Division as a revisional court had hardly any jurisdiction to set aside the findings of fact by the appellate court and that also without discussing any fault in the factual finding by the said court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Kachi Mia Vs. Suruj Mia &amp; Ors 8BLT (AD)-125</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-115(1)</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Revisional court found it to be a case of non-consideration of material evidence on record. D.W.1 Abu Taher said in his deposition that the pre-emptor is his cousin sister and she lived in the same village and her husband knew about the same transfer of the case land and requested him to purchase the case land and also told them that they would help the pre-emptor in purchasing the land. D.W. 2A K.M. Golzar Hossain also corroborated the statement of D.W. 1 that both the pre-emptor and her husband refused to purchase the land. This specific deposition of D.Ws. 1 and 2 was not at all considered by the last court of fact. So this non-consideration of the vital material evidence affected the merit of the case, the revisional court in the facts of the present case correctly found that the deposition of D.Ws 1-3 was not at all discussed and considered as has been done by the trial court. Further, the judgment of the lower appellate court is based on certain surmises and conjectures as the lower appellate court that if the pre-emptor and her husband were requested to purchase the land before preemption then probably either the pre-emptor or her husband ought to have been a signatory either in the agreement or in the kabala. This is really an assumption and surmise of the lower appellate court which is not borne out by any evidence on record. There is no scope to guess this probability on the face of positive oral evidence on record. That apart, the pre-emptor and the pre-emptee are relations and live in the same village—the exercise of revisional jurisdiction by the learned Single Judge was proper and justified in the facts of the case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Most.

The appellate court found fault with the finding of possession arrived at by the trial court holding that the reasons of the trial court suffered from discrepancy. Again, the appellate court also found that the Assistant Custodian of Vested Property was necessary for the sake of effective and complete adjudication. The appellate court thus did not give any independent finding on possession or decide the matter of impleading the Assistant Custodian in the suit itself. The said court had sent back the case on remand for deciding it on all points after fresh trial. Such an order on the facts and in the circumstances of the case has not caused any Miscarriage of justice for any patent illegality as such. It was not proper for the High Court Division while exercising revisional jurisdiction to interfere with the order of remained.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

Khatian No 311 did not form part of land of patta Ext. 1 and as such there was no dispute that the suit land was not identical to the land patta. I and accordingly, no question of relayment in order to ascertain identity of the land was necessary. Thus the High Court Division erred in law in holding that in order to ascertain the suit land claimed by the plaintiff relayment is required and as that was not done by the plaintiff, they failed to prove (heir claim as per pleading.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Nurul Haque &amp; Anr.

The lower appellate Court in the background of the facts as well as on the basis of the evidence held that the kabala executed by Yakub Ali in favour of his son Ishaque was not acted upon.

But the court of appeal below considering the background of the case held that the plaintiff has failed to prove his possession rather the defendants’ witnesses have been able to prove the possession of the defendants in the suit land. The court of appeal below in support of the conclusion regarding possession of the defendants in the suit land observed that there was no denial of the fact that C.S. Dag Nos.585 and 586 are in possession of the defendants in their jote right from the time of their predecessors under the common landlords within the same Mouza as of Dag No.490 and both of them are on the contiguous east of the suit land forming part of Dag No.490 and it was apparent that the plaintiff had no land or house near about the suit land. In such circumstances it was natural that the riparian owner of the adjoining holding of the suit land would go into possession of any land coming out of the river by way of alluvion contiguous to his original holding under the same landlord. In that view of the matter the defence case was found to be more acceptable than the plaintiffs story of possession. The above observations of the court of appeal below are based on proper consideration of the materials on record and averments made in the plaint that the suit land was part of a large navigable river and gradually the river had silted up. It further appears that the court of appeal below assigned cogent reasons for disbelieving the evidence of plaintiffs witnesses regarding possession and for believing of the evidence of defendants witnesses regarding possession of the defendants in the suit land -the appellate court below reversed the findings of the trial court on exhaustive consideration and elaborate discussion of both the documentary and oral evidence on record. So the observations and findings of the High Court Division in reversing the findings of the lower appellate court are rather without any basis.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

It is nobody’s case that the plaintiff has sold some property elsewhere. In view of the above the plaintiff was entitled to get a preliminary decree to the extent of .661/2 acres of land. I find that the learned Sub-ordinate Judge has committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning a failure of justice in assessing the share of the plaintiff and the impugned judgment and decree is not sustainable in law.

The inherent power conferred under section 151 of the Code can be available in a case where there is no other provision for providing a redress. Power under section 151 of the Code can be invoked by a court only when the court is satisfied that prevention of the abuse of the process of the court is necessary or when ends of justice demand that the wrong complained of would be remedied. In the name of ends of justice, the remedy provided in the Code itself cannot be allowed to be negative and also to be thwarted. The court, of course, under section 151 of the Code preserves the power to set aside order passed under Misapprehension of facts when true facts are brought to light. The court also got the inherent power to vacate any order obtained by Misleading the court and practicing fraud upon it. The court, in the exercise of the power under section 151 of the Code, also, can collect the unintentional or inadvertent mistake committed by it. The court also preserves the inherent power to vacate any order if the same is passed under Misapprehension of law. But the power cannot be invoked in cases which would result in overriding the express provision of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Amirunnessa &amp; Ors. Vs.

In the ex parte disposal of the suit the learned Assistant Judge dismissed the same on 7.2.90. But in Civil Revision 962 of 1990, preferred by the petitioner, a Single Bench of the High Court Division on 7.2.91 decreed the suit. The petitioner however, instituted Execution Case No.1 of 1992— Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 as representatives of the deity on 15.11.80 instituted Title Suit No. 1085 of 1980 (was renumbered as Title Suit No. 225 of 1986) for declaration of her title to the suit land. The present petitioner is a party in the case of Title Suit No. 225 of 1986 and that the petitioner in his suit did not implead the plaintiff of Title Suit No. 225 of 1986 as party—Held: The High Court Division in the facts and circumstances of the case has rightly refused to interfere with the discretion exercised by the executing court under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure in the interest of justice staying further proceeding of the execution case pending disposal of Title Suit No. 225 of 1986.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M.

The decree of the trial court having been modified by the High Court it merged into the decree of the High Court. Hence, the question of drawing up of a modified decree on 9.8.93 in the light of the judgment and decree of the High Court in First Appeal is wholly illegal and without jurisdiction. It is found that the modified decree was passed on 22.3.1960 and to avoid the question of limitation a modified decree was again drawn up by the trial court on 9.8.93 and which is so obvious that it was obtained from a court by fraudulent means. Even if, it is admitted that a Mistake was committed by the executing court itself even then there are innumerable authorities of this court to hold that any error or wrong committed by the court itself can be corrected in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure to secure the ends of justice and to prevent the abuse of process of court. Thus, the execution proceeding is apparently barred under Article 182 of the Limitation Act. The plaintiff did not take any steps within three years from the modified decree of the High Court nor he kept alive the decree by taking steps to execute the decree within 12 years from the date of the final modified decree. Thus in order to avoid the bar of limitation the plaintiff fraudulently got the modified decree drawn up by the trial court. Hence the application, under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure is maintainable in the facts of the present case. Further, the plaintiff got decree for 8 Anna’s share of the suit property as modified by the High Court. In the execution proceeding the application was filed by the decree-holder for partition and for possession. Without filing a partition suit the executing court cannot also pass an order for possession when the decree itself does not contemplate such possession by partition of the property by metes and bounds. This exercise of jurisdiction by the executing court is palpably erroneous and without jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M. Majid Vs.

Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure is no doubt a special preserve of the Court for doing even-handed justice under given circumstances but the Court is not competent to exercise its inherent power in any and every matter which is not sanction by law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Harun-Or-Rashid &amp; Ors.

It will be quite harsh and inequitable if the illegal action of the Commissioner on the basis of a writ issued to him in violation of the provision of law is allowed to stand, driving the aggrieved party to have recourse to other ardorous, costly and time-consuming exercise for getting back possession in the suit property from which it has been dispossessed illegally. In such a case, exercise of the inherent power of the Court under Section 151 C.P.C. is clearly permissible.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

The Judgment Debtor- defendant opposite party side on the basis of Miscellaneous Case, No. 15 of 1999 under Order 9, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, obtained an order of stay of the proceeding of Title Execution Case. It is the positive assertion of the Decree Holder plaintiffs-petitioners that the Judgment Debtors defendant opposite party side on the strength order of stay started kancha semi pucca structures and also permanent construction on the suit property and by way of an application under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure the Decree Holder plaintiff petitioners prayed before the court for exercising Courts inherent jurisdiction in recording an order of injunction restraining the Judgment Debtors defendant opposite party side from making any kancha, semi pucca or permanent structure and construction. The decree so obtained by the plaintiffs Decree Holders-petitioners stands good so long the same is not set aside in Miscellaneous case laid by the Judgment Debtors defendant-opposite party side. Taking the advantage of an order of stay of the proceedings of the Title Execution case the Judgment Debtors-defendant opposite party side cannot be allowed to make semi pucca, kancha structure and permanent construction by changing the nature and character of the suit property causing loss and damage to the Decree-Holder plaintiffs petitioners. In the fitness of the facts and circumstances the learned Assistant Judge was required to record an order of injunction restraining the judgement debtors defendant opposite party side from raising structure and making construction kancha, semi pucca or pucca on the suit property. The learned Assistant Judge thus appears to have committed a substantial error in not issuing an order of injunction as prayed by the Decree-Holder plaintiffs-petitioners.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Abu Mohammad Yousuf &amp; Ors.

It will be not possible for the executing court to assess the value of 5 bighas of land. I find above that the defendant No. 1 in fact admitted to give 5 bighas of land indirectly out of schedule Kha land. Accordingly, in exercise of sumoto powers, I modify the decree of the Family Court and direct the defendants to execute and register 5 bighas of land out of schedule Kha land within 30 days of the decree.

The amendment sought being of the formal nature it falls within Sections 151, 152 and 153 of the Code of Civil Procedure which the Court can correct. The High Court Division therefore held that such correction of clerical Mistake does not amount to amendment of the plaint under Order 6 Rule 17 In the circumstances we do not find any illegality in the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division in allowing the correction in the schedule of the plaint by substituting plot No.4313 in place of 4314.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sri Narayan Chandra Pande Vs.

The legality of the said very Order dated 23.1.1991 was before the Labour Court for consideration. The BADC could not justify its said Order there, But although the respondent No. 2 got his relief but the Labour Court being without jurisdiction, its judgment and Order is of no legal effect. On the prayer of the BADC, we have already hold so as prayed for. But since the respondent No 2 is not the petitioner, the question is whether we can further declare about the legality of the Order dated 23.1.1991 which was the sole question before the Labour Court. This question is important because this was not prayed for by the BADC the petitioner, in this writ petition but it was prayed for on behalf of the respondent No.2 before the Labour Court and this writ petition original from the said judgment and Order of the Labour Court which considered the legality of the said order. In effect the legality of the order dated 23.1.1991 passed by the BADC technically is still before this court and cannot be bidden and shadowed by the mere fact that the present Rule was not issued at the instance of the respondent No. 2 but at the instance of the BADC whose order was under challenge at the instance of the actual aggrieved person, the respondent No. 2 in the IRO case. The jurisdiction of the Labour Court was raised only as a matter of procedure as a collateral question and that also admittedly at a much belated stage — Besides, as such the office order No wbt cOt/tmP/cOkv-39/90-91/1981/10 dated 23- 1-1991 (Annexure-E) is declared illegal and is of no legal effect and the period from 2.6.1976 to 11.5.1988 be treated as his period of duty and he is entitled to the salary and other service benefits as admissible under the relevant Rules and Regulations for the said period.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">BADC Vs.

According to the learned Judges the main object of detention appeared to be realisation of the loan which was not contemplated under section 3 of the Special Powers Act and consequently the learned Judges found no nexus between the order of detention and the grounds served. The learned Judges found that the order of detention was passed without any lawful authority and is of no legal effect. The learned Judges further found that respondent No. 1 was released after executing some papers transferring his mill and after doing certain other acts. The learned Judges held that the purported action of detaining respondent No. 1 being not authorised by law respondent No. 1 was entitled to such a declaration under Article 102(2) (a) (ii) of the Constitution.

The right of judicial review under Article 102(2) of the Constitution is neither a fundamental right nor a guaranteed right. Similarly, the judicial review of an administrative action is neither an all weather remedy nor a remedy for all wrongs but is only available only when there is no other equally efficacious remedy. The writ petitioners have challenged the impugned decisions alleged to have infringed their fundamental right guaranteed under Articles 27 and 29 of the Constitution, but in view of the provision of Article 117(2) of the Constitution the Parliament has set up the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 for exercise of the functions enumerated in Article 117(1) i.e. by setting up of the Administrative Tribunal to exercise the jurisdiction in respect of matters relating to or arising out of the terms and conditions of persons in the service of the republic etc. Article 117(2) provides that no Court shall entertain any proceeding or make any order in respect of any matter falling within the jurisdiction of such Tribunal. Section 4 of the Administrative Tribunal Act 1980 specifically provides how the jurisdiction under Article 117(1) is conferred to any other Court. In the case of 44 DLR (AD) 111 it has further been cautioned that an aggrieved person may, out of desperation or just for taking a sportive chance in the summary writ jurisdiction, allege-contravention of some fundamental right which may ultimately turn out to be frivolous or vexation or not even wrongly attracted in the case and asked to be a ground so that great value of the right given under Article 102(1) is not frittered away or Misused on the pretext of alternative remedy. The question of enforcement of fundamental right is not available in the case as the question involved in the impugned decisions are mere clarification of the rules for giving effect thereto and as such the assumption of jurisdiction under Article 102(2) of the Constitution for ventilating certain grievances regarding terms and conditions of service of the writ petitioners pursuant to the impugned decisions has never been contemplated. On our examination of the impugned order we do not think that any question of fundamental right is involved in the case so as to allege that the same cannot be extricated for exclusive consideration in the petition for enforcement of fundamental rights.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Govt. of Bangladesh &amp; Ors.

It should take notice under section 114(c) of the Evidence Act, 1872 and should start with the presumption of regularity in official business. Initially, in the writ petition itself, the writ petitioner must include some reliable and relevant materials to show that between the last date of fixation of tariff value and the impugned date of fixation of tariff value the international market prove of a particular imported item has either gone down or has gone up to an extent which is significantly higher or lower than the impugned fixation of tariff value, according as the writ petitioner’s case is.

There was no allegation of any  Misconduct or inefficiency against her for the last 20 (twenty) years she worked there in the said school till she was dismissed in 1995 —It appears that the teachers council of the school in its meeting held on 30.12.1993, decided to form a club, as a recreational forum for the teachers on a monthly contributions from the teachers. It appears from para-4 of the affidavit in opposition that she also contributed to the said fund for some times but thereafter she defaulted and subsequently prayed to be excused from paying the said subscription —It appears that the petitioner had no obligation to pay subscriptions to the Teachers’ Club. As such, the Principal of the school, the respondent no. 2, had no right or authority to issue the memo no. 103/IPSC/7 dated 13.4.1995, asking her to show-cause as to why disciplinary action should not be taken against her. This notice itself was illegal, still, in reply to the notice to show cause dated 13.4.1995 (Annexure-B); issued by the respondent no. 2 she explained the reasons for her such inability by her letter dated 15.4.1995 (Annexure-C). The matter ought to have ended there but the Principal of the school again issued another notice on 22.4.1995 (Annexure-D). This notice was also illegal — the whole disciplinary proceeding against the petitioner was initiated to victimize the petitioner which is palpable and the Appeal and Arbitration Committee ought to have considered it in its proper perspective but it Miserably failed to do so, rather, illegally choose to tow and endorse the illegal decision of the Governing Body of the school. The said Committee failed to consider the two notices dated 13.4.1995 (Annexure-B) and dated 22.4.1995 (Annexure-D) issued by the respondent no. 2, threatening to punish the petitioner if she fails to pay the subscription. The committee ought to have appreciated that those notices were illegal and the conduct of the respondent no. 2 in issuing those two notices was reprehensible. The Board in its turn also blindly approved the decision of the Governing Body and its Committee, as such, Miserably failed to perform its statutory duty cast upon it under regulation 12 of the Regulations in its true spirit, thereby, the respondent-Board also became a party to the arbitrary action of the Governing Body of the school.

The Parliament in its wisdom, can do so. It can create statutory corporations also but it cannot create a body which is professed to represent a section of the people but without their representation and without making it accountable to the said section. The Gram Sharker is sought to represent the people of the village but all its members are nominated by the concerned authority. As such, they are neither the representative of the village people nor they are accountable to them. They are accountable to the bureaucracy. As such, in the name of the Gram Sharker, an autocracy has been created. This is against the spirit of the Constitution, so lucidly explained by Mustafa Kamal, J., in Panir’s case at para-72, that there cannot be any half way house between the democracy and autocracy. The Parliament may, in its wisdom, even abolish a local Government but cannot replace it with a body like Gram Sharker which is not a local government but dependent on bureaucracy. This is what we call a colourable legislation in the forceful language of Mustafa Kamal,J., in Panir’s case at para-7 1. It may be remembered that in Panir’s case, the dissolution of Upazilla Parishad was justified on the ground that it was not an administrative unit. But in the perspective of village, under the Act XXI of 1997, the Village Parishad was already an administrative unit and its members were elected from and amongst the village people, bearing a representative character, as such, was visibly and decidedly a local government. But the village Parishad was abolished and was replaced by nothing better than the Gram Sharker which is demonstratively an autocracy in all respect, created by the Gram Sharker Ain, 2003, in violation of the democratic spirit enshrined in Articles 7,9,11, 59 and 60 of the Constitution, as such, the said Ain, is not law and we are constrained to declare so.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Blast Vs.

It is pertinent to point out that a Division Bench of the High Court Division has already held in the case of Jahangir Hossain Howlader 58 DLR (2006)106 that filing of an application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not an adequate alternative remedy as contemplated under Article 102(2) of the Constitution.

In view of such legal position, there would be little hesitation to say that the Secretary of the Ministry of Land acted beyond his authority to Misguide the revenue authority by issuing the aforesaid circular dated 10.11.02 and such circular must be held to be illegal, unauthorized and without jurisdiction since it is not backed by any law and any action taken thereupon must be set aside.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mrs. Romisa Khanam &amp; Ors Vs Govt. of Bangladesh &amp; Ors 16 BLT (HCD)461.<span id="pastemarkerend"></span></p></div></div>

India got its Constitution in 1949 and became a Republic in 1950. The political history of Pakistan was not that happy. It got its first Constitution in 1956, only to be ditched unceremoniously in 1958. Another Constitution was made in 1962 but again Field Martial (self appointed) Ayub Khan, in violation of the Constitution, handed over the office of President to General Yahia Khan in 1969. A general election was held in 1970, the first as well as the last in the erstwhile Pakistan but when the army President refused to convene the Constituent Assembly, rather, let loose a genocide in the then East Pakistan, independence of Bangladesh was proclaimed on the night following 25th March, 1971, and the people of Bangladesh was proclaimed through a historic war of liberation against the Pakistan army and its murderous local vassals, achieved its independence at a cost of three million martyrs on the 16th day of December, 1971.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Anwar Hossain Manju Vs.

The preamble along with other articles and provision of the Constitution have given justice an ampler dimension to provide justice to every citizen of the country, Above all the Constitution reposes all the power to the people. Article 7 makes it clear that all legislative, judicial and executive powers are conferred on the people through the Constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">ETV Ltd. &amp; Anr.

The spirit of the Constitution is to uphold the will of the People of the Republic and such reflection of the People’s will results in formation of a Government which is to be elected through a fair, free and credible election conducted by the Election Commission But it appears that because of different defects including non introduction of voter ID card most of the elections held after the liberation unfortunately received question of fairness and neutrally. Considering the socio economic condition the country, we are of the view that the Election Commission, should take initiative to remove the existent legal barriers and introduce voter ID card or may introduce multipurpose national ID card with the assistance of the Caretaker Government because such documents are sine quo non for a credible election for developing state.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Kazi Mamunur Rashid Vs.

The failure of a person or persons in the State is not the failure of the Constitution or the laws of the land. The failure of the people in power to uphold the law must not be equated with the failure of the Constitution or the laws made thereunder, rather, it may be the failure of the persons concerned who are oath-bound to implement it. There must be others in the State who would again uphold the law. The checks and balances inherent in the Constitution and the conventions grown and groomed therein with the honesty and integrity of the people in the system, keep the State in its rightful place. If there is none to uphold the law in its real spirit, that will be unfortunate and disastrous for all and for the nation as a whole. Because, it, may lead the country to the catastrophe of a failed State. But for such an eventuality it would be foolhardy to blame the Constitution or the laws, rather, the concerned persons who failed to uphold the Constitution in its real spirit, should be identified, penalised and be thrown in the gutter, so that the others may learn their lessons from the reckless excesses of their unconscientious and debase predecessors.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Blast Vs.

Article 27 of the Constitution provides that all citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law and Article 29 (1) of the Constitution provides that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in respect of employment or office in the service of the Republic. If the petitioners merely prepared a list and kept it to themselves or their different departments for implementation as and when possible the writ petitioners had nothing to complain about but when a number of them are appointed from a list and the appointment of others is postponed pending inquiry into the genuineness of a list comprising of 1745 persons with which list the writ petitioners have no concern, then they can legitimately complain of inequality before law and discrimination in public employment—We are of the opinion that the High Court Division was not well-grounded in law in directing the petitioners to absorb/appoint the writ petitioners against specific posts within a specified period which is purely an executive act.

It has got all the attributes of a local government body but it’s such status is curtailed, as if purposely, by enacting subsection 4 to section 3, to take it out of its existing status under the provisions of Act XXI of 1997, as an administrative unit and also to make it a non-representative body by making provisions for nominations of all its members, thereby, as if purposely, robed its character as a local government body as it used to be earlier both under the Palli Parishad Am, 1989 and also under Asthanio Sharker (Gram Parishad) Am, 1997.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Blast Vs.

But it was only made applicable to him after long 8 years from the date of conviction and sentence while he was continuing as a Member of Parliament. Hence, the authorities concerned must now be estopped from declaring his seat vacant on the ground of disqualification for his conviction in Janata Tower case—Held: In the instant case, the Speaker did not inform the House that the petitioner ceased to be a Member on account of disqualification for being convicted in the Janata Tower Case for a period exceeding 2 (two) years. The petitioner was, therefore, not informed about his seat being vacant due to disqualification. As a result he had no opportunity in the present case to raise any dispute. The impugned notification was not issued after due compliance with the aforesaid rule of the procedure.

The speaker  derives his power of certification under Article 8 1(3) which is hedged with a condition that “Every Money is presented to the President for his assent, shall bear a certificate under his band “that” (the underlining is mine) it is a Money Bill” and such certificate shall be a conclusive for all purposes and shall not be questioned in any court. The expression “that” it is a Money Bill is not an “idle expression or mere formality” It means that the speaker must satisfy himself that what he is presenting for the assent of the President is in fact a Money Bill. And this satisfaction must be derived from the enumeration given under Article 8l(1)(a) to (f) read with Article 81(2) and 88 of the Constitution. Furthermore, Article 7(1) which is the “touch stone” of the constitution ordains in no uncertain term that “All Powers in the Republic belong to the people and their exercise on behalf of the People shall be effected only under, and by authority of this Constitution while under Article 7(2) it is sanctified to be the “Solemn expression” of the will of the People and the “Supreme law of the Republic”. Now the question is, have the people invested the speaker with the power or in other words is the speaker empowered to certify a Bill as a Money Bill which in fact is not a Money Bill? The answer must be “no” The Power conferred upon the Speaker under Article 8 1(3) must be exercised on behalf of the people and must be effected only under, and by authority, of the Constitution. This sacred document (the Constitution) has not authorized or invested any one specially the constitutional functionaries of the state who are under oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution to issue a false certificate transgressing the presidential Prerogative under Article 80(3) of the Constitution, This constitutional Power cannot be negated and denied by any one at his sweet will or whim. There must be a clear and unambiguous conferment of such power by the Constitution itself. In the facts and circumstances of this case Particularly the way the extract Bill was sent to the President for his recommendation to be introduced in the House, the way the Home Minister deliberately M/Sled the House saying that the President recommended the Bill as a Money Bill (Which it was not) and the way the Speaker sent the Bill for the assent of the President after it was passed by the Parliament as a Money Bill certifying that the Bill (P.S.A.) was a Money Bill knowing full well that it was not so under Article 8 1(1) of the Constitution, I am left with but only one conclusion that it was a ploy to preempt the prerogative of the President (under Article 80(3) to prevent him from refusing or withholding his assent to the Bill and returning it back to the Parliament because it did not answer the description (a) to (f) of Sub-Article (1) of Article 81 of the Constitution. It was clearly an act of fraud by the Speaker committed upon the president, upon the Constitution and above all upon the people.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Per Mr. Justice Shamsul Huda : In no way any fraud has been committed either on the President or on the Constitution in relation to a money bill while presenting it to the President for latter’s assent, the propriety of legality or any other matters relating to such certification cannot be called in question in any court. And the court cannot go behind the certificate even if the court finds error of law in certifying.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Afzalul Abedin &amp; Ors. Vs.

The trial court decreed thesuit of respondent No. 2 with a direction on the BSC to reinstate him in hisservice as the Secretary of the Corporation. There is the simple direction givenby the trial court which was upheld upto the Appellate Division. Respondent No.2 in all his applications of joining made a prayer for fixing his seniority andthat is why the appellant sought the opinion of the parent Ministry and theLegal Adviser in the matter. Immediately the opinion of the Legal Adviser wassought for without any delay and on 19.5.1994 respondent No. 2 was directed tosubmit a normal and proper joining report. It thus appears that within 112months from the first letter praying for, joining as Secretary, the appellantdirected respondent No. 2 to file a normal joining report and to join asSecretary of BSC, but respondent No. 2. without joining moved the High CourtDivision in a contempt proceedings on 5.5.1994. Respondent No. 2 did not evenwait for 112 months but moved, the High Court Division in contempt. In thebackground of the admitted fact, and correspondence it is difficult to hold‘that the appellant had wilfully shown any disrespect and disobedience ‘towardsthe order of the court. As’ the matter was not a simple joining report theappellant in bonafide and good faith immediately sought clarification of theMinistry and the opinion of the Legal Adviser, as directed by the Ministry. Inthose correspondences there was nothing to show that , any contumaciousness wasshown regarding the implementation of the order of the court. There was also nodelay or laches on the part of the appellant in taking ‘effective steps inimplementing the court’s order. We do not find that the conduct of theappellant was such of flouting the order of the court deliberately and to treatthe court’s order with some degree of hatred or malice—in this case, theappellant challenged the contempt Rule and filed a Counter Affidavit setting uphis defence upon alternative facts and circumstances in which he acted under abonafide and good faith. As a matter of fact he had no authority also ‘to fixthe question of fixation of seniority and promotion. Thus, in the facts of thepresent case probably no apology was sought for as he was in fact acting withhonest belief for clarification. The apology in this case would have shown thathe had committed the offence of contempt. In the present case, it appears thatwithin 112 months of the filing of the joining report respondent No 2 was askedto join. There was in fact no delay and no attempt was made to obstruct the,order of the court.

It means it was an existing law till the 13th November, 1996. When a statute is repealed by the Parliament its disappearance from the statute-book takes place from the date of repeal, either prospectively or retrospectively according as the legislature prescribes. But if as statute is declared void ab initio by the Court its disappearance from the statute- book takes place retrospectively from the date of enactment of the repealed statute, never prospectively. If a statute is declared void ab initio by a Court no rights accrue at all. No obligation or liability generates from the void law. But a repealed statute retains accrued rights and obligations, unless avoided specifically or by necessary implication. In the present case no Court of law has earlier pronounced that the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 is void ab initio. The Parliament was therefore free to pass a declaratory statute declaring that the said Ordinance was void from the very beginning; but it did not do so, It preferred to treat the said Ordinance as an existing law and repealed it. The High Court Division made a basic mistake in holding that the Parliament has legally repealed a void law, little giving thought that a void law has to be declared void by a declaratory statute and a repeal can only be made of an existing law in case of repeal the Repeal Act is itself liable to be repealed by the same Parliament or subsequent Parliament, reviving the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975; but when a Court declares the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 void ab initio the Parliament cannot reenact the same legislation afresh. It will be struck down as unconstitutional. It is buried forever. This distinction was lost sight of by the High Court Division.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><strong>Shahriar Rashid Khan Vs. Bangladesh. &amp;.

India and second by Ext.6 it has been established by the Respondent Nos.1 and 2 that Gonesh Chandra Mondal ceased to have any interest in the land of Sarabo Mouza because of amicable partition with his brother Kartik Mondal.

Respondent Nos. 2-6 who are among the 73 directly recruited Class-i officers have added themselves as parties in the tribunal cases, but the rest have not.

The said Abdul Wahab Howlader executed a deed of gift in favourof the plaintiffs on 27.7.64 and delivered the possession but the said deedcould not be registered due to certain difficulties. The defendants claimed thetitle over the suit land as a residuary sharer. Hence the plaintiff filed thetitle suit for declaration of title in respect of suit land—the learned trialcourt in consideration of oral and documentary evidence and materials on recorddecreed the suit. Against the said decree the defendants preferred appeal.Learned Appellate Court allowed the appeal by reversing the decree of the trialcourt—Held: That the plaintiffs, being in exclusive possession over thestatutory period of limitation from the date of institution of the suit by theplaintiffs in the year 1984 and to the complete ouster of the defendants forabout 20 years from the suit property have acquired a valid title even on thebasis of the defective deed -of gift being an unregistered one. It furtherappears that the defendant could neither challenge the said unregistered deedExt.

S. recorded owner of the suit property. Afterhis death his son Gopal Karmaker inherited the said property. This GopalKarmaker transferred the suit property to one Harendra Lal Saha and JagannathSaha. After the death of Harendra Lal Saha his property was inherited by histwo sons Chandi Gopal Saha and Ashutosh Saha. One Parveen Akter purchased thesuit property by registered deeds from Chandi Gopal Saha, Ashutosh Saha andJagannath Saha. From this Parveen Akhter plaintiff- appellants had purchasedthe suit property while the plaintiffs were possessing the suit land, they cameto know that the property in question was declared as vested and nonresidentproperty—learned Subordinate Judge dismissing the suit holding that theplaintiffs failed to produce any document to show the transfer in between GopalKarmaker and Harendra Lal Saha and others—Held: The averments made in theplaint and the evidence of P.W.I together with the written statements ofdefendant No. 2 and the evidence of P.W. I it clearly appears that Harendra LalSaha and others became the owners of the suit property and they possessed thesame and sold the same to Mrs. Parveen Akhter by registered sale deeds in1981—the rent receipts together with the continuous record as right videexhibits I series may be treated as collateral evidence of title in favour ofthe plaintiff. Now, if we consider the oral as well as documentary evidence asstated above, we find that this Harendra Lal Saha and others acquired right andtitle over the suit property. The documents by which the heirs Harendra Lal andJagannath transferred the suit land to Parveen Akhter and the registereddocument by which Parveen Akhter transferred the land to the present plaintiffsare not disputed at all. So it is held that the learned Subordinate Judgefailed to consider the material evidence or record as stated above and he hasarrived at a wrong finding and as such it cannot be sustained.</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Md.Amjad Hossain &amp; Ors.

The plaintiffs asseted that they purchased thesuit land in auction in Certificate case No. 10168 of 195060 and got possessiontherein. The plaintiffs produced photocopies of sale certificate and writ ofdelivery of possession which were not admitted in evidence by the trial court.The lower appellate court. however, accepted the photocopies as additionalevidences. The learned Judges of the High Court Division found that the trialCourt gave proper reasons for not accepting those photocopies as there was noexplanation as to what happened to the original copies of the sale certificateand delivery of possession and that there was no evidence on record to showthat any witness testified that those were the photocopies of the originals.Secondary evidence was wrongly admitted without any cogent explanation. Therewas no statement in the plaint or in the deposition that the originals werelost or destroyed. Further from the evidence on record it was found by thelearned Judges of the High Court Division that plaintiff Nos. 3, 4, 6 and 14were not born at the time of auction sale and as such the question of auctionpurchase in the name of unborn person does not arise. The learned Judgesthemselves also saw the photocopies Ext. 2 and 2a (as marked by lower appellatecourt) and found that those photocopies were different from those filed in thetrial court. The learned Judges or the High Court Division rightly reversed thefinding of the lower appellate court. It further appears from the record thatthe certificate case was started in 1959-60, but the plaintiffs claimed to havepurchased the suit land on 16.06.1979 and got possession on 20.02.1981. Thesale was set aside by the certificate officer and the lower appellate court didnot consider this aspect at all.

The hard reality is that the quality of the judges of Division, though are of a satisfactory level, all are not equal. Some are more brilliant may be left behind and the less competent may be elevated to the Appellate Division simply because he was appointed a judge of this Division at an earlier point of time than the others. This will have the following effect on the highest judiciary; firstly the most brilliant judges may be left behind though they could make better contribution to the judiciary. Secondly, if seniority-cum-merit becomes the criterion then right after the appointment of a judge in this Division he will do his best to improve the quality of his judgment and his overall performance as a judge and there will be a sense of competitiveness among the judges in performing their judicial duties. This will immensely benefit the nation as a whole and the judiciary in particular and the most meritorious will move ahead the less meritorious.

The Administrative Tribunal dismissed the case. But the Administrative Appellate Tribunal allowed the appeal holding that the order of dismissal was passed illegally Held We have gone through the impugned order of dismissal. The authority in view of the conviction of the respondent’ of a criminal offence decided whether the respondent should be punished under 1985 Rules and in fact decided to dismiss him from service under Rule 4(3) (a) of 1985 Rules. As no proceeding needs to brown up and no opportunity needs to be given to the respondent for showing cause against the proposed penalty (under Rule 25 (3) of 1985 Rules) the Government passed the order of dismissal straightway.

The only argument which was available with the Appellate Joint Commissioner of Taxes in avoiding the circular is that the assessments were already made when the circular had not yet been issued and therefore the assessments were a closed transaction. But obviously the assessments were not a closed transaction aw1 the Appellate Joint Commissioner of Taxes had the whole question of assessment open before him.

Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 5382 of 1998, claiming Custody of the victim girl. The appellant was not made a party in the said M/Sc. Case but upon an application filed by him he was permitted to assist the State lawyer at the time of hearing of the Rule. When the matter came up for hearing, no one appeared for the petitioner of the M/Sc. Case. It is alleged by the appellant that the learned Advocate for him, however, appeared and prayed for adjournment of the hearing on the ground that an appeal was pending before this Division against the order discharging the Rule in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 4342 of 1997 filed by the appellant and further that it was found by the High Court Division itself in that case that the present detention of Suma Chatterjee could be said to be illegal as she was being detained by virtue of the order of the Appellate Division —As already noticed, the aforesaid M/Sc. Case was filed by one Meher Chand Claiming himself to be the brother-in-law of the victim girl and seeking her custody. At the hearing of the said M/Se. Case no one appeared for Meher Chand, but even then the learned Judge took up the matter for consideration which is to say the least, quiet extraordinary. The ‘earned Judges were not sitting in appeal or revision as would entitle them to proceed with the matter even in the absence of the parties. In the instant case, the High Court Division was exercising a kind of original jurisdiction was exercising a kind of original jurisdiction i.e. under Section 491 Cr.P.C. The only course open to the learned Judges was to dismiss the M/Sc. Case for default of the petitioner. But that was not done which was quite improper. Furthermore, the appellant has alleged that a prayer for adjournment was a made on behalf of the appellant, inter alia, on the ground that the same Bench in the case filed by the appellant for the custody of the victim girl had dismissed the same finding that the girl being in judicial custody as per the direction of the Appellant Division, it could not be said that her present detention before this Division. The judgment (by itself) was before the Court which was annexed to the application filed by the said Meher Chand Having acted in such manner the learned Judges have not only shown disrespect to this Division but manifested a regrettable attitude of throwing norms and procure to the winds. This does not enhance the prestige of the learned Judges nor of this Court. We are very sorry to observe that we have had occasion before to record our dissatisfaction about the manner in which the learned Senior Judge had been disposing of some cases with the hope that the path or correction and rectitude may be followed, but it seems that it has all been water on ducks back.

He has gone wrong with his reasoning as well. The Title Suit No.49/1986 was fixed for hearing on 1.8.90. On that day the petitioner moved 2 applications for adjournment of the hearing before the learned Assistant Judge. So the petitioner was not ill and the learned Assistant Judge was right to conclude so, but he was wrong in his thinking that the petitioner claimed that he was ill. The petitioner, in fact made no such claim in his petition. Nor did he express his inability, on the ground of his alleged illness, to conduct the hearing of the suit question. All that was said in his applications for an adjournment was that the petitioner on the previous evening had returned home very late in the evening not until 8 P.M. and he could not prepare the case as he was unwell. The words used by him in his application are, “স্বাস্থ্য খারাপ থাকার দরুন” and by using these words the petitioner was not claiming that he was ill to attend the court or to conduct hearing. The words have been linked with the task of preparation of the case and are preceded by the words “গতকাল রাত্র ০৮:০০ ঘটিকার সময় বাসায় পৌছিয়া”.It may mind, the petitioner by using words, “স্বাস্থ্য খারাপ থাকার দরুন” was not claiming to be suffering from any illness. He was simply saying that as he had returned home late at 8 P.M. on the previous evening he was then too exhausted to undertake further work and prepare the case for hearing on the following day. The learned Assistant Judge in the impugned judgment and order said, to borrow his words “বিজ্ঞ আইনজীবী ধার্য তারিখে অসুস্থ ছিলেন। এটি প্রমানিত হয় নাই। যেমন তাহার অসুস্থতার স্বপক্ষে কোন এমসি দাখিল হয় নাই।” the learned Assistant Judge, it seems that he was under the impression that the petitioner had claimed to be ill in on the day of the hearing of the suit and adjournment of the hearing was sought on the ground of such illness. But this is not borne out by the records as disclosed in the adjournment applications, Annexure “A” and “A1” to the instant Civil Revision. From the tenor of the impugned judgment and order it seems that the learned Assistant Judge condemned the petitioner as a hero and a cheat, but the facts and materials on record do not warrant such a condemnation. Furthermore, the passage of the judgment to which the petitioner has taken objection was not necessary for the determination of the learned Senior Assistant Judge.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bibhu Ranjan Das Vs.

From the aforesaid evidence it seems that although the witnesses did not state in unequivocal language that the plaintiff disclosed his Talab-i Mowsibat previous to his second demand but they have proved his first demand as well as his second demand and I am in respectful agreement with the decisions of Indian Jurisdiction as referred above in holding that if under these circumstances a Talab-i-ishad is made subsequently, and there is no express reference of Talab-i-Mowsibat, the right of preemption of the plaintiff is not defended, as subsequent demand is superfluous, further, Hedaya observed in his book Mohammadan Law at page 551 that no particu1ar form is necessary : what the law requires is that the demand must be to that effect and no more.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bangladesh Krishi Bank Vs Kazi Liakat Ali and Ors. 14 BLT (HCD)76.</p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>

The law is now settled that one who alleges fraud for setting particular transaction, the burden lies on him —That the transaction in question was not the product of fraud or undue influence is evident from the fact as stated hereinbefore, that Rativan Bibi on the same date executed 2 Heba-bil-ewaz deed, one in favour of the defendant and another in favour of her daughter and later on registered the said deeds on the same date, but taking exception only in respect of the transaction made in favour of the defendant. Had the transactions were the product of fraud, coercion or undue influence or had the transactions been not the product of Rativan’s free will and that had the Heba-bil-ewaz deeds were not executed and registered by her without understanding the nature of the transaction and of being unaware of the contents of the documents, Rativan Bibi would in the normal course of conduct and behavior have taken exception to both the transactions instead of that she is taking exception only in respect, of one transaction i.e. the transaction which was made in favour of the defendant and this shows lack of bonafide on her part and that she being influenced by some other interested persons, as contended by the defendant by the sons of Amzad, one of the sons of Rativan Bibi, instituted the suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mustafizur Rahman Vs.

Shahifur Rahman &amp; Ors. 11 BLT (HCD)-189.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-24(1) read with Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 Section-2(2)</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A reference to Section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure shows that a decree may be either preliminary or final. Explanation to Section 2(2) provides that “a decree is preliminary when further proceedings have to be taken before the suit can he completely dispose of. It is final when such adjudication completely disposes of the suit”. In a suit for partition, after filing of the report along with the case map, field book, saham list by the Advocate Commissioner final decree takes effect and thereafter remains nothing to be done. In a pre-emption proceeding under Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, the question of co-sharership in the tenancy is relevant, but the Section 24(1) of Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act the co-shareship in the land is maternal. In that view of the matter, the passing of the final decree in a partition suit finally determines the rights of the co-sharers in the land. Hence, the application for the pre-emptor respondents on the basis of co-shareship is not maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md. Shafiuddin Chowdhury Vs. Abdul Karim &amp; Ors. 8BLT(AD)-165</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-24(1) read with State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 Section-117</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">There is no escape from the irresistible conclusion that even if the land in the expression. ‘co-sharer in the land’ in Section 24(1) of the Act, 1949 is not synonymous to a holding but conceiving of such land without reference to the word ‘co-sharer’ is neither feasible nor possible. And the word ‘co-sharer’ in the phrase ‘co-sharer in the land’ is the key to find whether the preemptor is entitled to preempt. A final decree passed in a partition suit or amicable partition though separates and divides the land for the purpose of possession but does not ipso facto terminate co-ownership in such land till subdivision of the holding and distribution of rents takes place only in accordance with law. Subdivision of a holding and distribution of rents may also take place in a revenue survey subsequent to the cadastral survey with or without the plot or plots divided into different small plots. As stated above, such subdivision may also takes place at the instance of one or more of the co-tenants of the holding in accordance with the provisions of S. 117 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950. Such subdivision always terminates the joint tenancy or more precisely co-sharership in the land, no matter whether the land is subdivided or separated or not and after such subdivision, the old co-owners of the holding in such land cannot be deemed to still continue as co-sharer in the land within the meaning of S.24(1) of the Act, 1949.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">S.

For attracting Article 6 of the Paris Convention there must be proof of well-known or wide use which is very much lacking in the case of the objector. Furthermore, the objector has not got his mark registered in this country. So he now cannot claim any protection under Article 6 of the Convention.

In the instant case having examined the materials on record it is evident that the respondent No.2 got the registration in India in the year 1985 which is much prior to the date of registration of the same mark in the name of the appellant. And about the user there are sufficient materials on record —In that regard our opinion is that this kind of Press release by World Trade Organization has not affected any provisions of Paris Convention of which 100 countries of the World are signatories by becoming members.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

The expression a dwelling house belonging to an undivided family is to be liberally construed. We have done so in Sree Jugal Kishori Sarker Vs. Azizur Rahman &amp; Ors. 40 DLR(AD) 150.

In the suit land an undivided dwelling house is situated. The defendant himself claimed to be residing in a portion there. The suit property never lost its character of an undivided homestead because there had admittedly been not partition by metes and bounds by any previous arrangement. The impartible character of the suit property remained undisturbed when the suit was filed in 1962. There is no time limit for filing an application under section 4 of the Partition Act.

If properties are left out in a partition suit it brooks further litigation. It is true that this rule is relaxable. But there are specific situations calling for relaxation. They are generally (a) where different portions of the property lie in different jurisdictions, or (b) when some portion of the property is at the time incapable of partition, or (c) when the property from its nature is impartible, or (d) when property is held jointly with strangers who cannot be joined as parties to a general suit for partition, or (e) where cotenants, by mutual agreement, decide to make partition of a part of the joint property retaining the rest in common.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Nurul Afsar Vs Rafiqul Ahmed 7BLT (AD)-335</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-4</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Decrees never put into execution within 12 years.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Decree in partition suit of I 1 6, appears that the decree in Title Suit No. 167 of l9I was never put into execution within 12 years and as such the decree holder plaintiff including plaintiff nos. 4 and 5 (Safunnessa and Jahra Bibi) could not get into possession in the decreetal land particularly in ‘Cha and Tha’ of the schedule upon evicting the defendants including the sons of Moinuddin Kochwan, the defendant no. 21, the substituted heirs of defendant no. 21-Kha Abdus Sattar, the predecessor-in-interest of defendant nos. 6-9 and Abdul Halim, the substituted defendant no. 21-Ga, the predecessor-in-interest of defendant nos. 1-5, the transferors of the defendant nos. 10-17.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sahani Bibi &amp; Ors.

In effecting partition by metes and bounds the existing possession of the parties is usually maintained as for practicable and in so far it is not inconsistent with the decree.

In that view of the matter it appears that he has failed to fulfill the condition precedent for filing an application under section 51 of the Act.

Therefore, it appears that the respondent No.1 by suppressing the fact that a similar design had already been registered as back as in 1994 obtained the registration of their design by committing a fraud upon the Controller of Designs. It further appears that the respondent No.2 also failed to discharge the legal duties cast upon him and after proper scrutiny failed to discover the fact that the design applied for already registered. Thus, the registration given by the respondent No.2 in favour of the respondent No.1 being registration No.01638 dated 14.5.96 in class-I is neither a new nor an original design and it has previously been published in Bangladesh and also registered by the petitioner in 1994.

Admittedly the landlord received Tk. 2.300/- from the tenant as advance security whereas he cannot take rent more than one month under the law and as such the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division correctly held that the agreement was void as it is hit by Section-10 of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

Hence non-filing of the rent receipts by itself will not be so material as from the evidence on record admittedly the unadjusted amount remains in the hands of the plaintiffs—the defendant having actually proved the payment of rent by oral and documentary evidences the trial court including the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division wrongly held the defendant to be a defaulter.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Monaranjan Barua Vs.

He is a defaulter in the payment of monthly rent from November, 1981 —The appellant admitted the tenancy at a rental of Tk. 300/- per month. He is not a defaulter and he has been paying rent regularly in House Rent Case—High Court Division found that the appellant having deposited 3 months rent (November, 1981 to January 1982) at a time was defaulter in the payment of rents when he filed the said House Rent Case and as such he is not entitled to get the benefit, of Section 18 of the Premises Control Ordinance.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Held : The suit premises was admittedly declared as an abandoned property and the appellant paid rents to the Abandoned Property Cell from time to time in lump which was the practice —There is absolutely no evidence that plaintiff-respondent ever informed the appellant that the suit the building has been released in his favour from 26.11.81 requiring the appellant to make payment of rent not to the Abandoned Property Cell but to the plaintiff. There is also no evidence on record that before 17.2.82 any official communication was addressed to the appellant informing him of the release of the suit building in favour of the plaintiff- respondent. The appellant had sent 3 months’ rent by postal money order to the plaintiff. On coming to know that the suit building has been released in his favour. On the plaintiffs refusal to accept the money order the appellant deposited 4 month’s rent upto February to the Authority. There was neither any mala fide nor any intentional desire to deprive the plaintiff from his claim of rent—the High Court Division did not consider these facts and it apparently made a mistake of fact in coming to the conclusion that the appellant was a defaulter.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Monzurul Morshed Vs Humayun Majid 3BLT (AD)-165</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section- 18(5)</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">From the materials on record it appears that the tenancy of the respondent Md. Lal Miah with the father of the petitioner terminated with his father’s death. Both the plaint case and the notice under Section- 106 of the Transfer of Property Act show that there was a fresh tenancy created with the respondent for a rental of Tk. 90/- in place of Tk. 60/- which was the rental for previous tenancy. It was only in the previous tenancy agreement (Ext. 1) that there was a stipulation of payment of rent within 7 days of the following month. It does not appear from the claim of the petitioner that there was any such term in the agreement with the respondent. Therefore the rent was payable within 15 days from the following month in accordance with Section- 18(5) of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md. Abdus Salam &amp; Ors. Vs. Md.

Thus in the present case the tenant having failed to deposit the rent with the House Rent Controller for the month as mentioned above within fortnight of the following month, he is a defaulter in the eye of law and once a defaulter is always a defaulter.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Lutfur Rahman &amp; Ors Vs.

Act and when the lessor’s case was not one of default nor one of bonafide requirement and the tenant was holding over as a statutory tenant, paying regular rent before the rent controller—No.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">(a) Lease of immovable property is created under section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act and as such statutory notice must be given under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act for termination of tenance. The provisions of the Rent Control Ordinance are in addition to this section of notice u/s 106 by the T.P. Act. There is nothing in the Ordinance which also absolves the landlord to serve notice u/s 106 of the T.P. Act. Unless the tenancy is determined by giving a notice u/s 106 of the T.P. Act no suit for ejectment of a monthly ten ant can be filed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Abdul Aziz Vs Md. Abdul Majid 2BLT (AD)-151</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">(b) <strong><u>Per Mostafa Kamal, J. (agreeing):</u></strong> The tenant cannot be evicted solely and only on the ground of expiry of the period of lease, even if a notice under section 106 of the T.P. Act is validly served before filing of the suit. A notice will only be an idle formality in that case, leading to no remedy.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Abdul Aziz Vs Md.

Since the courts below had concurrently found that notice under section 106 had been correctly served and that a portion of the premises was sub-let without consent of the plaintiff the tenant was liable to be ejected.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Nur Nahar Begum &amp; Ors Kabir Ahmed Chowdhury &amp; Ors 12 BLT (AD) 108</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section —19(1)</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Since the tenant paid rent lastly in 1987 and in the background of the tenant’s case that she offered rent in 1396 B.S. i.e. in 1989. the tenant was a defaulter while filed Miscellaneous cases. It may be mentioned Miscellaneous cases under section 19(1) of the Ordinance was filed in 1991 for depositing the rent of 1989. The learned Counsel could not place any material before us that after 1987 the tenant paid or offered rent of the years i.e. for 1988-1990. In that state of the matter the trial Court held that the tenant was a defaulter in the payment of rent but the appellate Court while setting aside the order of the trial Court did not reverse that material finding that the tenant i.e. the present petitioner is a defaulter. The High Court Division has rightly held that the Miscellaneous cases were not maintainable since tenant was defaulter prior to the filing of the cases under section 19(1) of the Ordinance.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mst.

If, however, the ballot paper does notcontain any official mark, either in part or in full the Presiding Officer hasno option but to exclude it from count. The impression of a part of theofficial seal on the back of a ballot paper is a shortening of the elaborateprocedure under Article 31 (2)(d)(e) under pressure of circumstances.

As such, the contesting defendants filed a counter claim of Tk.27,76,84,9 10.00 under different heads. They also paid the necessary court-fees against their claimed amount. --- It is true that long before the detection of the damaged cargo, the defendant no.5, got its 90% of the invoice value of the cargo by committing fraud on them. It might be that the concerned officials realizing the said situation, tried to arrive at a compromise solution by asking the defendant no.5 to segregate the cargo but at the same time they ought to have appreciated that the vessel was not owned by the seller, rather, it was a chartered vessel by another charterer, again in violation of clause-7 of the contract, as such, delaying and detaining of the vessel would also cause serious loss to its owner who had no contractual obligation with the plaintiff. It might be that in order to balance the payment of 90% invoice value of the cargo they wanted to detain the vessel as a security against the payment fraudulently taken by the defendant no.5, but they ought to have realized that they ought not to have done so against a third party who is a stranger to their contract, causing loss and damage to them and for such loss and damage to the defendant nos. 1 and 3, the plaintiff would now be held liable in detaining the vessel illegally since 15th July, 1999.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Govt. of Bangladesh Vs.

In terms of compromise the pre-emption case was allowed and the consideration money was withdrawn by the purchaser pre-emptee and had given delivery of possession of the case land to the pre-emptor, petitioner — The Appellate Court dismissed the preemption Misc. Case 409/73 on the ground that since the registration under section 60 of the Registration Act was not completed in time before filing the pre-emption case it was not maintainable — petitioner thereafter again filed the Misc Case 369/75 within the statutory period of limitation from the date of registration of the deed under section 60 of the Registration Act, and he made a prayer to exempt him in depositing the consideration money again. Trial court did not pass any order but kept the application with record—on appeal the appellate court allowed on the ground of non-depositing the consideration money along with the pre-emption application— Held: It is on record that in view of the compromise between the pre-emptor and the opposite party No. 2 who is the purchaser pre-emptee the money was withdrawn by the pre-emptee purchaser and in that view of the matter, she did not contest either in the trial court in the first or second time pre-emption cases or in the appeals. Since the money was withdrawn by the rightful person, the second deposit is not necessary and the conception of it in the present circumstances is a redundant one. So the appellate court wrongly and illegally under mis-interpretation of law and fact, has allowed the appeal by the impugned judgment and order which resulted and error in the decision occasioning failure of justice and the view taken by the trial court was a correct and legal one. Law and the courts of law have been established to meet the ends of justice to the deserving party in the litigation.

It cannot be other way round. Separate holding number given by a Municipal Corporation cannot replace an order under Section 117(c) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. so the heirs of Golam Mortuza Khan must be held to be still enjoying the joint tenancy left by him. Similarly no amicable partition among the cosharers even if reached in writing nor even a decree passed in a partition suit allotting different shares to the co-shares can substitute the order as mentioned in Section 117(c) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. In such view of the legal position as well as the factual position, the court of appeal below was perfectly justified in holding that the joint tenancy of Golam Murtoza khan was never subdivided and the rents were never distributed amongst his heirs, pre-emptor and his brothers and sisters in accordance with law, and thereby the pre-emptor did not cease to be a co sharer in the joint tenancy left by him.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Harunur Rashid Vs.

Amir Hossain died in 1989. This ‘Ekrarnama’ was proved by PW.-5 younger brother of the plaintiff . He also testified that the plaintiff purchased the land and paid the entire consideration.

Out of 13 kathas and 7 chattaks of land, 9 kathas more or less had been used for effecting development of road and 4 kathas and 7 chattaks of land more or less had not been at all used and said 4 kathas and 7 chattaks of land had been and has been in possession of plaintiff. Rajuk created plot no.2 in respect of 4 kathas of land and created plot no. 3 in respect of 7 chattaks of land and allotted 4 kathas of land in favour of Md. Omar Faruk and Abdul Masrur and allotted 7 chattaks of land in favour of Md. Iqbal.

Allotment of 4 kathas and 7 chattaks of land in favour of allottees Md. Omar Faruk and two others were absolutely illegal, void and contrary to Martial Regulation No.VIII of 1986. 4 kathas and 7 chattaks of land having been unused land, plaintiff in the, capacity of original owner of said land was entitled to have property released and by allotments in favour of Md. Omar Faruk and two others right of plaintiff to the said 4 kathas and 7 chattaks of land had been infringed and plaintiff, thus, got legal character and legal status to file and maintain suit. It, thus, cannot be said that suit is barred under provision of section 42 of Specific Relief Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">RAJUK &amp; Ors Vs Habibur Rahman &amp; Ors 13 BLT (HCD)506</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section -42</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A decree for declaration of title could not be given unless the plaintiff is found to be in possession or in a suit for declaration of title and partition that the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration of title if he is in joint possession with his co-sharers.

Moreover, we have found that at the instance of the plaintiff himself Upendra filed that suit. So, plaintiff was fully aware that property was enemy property and as such he did not acquire any title on the basis of the sale deed dated25.3.1985. The courts below on the above ground found that the plaintiff acquired no title. The courts below also found that Title Suit No.123 of 1990 was barred by limitation held The High Court Division held that the plaintiff acquired title by adverse possession. This finding of the High Court Division is without any basis.

It is therefore apparent that the maintenance has been related to the period of Iddat. The interpretation given by the learned Judges is thus apparently in conflict of the aforesaid verse—from the above, it is clear that the interpretation given by the learned Judges is not and cannot be acceptable because it brings conflict and even on the general criterion of interpretation as they also would not deny that a document should be read as a whole, the interpretation of the learned Judges must be rejected.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M.

Iddat is a period of waiting, After divorce the marriage tie between the husband and wife is dissolved and after the dissolution of marriage there remains no obligation between the parties outside the contract of marriage, but due to the period of iddat outside the contract of marriage an obligation for payment of maintenance has been created according to Muslim Law.... There being no direction of payment of maintenance during the period of “Iddat” in the Holy Quran, one is bound to follow the other sources of Islamic law for a guidance on the question of granting of maintenance to a divorced woman.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M.

On return to Bangladesh he was taken in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the same post carrying a scale of pay of Tk.310-670/- which was in Grade-Vu of National Scale of Pay. His service was declared as surplus by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by a memo date 23.6.76 and his name was forwarded to the Ministry of Establishment for absorption. By an order dated 20.11.76 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked the appellant to join the Taxes Department as Inspector of Taxes. He was released from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 22.11.76 and on the same day he was absorbed as Inspector of Taxes in the office of the Income Tax Commissioner, Dhaka (North Zone) in Central Salary Circle-2 in the same scale of pay as above. At the time of filing the petition before the Administrative Tribunal the appellant was serving in the Contractors’ Circle-3 at Dhaka (East Zone). At the time of preparation of the List of Seniority the appellant found that his period of service was counted not from the date of his joining the service on 29.9.70, but from the date of joining as Inspector of Taxes on 22.11.76. Appellant’s prayer for a direction to reckon the period from 29.9.70 for the purpose of counting his seniority.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Held : Establishment Division issued Memo No. ED(R-1 1) S-59/77-25 (500) dated 20.3.79, This memo is the sheet-anchor of the appellant’s case. It is his case that in 1976 the post of Inspector of Taxes and an Upper Division Assistant were equivalent posts because they carried the same grade and scale of pay and there was no other yardstick of measurement of equivalence between a ministerial post and an executive post at that time. The appellant is right. Subject to the implementation of the recommendations of the National Pay Commission by an order notified in the Official Gazette under section 5 of Act No. XXXII of 1975, if the appellant’s seniority was fixed at any time between 22.11.76 (when he joined the Taxes Department as Inspector of Taxes) and 30.6.77 (When the New National Grade and Scale of Pay was not yet introduced), he could have reasonably claimed the counting of his past service for determining his seniority. The respondents could not then have been heard to say that the post of Inspector and the post of Upper Division Assistant are higher or lower posts, entailing higher or lower degrees of responsibility. The Inspector of Taxes and Upper Division Assistant being equivalent posts both for purposes of grade and scale of pay the appellant was entitled from 22.11.76 to 30.6.77 to count his previous service for fixation of seniority, in terms of the Establishment Division’s Memo dated 20.3.79. But both the appellant and the respondents missed the essential point in the entire litigation, namely, that on and from 1.7.77 the amalgamation of Upper Division Assistant and Inspector of Taxes into the same grade and scale of pay was done away with, making it a thing of the past, and obliterated event, leaving no trace of any vested right that may have accrued upto 30.6.77. From 1.7.77 an Upper Division Assistant and Inspector of Taxes are not equivalent posts, either in respect of grade or in respect of scale of pay. The appellant will not be considered to have been absorbed in an equivalent post. Yes, he was absorbed in an equivalent post in 1976, but the equivalence “ceased to exist” from 1.7.77. Because of the respondents’ inability to bring into sharp focus this vital legal aspect of the matter the judgment of the Appellate Tribunal has made a foray into redundant considerations, like the distinction between the duties of an Upper Division Assistant and an Inspector of Taxes. The basic legal position is that from 1.7.77 the appellant remains absorbed in a post different in grade and scale of pay from the post of Upper Division Assistant and therefore with no assistance from the Establishment Division Memo dated 20.3.79 and the various other Government Memos brought to our notice by Mr. Abdur Rab Chowdhury can the appellant in any way be permitted to count his previous service from 29.9.70 to 21.11.76 for fixation of his seniority.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

So the requirement of formation of an opinion by the Bangladesh Bank has been made before directing a Director, Chairman or Chief Executive of banking company to refrain from performing functions of his office during the pendency of the enquiry proceedings against him for his removal from office under Section 46 of the Act, Such opinion must be formed on the basis of relevant materials on record and not fancifully without any such material nor on the basis of irrelevant materials.

The words “SONY” and “SONYO” are not visually and phonetically similar to an identical with each other. There is no chance on the part of the customers or consumers to get confused and embarrassed because of the two appellations, namely, SONY and SONYO Virtually, the initiation of the Opposition Case No. 1543 of 2000 is an exercise in futility. The said case is founded on false and frivolous allegations — After filing of the Opposition Case No. 1543 of 2000 as against the Trade Mark Application No.48468 in Class-9, the opponent—appellant filed a number of applications in Form TM-55 for extension of time and those were allowed. Lastly on 05.09.2001 the appellant put in another application in Form TM-55 for extension of time, but that was turned down on 09.09.2001 and the application for registration of the trade-mark SONYO filed by the respondent no. 1 was accepted. —Held it was incumbent upon the Registrar of Trade Marks to afford an opportunity to the opponent-appellant of being heard prior to disposal of the Opposition Case No. 1543 of 2000. Admittedly the Registrar did not comply with the mandatory provisions of Section 70 (c) of the Trade Marks Act and he having not complied therewith illegally and erroneously rejected the Opposition Case No. 1543 of 2000 and accepted the application of the applicant-respondent no.1 for registration of the trade-mark SONYO.

Consequently, the duty with which the Registrar is entrusted with under the Rule 23 of the Trade Marks Rules, 1963, to search all the pending application is binding upon him for public interest so that no confusion can be created in the minds of the public by not doing so and then give notice if other applications are pending.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Aarman Soap Factory Vs.

Waqf means and includes any permanent dedication by a person professing the Muslim faith of any property for any purpose recognized by Islam as religious, pious or charitable. It is no doubt a trust. After the creation of the waqf. The title of such property vests absolutely in Allah or in the charities created in His name. A mutawalli or mutawallis are appointed to carry out the waqf. The position of a mutawalli is not that an ostensible owner but a mere manager. He is obliged to do only that what he was instructed for in the waqf-deed by way of administration and management of the waqf. No action of such mutawalli beyond the authority as given in the waqf-deed or which are intended to result in the waste or loss of the waqf property will be valid or being the waqf.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Hafizuddin Ahmed Vs.

First, he must be satisfied that such transfer is necessary for improvement and benefit of the waqf. Then, he will have to obtain a sanction of the Government. But Section 56 is not generally intended to empower a mutawalli to transfer any part of the waqf property by way of sale, mortgage or exchange, or by lease for more than five years. That is, he can only lease out for a period of five years only. In case of an absolute transfer, no such transfer could he valid without prior sanction of the Administrator. Again the proviso warns that even sanction cannot validate a transfer, which is in contravention of a law or otherwise invalid. So, the sanction is not sacrosanct. Even a transfer with sanction may not be valid either for contravention of the law or when the sanction itself was not valid. Moreover, we could not find any reason for not to read the conditions or limitations as provided in Section 33 that before granting sanction the Administrator must be satisfied that such transfer was necessary for the improvement and benefit of the waqf in Section 33 for a transfer by a mutawalli in Section 56 and/or granting sanction by the Administrator in Section 57. Underlining implied limitation must not also be forgotten that the law was never interred to validate a transfer even with sanction, which ultimately results in injury, waste or loss of the waqf.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Hafizuddin Ahmed Vs.

The lower appellate court further held that in respect of the acquiredland, the court cannot direct the Government to lease out the suit land to theplaintiffs simply because their predecessors—in-interest as the original ownershad been in possession even after acquisition. It does not appear either fromthe judgment of the trial court or from the lower appellate court that theplaintiffs had ever made out any case under section 16 of the Land AcquisitionAct, 1894, namely that no award regarding compensation for acquisition of theland was prepared by the Government or the original owners did not receive anycompensation for acquisition in question. It appears that the learned Judge ofthe High Court Division upon making out a third case, on consideration ofsection 16 of the said Act, has wrongly reversed the decree of the lowerappellant court and decreed the suit wrongly holding, inter alia, that althoughthe land had been acquired by the Government as far back as in 1941 the samedid not absolutely vest in the Government free from all encumbrance because theGovernment did not take physical possession thereof in pursuance of theacquisition in question. Moreover the learned Judge of the High Court Divisionwas not justified in considering the trial court’s finding that defendant No.1is a monthly tenant in respect of the suit land, overlooking that the lowerappellate court rightly held that the plaintiffs, who have no right, title andinterest in the suit land, had no legal authority to induct defendant No.1 as amonthly tenant in the suit land.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Govt of Bangladesh&amp; Ors.
