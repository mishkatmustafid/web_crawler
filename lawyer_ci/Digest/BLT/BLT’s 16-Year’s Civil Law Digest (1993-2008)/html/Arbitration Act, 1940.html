The Arbitrator was of the positive view that selling of 6 monkeys out of 5000 monkeys, if a breach of clause 33 of the Agreement, would not be a material breach leading to termination of the agreement. This decision rendered by the Arbitrator cannot be characterised as a “Misconduct” and it cannot be said that the Arbitrator Misconducted himself in making the Award. On the part of the Arbitrator there is no corruption nor conduct amounting to moral turpitude, no breach and neglect of duty and responsibility causing Miscarriage of justice, no failure to perform the essential duties, no Mishandling of the Arbitration proceeding amounting to some substantial displacement of the ordinary rules of justice and no indication of gross negligence or recklessness on the face of the Award.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mol  Enterprises Inc.

Nothing has been stated about the venue of the Arbitration proceeding. In the absence of any agreement/clause prohibiting Arbitration in any other place or land other than Bangladesh or to put it differently any statement manifesting the venue of the Arbitration in Bangladesh, it is difficult to appreciate the contention advanced from the respondent that the Arbitration proceeding having taken place in the United States of America, the whole Arbitration proceeding and the Award given by the Arbitrator is without jurisdiction.
