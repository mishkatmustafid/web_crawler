The nature and function of the Artha Rin Adalat coupled with its power and authority clearly indicate that it is a special forum of limited jurisdiction and not an ordinary civil court right to review like the right of appeal is a substantive right and not a mere matter of procedure — the power to review is not an inherent power. It must be conferred by law either specifically or by necessary implication no application for review under Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure lies in the Artha Rin Adalat. The review application was not entertainable by the Artha Rin Adalat and as such, incompetent.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sultan Alam Vs Rupali Bank 2BLT (HCD)-l 18</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-2(Ka) read with Bangladesh Commerce Bank Ltd. [Act No. XII of 1997]</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section —13</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Though Bangladesh Commerce and Investment Limited was neither a financial institution nor a commercial bank but even then sanctioned loan to the defendant No.1 and so the entire transaction being illegal suit does not lie; as contended by the learned counsel for the Petitioners —The High Court Division observed that section 2(Ka) of Artha Rin Adalat Ain (Act IV of 1990) defines “Financial Institution” as a financial institution licensed under the Financial Institution Act, 1993 and the Preamble of Act XII of 1997 clearly states the reason for reconstitution of the erstwhile Bangladesh Commerce and Investment Limited as it, being a non-banking financial institution licensed by the Bangladesh Bank, functioned to the detriment of the interest of the depositors and customers and so the erstwhile Bangladesh Commerce and Investment Limited was a licensed financial institution within the meaning of section 2(ka) of Artha Rin Adalat Ain; besides under section 13 of the above Act 12 of 1997 all assets and liabilities of erstwhile Bangladesh Commerce and Investment Limited vested in the newly constituted respondent No. I and the newly constituted respondent No.1, being a financial institution within the meaning of Artha Rin Adalat Ain, the Adalat committed no error in taking the view that Bangladesh Commerce Bank Limited was re-constituted by Act XII of 1997 as a commercial bank and the defendants having taken loan from its predecessor i.e. Bangladesh Commerce and Investment Bank/ the suit was filed before the Adalat was maintainable —Held; It is thus evident that Act 12 of 1997 covered the loan which was granted by Commerce Bank and Investment Limited to the defendant No.1. Further the above Commerce Bank and Investment Limited, which became defunct in the year 1992 did not file the above suit. So we are of the view that the High Court Division on applying the principle of law as applicable in the present case arrived at a correct decision which does not suffer from any illegality or infirmity so as to call for any interference.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M/s.

Applying this proposition in the facts of the instant case as set out in the plaint there seems to be no escape from the conclusion that the defendant has a debt to the plaintiff which is concurrently found to be a financial institution and that being so it must be held that the suit filed by the plaintiff in the Artha Rin Adalat for realizing the said debt which is a ‘loan’; under Section 2 (Kha) is quite maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Saudi Bangladesh Ind. &amp; Ors Vs.

It also appears from the averments made in the plaint and the papers placed on the record that said loans were given to the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 to enable them to lift the fertilizer which they have purchased in advance from the defendant Nos.3 and 4 who got the allotment of the fertilizer from defendant No.7. In our opinion upon making advance sale of the fertilizer the defendant Nos.3 and 4 had hardly anything to do except facilitating the defendant Nos. l and 2 to lift the fertilizer, which the defendant Nos.3 and 4 did as regard the fertilizer in question. From the papers on the record it is seen that the defendant Nos.3 and 4 to make the agreement of advance sale fruitful they did everything to enable the Bank and the defendant Nos.1 and 2 to lift the fertilizer from Respondent No.7 —Held; In the background of the materials on record and the discussions made hereinbefore in our view it cannot be said that defendant Nos.3 and 4 obtained loan from the Bank or received any financial facilities from the Bank and that they are also not the guarantors in respect of the loan made available by the defendant Nos. I and 2.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sonali Bank Vs. Md.

Accordingly, the Artha Rin Adalat, under the provision Artha Rin Adalat Act cannot legally pass any order as to how the suits filed under the general law would proceed simultaneously or otherwise with suits filed in Artha Rin Adalat under the provision of Artha Rin Adalat, obviously if any such order is passed that cannot be said to have been passed under the Artha Rin Adalat Act and that order cannot get the benefit of section 5 of the Artha Rin Adalat Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">As such we hold that the Artha Rin Adalat acted beyond its jurisdiction conferred by section 5 of the Artha Rin Adalat Act— impugned orders are amenable to revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 C.P.C.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">United Commercial Bank Ltd.

The Section 33 of P.O. 129 of 1972 provides for entertainment of such application only by the District Judge, who is given the exclusive jurisdiction to deal with such application for realization of respondents due money. The Artha Rin Adalat has no jurisdiction to entertain an application under Section-33 of P.O. 129 of 1972.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Abdur Razzaque Chowdhury &amp; Ors Vs.

P.C. lies for rejection of that counterclaim and whether a writ petition or civil revisional application will lie to the High Court Division, A defendant cannot claim in a written statement a set off or counterclaim against the plaintiff in a suit filed under the Artha Rin Adalat Act. The bar to claim a set off or counterclaim is not expressly contained in the Artha Rin Adalat Act, but it is implied-ly contained in section 5(1) read with section-2 (ka), 2 (kha) and sections-5(4) and 5(5) thereof. Although the effect of a set off or counterclaim is that of a plaint in a cross suit, Order-7, Rule-11, C.P.C will not apply in rejecting such set off or counterclaim. Plaintiff may have recourse to section 151 of the C.P.C. for such rejection. Alternatively, plaintiff may bring the maintainability of the set off or counterclaim as an issue of law under Order 14 Rule 2 C.P.C. which may be decided first. In view of the paten inadmissibility of the counterclaim within the framework of Adalat Act, plaintiffs application under Order-7 Rule -Il can be treated as one under Section- 151 C.P.C.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sultana Jute Mills Ltd.

Section-7 of the ARA Act provides for a Special Period of Limitation of 30 days for preferring an appeal against the judgment of the decree of the ARA. The cross-objection filed beyond thirty days, was rightly rejected by the High Court Division as time barred— in view of Section-6 of the ARA Act a defendant can only challenge the decree of the ARA by filing an appeal under Section-7 of the Act—and is liable to pay necessary court fee and observe other formalities—the petitioners arc not entitled to file any cross objection. under Order-4 I, Rule-22 of the Code of Civil Procedure—the petitions are dismissed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M.

If any other meaning is given to section 7, then this section will mean that the judgment is appealable but the operative portion of the judgment, namely, the order, will have to be challenged otherwise than by way of appeal.

Instead of depositing the said money in the Court, the appellant deposited it in the current account maintained with the decree-holder Bank, Since the appellant has deposited 50% of the decreetal dues within the stipulated time, albeit in a non-traditional forum, the deposit should treated as a valid one.
