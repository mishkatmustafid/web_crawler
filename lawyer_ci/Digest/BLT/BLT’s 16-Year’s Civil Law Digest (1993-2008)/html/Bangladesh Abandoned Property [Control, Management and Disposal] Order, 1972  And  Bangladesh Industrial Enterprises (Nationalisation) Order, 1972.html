No. 27 of 1972. In view of the fact that three allied commercial concerns of the respondents have been released under the Court’s order this case deserves favourable consideration. So far as the Writ Petition is concerned, it must fail; the impugned judgment of the High Court Division is set aside and both the appeals are allowed, without any order as to costs.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bangladesh Vs.

But this vesting is also very much dependent upon the lawful placing of an industrial enterprise under a Corporation. Vesting is a consequence of placing. Placing is the cause, vesting is the consequence. If placing goes, vesting also falls through. So whether it is Article 10(1A) or Article 4(a), the result is the same. If there is a lawful placing, vesting takes place under Article 10(IA) and a double vesting takes place under Article4(1). But if the placing itself was unlawful, the vesting did not take place, either under Article-l0(1A) or under Article-4(l). The consequence may have a double protection, but if the cause is removed, no single protection is left.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bangladesh Vs. M/S.
