But the question before us as to whether the plaintiff himself continues to be so resident and is not otherwise disqualified for being a citizen by a under any law for the time being in force. By conferring the citizenship the respondent is deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh and has continued to be a permanent resident as a citizen of Bangladesh. The conferment of citizenship to the resident under Article 2 of the Order impliedly declared that the plaintiff- respondent qualified himself as a citizen of Bangladesh. The plaintiffs staying in Pakistan, without any formation of any opinion that his stay was prejudicial to the interest of Bangladesh under the circumstances should not be the consideration inasmuch as the concerned laws do not put any such disqualification to be deemed against a citizen of Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><strong>Sena Kalayan Sangstha Vs.

It has undergone several amendments. At present, law of citizenship is governed by two legislations the Citizenship Act, 1951 continued as an existing law and the Bangladesh Citizenship (Temporary Provisions) Order. 1972 (P.O. 149 of 1972) which came into force on 15 December, 1972, but it was given effect from 26 March, 1971.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><strong>Bangladesh vs. Prof. Golam Azam &amp; Ors. 3 BLT (AD)-3.</strong></em></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
