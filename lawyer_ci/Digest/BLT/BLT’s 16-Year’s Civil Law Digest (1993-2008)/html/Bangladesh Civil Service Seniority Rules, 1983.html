Public Service Commission, on the basis numericalnumbers to all BCS Exams so far held, and according to this, respondentNos.2-6l belongs to 1st BCS Examination whilst the appellants batch belong to2uid BCS Examination. This being the case appellants are as a batch junior tothe respondents—as a matter of fact, Rule 3(e) of the BCS Seniority Rules, 1983is not applicable for determining the seniority of the appellants as well as ofrespondent as they were directly recruited on the basis of two differentadvertisements, whereas Rule 3(e) is applicable only in case of determiningseniority involving lateral entrance.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>A.H.M.

Government always reserves the right to fix seniority according toexisting rules and principles. Sub-Rule 3(g) was nothing new as identicalprovision was already there in the general principle of the seniority, 1970.This incorporation in the BCS Seniority Rules 1983 was necessary to fulfill legalrequirement as it has protected the seniority of all officers of all cadresbelonging to first BCS examination not only of respondent Nos. 2-61. Therefore,sub-rule 3(g) was incorporated not only to give benefit to respondent Nos.2-61. Further, the President is clearly empowered under the provision ofArticle 133 to make rules prospectively and retrospectively and in that view itcannot be argued that Rule 3(9) of Rule 1982 cannot apply retrospectively inthe case of respondents who were appointed in 1984 and the appellants who wereappointed in 1983 and Rule 3(g) was not applicable with retrospective effect inthe case of the appellants and the respondents. It will also be seen that thedispute regarding seniority of the officers of 1982 regular batch and that of1982 special batch having arisen after amalgamation if 1992, Rule 3(g) whichcame into operation in 1985 will apply in determining the seniority of theofficers of these two batches and the question of giving retrospective effectof Rule 3(g) does not strictly arise.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>A.H.M.
