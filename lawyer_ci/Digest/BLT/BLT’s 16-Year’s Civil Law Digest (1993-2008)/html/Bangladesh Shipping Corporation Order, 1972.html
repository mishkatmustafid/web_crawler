We accordingly hold that delegation of power made in 1974 still continues. We have also found that under regulations 6(3) seniority-cum-merit is the criteria for promotion and seniority alone is not the criteria for promotion (Regulation 6(2)). We have also found that promotion in service cannot be claimed as a matter of right bit a person has a right to be considered for promotion.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bangladesh Shipping Corp. &amp; Ors.
