The forum and also timefor institution of proceeding or concluding the same are only questions ofprocedural law for they relate merely to the modes in which the court or thetribunal fulfils their function. It does not invest an incumbent with anyvested right. It is well settled that any procedural law is retrospective inits operation. Therefore, a subsequent omission by way of amendment in aprocedure cannot be of any consequence in respect of the proceeding against theappellant. Secondly, Section 6 of the General Clauses Act contemplates repealof an Act and not of a regulation under the rule making power. Admittedly, inthe instant case, whatever alteration was made it was made in respect of aregulation.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Chowdhury NasimulBaqui Vs.

The review forum further observed that the respondent -has beenhonorably acquitted from the charges and as such he is entitled to pay andallowances for the period of absence from his service as per Note-4 of Rule-72of BSR Part- I. A reference to Note- 4 of Rule-72 shows that ‘the period ofabsence of Government servant on reinstatement in ‘service after wrongfulretirement shall be treated as a period spent on duty and he will be entitledto pay and allowances admissible under clause (a) of this rule” Clause (a) ofRule 72 speaks that in case of honorably acquittal the incumbent is entitled tofull pay to which he would have been entitled if he had not been dismissed orremoved or suspended. In that view of the matter the Administrative AppellateTribunal rightly held that the respondent is entitled to the arrear pay andallowances. </p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Govt. of Bangladeshvs. A.
