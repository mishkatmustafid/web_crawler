Theofficials of the bank were aware that those imported clothing and fabrics werevery expensive and its quality would certainly deteriorate with the passage oftime, as such, they ought to have taken practical steps from commercial pointof view, to dispose of those goods as soon as possible, to the relief of theborrower as well as of the bank both. In this case, the bank in its prudence,ought to have taken effective steps to dispose of the imported goods soon afterits release from the port in 1977, on information to the defendant-borrower.The delay in such disposal in 1981 shows inefficiency on the part of theofficials of the bank, during which period the dues of the bank mounted to theprejudice of the defendant while the quality of the goods continued todeteriorate. Had those goods were disposed of earlier, it would have not only fetchedbetter price but also the dues of the defendant might have been substantiallyadjusted to the relief of both. In these circumstances, the bank cannot avoidits part of the responsibility altogether.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Janata Bank Vs.Alhaj Abdul Hannan Chowdhury 10 BLT (HCD)-482</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Section-5</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>ITCL isa business company and undergoing simple business on dividend and profit basisand it receives money from different persons and invest the same for different productsas contended by the petitioners counsel.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Held:The ITCL do not come either within the ambit of Mudaraba or Musharik Method ofbusiness.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Islamic Trade &amp;Commerce ltd.
