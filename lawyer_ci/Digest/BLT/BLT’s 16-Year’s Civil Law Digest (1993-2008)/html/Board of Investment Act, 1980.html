But law has its own way andis inclined to speak in its own language. When money talks judiciary must nottalk. Syndicated bridge financing for the Ekushey Television by some foreignand local banks and the investment, by the U.S.A finance company is neither acontribution to philanthropy nor an effort to do something for the noble causeof free media. It is a simple case of investment, and like every investment,the investment in ETV has its own risk. The third party rights exist and fallwith the Ekushey Television, since their interests are merged with that of ETV.The substantive legal principle in this regards that every person is subject tothe ordinary law within the jurisdiction. Therefore, all persons within thejurisdiction of Bangladesh are within Bangladesh rule of law. The foreign investorsin ETV are no exception to this principle.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>ETV Ltd. &amp; Anr.Vs.
