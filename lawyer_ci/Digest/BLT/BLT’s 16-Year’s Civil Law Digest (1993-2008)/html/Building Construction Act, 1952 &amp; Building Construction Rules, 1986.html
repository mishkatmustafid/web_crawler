RAJUK cannot now cancel the sanction in such an arbitrary mannerwithout giving notice claiming that due to Mistake and Misrepresentation thebuilding plans were sanctioned and permission was given for construction.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Rajuk &amp; Ors.

Then a show cause notice was issued upon the petitioner on9.5.93 directing him to demolish the unauthorised construction within 7 days ofreceipt. From the show cause notice dated 9.5.93 (Annexure-2 to theaffidavit-in-opposition) it appears that the direction was given to demolishthe entire building but without giving any reason for satisfaction of the RAJUKauthority for issuing such notice for demolishing of the building constructedon approved plan. it appears from annexure-2 to the supplementary affidavit ofthe petitioner that within 7 days of receipt of the show cause notice thepetitioner replied to the same but after about 2 and 12 months, respondent No.1served another notice directed to demolish the 2 storied building within 7 daysholding the reply not satisfactory. In that notice also no ground was given forwhich the entire building would be liable to be demolished, although the samewas constructed on approved plan of RAJUK. Admittedly the petitioner replied tothe show cause notice and according to Section3B of Building Construction Act,1952 the petitioner was required to be heard in persons but without affordinghim any such opportunity of being heard the RAJUK authority in violation ofSection-3B(3), long after expiry of 15 days served the notice on 17.8.93 uponthe petitioner directing him to demolish the entire building. So, it isapparent from the above factual position that the whole action of therespondents were not only malafide but also illegal and without lawfulauthority.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Mohammad AmirHossain Vs.

A 5-member committee was formed for identification of the buildingsthe height of which is greater than the fixed limit. It was also decided tocancel and/or reduce the height with information in the Air HQ and CivilAviation Authority. If the owner does not stop construction, then legal stepswould be taken. Both the decisions are general in nature and meant for thefuture. Nothing happened thereafter. There is nothing in respect of thebuilding in question even in June, 1999, In such view of the matter, we do notsee that rule 26 is any way attracted to the facts and in the circumstances ofthe case, Moreover, the Rules cannot override the mandatory provisions of theAct.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>A.
