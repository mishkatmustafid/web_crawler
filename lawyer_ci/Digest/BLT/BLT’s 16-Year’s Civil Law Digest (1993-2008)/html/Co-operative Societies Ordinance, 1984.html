Which proverb to following what given situation is a legislative exercise and it cannot be said that barring a thrice-elected Member of the Managing Committee to stand for election again till the lapse of 2 years since his last term expired is an unreasonable restriction.”</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

This provision has been made for the examination of correctness of the decision of the appellate authority. The authority or power so assigned to the District Judge as well as to the Additional District Judge is not limited to the question of law alone, but also authorizes to examine the correctness of the decision of the appellate authority in the background of the materials on record and as such while examining the correctness of the decision of the appellate authority the District Judge or the Additional District Judge is quite competent to examine the case of the parties in the background of the materials placed on record and in the instant case the learned Additional District Judge on scrutiny of the materials brought on record by the parties arrived at the finding that the deed dated 14.3.1980 was forged and fabricated one. The power so exercised by the learned. Additional District Judge is quite in accordance with law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md. Mojibul Huq alias Shaikh Vs.
