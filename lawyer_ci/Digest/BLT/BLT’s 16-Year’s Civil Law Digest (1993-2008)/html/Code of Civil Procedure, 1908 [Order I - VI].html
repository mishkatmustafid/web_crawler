The Bank on the application of the defendant Nos.1 and 2 allowed loan to enable them to lift the fertilizer which they purchased from the defendant Nos.3 and 4. An agreement was entered into between the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 and the defendant Nos.3 and 4 as regard sale of the fertilizer and the defendant Nos.1.and 2 by placing the said agreement for sale, as it appears, obtained loan and utilized the same for lifting the fertilizer from the defendant No.7. In the background of the said fact it cannot be said that the loan as the Bank granted to the defendant Nos.1 and 2 and utilized by them and the transaction that took place between the defendant Nos.1 and 2 and defendant Nos.3 and 4 is same or one. As such upon resorting to the provision of Order 1, Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure it cannot be said that Bank has quite legally filed the suit impleading the defendant Nos.3 and 4 as the defendants along with others.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sonali Bank Vs.

Trial Court decreed the suit on appeal, the Appellate Court dismissed the suit. The plaintiff-respondent then obtained a Rule in Civil Revision which is pending for final hearing — The petitioners are subsequent purchasers during the pendency of the suit, filed an application for addition of parties in the Revision case before the High Court Division —Held The issue in the suit was whether the three kabala deeds dated 5.5.76 were void abinitio or not. The issue is not whether the petitioners subsequent purchase of the suit land from the defendants during the pendency of the suit is valid or not. The petitioners are not competent persons to make any submission with regard to the three sale deeds dated 5.5.76—Their applications has been rightly rejected by the High Court Division.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Nesmohammad &amp; Ors.

The case of the plaintiff opposite party is that he got the suit property from his father Poyer Mamud Mondal and fufu Powchhari Bibi by way of settlement on obtaining dakhilas in the year of 1345 B.B., which facts are stoutly denied by the present petitioners. It has been contended in the application under Order I Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure that the original tenants Poyer Mamud Mondal and Powchhari Bibi never settled the suit land with the plaintiff and the plaintiffs claim of title by way of settlement is false. It has further been asserted that as co-owners of the suit property by inheritance like the plaintiff the petitions have been owning and possessing the suit property in ejmali. It was also contended in no uncertain terms that the plaintiffs’ papers in respect of the alleged settlement are totally false and fabricated. It thus appears that vital interests of the petitioners are involvement in the suit and they have definite say in the adjudication of the suit and they are interested in the result of the suit for declaration of title in the suit land. In the face of the clear and specific assertions made by the petitioners it is evident that vital interests of the petitioner are involved in the suit and as such their presence in the suit is necessary for proper adjudication of the controversies between the contending parties. The order of the learned Munsif, rejecting the petitioners’ prayer under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure is thus found to be illegal and arbitrary occasioning failure of justice and as such is same is liable to be set aside in the interest of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mst.

But in view of the peculiar facts that after about 25 years the plaintiff has sought for Specific Performance of Contract dated 15.4.70 in respect of an apparently joint property without making one of its admitted co-sharers namely, respondent No.1, as a party to the suit, the learned Judge of the High Court Division upon proper consideration of the material facts has rightly held that the case of respondent No.1 clearly come within the exception of the general principle of addition of party in a suit for Specific Performance of Contract and that he is a proper party to be added as a defendant in the suit for proper adjudication of the real dispute as to whether the bainapatra in question is a fake one and as to whether there was any family settlement as alleged in the plaint by the plaintiff on, the basis of which the contract in question with defendant Nos. 1-3 was entered into.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

His further contention is that as the vendor left for India as per provision of State Acquisition and Tenancy Act the property vested in the Government—it appears that the High Court Division considered the judgment of the trial court and the case of the present petitioner. It was found by the High Court Division that in such a suit the petitioner is not a necessary party as he is a third party. It was also found that in such. a suit only consideration is whether the vendors have executed ‘Bainapatra’ or not. In the suit, the Government who has allegedly taken over the property has entered appearance and contesting the same. The High Court Division found that in such a situation the presence of the present petitioner in the suit is not necessary—we are of the view that the High Court Division as well as the trial Court rightly rejected the petition filed under Order 1 Rule 10 read with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

The deed was executed by Abdul Jalil Sk. Abdul Jabbar Sk. and Abdul Gafur Sk. Abdu Gafur died and his heirs have been left out as defendants in the suit. In that view of the matter, the presence of the heirs of Abdul Gafur Sk. is necessary for effectually and completely to adjudicate upon the suit.

Since the petitioners were not at the scene when the suit was filed but they became interested in the result of the suit subsequently, they cannot be made coplaintiff, over the head of the unwilling plaintiffs.

The suit was filed on September 3, 1976. Thereafter on July 10, 1988 plaintiff filed petition seeking amendment of the plaint by inserting some facts as well as an additional relief i.e. b (1) seeking declaration that the deeds bearing Nos.l6157 and 16158 dated 27.10.1969 showing transfer of the property at 62 BCC Road to Ali Ahmed Khandker and Wali Mohammad Siddiqui by Jatindra Mohon Roy alias Sachindra Mohon Roy is forged, fabricated and that the transfers by the said Ali Ahmed Khandker and Wali Mohammad Siddiqui, to the defendant Nos.1 and 2 are illegal and not binding on the plaintiff. This prayer for amendment was allowed on November 19, 1988 —the plaintiff having had realized that in the absence of a declaration as was sought for in relief (b) (1) the other reliefs prayed for in the suit even if granted would not be complete one and thus the plaintiff having had sought for relief against the recipients of the deeds dated October 27, 1969 the recipients thereof were required to be made party and having had not impleaded the recipients of the deeds of October 27, 1969 the suit was certainly bad for defect of party so far the same concerned with relief (b)(1).</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A N M W Nabi &amp; Anr Vs.

In a suit for declaration of title it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove his exclusive possession. There is nothing on record to show that the plaintiff is in possession upon any portion of the suit land. Admittedly the plaintiff was a co-shaerer to the suit holding. Order 2 Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that every suit shall include the whole of the claim which the plaintiff is entitled to make in respect of the cause of action but a plaintiff may relinquish any portion of his claim in order to bring the suit within the jurisdiction of any Court. Thus in the instant suit, the plaintiff being not in possession ought to have sought two relieves, one for declaration of ejmali possession with defendant and thereafter for partition by metes and bounds in the suit land. That has not been done in the instant suit. The learned Additional District Judge has totally failed to consider this aspect and decreed the suit erroneously.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Abu Taher &amp; Ors Vs.

The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division found that apart from the declaration on the return of process server that summons were duly served, notices with acknowledgement dues were posted in the correct addresses of the defendants. The return of acknowledgement dues with postal endorsement clearly showed that notices were refused by the defendants. It is on record that along with service of summons, simultaneously notices with postal acknowledgement dues were sent in the correct addresses of the defendants. Apart from this, the defendants stated that they came to know about the ex parte decree from one Dinabandhu in presence of Rabindra Nath Biswas but curiously enough the said Dinabandhu was not examined by the defendants.

The plaintiff should have made a prayer in the plaint for demolition of the existing boundary wall between the plaintiffs and the petitioner’s land. It appears that plaintiff omitted to make a prayer for the same. As such the plaintiff should not be allowed to make a prayer by way of amendment at this stage as contended by the learned petitioners Counsel—Held: In the application for amendment there was a prayer made for demolishing of the wall and the super structure raised thereon. In the absence of any statement in the plaint that the defendant petitioner disposed the plaintiff opposite parry from the suit land and in absence of any prayer for demolishing the existing wall in the plaint we are of the view that the amendment proposed could at last change the character of the plaint which is not permissible under the law — the order passed by the learned Subordinate Judge is set aside.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

At the time of trial the plaintiff made out a case that his father had taken the lease for his (plaintiff’s) benefits and interest during his infancy. The departure in the evidence from the plaint has not been of such a dimension that the defendants were unfairly taken by surprise. The defendants suffered these evidence to be taken. Evidently this has caused no prejudice to the defendants. Both the parties had all opportunities to lay before the court all their evidence respecting the title and possession of the suit land.

The proposed amendment to add further of C-I, that the joint declaration dated 01 .08.1991 to be declared void ab inition and be cancelled and C-III that, defendant No.2 and/or no 3 to be declared liable and responsible to pay the money to be assessed by Defendant No. 1 in different adjudication orders on the basis of Import General Manifest are not at all necessary for adjudication of the aforesaid real issues. Further relief of C-II for a money decree for a sum of Taka 3,90,735 and C-IV a decree of mandatory injunction directing defendant No. 2 and 3 to pay the penalty and other amount to be assessed by Defendant No. 1 are equally not necessary. Because if the plaintiff succeeds to fix the responsibility of Defendant No. 1 and or No. 3 and gets a decree accordingly then, pursuant to the decree the Defendant No. 1 would be obliged to return gets a decree realized from the plaintiff on 07.02.1999 and would need no mandate from the court to realize the dues from the agent found responsible.
