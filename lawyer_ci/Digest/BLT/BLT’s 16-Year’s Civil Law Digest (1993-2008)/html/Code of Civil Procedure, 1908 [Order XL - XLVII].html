Mokshed Ali Biswas &amp; Ors. 4 BLT (AD)-4.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Order-40 Rule-1</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Appointment of receiver</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It appears that the trial court with a view to saving the property of the suit from being sold in auction due to non-payment of tax and duties passed the order for appointment of receiver with an observation that whether the plaintiffs have acquired any right, title in the suit property will be decided in the suit itself. Upon such finding of the trial court and in the facts and circumstances of the case it cannot be said that the learned Judge of the High Court Division has committed an error of law in upholding the impugned order of the trial court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mohammad Mosharef Hossain &amp; Ors.

Save and except the said assertion there is no other case brought before the Court for getting an order for appointment of receiver. The order of status quo in respect of possession was passed on contest on 13.4.1999 and that after that order the plaintiff being in possession was receiving rent from the shop keepers and that he took an attempt to repair shops. The defendant-opposite parties being not in physical possession and having accepted the order of status quo in respect of possession in the suit shops were not entitled to make application for appointment of receiver long after about 7 years of the status quo order was passed. Order-40 Rules 1(2) is clear bar in allowing the prayer for appointment of receiver.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

Before allowing an application it should be the duty of the court to see that the rights of the parties are not jeopardized and the ends of justice not defeated.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

Out of six sisters and two brothers, Plaintiff No. 1 only wants appointment of a receiver. And her success in the suit mainly depends on the proof that the registered deed of partition was forged and void, and/or not acted upon. In the circumstances, introduction of a third party as a receiver of the valuable property cannot be surely said would not result in Mismanagement of or harm to the property — there should be no appointment of a receiver.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

Imam Sharif, the common ancestor of both the parties of suit, it does not appear that the learned Judges of the High Court Division have passed the impugned order of appointment of receiver inequitably and in violation of Rule 1(2) of Order 40 C.P.C.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mohammad Moslem Khan &amp; Ors. Vs. Mohammad MohsinKhan &amp; Ors. 7BLT(AD)-101</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Order-41 Rule 11(1)</p><p>A close reading of Order 41 Rule 11(1) read with Rules 12 and 13 leads to the irresistible conclusion that the impugned judgment and order is not an order of dismissal of the appeal. It is an order finally disposing the appeal without admission of the appeal and without serving notice upon the respondent. Such order as has been passed under the impugned judgment and order is not an order of dismissal of appeal rather it is a final order setting aside the order of status quo passed by the trial court without giving an opportunity to the respondent to which she was entitled to. The judgment and order impugned has no legal sanction in that it is not an order within the meaning of order 41 Rule 11(1) C.P.O.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Most.

Appeals Section 43 of the Waqf Ordinance, Appeals were dismissed for default—Held: From a consideration of the provisions of the Code as well as Section 43 of the Waqf ordinance it appears that as the District Judge as contemplated under Section 43 of the Waqf Ordinance is not a persona designata but a court and as it is a court of civil nature. the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure is very much attracted in the present case and accordingly the provisions of Order-41 Rule- 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure is available to the respondents.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Aminul Haque Shah Chowdhury Vs.

When it is found that the appellant is guilty of gross negligence in prosecuting his appeal, he cannot be allowed to have mercy of the court in the interest of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

How could an order of remand be made to fill up the lacunae left by the plaintiff himself? The High Court Division also ignored the con current finding of the Courts below that the defendants have been in possession of the suit land on the basis of the sale deeds in question. The order of remand was therefore absolutely uncalled for.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md. Nazir Hossain Khan &amp; Anr. Vs.

Upon such finding the High Court Division remanded the case the trial Court for the ends of justice and ordered that the parties should be given opportunity to prove their respective case in accordance with law. As the High Court Division remanded the case for fresh trial with liberty to the parties to adduce evidence to prove their cases the order of remand was made legally we do not find that the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division occasioned any failure of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Amal Bhushan Singha Vs, Khalokuzzaman. &amp; Ors. 7BLT (AD)-311</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Order-41 Rule-23</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Remand—We hold that the Division Bench ought to have either dismissed the appeal for default or ought to have adjourned it to some other date as it was a part-heard appeal or could have passed other orders but it was certainly not authorised to consider the appeal in the absence of the appellant and decide it on merits. It was simply an unacceptable manner of disposal of the appeal and in that view of the matter, the First Appeal ought to be remanded to the High Court Division for fresh hearing on merit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Govt. of Bangladesh &amp; Anr Vs.

It appears that he has distributed the property leaving aside Kha schedule property which was sold by the defendant No. 1 to defendant No.2 but that has also must come with the partition and this may be allotted to defendant No. 1 which admittedly was inherited by the plaintiff and defendant No. 1—We are inclined to send the case back to the trial court for fresh hearing and disposal of the matter.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bina Roy Chowdhury Vs.

In revision High Court Division found that there are Misreading of evidences and that both the Courts below have not at all considered the material evidence on record and for that he send the case back on remand to the trial court — it is not consonance with equity and justice that an old case of 30 years could be remanded so lightly as has been done by the High Court Division even if it is accepted that there is Misreading of evidence and non-consideration of material evidence then the High Court Division was within its competence to dispose of the matter on the materials on record without remanding the suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">H.

Share of Iman Sheikh has not been auction-sold and the petitioner purchased the share of Iman Sheikh and from disinterested heirs of Mohir Sheikh—so, since the holding has not been petitioned amongst the co-sharer and both the parties are co-shared of the suit properties and the permanent injunction suit generally cannot lie in such a holding as the petitioner filed the suit for injunction against co-sharer with a Misconceived idea and the court decided the title of the suit property against him—the Courts below decided the partition suit on the basis of the title and possession decided in the suit for permanent injunction between the part is —the partition suit is sent back on Order of remand by the appellate court on remand for fresh trial.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

It is settled principles of law that unnecessary order of remand entails hardship, agony of fresh hearing and additional expenditure and the same is to be deprecated and discouraged as it tends to delay the administration of justice far from advancing its course.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Abdul Quiyum Jalali Ponkhi Vs.

Superior courts generally show aversion to an order of remand in old cases and it is warranted in law that the court should decide the issues on the basis of evidences on record. It is well settled that remand orders are not to be made as a matter of course and it should be avoided as far as possible when there are sufficient evidence on record and specially the remand orders are disapproved and deprecated in old cases. The case of Mustafizur Rahman Vs. Abdul Kader, 3 BLC (AD) 38 may be noted in this connection that an order cannot be held more unconscionable and unjust than to send the case back on remand to the trial court for fresh disposal after such a long laps of time. After more than 27 years when as per evidence on record the defendant No.1 who palpably held documents of title to the suit property is now about 80 years of age and forsaken and abandoned by the plaintiff husband by contracting a second marriage behind her back and without her consent before even filing the present suit, the present suit needs to be decided on the basis of evidence on record in the ends of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A.H.

The above is the general as well as broad principle of law. But there may be case (s) as the instant one, even though there is no prayer from the parties in the proceeding for sending the suit back to the trial Court or to the lower appellate Court for disposal where right of the parties to the proceeding so send back Of remand is depended on the result of a suit filed earlier still remains pending the order of remand by the appellate/higher Court made in such a situation cannot he considered unjustified.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Begum Lutfunnessa Vs.Md.

The High Court Division, however, remanded the suit to the lower appellate Court for writing a proper judgment in accordance with law. The evidence on record are sufficient to dispose of the case in its revisional jurisdiction under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and in that view of the point of law involved in this case decision on the contesting issues involved in the suit could be given by the High Court Division by assessing the evidence. This Court feel that it should not decide the points raised in this appeal and with all fairness and keeping the spirit of expeditious disposal of the suit, the High Court Division could dispose of the rule upon hearing the parties on the merit of the suit considering the pleadings and the evidence on record together with the point of law involved in the case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mrs. Zakaria Chowdhury &amp; Ors Vs.

An order of remand can be passed if it is necessary to do so in the interest of justice. The power of remand must be regulated by the provision of rule 23 of order 41 and that inherent powers under section 151 of the Code cannot be exercised by the appellate court to order remand.

The appellate Court is also required to set aside the material findings of the trial Court with reference to the evidence on record adverting to the reasons assigned by it.

We also find that the application by the respondent under Order I Rule 10 of the Code has not yet been disposed of. It is also a fact that the alleged existence of a daughter of Khairunnessa was canvassed for the first time before the High Court Division and that also without any support of evidence. Again, all throughout haziras were filed before the trial court on behalf of the deceased defendant Khairunnessa till 20 July 1985 when Nurul Islam made an application disclosing her death. It is obvious that the plaintiff had no inkling of the death of Khairunnessa till 20 July 1985. It is only in or about the middle of November, 1985 that the plaintiff seems to have the definite knowledge of the death of Khairunnessa without leaving any heir behind. He then came up with an application on 17 November 1985 praying for amendment of the plaint by way of substituting the Government for Khairunnessa. The learned Assistant Judge, however passed an order on 22 December 1985 recording of abatement of the suit. The plaintiff made the application for setting aside the abatement after the order was passed on 22 December 1985 which is within 14 days of the order. The learned Judge of the High Court Division completely overlooked these facts and set aside the order of the learned Assistant Judge dated 13 August 1987. The learned Single Judge laid unnecessary stress upon certain averments in the written statement which were only matters of contest between the parties at the trial and hart no bearing upon the abatement. In our opinion the impugned judgment of the High Court Division is a product of non application of judicial mind and suffers from patent illegality.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

It was the case of the plaintiffs that land described in schedule ‘Kha accreted in 1935 to the C.S. Plots. If that assertion of the plaintiffs is accepted then it would have been quite natural to have the mention of the accreted land in the kabalas of the years between 1943 and 1968 and there would been mention of said fact upon referring to the plot(s) to which there was accretion of land and the quantity thereof, but conspicuously in the deeds of the years 1943- 1968 there is no mention of the plot of the accreted land nor quantity of land accreted to particular C.S. plot and also there is no mention of quantity as stated hereinbefore. It was the definite case of the defendants that there was no existence of accreted land till 1963 i.e. at the time when the S.A. record was made final. Had there been any accretion of land to the C. S. plot during S. A. survey the same would have surely been recorded in the S.A. Record which was published on 1.8.1963. In the aforesaid state of the matter it has been observed by the trial Court that there was no reason to believe that the accreted land was in existence in 1963. It may be mentioned that during the period between 1935-1947 no rent was paid by the plaintiffs in respect of the land said to have accreted to the C.S. plots — The trial Court on consideration of the entire materials on record arriving at the finding that plaintiffs have no title and possession in the land in suit and that accreted land settled with the defendant Nos.6-8 was the khas land of the Government. Since the plaintiffs have no right, title and interest as well as possession in the land in suit, the suit as framed is not maintainable as per provision of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act —Held: on reading the judgment of the High Court Division it is seen that the said Division did not at all applied its mind to the reasonings and findings of the trial Court while disposing of the suit and that also was not collect in arriving at the finding that the trial Court was unaware of the law laid down by this Division in the case reported in 31 DLR (AD) 195.

The reason upon which the review application was rejected must be held to be unconscionable and erroneous and so also was the memo of the Ministry of land impugned in the writ petition. We, therefore, come to the conclusion that the High Court Division ought to have allowed the review application and ultimately it ought to have declared the impugned memo of the Ministry of Land as illegal without lawful authority and of no legal effect.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Ratul Basu &amp; Ors.

According to him, the concept he is advocating is already recognized as a general principle of law and applied both by the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. It aims at maintaining a proper balance between any adverse effect, which the court’s decision may have on the rights, liberties or interests of persons, and the purpose which the court pursues in its judgment. It involves the exercise of balancing relevant considerations like, the balancing test, the necessary test and the suitability test. This concept involves the court to evaluate whether proportionate weight has been attacked to one other consideration relevant to the decision. As a ground judicial review it is absolutely a new concept to our jurisprudence. And in accepting it this court shall have to accord different weights to different ends or purposes and different means which cannot be allowed in a review.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">E.

Not mere error of fact and law, but error apparent on the face of the record is a ground for Review, Review lies only on a patent error. There is real distinction between a mere erroneous decision and an error apparent on the face of the record. Error apparent on face of record is an error which can be seen by a mere perusal of record without reference to any other matter and to find out error one has not to scrutinize the evidence or record but it should be self evident from a perusal of record itself and can be pinpointed without elaborate examination.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Haji Md.

The petitioner appeared and contested the case stating, inter alia, that he was not a defaulter. On the date for further examination of the petitioner, an application was filed on behalf of the petitioner seeking leave of the court to ask him two specific questions, namely (1) what was the time of repayment of the loan sanctioned by the Krishi Bank and how this time has been given? and (b) was the payment of installment re-scheduled by the Bank and if so what are the re-scheduled dates? The tribunal rejected the said application, the High Court Division observed that the petitioner should be allowed to give his reply in question No. 1, without saying anything about question No.2.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Held: It is difficult to appreciate why the Tribunal rejected the prayer for the aforesaid 2 questions to be put to the petitioner because his case apparently was that he was not a defaulter.
