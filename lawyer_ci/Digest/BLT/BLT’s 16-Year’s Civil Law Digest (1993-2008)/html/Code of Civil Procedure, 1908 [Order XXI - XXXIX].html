It seems that before filing of this present application the judgment debtor has also preferred similar application before this court which went up to Appellate Division and that was rejected. Therefore under this circumstances the application alleging that excess land is going to be delivered is just a decree to make delay in executing and delivering the possession of the decreetal land. Therefore the executing court must not make further delay in delivery of possession in respect of decreetal land by appointing an Advocate Commissioner after demarcating the boundary in respect of 55 Bighas of land as per schedule within one month from the date of receipt of this order.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bikram Baral &amp; Ors.

Hazi Jahan Ara Begum &amp; Ors. 9BLT (AD)-207</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Order-21 Rule-16</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It appears from the judgment of the Court of appeal below that the plaintiff received copy of the application for execution of the decree endorsing thereon ‘no objection” through his Advocate Zakir Hossain and as such it cannot be said that copy of application for execution of the decree was not served under Order 21 Rule 16 of the Code. When the petitioner himself consented to the execution of the decree by endorsing “no objection” he is debarred from raising the question of service of notice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

And quotable set off can be claimed in a case where cross demands arise out of the same transaction may not arise out of the same transaction hut they are so connection in the nature or circumstances that it would be inequitable to allow one party to separate suit or proceedings. Granting of set off however rests entirely with the discretion of the Court, No party, of course, as of right can claim such set off. It is needless to say that the discretion is to be exercised judicially. In such view of the matter the claim of the judgment debtor for adjustment.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Shankar Lat Das Vs.

As the Court below acted in a manner, which is not provided in law, the process of execution of the decree will be delayed to the prejudice of the petitioners decree holders.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Haji Jahanara Begum &amp; Ors.

For the purpose of the Rule, the court of the Subordinate Judge and Artha Rin Adalat and the Court of the Subordinate Judge are not the same Courts.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">BCIC Vs.

The Executing court got no power to order stay of execution where the suit is against Decree Holder filed by Third Party. Since, the petitioner is not a party to the suit and the decree and Execution case he got no legal right or character to maintain any application under Rule 29 of Order 21 of the Code to stay further proceeding of Title Execution case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Rotis chandra Das Vs.

Since by the impugned order the petitioner No. 1 has been sentenced to undergo civil imprisonment for 15 days the age of the petitioner No. 1 is of no relevance. In that view of the matter I am of the view that in the instant case no lenient view can be taken simply on the ground that the petitioner No. 1 is aged about 60 years and fact remains that he has violated the courts order and ousted the plaintiff opposite party from the suit land.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Madhu &amp; Ors Vs.

Hajera Khatun and ors 36 DLR (AD) 183 executing court attached the properties of the judgment debtors for alleged disobedience of a decree for perpetual injunction. District Judge in revision set aside the order of the executing Court holding that an application under order 21 rule 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure was not maintainable. On further revision under the repealed provision of Section 115(3) of the Code. High Court Division made the rule absolute. Leave was granted at the instance of the judgment debtors by this Division to consider the question whether a petition under order 21 rule 32 of the Code was maintainable. The appeal was allowed and the case was sent back to the trial court to give an opportunity to the parties to prove that the defendants Judgment debtors had willfully disobeyed the order of injunction impliedly holding the order of injunction impliedly holding that application under order 21 rule 32 of the Code was maintainable. A Division Bench of the High Court Division with one of us and presided over by Ismail Uddin Sarker J. heard a reference made by D. M. Ansaruddin Ahmed J. to resolve the conflicting decisions of different Single Benches as to the maintainability of an application under order 21 rule 32 of the Code. The said Division Bench relying on the aforesaid decision of this Division held that such an application is maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Zainal Abedin &amp; Anr.

Any objection against such allotment that might be raised to such allotment must have been met with before the preliminary decree was made final. Once a final decree is passed on the basis of such allotment and after exhausting all procedures against such final decree by way of appeal or otherwise, when such decree was put into execution for possession of the lot allotted to the decree-holder, and the application did not suffer from any defect, it is the duty of the executing Court to deliver possession to the decree holder under sub-rule (1) of Order 21 Rule 35 of the Code, and if necessary, by removing all obstructions or obstacles put up by the judgment-debtors.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mirza Abdul Ban Beg &amp; Ors Vs.

The High Court Division rightly held that the principle of resjudicata is not applicable in such proceeding.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sonali Bank Vs. S.

The order was communicated to the said Commercial Court for taking necessary steps. By his order dated 15.03.1997 the Subordinate Judge, First Court again requested the Commercial Court No. 1 to take steps in light of his order dated 22.07.1989 On further prayer of the petitioner dated 25.03.1997, the Subordinate Judge. First court wrote a letter to the said Commercial court requesting him to remit the decreetal amount of Taka 58,08,215 out of the fixed deposit. The steps taken and the procedure followed by the Subordinate Judge. First Court we are afraid fulfilled the requirements of Order XXI Rule 52 of the Code to make the attachment valid. Because, to effect a valid attachment in respect of the fixed deposit, it was necessary to issue a prior notice under Rule 52 of Order XII of the Code as the notice is a condition precedent to the order of attachment as is stated in Kanhayalal Hanmantrao v Reginald Mathalone, AIR 1951 Nag 52, and Then Mal v Income Tax Officer 67 CWN 916 We could not find any such statutory notice was ever issued by the Subordinate Judge before attaching the fixed deposit which is already in the custody of the Commercial Court No. 1 by prior attachment. The communication of the order dated 22.07.1989 of the Subordinate Judge to the Commercial Court No. 1 is not sanctioned by the Rule.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

C. P. C. be disposed of afresh in accordance with law reviewing the impugned order passed by the Executing Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mohiuddin Ahmed Vs MIDAS &amp; Anr 16 BLT (HCD)290</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Order —21 Rule—58</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The learned executive Court without carrying on any investigation into the prayer has rejected the said application only on the reason that the present petitioners are sons, daughter and wife of the judgment debtor</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">This provision imposes duty upon the Executing Court for holding a true investigation mandatorily but in the instant case without executing any investigation the court has rejected the application of the present petitioner summarily by a non speaking order. In view of the non-speaking order and that the impugned order having passed without having any investigation, we are of the view that the impugned order has been passed not in accordance with the provision of order 21 Rule 58 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mst.

But such possession such be independent of the judgment debtor and not through the judgment debtor within the meaning of Rule-61.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mohammad Yunus Mia &amp; Ors.

I find that the executing Court proceed not in accordance with the provision of order 21 Rule 100(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

But as a matter of practice such application is made furnishing the legal requirements viz, the date of death of the deceased, names and other particulars of his heirs to be substituted and their relationship with the deceased and as to whether such applica tion has been made within the prescribed period of limitation.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

Opposite parties No. 1-5 claim that they are in possession of the suit land on the basis of purchase from sole plaintiff Lal Mohon by registered deeds and that they have acquired interest in the suit land. Therefore, they claim that they may be allowed to prosecute the suit since Lal Mohon is dead—Held: No question of substitution of the opposite parties No. 1-5 under Order 22 Rule 3 C.P.C the death of sole plaintiff Lal Mohon arises at all, firstly because, they opposite parties are not the legal heirs of the deceased Lal Mohon nor successors of the deceased nor are they executors or administrators of the deceased’s estate appointed by the deceased and as such, they are not legal representatives within the meaning of 2(11) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Secondly since the heirs of Lal Mohon are already on record on question of abetment arises at all —l am of the view that Order 22 Rule 10 C.P.C is the only provision of law on which, they may be allowed to be substituted and leave to be granted to continue the suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Abu Taher Bhuiyan Vs.

During pendency of these cases opposite party No. 2, 13 &amp; 22 died leaving behind heirs. The petitioners of all these cases filed petitions for striking out the name of the deceased opposite parties — the trial court rejected the prayer for striking out the names of deceased opposite parties on the ground that the case already abated for not substituting the heirs of those deceased opposite parties—the lower appellate court set aside the order of abatement the High Court Division affirmed the appellate order — Held The High Court Division rightly held that the amendment made by the Calcutta High Court before 1947 is a part of Bangladesh law and are effective as other laws in Bangladesh—the heirs of the deceased defendants were not necessary parties because their predecessors in spite of receipt of notices of the original cases did not appear and file any application for ratable pre-emption as co-petitioners—petition is dismissed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Most T.

Since evidently the final decree was passed against deceased defendant No. 5 Abdus Salam, after two months of his death without bringing his legal representatives on record by way of substitution, it is to be held that vital interests of the petitioners have been adversely affected in effecting the final decree in their absence.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Kabirunnessa &amp; Ors Vs.

The share of the Plaintiff No. 1 and 2 has not been specified in the suit-stood abated as a whole on account of the death of the Respondent No. 2 and on account of non substitution of his heirs within 90 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

Thereafter, the suit was transferred to the Court of Munsif at Birganj and was renumbered as Other Class Suit No. 5 of 1984. This was recorded in the Order sheet of the said Court on 30.9.1984. It appears from the order sheet that on 2.12.1984, the defendants made their appearance and 10.12.1984 was fixed for settling date of the suit. By the Order No. 5, dated 10.12.1984, the settling date was again fixed on 25.12.1984. In the meantime earlier on 12.12.1984, the heirs of the plaintiff filed an application divulging the date of death of the plaintiff on 28.9.1984 and prayed for amendment of the plaint by substituting them in place of the deceased plaintiff. This shows that there was no laches on their part in appearing and making the application for substitution on the very first opportunity. Even if we assume that the sole plaintiff died on 28.7.1984 but because of the transfer of the suit obviously no petition could be made within the statutory period of 90 days and the learned Assistant Judge was well justified in holding that there was substantial cause for which the heirs of the sole deceased plaintiff could not make their appearance earlier within the statutory period of limitation specially when the materials on record do not disclose culpable negligence or mala fides on their part.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Hafizuddin &amp; Anr Vs.

To substantiate the legal representatives of the deceased party on setting aside abatement, the applicant is required to prove that he had no earlier knowledge about the death of the deceased party and he had no laches and negligence in making the prayer for setting aside abatement. In view of the fact that abatement is essentially a technical default, which may deal a shattering blow to his claims, the court is usually inclined to consider an application for setting aside abatement liberally, unless there are gross laches and negligence on the part of the applicant.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Garakh Nath Shib Thakur Vs. Md. Fatikuddin Mondal &amp; Ors. 7BLT (HCD)-202</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Order-22 Rule-9(2)(3)</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In the instant case, though the learned Subordinate Judge did not accept that plaintiff No. 14 was the sole tadbirkar for the plaintiffs in the suit, he found that plaintiff No. 1 was a simpleton and took a merciful view to the default of the surviving plaintiffs in the absence of any willful negligence on their part. He gave them the benefit of section 5 of the limitation Act and set aside the order of abatement in his discretion to achieve the ends of justice—The application for substitution after setting aside abatement filed in the present case substantially contains the prayer for condonation of the delay describing circumstances. Therefore the Subordinate Judge was not much wrong in treating the application as one also for condonation of delay.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Abdul Kader Mondal &amp;Ors. Vs. Md.

The appointment of a guardian, therefore, of minor heirs of defendant who died during pendency of suit is absolutely necessary. A minor cannot be considered to be a party to suit unless he is properly represented in a suit by a duly qualified and competent guardian. When a minor has legally become a party to the suit, only then the court would acquire jurisdiction to decide the case. Decree passed against an unrepresented minor defendant being a decree against a person not a party to the suit would be without jurisdiction, null and void.
