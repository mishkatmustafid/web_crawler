The appeal was dismissed but the High Court Division while maintaining the same found that as Abul Kasham Hawlader was not present in the country during the pendency of the previous suit and the Miscellaneous proceeding thereto and hence the impugned judgment and decree is not binding upon him as the same was fraudulently obtained-Held; A decree in a suit declaring that the decree is passed in Title Suit No.49 of 1958 dated 6.12.1958 is fraudulent and not binding upon the plaintiff is not a devisable one and as such aforesaid finding of the High Court Division is unwarranted because the decree against other plaintiffs that has been maintained was opposed to law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Shamsun Nahar Begum &amp; Org.

Explanation to Section 2(2) provides that ‘a decree is preliminary when further proceedings have to be taken before the suit can be completely dispose of. It is final when such adjudication completely disposes of the suit.” In a suit for partition, after filing of the report along with the case map, field book, saham list by the Advocate Commissioner final decree takes effect and thereafter remains nothing to be done. In a pre-emption proceeding under Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, the question of co-shareship in the tenancy is relevant, but in Section 24(1) of Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act the co-shareship in the land is material. In that view of the matter, the passing of the final decree in a partition suit finally determines the right of the co-sharers in the land. Hence, the application for the preemptor-respondents on the basis of co-sharership is not maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md. Shafiuddin Chowdhury Vs.

This fact as mentioned in his own plaint shows that he has got no interest in the said company and cannot file a suit on its behalf without any specific and tangible interest in the said company.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Shafi A.

Staff (Service) Rules, 1965 ceased to play any role in controlling, governing and regulating the service of any employer or officer of Uttara Bank Limited and termination order issued on 19.09.1981 was under a dead (Service) Rules and dead law and that termination order is absolutely a nullity and without jurisdiction. When an order is nullity, ultravires and without jurisdiction validity of that can be very much challenged under the Ordinary Civil Jurisdiction in as much as the Civil Court or any Tribunal got the authority to see and examine whether action taken or done in any proceeding is a nullity and Quarum Non Judice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Uttara Bank Limited Vs.

The issues are essentially civil in nature. Under Section 9 of the Code all suits of civil nature will lie in civil courts unless the same is specially barred by specific provision of law. It is now well settled by a long line of authorities that jurisdiction of a civil court cannot readily be read to have stood ousted.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Kamrul Ahsan &amp; Ors Vs.

On 18.11.1982 the plaintiff was dismissed from service under the service rules of the Bank.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Held I find from the record that after the plaintiff was put under suspension, proceeded with under the Banks Old Service Rules and finally dismissed from service on 18.11.1982 under the Bank’s Service Rule No. 39. His departmental appeal was also dismissed under Rule not 43 on 25.091984. All though he was proceeded with under the Service Rules of the Bank. This is permitted under Section-3 of the SO Act, On 18.111982 when he was dismissed for service, the defendant Bank was not brought within the ambit of the AT Act, So the plaintiff had no scope to seek remedy under the AT Act, 1981, Equally, as the plaintiff was not dismissed under any provision of the SO Act. 1965 he had also no right to go to the labour court established under the Industrial Relations Ordinance —the plaintiff opted to sue in a Civil Court and he is quite entitled to proceed with his suit in the Civil Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sonali Bank &amp; Ors.

Respondent No. 1 the wife of the insured was made his nominee in the policy. On 25.03.1997 Rafiqul Islam died whereupon the respondent No.1 made the insurance claim to the appellant. On inquiry, the claim was found valid. As the insured amount was not being paid by the appellant the dispute was referred to the Controller of Insurance, respondent No. 3 purportedly under Section 47A of the Insurance Act, 1938, shortly the Act, On 28.01.1998 respondent No. 3 in presence of representatives of both the appellant and respondent No. 1 found the claim valid and asked the appellant to pay claim. Pursuant to the order of the respondent No. 3 respondent 1 started Money Execution No. 06 of 1998 for recovery of the insured amount in the above Court. Thereafter the appellant instituted the above T S No. 30/1999 in the same Court for declaration that the order of respondent No. 3 dated 28.Ol.1998 vide letter No. ll21/53/197172 asking the appellant to pay insured amount to the respondent No.1 is illegal, malafide, void and not binding upon the appellant—we do not have any doubt that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the appellant has no right to sue in a civil Court for the simple reason that an insurer does not have any such right under the law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Homeland Life Ins.

One essential but of the applicability of section 10 C.P.C. is whether the decision in the earlier suit will operate as resjudicata in the subsequent suit. Even if the applicant succeeds in proving that some of the issues of the two suits are common but others are not. still then he is not entitled to get further proceedings of the subsequent suit stayed till the disposal of the previous suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

Learned Senior Assistant Judge rejected the application of the defendants on the ground that the two suits are not of same nature and character and the cause of action in the two suits are different—Held: I find that at least two suit plots in the above two suits are the same and in two courts proceeding are pending and to avoid conflict of judgments and to avoid possibility of multiplicity of proceeding. the subsequent suit should he stayed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Shamsul Huq Vs.

So the writ petitioner-respondents cannot seek relief against the said sale deed dated 09.11.1989 by filing another Writ Petition No. 4127 of 1992. Principle of resjudicata under Section 11 of the Code is applicable in a writ proceeding as the same is also a civil proceeding. We are, therefore, of the view that relief claimed in writ Petition No. 4127 of 1992 filed by the writ petitioner-respondents against the appellants of both the appeals was baited by the principle of constructive resjudicata for implied refusal of their claim in respect of the self same sale deed dated 09.11.1989 in writ Petition No. 798 of 1990.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Govt. of Bangladesh &amp; Ors.

The defendant in the said suit including the plaintiff-respondent No. 1 denying the claim of alleged mortgage, it may be mentioned here that; the bank also did not claim that on 17.3.1988 the mortgage executed a memorandum of deposit of title deed on 9.3.1989 executed another agreement for creating further charge on the deed for the loan of Coast Marine Lines Limited. Admittedly no issue on the basis of the said denial of the parties was framed regarding the disputed nature of mortgage as alleged in the said Artha Rin Adalat Suit. D.W.I Mr. Azfar Ahmed an officer of the Bank and tadbirkar has deposed in that suit that the plaintiff respondent No.1 was not a surety and that defendant No.4 did not keep the land in question as security for the loan but the instant case was a suit for the declaration, inter alia, that the plaintiffs property was not subject-matter of security in respect of the loan, the subject-matter of Artha Rin Adalat Suit No.147 of 1992.— Held; in the instant suit as we have found that no such issue was framed regarding the subject-matter of present suit and decision was arrived at and the issue of the present suit was not directly or substantially an issue in the previous suit so as to render the present suit barred by the principle of resjudicata. The High Court Division was not also unmindful as to the question of res judicata to operate as a bar in the instant suit and the trial Court as well on consideration of the material on record arrived at a finding that the suit is not barred by res-judicata.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The Oriental Bank Ltd.

Similarly objection as to pecuniary jurisdiction which is for the purpose of Court fee and availing a forum of appeal / revision is mostly of formal nature and the Court with higher pecuniary jurisdiction could decide a suit of lower pecuniary value and would not render the decree void.

There is real distinction between a mere erroneous decision and an error apparent on the face of the record. Error apparent on the face of record is an error which can be seen by mere perusal of record without reference to an’ other matter and to find out such error one has not to scrutinize the evidence or record but it should be self-evident from a perusal of the record itself and can be pinpointed without elaborate examination.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Farmisi Khatun Vs.
