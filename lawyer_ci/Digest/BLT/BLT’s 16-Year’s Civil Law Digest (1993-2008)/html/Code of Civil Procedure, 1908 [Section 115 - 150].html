In appropriate cases High Court Division may suo-motu exercise such jurisdiction to rectify failure of justice. But as a matter of long standing practice one has to exercise vigilance and promptness in invoking the revisional jurisdiction at the earliest opportunity without causing any inordinate delay. Preferably within 90 days from the decree or order complained against as has been prescribed for preferring an appeal to the High Court Division from any decree or order of a court subordinate to it — relied on 39 DLR (AD) 205.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A.D.C.

That being the legal position we do not find that the petitioner cannot seek relief under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure against the impugned order, in as much as. Section 115 uses the expression “Where no appeal lies” Section 115 applies. Therefore on this Count we are not inclined to invoke our jurisdiction under Article 102 of our Constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Serajuddin Hawlader Vs.

Without reversing the findings of the courts below on the grounds mentioned in Section 115 C.P.C the High Court Division has no jurisdiction to disturb the final findings of facts. It cannot superimpose itself as a third court for fresh appreciation of evidence.

The exercise undertaken by the learned Judges was not only gratuitous but wholly illegal being not within their jurisdiction under the Code of Civil Procedure —In the circumstances of the case, we feel compelled to observe that the discussion on polygamy in Islam and recommendation thereon as recorded in the impugned judgment should be taken to be deleted lest it may create confusion in the mind of the Subordinate Courts and the people at large.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

If in revisional jurisdiction the High Court Division rides roughshod over both substantive and procedural law then a litigant does not know what will happen to his case, what course will it take and what relief will ultimately emerge. This is a travesty of justice, as we know it. The suo motu exercise in the manner it was done, besides being without jurisdiction was an act of extreme judicial indiscretion.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Per Bimalendu Bikash Roy Choudhury, J: Plaintiff No.1 Shamsun Nahar Begum never appealed against the decree of the original court nor did she take any appeal therefrom. She did not also prefer any revision. In such circumstances the learned Judges of the High Court Division had no jurisdiction to give her any further relief beyond what was granted by the first two courts below.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

It thus, cannot be said that matter was decided by the learned Assistant Judge by a decision and the said order cannot be a at all characterized to be a decision. I am of this considered view that the order under challenge having not a case decide and not a decision, the Civil Revision Petition against the said order is not maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sirajul Islam Chowdhury Trawlers Ltd.

Interference may be called for if the judgment appears to have suffered from a patent illegality, legal infirmity and flagrant error of law occasioning a failure of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mrs. Razia Kader Vs.

In her examination chief, she has testified that the minor son was born out of the wedlock. During cross examination, may be in reply to the suggestion of development of bad relations among the spouses leading to the divorce, she stated that her husband used to torture her over the birth of the son and that her husband doubted over the parentage of the son. In the absence of any pleading and without understanding the disastrous implication or consequence of his reasoning learned Additional District Judge most illegally based his finding upon such statements made in cross-examination as a reason for the deceased Shahabuddin Ahmed Khan for declaring opposite party No. 1 as the next of kin. This way of reasoning cannot be approved nor the reason, which is wholly bases on surmise.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Secondly, when the learned Additional District Judge himself found that even the appointment of the next of kin would not exempt the requirement of taking a succession certificate for withdrawing the money left by the deceased, how could he on the next breath find the opposite party No. 1 only entitled to the estate of the deceased. Learned Subordinate Judge found that the son is the only heir left by the deceased Shahabuddin Ahmed Khan and he will inherit the estate of his father. Without reversing such finding, the learned Additional District Judge fell in serious error to find opposite party No. 1 only beneficiary and entitled to the estate of the deceased. We find no reason to disturb such finding of the learned Subordinate Judge.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Muhaiminual Hassan Khan Vs. Md.

Appellate Judge as last Judge of fact was duty bound to come to a finding on discussion on materials on record, whether the predecessor grand-father Krishna Chandra Basak and father Kala Chand Basak were Enemies and whether the property could be brought under the Mischief of Enemy Property laws and whether treating of property as Enemy Property suffered from illegality but Appellate Judge did not at all touch the vital issue involved in the case and, thus, committed a grave error Of law by which a failure Of Justice has been occasioned.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sree Narayan Chandra Basak &amp; Ors Vs.

The khatian being at best evidence of present possession could not be a, document of title so as to confer right, title, and interest of the suit land. The defendant having failed to prove any basis of their title, by any cogent material, the rent receipt Ext E series are of no avail to them. When evidence was led in rebuttal of the presumption of correctness of entry in the record of right and the appellate court below comes to a finding rebutting the presumption, the said finding being of fact, arrived at by the final court of fact on consideration of the evidence on record, is not liable to be interfered with in revision as there was no error of law resulting in the error in the decision occasioning failure of justice.

In the background of the facts of the instant case the trial Court as well as the appellate Court while considering the question of right, title and interest and claim of possession of the plaintiff, which was denied by the defendant Nos.1-6, the said Courts in deciding the question of right, title, interest and possession of the plaintiff were not in error in considering the judgment in the previous suit along with the other evidence, both oral and documentary and decreeing the suit and that being the position the High Court Division without considering the evidence other than Exts.4 and 6 (previous judgment) placing reliance whereupon judgment by trial Court was made and the appellate Court affirmed was in error in reversing the judgment of the appellate Court affirming the judgment and decree of the trial Court on the view that the said Courts decreed the suit solely.

We have already mentioned that the defendant for his entitlement to buy out the share of the plaintiff in the land of C. S. plot No. 366 has not lead any evidence to establish the fact that the land in suit is part of the dwelling house of the undivided family or in other words part of the dwelling house of the defendant No. 1. The High Court Division was unmindful of the fact that defendant No. 1’s prayer under Section 4 of the partition Act could only be allowed upon establishing of the fact that the land in suit is part of his dwelling house or that the land in suit contiguous to the defendant’s homestead or that defendant needs the land in suit for convenient use and occupation of his dwelling house. But the defendant did not establish any one of the facts stated above. It may also be mentioned that defendant has not taken exception as regard the occupation of the land of C. S. plot No. 366 by the other  stranger purchasers who purchased the land of the plot in suit from the wife of the defendant No. 1 subsequent to plaintiff’s purchase. As seen from the judgment of the appellate court that it was contended from the side of the defendant No.1 that the strangers, one of whom purchased the land from the wife of the defendant No. 1, are “compromising person” and as such they have been accommodated by the defendant No. 1 and others. Legally the said contention is not sustainable since provision of Section 4 of the partition Act does not contemplate that a member of an undivided family will take exception in respect of a buyer who has purchased the part of the dwelling house of his undivided family but will not take exception in respect of the other stranger buyers who are not his kith and kin, as in the instant case, who have purchased the land of the dwelling house of undivided family.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Maleka Khatun &amp; Ors Vs.

As to maintainability of the revisional Application, I am of the view relying on the decision reported in 9 DLR 173 that the Election Tribunal not being a Civil Court is not amenable to the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court Division and as such the revisional application is not maintainable and the Rule is liable to be discharged as not being maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

The learned Judge also pointed out that the conclusion reached by the appellate court on title and possessions absurd. He was, however, quite mindful of the fact that usually in revisional jurisdiction the Court is not expected to go into evidence but that the instant case is an exception to the rule. The appellate court having absolutely Misconstrued the evidence we do not find any tangible fault with the elaborate judgment of the High Court Division.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sufia Khatoon &amp; Ors.

The appellate court appears to have discussed each witness both for the plaintiff and for the defendants and also the documents in coming to its conclusion that the plaintiff could prove his title and possession but the circumstances proved that the registered lease deed dated 3 April 1957 in favour of the defendants was a collusive document since the landlord had not right to lease out the land at that time. Furthermore the defendants failed to prove any farog in confirmation of which the lease deed is said to have been executed. But the learned Judge of the High Court Division did not consider any of the above aspects of the case. Those apart the High Court Division as a revisional court had hardly any jurisdiction to set aside the findings of fact by the appellate court and that also without discussing any fault in the factual finding by the said court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Kachi Mia Vs.

D.W.1 Abu Taher said in his deposition that the pre-emptor is his cousin sister and she lived in the same village and her husband knew about the same transfer of the case land and requested him to purchase the case land and also told them that they would help the pre-emptor in purchasing the land. D.W. 2A K.M. Golzar Hossain also corroborated the statement of D.W. 1 that both the pre-emptor and her husband refused to purchase the land. This specific deposition of D.Ws. 1 and 2 was not at all considered by the last court of fact. So this non-consideration of the vital material evidence affected the merit of the case, the revisional court in the facts of the present case correctly found that the deposition of D.Ws 1-3 was not at all discussed and considered as has been done by the trial court. Further, the judgment of the lower appellate court is based on certain surmises and conjectures as the lower appellate court that if the pre-emptor and her husband were requested to purchase the land before preemption then probably either the pre-emptor or her husband ought to have been a signatory either in the agreement or in the kabala. This is really an assumption and surmise of the lower appellate court which is not borne out by any evidence on record. There is no scope to guess this probability on the face of positive oral evidence on record. That apart, the pre-emptor and the pre-emptee are relations and live in the same village—the exercise of revisional jurisdiction by the learned Single Judge was proper and justified in the facts of the case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Most.

The appellate court found fault with the finding of possession arrived at by the trial court holding that the reasons of the trial court suffered from discrepancy. Again, the appellate court also found that the Assistant Custodian of Vested Property was necessary for the sake of effective and complete adjudication. The appellate court thus did not give any independent finding on possession or decide the matter of impleading the Assistant Custodian in the suit itself. The said court had sent back the case on remand for deciding it on all points after fresh trial. Such an order on the facts and in the circumstances of the case has not caused any Miscarriage of justice for any patent illegality as such.

But the court of appeal below considering the background of the case held that the plaintiff has failed to prove his possession rather the defendants’ witnesses have been able to prove the possession of the defendants in the suit land. The court of appeal below in support of the conclusion regarding possession of the defendants in the suit land observed that there was no denial of the fact that C.S. Dag Nos.585 and 586 are in possession of the defendants in their jote right from the time of their predecessors under the common landlords within the same Mouza as of Dag No.490 and both of them are on the contiguous east of the suit land forming part of Dag No.490 and it was apparent that the plaintiff had no land or house near about the suit land. In such circumstances it was natural that the riparian owner of the adjoining holding of the suit land would go into possession of any land coming out of the river by way of alluvion contiguous to his original holding under the same landlord. In that view of the matter the defence case was found to be more acceptable than the plaintiffs story of possession. The above observations of the court of appeal below are based on proper consideration of the materials on record and averments made in the plaint that the suit land was part of a large navigable river and gradually the river had silted up. It further appears that the court of appeal below assigned cogent reasons for disbelieving the evidence of plaintiffs witnesses regarding possession and for believing of the evidence of defendants witnesses regarding possession of the defendants in the suit land -the appellate court below reversed the findings of the trial court on exhaustive consideration and elaborate discussion of both the documentary and oral evidence on record. So the observations and findings of the High Court Division in reversing the findings of the lower appellate court are rather without any basis.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.
