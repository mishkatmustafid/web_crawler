The inherent power conferred under section 151 of the Code can be available in a case where there is no other provision for providing a redress. Power under section 151 of the Code can be invoked by a court only when the court is satisfied that prevention of the abuse of the process of the court is necessary or when ends of justice demand that the wrong complained of would be remedied. In the name of ends of justice, the remedy provided in the Code itself cannot be allowed to be negative and also to be thwarted. The court, of course, under section 151 of the Code preserves the power to set aside order passed under Misapprehension of facts when true facts are brought to light. The court also got the inherent power to vacate any order obtained by Misleading the court and practicing fraud upon it. The court, in the exercise of the power under section 151 of the Code, also, can collect the unintentional or inadvertent mistake committed by it. The court also preserves the inherent power to vacate any order if the same is passed under Misapprehension of law. But the power cannot be invoked in cases which would result in overriding the express provision of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Amirunnessa &amp; Ors. Vs.

In the ex parte disposal of the suit the learned Assistant Judge dismissed the same on 7.2.90. But in Civil Revision 962 of 1990, preferred by the petitioner, a Single Bench of the High Court Division on 7.2.91 decreed the suit. The petitioner however, instituted Execution Case No.1 of 1992— Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 as representatives of the deity on 15.11.80 instituted Title Suit No. 1085 of 1980 (was renumbered as Title Suit No. 225 of 1986) for declaration of her title to the suit land. The present petitioner is a party in the case of Title Suit No. 225 of 1986 and that the petitioner in his suit did not implead the plaintiff of Title Suit No. 225 of 1986 as party—Held: The High Court Division in the facts and circumstances of the case has rightly refused to interfere with the discretion exercised by the executing court under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure in the interest of justice staying further proceeding of the execution case pending disposal of Title Suit No. 225 of 1986.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M.

The decree of the trial court having been modified by the High Court it merged into the decree of the High Court. Hence, the question of drawing up of a modified decree on 9.8.93 in the light of the judgment and decree of the High Court in First Appeal is wholly illegal and without jurisdiction. It is found that the modified decree was passed on 22.3.1960 and to avoid the question of limitation a modified decree was again drawn up by the trial court on 9.8.93 and which is so obvious that it was obtained from a court by fraudulent means. Even if, it is admitted that a Mistake was committed by the executing court itself even then there are innumerable authorities of this court to hold that any error or wrong committed by the court itself can be corrected in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure to secure the ends of justice and to prevent the abuse of process of court. Thus, the execution proceeding is apparently barred under Article 182 of the Limitation Act. The plaintiff did not take any steps within three years from the modified decree of the High Court nor he kept alive the decree by taking steps to execute the decree within 12 years from the date of the final modified decree. Thus in order to avoid the bar of limitation the plaintiff fraudulently got the modified decree drawn up by the trial court. Hence the application, under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure is maintainable in the facts of the present case. Further, the plaintiff got decree for 8 Anna’s share of the suit property as modified by the High Court. In the execution proceeding the application was filed by the decree-holder for partition and for possession. Without filing a partition suit the executing court cannot also pass an order for possession when the decree itself does not contemplate such possession by partition of the property by metes and bounds. This exercise of jurisdiction by the executing court is palpably erroneous and without jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M. Majid Vs.

Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure is no doubt a special preserve of the Court for doing even-handed justice under given circumstances but the Court is not competent to exercise its inherent power in any and every matter which is not sanction by law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Harun-Or-Rashid &amp; Ors.

It will be quite harsh and inequitable if the illegal action of the Commissioner on the basis of a writ issued to him in violation of the provision of law is allowed to stand, driving the aggrieved party to have recourse to other ardorous, costly and time-consuming exercise for getting back possession in the suit property from which it has been dispossessed illegally. In such a case, exercise of the inherent power of the Court under Section 151 C.P.C. is clearly permissible.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

P. C But when the disputed order has been obtained by practicing fraud upon the Court or it has been occasioned due to the fault of the Court, it can certainly undo the wrong in exercise of its inherent power.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Procedural laws are devised to advance the cause of justice and not to obstruct it is the name of any technicality.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

The section does not confer new powers on court but only to save inherent power to make orders necessary for the ends of justice, Section 151 of the Code is only a legislative recognition of well known doctrine and principle that every court got inherent power to act ex debito justitae and to do that real justice for the administration of which alone it exists court acts ex debito justitae according to equity justice and good conscience of a cause and in consonance with sound judicial principle and also fundamental laws and judicial procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Rotis Chandra Das Vs.

The Judgment Debtor- defendant opposite party side on the basis of Miscellaneous Case, No. 15 of 1999 under Order 9, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, obtained an order of stay of the proceeding of Title Execution Case. It is the positive assertion of the Decree Holder plaintiffs-petitioners that the Judgment Debtors defendant opposite party side on the strength order of stay started kancha semi pucca structures and also permanent construction on the suit property and by way of an application under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure the Decree Holder plaintiff petitioners prayed before the court for exercising Courts inherent jurisdiction in recording an order of injunction restraining the Judgment Debtors defendant opposite party side from making any kancha, semi pucca or permanent structure and construction. The decree so obtained by the plaintiffs Decree Holders-petitioners stands good so long the same is not set aside in Miscellaneous case laid by the Judgment Debtors defendant-opposite party side. Taking the advantage of an order of stay of the proceedings of the Title Execution case the Judgment Debtors-defendant opposite party side cannot be allowed to make semi pucca, kancha structure and permanent construction by changing the nature and character of the suit property causing loss and damage to the Decree-Holder plaintiffs petitioners. In the fitness of the facts and circumstances the learned Assistant Judge was required to record an order of injunction restraining the judgement debtors defendant opposite party side from raising structure and making construction kancha, semi pucca or pucca on the suit property. The learned Assistant Judge thus appears to have committed a substantial error in not issuing an order of injunction as prayed by the Decree-Holder plaintiffs-petitioners.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Abu Mohammad Yousuf &amp; Ors.

The trial Court directed the defendant No. 1 to give 5 bighas of land equivalent to the price of 5 (five) bighas of land sold earlier or in the alternative price of 5 bighas of land on the basis of present market value. It will be not possible for the executing court to assess the value of 5 bighas of land. I find above that the defendant No. 1 in fact admitted to give 5 bighas of land indirectly out of schedule Kha land. Accordingly, in exercise of sumoto powers, I modify the decree of the Family Court and direct the defendants to execute and register 5 bighas of land out of schedule Kha land within 30 days of the decree.

No.128 of 1972)</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Article-33 (5)</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Held: We like to mention that in view of disposal of the case by the learned District Judge without complying with the provision of law the High Court Division rightly set aside the decree illegally passed by the learned District Judge and sent the case for retrial in accordance with law which has been, according to us, made for the benefit of the petitioner BSRS.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha Vs.

In the instant case, only an appeal under section 7(2) could be preferred challenging the decree passed by the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 and in the absence of any such appeal, we do not find that the petitioner’s application for stay of the Artha Rin Execution Case No.2 of 2001 is maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M/s Shahajan Traders &amp; Anr Vs.

Further a copy of the tenancy agreement was submitted which show that the premises rented out was plot No. 4313 and therefore the mentioning of plot No. 4314 in the schedule of the plain is obviously a typing error. The High Court Division also found that plot no. 4314 in the schedule was a typing error. The amendment sought being of the formal nature it falls within Sections 151, 152 and 153 of the Code of Civil Procedure which the Court can correct. The High Court Division therefore held that such correction of clerical Mistake does not amount to amendment of the plaint under Order 6 Rule 17 In the circumstances we do not find any illegality in the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division in allowing the correction in the schedule of the plaint by substituting plot No.4313 in place of 4314.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sri Narayan Chandra Pande Vs.

Answer—from the date of the decree.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Subordinate Judge as an Arbitrator passed the award on 28th May, 1985. The Arbitrator corrected the Award on 10th March, 1990 on an application under section 152 of the C.P.C. The scope of this section is very limited and decision under this section cannot materially affect the decree except correcting some insignificant errors or accidental omission having nothing to do with the merit of the decree itself. The appeal, not being filed within the prescribed period of 60 days from the date of the decree on 28.5.85 but being filed about 41/2 years beyond this period, was not maintainable. The decree award being under a special law, condonation under Section 5 of the Limitation Act also did not apply. The amendment does not give a fresh start of limitation to file an appeal from the date of the amendment; the point remains as before the date of the decree.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bangladesh Vs Luxmi Bibi &amp; Ors. 2BLT(AD)-182</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section- 152</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Advocate —right of address and showing the name for respondent No.1—without filing any Vokalatnama the learned Advocate has got no locus standi to file an application for amendment of the judgment and decree showing the name for respondent No.1.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Anowara Khatun Vs.

In exercise: of their right the appellants well within the period of limitation submitted the required application for substitution furnishing all the required particulars and the same having been allowed by the court they also prosecuted both the Misc. Case as well as the suit after its restoration. From, the date of acceptance of the appellant’s said application there was no legal existence of the deceased plaintiff in the case record, whose name could not have been retained by the trial court in the plaint when the suit was restored to its file and number. Clearly, an error on the face of the record had been committed by the trial, court for not recording the present appellants as substituted plaintiffs in the plaint and for failing to draw up the decree in question accordingly. Under Section 152 C.P.C. the trial court ought to have corrected its own clerical errors even after the passing of the decree.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

This subsequent version has changed nature and character of the suit. It is not open to a Court under section 153 to allow an amendment, which will alter the real matter in controversy between the parties and involve setting up a new case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sufia Khatoon &amp; Ors.

In that case this Section 153 is available to the Court concerned.
