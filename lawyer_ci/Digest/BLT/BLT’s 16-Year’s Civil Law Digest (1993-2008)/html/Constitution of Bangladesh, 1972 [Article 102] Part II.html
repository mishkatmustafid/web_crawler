The legality of the said very Order dated 23.1.1991 was before the Labour Court for consideration. The BADC could not justify its said Order there, But although the respondent No. 2 got his relief but the Labour Court being without jurisdiction, its judgment and Order is of no legal effect. On the prayer of the BADC, we have already hold so as prayed for. But since the respondent No 2 is not the petitioner, the question is whether we can further declare about the legality of the Order dated 23.1.1991 which was the sole question before the Labour Court. This question is important because this was not prayed for by the BADC the petitioner, in this writ petition but it was prayed for on behalf of the respondent No.2 before the Labour Court and this writ petition original from the said judgment and Order of the Labour Court which considered the legality of the said order. In effect the legality of the order dated 23.1.1991 passed by the BADC technically is still before this court and cannot be bidden and shadowed by the mere fact that the present Rule was not issued at the instance of the respondent No. 2 but at the instance of the BADC whose order was under challenge at the instance of the actual aggrieved person, the respondent No. 2 in the IRO case. The jurisdiction of the Labour Court was raised only as a matter of procedure as a collateral question and that also admittedly at a much belated stage — Besides, as such the office order No wbt cOt/tmP/cOkv-39/90-91/1981/10 dated 23- 1-1991 (Annexure-E) is declared illegal and is of no legal effect and the period from 2.6.1976 to 11.5.1988 be treated as his period of duty and he is entitled to the salary and other service benefits as admissible under the relevant Rules and Regulations for the said period.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">BADC Vs.

As such chapter 5 has been incorporated in the present Ain allowing the parties to ask for amicable settlement under section 22 and /or under section 21 the Adalat can invoke it if it is deemed fit and proper on perusal of the pleadings of both the parties —The order which has been complained of is hereby declared to be illegal, without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M/S Rana Apparels Ltd. &amp; Anr Vs.

This was definitely a good beginning to the right direction. There cannot be any better public interest than this. We have all praise for them.

It appears that the provision of special provisions of Ordinance are discriminatory and comparatively harsh in nature. In the absence of guideline as to which case be tried under PRB and which under the Ordinance 1976, the authority enjoys arbitrary power in violation of the nondiscriminatory provision of the Constitution. The Respondents preferred harsh and discriminatory procedure of the Ordinance of 1976 instead of PRB in drawing up departmental proceeding against the petitioner as such the right to equal protection of law guaranteed under Article 127 of the Constitution was deliberately violated.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

It is evident from the amended provisions of the Ordinance 1976 that the Respondent No.4 Additional Commissioner of Police K.M.P.

This amounts to saying that the Petitioners were not only removed from their services but also after having served as permanent servants of the Republic for 10 years their services have not been regularized and that they are not entitled to any benefits for the said tenure of service after their removal. In other words, their services in the Republic are not been regularized. In such a situation if they went to the Administrative Tribunal to agitate their grievances, their case will not be maintainable for being barred by limitation and they will have no other option but to come to this court under Article 102 of the Constitution of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh.

The legitimate expectation of a person can be enforced only when he has got a legal right. In the instant case, the lease agreement between the petitioner and the respondents is a mere tenancy agreement which is simple in nature. The same has been cancelled by complying the terms of the agreement. Meanwhile, the period of lease has already been expired. So, the petitioner has no legal right, to continue with lease agreement. —We are of the view, that the impugned order (Annexure-J) suffers from no illegality and impropriety, which calls for no interference by this Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Syed Arif Niazi Vs.

Thus as stated earlier since Annexure J did not create any specific right in favour of the Petitioner, in our opinion there was no reason to give the petitioner any prior show cause notice and there has been no breach of the principles of natural justice in this regard.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mst.

The right of judicial review under Article 102(2) of the Constitution is neither a fundamental right nor a guaranteed right. Similarly, the judicial review of an administrative action is neither an all weather remedy nor a remedy for all wrongs but is only available only when there is no other equally efficacious remedy. The writ petitioners have challenged the impugned decisions alleged to have infringed their fundamental right guaranteed under Articles 27 and 29 of the Constitution, but in view of the provision of Article 117(2) of the Constitution the Parliament has set up the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 for exercise of the functions enumerated in Article 117(1) i.e. by setting up of the Administrative Tribunal to exercise the jurisdiction in respect of matters relating to or arising out of the terms and conditions of persons in the service of the republic etc. Article 117(2) provides that no Court shall entertain any proceeding or make any order in respect of any matter falling within the jurisdiction of such Tribunal. Section 4 of the Administrative Tribunal Act 1980 specifically provides how the jurisdiction under Article 117(1) is conferred to any other Court. In the case of 44 DLR (AD) 111 it has further been cautioned that an aggrieved person may, out of desperation or just for taking a sportive chance in the summary writ jurisdiction, allege-contravention of some fundamental right which may ultimately turn out to be frivolous or vexation or not even wrongly attracted in the case and asked to be a ground so that great value of the right given under Article 102(1) is not frittered away or Misused on the pretext of alternative remedy. The question of enforcement of fundamental right is not available in the case as the question involved in the impugned decisions are mere clarification of the rules for giving effect thereto and as such the assumption of jurisdiction under Article 102(2) of the Constitution for ventilating certain grievances regarding terms and conditions of service of the writ petitioners pursuant to the impugned decisions has never been contemplated. On our examination of the impugned order we do not think that any question of fundamental right is involved in the case so as to allege that the same cannot be extricated for exclusive consideration in the petition for enforcement of fundamental rights.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Govt. of Bangladesh &amp; Ors.

She joined the Ispahani Public School on 15.7.1975. She was a senior teacher there. There was no allegation of any  Misconduct or inefficiency against her for the last 20 (twenty) years she worked there in the said school till she was dismissed in 1995 —It appears that the teachers council of the school in its meeting held on 30.12.1993, decided to form a club, as a recreational forum for the teachers on a monthly contributions from the teachers. It appears from para-4 of the affidavit in opposition that she also contributed to the said fund for some times but thereafter she defaulted and subsequently prayed to be excused from paying the said subscription —It appears that the petitioner had no obligation to pay subscriptions to the Teachers’ Club. As such, the Principal of the school, the respondent no. 2, had no right or authority to issue the memo no. 103/IPSC/7 dated 13.4.1995, asking her to show-cause as to why disciplinary action should not be taken against her. This notice itself was illegal, still, in reply to the notice to show cause dated 13.4.1995 (Annexure-B); issued by the respondent no. 2 she explained the reasons for her such inability by her letter dated 15.4.1995 (Annexure-C). The matter ought to have ended there but the Principal of the school again issued another notice on 22.4.1995 (Annexure-D). This notice was also illegal — the whole disciplinary proceeding against the petitioner was initiated to victimize the petitioner which is palpable and the Appeal and Arbitration Committee ought to have considered it in its proper perspective but it Miserably failed to do so, rather, illegally choose to tow and endorse the illegal decision of the Governing Body of the school. The said Committee failed to consider the two notices dated 13.4.1995 (Annexure-B) and dated 22.4.1995 (Annexure-D) issued by the respondent no. 2, threatening to punish the petitioner if she fails to pay the subscription. The committee ought to have appreciated that those notices were illegal and the conduct of the respondent no. 2 in issuing those two notices was reprehensible. The Board in its turn also blindly approved the decision of the Governing Body and its Committee, as such, Miserably failed to perform its statutory duty cast upon it under regulation 12 of the Regulations in its true spirit, thereby, the respondent-Board also became a party to the arbitrary action of the Governing Body of the school.

The Parliament in its wisdom, can do so. It can create statutory corporations also but it cannot create a body which is professed to represent a section of the people but without their representation and without making it accountable to the said section. The Gram Sharker is sought to represent the people of the village but all its members are nominated by the concerned authority. As such, they are neither the representative of the village people nor they are accountable to them. They are accountable to the bureaucracy. As such, in the name of the Gram Sharker, an autocracy has been created. This is against the spirit of the Constitution, so lucidly explained by Mustafa Kamal, J., in Panir’s case at para-72, that there cannot be any half way house between the democracy and autocracy. The Parliament may, in its wisdom, even abolish a local Government but cannot replace it with a body like Gram Sharker which is not a local government but dependent on bureaucracy. This is what we call a colourable legislation in the forceful language of Mustafa Kamal,J., in Panir’s case at para-7 1. It may be remembered that in Panir’s case, the dissolution of Upazilla Parishad was justified on the ground that it was not an administrative unit. But in the perspective of village, under the Act XXI of 1997, the Village Parishad was already an administrative unit and its members were elected from and amongst the village people, bearing a representative character, as such, was visibly and decidedly a local government. But the village Parishad was abolished and was replaced by nothing better than the Gram Sharker which is demonstratively an autocracy in all respect, created by the Gram Sharker Ain, 2003, in violation of the democratic spirit enshrined in Articles 7,9,11, 59 and 60 of the Constitution, as such, the said Ain, is not law and we are constrained to declare so.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Blast Vs.

It is also true that such presumption arising out of a record-of-rights relates to the time when it was prepared and with the passage of time, as the state of things starts changing and such presumption also loses its weight. But it must be remembered that a finally prepared and published record-of-rights takes precedence over the last record-of-rights. Moreover, the entries made in the CS record-of-rights which was prepared from 1917 to 1922 cannot be expected to be the same in 2002 and to override the SA record-of-rights and revised record-of-rights.
