TheCourt of Inquiry and the Commission of Inquiry were constituted by theGovernment in exercise of the investigative power of the State to inform itselfas to the state of affairs when the cyclonic storm and tidal bore hit thecountry in the night between 29 and 30 April, 1991. It was not for publicinformation and consumption, but for fact-gathering purpose of the Government.If after gathering facts the President has a choice of action to be taken inrespect of those on whom responsibilities have been fixed then the selection ofchoice cannot be called malafide as long as the reports remain confidentialdocuments. By the impugned order dated 4.6.1991 annexed to the writ petitionthe writ peti tioner was not given any stigma or was not blamed in any way fordamages caused to the vessels of Bangladesh Navy by the cyclonic storm andtidal bore. It remained within the special knowledge of the President as to thefacts revealed in the two reports. As long as those facts are not made publicdocuments available to the public at large, including the petitioner, thosereports and the decisions taken thereon remained the exclusive preserves of thePresident. No cause of action can be found on those confidential reports.</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Rear Admiral A. A. Mustafa Vs.

If the Parliament makes any law earlier then itwill be a case of occupied field. The regulations made by the President willonly supplement the law and will not be inconsistent with it. But if thePresident makes the regulations earlier then that will occupy the field until alaw is made by Parliament. If the law made by Parliament and the regulationsalready made by the President can co-exist without being in conflict with oneanother, well and good, but if there is a conflict between the law made by theParliament and the regulations made by the President, the law will prevail —the words “the President shall consult a Commission” is not mandatory.
