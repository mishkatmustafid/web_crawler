India got its Constitution in 1949 and became a Republic in 1950. The political history of Pakistan was not that happy. It got its first Constitution in 1956, only to be ditched unceremoniously in 1958. Another Constitution was made in 1962 but again Field Martial (self appointed) Ayub Khan, in violation of the Constitution, handed over the office of President to General Yahia Khan in 1969. A general election was held in 1970, the first as well as the last in the erstwhile Pakistan but when the army President refused to convene the Constituent Assembly, rather, let loose a genocide in the then East Pakistan, independence of Bangladesh was proclaimed on the night following 25th March, 1971, and the people of Bangladesh was proclaimed through a historic war of liberation against the Pakistan army and its murderous local vassals, achieved its independence at a cost of three million martyrs on the 16th day of December, 1971.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Anwar Hossain Manju Vs.

The preamble along with other articles and provision of the Constitution have given justice an ampler dimension to provide justice to every citizen of the country, Above all the Constitution reposes all the power to the people. Article 7 makes it clear that all legislative, judicial and executive powers are conferred on the people through the Constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">ETV Ltd. &amp; Anr. Vs. Govt of Bangladesh &amp; Ors 10BLT (AD)-108</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Article —7 read with Electoral Rolls Ordinance, 1982 Section —7(6)</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In the present context of time, it appears that without any identification document, a free and fair election is impossible and election without an identification document now-a- days is neither desirable nor practicable. The spirit of the Constitution is to uphold the will of the People of the Republic and such reflection of the People’s will results in formation of a Government which is to be elected through a fair, free and credible election conducted by the Election Commission But it appears that because of different defects including non introduction of voter ID card most of the elections held after the liberation unfortunately received question of fairness and neutrally. Considering the socio economic condition the country, we are of the view that the Election Commission, should take initiative to remove the existent legal barriers and introduce voter ID card or may introduce multipurpose national ID card with the assistance of the Caretaker Government because such documents are sine quo non for a credible election for developing state.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Kazi Mamunur Rashid Vs.

The failure of a person or persons in the State is not the failure of the Constitution or the laws of the land. The failure of the people in power to uphold the law must not be equated with the failure of the Constitution or the laws made thereunder, rather, it may be the failure of the persons concerned who are oath-bound to implement it. There must be others in the State who would again uphold the law. The checks and balances inherent in the Constitution and the conventions grown and groomed therein with the honesty and integrity of the people in the system, keep the State in its rightful place. If there is none to uphold the law in its real spirit, that will be unfortunate and disastrous for all and for the nation as a whole. Because, it, may lead the country to the catastrophe of a failed State. But for such an eventuality it would be foolhardy to blame the Constitution or the laws, rather, the concerned persons who failed to uphold the Constitution in its real spirit, should be identified, penalised and be thrown in the gutter, so that the others may learn their lessons from the reckless excesses of their unconscientious and debase predecessors.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Blast Vs.

In the past as well all the reserved seats for women in the Parliament were elected by the majority party in the Parliament by virtue of their strength electing all the 10 or 30 seats exclusively reserved for women to the exclusion of minority party/parties in the Parliament and P.O. No.17 of 1973 provided for the modalities/ methodology of conducting election to those seats and Article 3 thereof empowered the Election Commission to divide the Country in to thirty Zones and Article 4 thereof provided for the preparation of the list of electors i.e., the members of the Parliament who have been elected and have made and subscribed oath or affirmation shall be the voters for the purpose of election to the seats reserved exclusively for women members in Parliament. But the impugned Act has for the first time provided that all the political parties, jote and independent members represented in the Parliament have been given opportunity to elect women members of the reserved seats proportionally which is not only in keeping with the provision of the preamble of the Constitution and is also in consonance to Article 7(2) of the Constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Farida Akhter &amp; Ors Vs.

But if the executive prepares a list of persons for appointment in the service of the Republic without the backing of any law behind it and actually appoints some persons from the list, the others left out can come to the High Court Division not for enforcement of any legal right but for enforcement of their fundamental right. Article 27 of the Constitution provides that all citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law and Article 29 (1) of the Constitution provides that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in respect of employment or office in the service of the Republic. If the petitioners merely prepared a list and kept it to themselves or their different departments for implementation as and when possible the writ petitioners had nothing to complain about but when a number of them are appointed from a list and the appointment of others is postponed pending inquiry into the genuineness of a list comprising of 1745 persons with which list the writ petitioners have no concern, then they can legitimately complain of inequality before law and discrimination in public employment—We are of the opinion that the High Court Division was not well-grounded in law in directing the petitioners to absorb/appoint the writ petitioners against specific posts within a specified period which is purely an executive act. We are not inclined to interfere with the same except with the modification that the petitioners will appoint/ absorb the left-out writ petitioners as and when vacancies are available.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Govt. of Bangladesh &amp; Ors Jahangir Hossain. &amp; Ors. 7BLT (AD)-347</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Article - 27 &amp; 29 read with Civil service (Examination for Promotion) Rules, 1986</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Equality before Law</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is to be borne in mind that each Cadre in an independent Cadre by itself and that the appellants could not allege any discrimination to them simply because the member of other Cadres were given relaxation considering their respective position as they are not similarly situated with that of the appellants.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Delowar Hossain Mollah &amp; Ors.

Promotion is to be earned by rendering meritorious service and other than seniority promotion is also conditioned by other factors, such as efficiency, good conduct, character, integrity, sense of value, honesty and temperamental suitability.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Vs.

On the other hand, the people are guaranteed with “the protection of law, and to be treated in accordance with law, and only in accordance with law under article 31 of the Constitution. To carry out its public duties, the RAJUK is therefore, expected to act fairly and justly. It cannot act arbitrarily. They are expected to be more circumspect in exercising their statutory powers in dealing with the properties of the citizen. Moreover, it should also be remembered, the exercise of powers of canceling a sanction is akin to and partakes of a quasi-judicial complexion and that in exercising the power to cancel-sanction the authority must bring to bear an unbiased mind, consider impartially the objections raised by the aggrieved party and decide the matter consistent with the principles of natural justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A Rouf Chowdhury &amp; Anr.

The urge of the petitioners for trying their cases in accordance with Islamic law is nothing but an imaginary dream as the said so-called law is not recognised now by our constitution or in any other law except the sharia law codified as the law of the land. In this view of the matter urge of the petitioners to dispose of their case under Islamic law is an utopian concept unknown to our legal jurisprudence.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Shaiakh Abdur Rahman &amp; Ors Vs.

This is all the more necessary and required in view of the fundamental right guaranteed to them as enshrined under Article 31 of the Constitution that no action detrimental to the life, liberty and body shall be taken against any citizen except in accordance with law. Article 31 of the Constitution guarantees protection of life and liberty to every citizen. The term cannot be confined only to taking away of life, but means something more than mere animal existence.

Section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is a procedural law and the accused having alleged to have committed a substantive offence of murder his liberty is curtailed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The State vs. Faisal Alam Ansari  9BLT (AD)-189</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Article-35(1)</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A person accused of the commission off an offence has no fundamental rights to a trial by a particular court or by a particular procedure except in so far as any Constitutional objection by way of discrimination or violation of any other fundamental right may be involved. In other words the prohibition under this clause does not extend to merely procedural laws and procedural law would not contravene Article 35(1) merely because retrospective effect is given to it.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In the instant case Section 385 is not a creation of emergency Power Ordinance or Rules 2007.

But upon an application under Article 102 of the Constitution the said conviction and sentence was quashed as coramnonjudice by the High Court Division and declared the order of conviction and sentence passed by the Special Martial Law Court, Comilla in Special Martial Law Case No.24 of 1983 to have been passed without lawful authority on the finding that the cognizance was taken by the Special Martial Court No.4 at a time when the case was actually before him by an order of the authority having no power to transfer the case from the Court of General Criminal Jurisdiction and hence the Special Martial Law Court has not been vested with the jurisdiction of trying the case and pass the order of conviction and sentence. Moreover, there was no order by the High Court Division while disposing of the writ petition for retrial of the case and accordingly the appellant is left with the distinguishing fact in the instant case and after lapse of about 20 years now it will be far cry for the prosecution to bring all necessary evidence once again before the learned Sessions Judge. Admittedly, the appellant was in custody pursuant to conviction and sentence by Special Martial Law Court for a long period of more than 10 years out of 14 years’ sentence then prescribed for a convict undergoing sentence of imprisonment for life under the law and has suffered substantial conviction for the selfsame offence —Held: we are of the view that it will not be just and proper to proceed with the prosecution afresh thereby putting the appellant to suffer the rigors of fresh trial in G.R.

On the face of the impugned orders, there is nothing to suggest that the respective petitioner was made accused and formal accusation had been made against him and it cannot, also, be said that as accused person he is being compelled to give evidence against himself. Article 35(4) of the Constitution will be attracted only, if the proceedings ‘started with the accusation and the person who seeks its protection is already an accused person and he is of being compelled to make the statement. By the respective impugned order, the respective petitioner has been asked to submit statements with full particulars stating the acquisition of properties and the sources of income so that he can satisfy the Government that the properties acquired by him are not disproportionate to his known sources of income.

When the petitioner company was not formed at all with petitioner Nos. 2-5 as its directors, there is no question of acquiring any fundamental right to continue with petitioner Nos. 2-5 as its directors. Besides the petitioner company was formed in 1995 after the আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান আইন, 1993 was enacted on 30.09.1993. It was already governed by the restrictions imposed by section 25(3) of the said Act. The petitioner company was formed knowingly and voluntarily under the restrictive provisions of the said Act.

It has got all the attributes of a local government body but it’s such status is curtailed, as if purposely, by enacting subsection 4 to section 3, to take it out of its existing status under the provisions of Act XXI of 1997, as an administrative unit and also to make it a non-representative body by making provisions for nominations of all its members, thereby, as if purposely, robed its character as a local government body as it used to be earlier both under the Palli Parishad Am, 1989 and also under Asthanio Sharker (Gram Parishad) Am, 1997.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Blast Vs.

Naturally, the approach to these two kinds of rights, such as, the right of a convict and the right to remain as a sitting member of Parliament, shall be, of  necessity, different from the other.

But it was only made applicable to him after long 8 years from the date of conviction and sentence while he was continuing as a Member of Parliament. Hence, the authorities concerned must now be estopped from declaring his seat vacant on the ground of disqualification for his conviction in Janata Tower case—Held: In the instant case, the Speaker did not inform the House that the petitioner ceased to be a Member on account of disqualification for being convicted in the Janata Tower Case for a period exceeding 2 (two) years. The petitioner was, therefore, not informed about his seat being vacant due to disqualification. As a result he had no opportunity in the present case to raise any dispute.

But like two other organs of the Republic, it is also a creation of the Constitution —In our country, like the United States of America and India, the Constitution is supreme. All three organs of the Republic, owe its existence to the Constitution. The legislative powers of the Republic is vested in the Parliament but it is subject to the Constitution. No doubt the Parliament enacts the laws but it is for the Courts to tell the nation, including the members of the Parliament, what those laws mean.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Blast Vs.

And therefore, the certificate of the speaker will not be conclusive for all purposes.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Afzalul Abedin &amp; Ors. Vs Govt. of Bangladesh &amp;m Ors. 10BLT (HCD)-490</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Article-81(1) read with 80(3)</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Per Mr. Justice M.A. Aziz; P.S.A —Money Bill—the President did never recommend the Bill as a Money Bill as it was not sent for his recommendation as a Money Bill and the endorsement of the Speaker of the Bill as a Money Bill under Article 81(3) being without authority and power is a nullity and the certificate not being a magic wand has no mesmerism to transform a non money Bill into a Money Bill in derogation of Article 81(1) of the constitution. The speaker  derives his power of certification under Article 8 1(3) which is hedged with a condition that “Every Money is presented to the President for his assent, shall bear a certificate under his band “that” (the underlining is mine) it is a Money Bill” and such certificate shall be a conclusive for all purposes and shall not be questioned in any court. The expression “that” it is a Money Bill is not an “idle expression or mere formality” It means that the speaker must satisfy himself that what he is presenting for the assent of the President is in fact a Money Bill. And this satisfaction must be derived from the enumeration given under Article 8l(1)(a) to (f) read with Article 81(2) and 88 of the Constitution. Furthermore, Article 7(1) which is the “touch stone” of the constitution ordains in no uncertain term that “All Powers in the Republic belong to the people and their exercise on behalf of the People shall be effected only under, and by authority of this Constitution while under Article 7(2) it is sanctified to be the “Solemn expression” of the will of the People and the “Supreme law of the Republic”. Now the question is, have the people invested the speaker with the power or in other words is the speaker empowered to certify a Bill as a Money Bill which in fact is not a Money Bill? The answer must be “no” The Power conferred upon the Speaker under Article 8 1(3) must be exercised on behalf of the people and must be effected only under, and by authority, of the Constitution. This sacred document (the Constitution) has not authorized or invested any one specially the constitutional functionaries of the state who are under oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution to issue a false certificate transgressing the presidential Prerogative under Article 80(3) of the Constitution, This constitutional Power cannot be negated and denied by any one at his sweet will or whim. There must be a clear and unambiguous conferment of such power by the Constitution itself. In the facts and circumstances of this case Particularly the way the extract Bill was sent to the President for his recommendation to be introduced in the House, the way the Home Minister deliberately M/Sled the House saying that the President recommended the Bill as a Money Bill (Which it was not) and the way the Speaker sent the Bill for the assent of the President after it was passed by the Parliament as a Money Bill certifying that the Bill (P.S.A.) was a Money Bill knowing full well that it was not so under Article 8 1(1) of the Constitution, I am left with but only one conclusion that it was a ploy to preempt the prerogative of the President (under Article 80(3) to prevent him from refusing or withholding his assent to the Bill and returning it back to the Parliament because it did not answer the description (a) to (f) of Sub-Article (1) of Article 81 of the Constitution. It was clearly an act of fraud by the Speaker committed upon the president, upon the Constitution and above all upon the people.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Per Mr. Justice Shamsul Huda : In no way any fraud has been committed either on the President or on the Constitution in relation to a money bill while presenting it to the President for latter’s assent, the propriety of legality or any other matters relating to such certification cannot be called in question in any court. And the court cannot go behind the certificate even if the court finds error of law in certifying.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Afzalul Abedin &amp; Ors. Vs.

We are no doubt holding a public office on oath under the Constitution. A great trust and confidence of the people are reposed in such office. Every day, we are discharging our constitutional duties within the public gaze, Our judgments are the acid test of our accountability. Further, if there is any lapse or failing in the capacity or conduct of a judge, Article 96 of the Constitution has ordained the President of the Republic to act and direct the Supreme Judicial Council to inquire into the matter and report its finding to him. Thereupon, the President is empowered to take action under the Constitution. Originally in our Constitution, this power was given to the House of Nations like the parliament in India. So, it is not correct for anybody to think that the Judges are above law or, there is no accountability of the Judges under the constitution. The sooner it is understood by all and sundry is better for the whole nation.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mainul Hosein &amp; Ors. Vs.

The appointment, removal and other terms and conditions of service of a retired Judge in a public office should not be governed either by ‘master-and-servant law’ or by any unequal contract.
