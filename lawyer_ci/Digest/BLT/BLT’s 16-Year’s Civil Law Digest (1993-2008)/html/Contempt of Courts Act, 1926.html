The trial court decreed thesuit of respondent No. 2 with a direction on the BSC to reinstate him in hisservice as the Secretary of the Corporation. There is the simple direction givenby the trial court which was upheld upto the Appellate Division. Respondent No.2 in all his applications of joining made a prayer for fixing his seniority andthat is why the appellant sought the opinion of the parent Ministry and theLegal Adviser in the matter. Immediately the opinion of the Legal Adviser wassought for without any delay and on 19.5.1994 respondent No. 2 was directed tosubmit a normal and proper joining report. It thus appears that within 112months from the first letter praying for, joining as Secretary, the appellantdirected respondent No. 2 to file a normal joining report and to join asSecretary of BSC, but respondent No. 2. without joining moved the High CourtDivision in a contempt proceedings on 5.5.1994. Respondent No. 2 did not evenwait for 112 months but moved, the High Court Division in contempt. In thebackground of the admitted fact, and correspondence it is difficult to hold‘that the appellant had wilfully shown any disrespect and disobedience ‘towardsthe order of the court. As’ the matter was not a simple joining report theappellant in bonafide and good faith immediately sought clarification of theMinistry and the opinion of the Legal Adviser, as directed by the Ministry. Inthose correspondences there was nothing to show that , any contumaciousness wasshown regarding the implementation of the order of the court. There was also nodelay or laches on the part of the appellant in taking ‘effective steps inimplementing the court’s order. We do not find that the conduct of theappellant was such of flouting the order of the court deliberately and to treatthe court’s order with some degree of hatred or malice—in this case, theappellant challenged the contempt Rule and filed a Counter Affidavit setting uphis defence upon alternative facts and circumstances in which he acted under abonafide and good faith. As a matter of fact he had no authority also ‘to fixthe question of fixation of seniority and promotion. Thus, in the facts of thepresent case probably no apology was sought for as he was in fact acting withhonest belief for clarification. The apology in this case would have shown thathe had committed the offence of contempt. In the present case, it appears thatwithin 112 months of the filing of the joining report respondent No 2 was askedto join. There was in fact no delay and no attempt was made to obstruct the,order of the court. In the facts and circumstances as indicated above, we haveno hesitation in Our mind in holding that no contempt was committed by theappellant.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>S.
