The power to direct such an inquiry is no doubt discretionary but it is a discretion which must be judicially exercised and there must be some enquiry either by the court itself or by somebody appointed in this behalf to enable the court to come to a correct assessment of the valuation of the suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sola Bibi &amp; Ors.
