If the expression ‘action’ is construed as meaning‘suit’ only the expression ‘action’ becomes redundant. The meaning has to beconstrued strictly keeping in mind that the terms of the policy is drawn up bythe insurer and the interest of the insured depands on the interpretation ofthe terms. The expression ‘action’ in the circumstances means and includeslegal notice and not suit. The insured has taken action by making his claimthrough legal notice. We therefore do not agree with the High Court Divisionthat the word ‘action’ in clause 8(b) means only ‘suit’.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Chaina Marine Products Ltd.
