The petitioner on the other handhas proved her case for dissolution of her marriage with the respondent on theground of adultery coupled with cruelty. It is also found that no collusion orconnivance exists between the petitioner and the respondent with regard to thesubject matter of the suit namely, the dissolution of their marriage. Moreover,since the respondent after being served with the summons has not contested thesuit, the averments of the petitioner have been proved by the evidence onrecord. Since the two minor children are in custody of the petitioner andliving with her ever since she left the matrimonial home, I consider it to bein the best interest of the children that they should continue to remain in thecustody of the petitioner unless the respondent can show any valid reason whythey should not continue to remain in the custody of thepetitioner-petitioner’s case proved. Decree Nisi be issued.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Ms. Christine Charmine Cholet Vs.
