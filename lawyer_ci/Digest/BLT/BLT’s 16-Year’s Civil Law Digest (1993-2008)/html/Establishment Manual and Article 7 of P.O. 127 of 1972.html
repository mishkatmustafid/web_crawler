Respondent Nos. 2-6 who are among the 73 directly recruited Class-i officers have added themselves as parties in the tribunal cases, but the rest have not. We do not think that it will be in consonance with the principle of natural justice to deny them a hearing when a question of seniority is being raised 15 years after their recruitment. The Appellate Tribunal rightly decided the point.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md. Hafizuddin &amp; Ors Vs.
