The said Abdul Wahab Howlader executed a deed of gift in favourof the plaintiffs on 27.7.64 and delivered the possession but the said deedcould not be registered due to certain difficulties. The defendants claimed thetitle over the suit land as a residuary sharer. Hence the plaintiff filed thetitle suit for declaration of title in respect of suit land—the learned trialcourt in consideration of oral and documentary evidence and materials on recorddecreed the suit. Against the said decree the defendants preferred appeal.Learned Appellate Court allowed the appeal by reversing the decree of the trialcourt—Held: That the plaintiffs, being in exclusive possession over thestatutory period of limitation from the date of institution of the suit by theplaintiffs in the year 1984 and to the complete ouster of the defendants forabout 20 years from the suit property have acquired a valid title even on thebasis of the defective deed -of gift being an unregistered one. It furtherappears that the defendant could neither challenge the said unregistered deedExt. I nor file any suit to establish their alleged right in the suit propertywithin the statutory period of 12 year and it is further held that the defectof the plaintiffs deed of gift has been cured with the passage of time and theplaintiffs imperfect title has been perfected by the said period.</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Amirunnessa &amp; Ors Vs.

S. recorded owner of the suit property. Afterhis death his son Gopal Karmaker inherited the said property. This GopalKarmaker transferred the suit property to one Harendra Lal Saha and JagannathSaha. After the death of Harendra Lal Saha his property was inherited by histwo sons Chandi Gopal Saha and Ashutosh Saha. One Parveen Akter purchased thesuit property by registered deeds from Chandi Gopal Saha, Ashutosh Saha andJagannath Saha. From this Parveen Akhter plaintiff- appellants had purchasedthe suit property while the plaintiffs were possessing the suit land, they cameto know that the property in question was declared as vested and nonresidentproperty—learned Subordinate Judge dismissing the suit holding that theplaintiffs failed to produce any document to show the transfer in between GopalKarmaker and Harendra Lal Saha and others—Held: The averments made in theplaint and the evidence of P.W.I together with the written statements ofdefendant No. 2 and the evidence of P.W. I it clearly appears that Harendra LalSaha and others became the owners of the suit property and they possessed thesame and sold the same to Mrs. Parveen Akhter by registered sale deeds in1981—the rent receipts together with the continuous record as right videexhibits I series may be treated as collateral evidence of title in favour ofthe plaintiff. Now, if we consider the oral as well as documentary evidence asstated above, we find that this Harendra Lal Saha and others acquired right andtitle over the suit property. The documents by which the heirs Harendra Lal andJagannath transferred the suit land to Parveen Akhter and the registereddocument by which Parveen Akhter transferred the land to the present plaintiffsare not disputed at all. So it is held that the learned Subordinate Judgefailed to consider the material evidence or record as stated above and he hasarrived at a wrong finding and as such it cannot be sustained.</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Md.Amjad Hossain &amp; Ors.

The plaintiffs asseted that they purchased thesuit land in auction in Certificate case No. 10168 of 195060 and got possessiontherein. The plaintiffs produced photocopies of sale certificate and writ ofdelivery of possession which were not admitted in evidence by the trial court.The lower appellate court. however, accepted the photocopies as additionalevidences. The learned Judges of the High Court Division found that the trialCourt gave proper reasons for not accepting those photocopies as there was noexplanation as to what happened to the original copies of the sale certificateand delivery of possession and that there was no evidence on record to showthat any witness testified that those were the photocopies of the originals.Secondary evidence was wrongly admitted without any cogent explanation. Therewas no statement in the plaint or in the deposition that the originals werelost or destroyed. Further from the evidence on record it was found by thelearned Judges of the High Court Division that plaintiff Nos. 3, 4, 6 and 14were not born at the time of auction sale and as such the question of auctionpurchase in the name of unborn person does not arise. The learned Judgesthemselves also saw the photocopies Ext. 2 and 2a (as marked by lower appellatecourt) and found that those photocopies were different from those filed in thetrial court. The learned Judges or the High Court Division rightly reversed thefinding of the lower appellate court. It further appears from the record thatthe certificate case was started in 1959-60, but the plaintiffs claimed to havepurchased the suit land on 16.06.1979 and got possession on 20.02.1981. Thesale was set aside by the certificate officer and the lower appellate court didnot consider this aspect at all. The basic document of title of the plaintiffsbeing of a highly doubtful nature the learned Judges committed no illegality insetting aside the Judgment of the lower appellate court and restoring those thetrial court.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Kazi Abdul Khaleque&amp; Ors.
