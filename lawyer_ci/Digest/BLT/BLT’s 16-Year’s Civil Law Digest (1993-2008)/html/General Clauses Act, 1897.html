For commencement of an Act there can only be one date. An Act may come into effect as a whole or in part on the day of its commencement, or it may be given, as a whole or in part, a retrospective effect from a date earlier than the date of commencement. Even there the Act is given retrospective operation the significance of the date of commencement of that law will be relevant for several reasons. From the date if its commencement an act will find a place on the statute book of the country.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bangladesh Vs. Prof Golam Azam &amp; Ors. 3BLT (AD)-3</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-6</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">This section provides that the right that accrued to a person under an enactment subsists even after expiry of the Act but it applies only when an enactment is repealed by another enactment. And when an enactment expired by lapse of time, it is deemed never to exist except transaction past and closed. The Emergency Requisition as Property Act has not been repealed by lapse of time and so the petitioner is not entitled to invoke the benefit of section 8B of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">S.

Thus we hold that the Government has the power to make such amendment but subject to certain restriction as referred above.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mst.

The Respondent is not authorized by law to avail of the provision of Section 21 of the General Clauses Act in withdrawing of canceling the letter or resignation, which was of immediate effect.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bangladesh Biman Corporation &amp; Ors.

Instead of bringing improvements, the amendment of Section 105C of the Companies Act, 1913 to its present position, has rather created confusion.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M.

The hard reality is that the quality of the judges of Division, though are of a satisfactory level, all are not equal. Some are more brilliant may be left behind and the less competent may be elevated to the Appellate Division simply because he was appointed a judge of this Division at an earlier point of time than the others. This will have the following effect on the highest judiciary; firstly the most brilliant judges may be left behind though they could make better contribution to the judiciary. Secondly, if seniority-cum-merit becomes the criterion then right after the appointment of a judge in this Division he will do his best to improve the quality of his judgment and his overall performance as a judge and there will be a sense of competitiveness among the judges in performing their judicial duties. This will immensely benefit the nation as a whole and the judiciary in particular and the most meritorious will move ahead the less meritorious. The judges of his Division will then leave no stone unturned to devote themselves whole heartedly to the job day in and day out during the tenure of their office.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">S.

It is ill luck for our nation that police are placed to face trial for committing heinous criminal offences i.e. murder, rape, dacoity, looting etc. This is a shame to the whole police community department.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Afzalul Abedin &amp; Ors.

Some time such order may create confusion and also difficulties. The English Act provides for purchase of shares not only by the members but also by the company itself and consequently allow reduction of its capital.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Nurul Hoque Chowdhury Vs.

No bank, is expected to receive the charge documents executed in blank in necessary particulars and then, fill them as and when they think fit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">When they fill in them afterwards they cannot do so without committing breach of such trust and confidence. We must say it is in the best interest of the bank to abandon such old practice, if any, as early as possible.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">BCCI Ltd. Vs.

In terms of Clause(e) of Article 88 of the Constitution expenditure for satisfying such decree is a charge upon the Consolidated Fund. So it is desirable that Ministry of Finance, takes immediate steps for including the decreetal dues, which is the subject matter of the present case, in the annual financial statement to be prepared for next year so that the above decreetal dues may be paid out of the consolidated Fund.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bangladesh Bank Vs.
