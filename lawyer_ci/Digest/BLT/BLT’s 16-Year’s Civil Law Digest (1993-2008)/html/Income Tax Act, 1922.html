Further it appears that it was found by the D.C.T to be highly excessive. Thus it appears that the payment of bonus made by the assessee is hit by the proviso to section 10(2)(x) of the Act. Therefore it appears that both the A.J.C.T and the ‘Tribunal taking a correct view of law and facts upheld the decision of the D.C.T. Therefore we are of the opinion that the payment of Six months bonus was unjustified.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M/S Dacca Ware House Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Taxes 9BLT (HCD)-116</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Revenue Expenditure</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Purchase of Compressor —in the instant case as a matter of fact it appears that by replacing the compressor of the air conditioner there has not been any addition to the value of value of assets and as such the D.C.T. ought to have treated those as revenue expenditure and thus both the A.J.C.T and the Tribunal erroneously affirmed the order of the D.C.T on that score without considering this aspect of the case. Therefore, our answer it that the Tribunal was not justified in the facts and circumstances of the case to disallow the amount of Tk. 58,500.00 which has been spent for replacement of the compressor and the same appears to be a revenue expenditure.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M/S Dacca Ware House Ltd.

XXIII of 1973 Section-3</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">By notification No.HCD-37/73/950/l 973 all workers of the Sector Corporation were allowed festival and incentive bonus and since the respondent assessee paid the bonus to the employees as per provision of the Government under the provision of the above Ordinance and notification, the question of earning profit of bonus did not arise. We are in agreement with the view expressed by the High Court Division. As payment of bonus to employees is incentive for service rendered by them, such payment of bonus as directed by the government is not dependent on profit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Commissioner of Taxes &amp; Ors.

The circular is in the nature of a direction upon Assessing Officers to appreciate evidence of certain materials produced before them in a particular manner, instructions which are binding on them. The only argument which was available with the Appellate Joint Commissioner of Taxes in avoiding the circular is that the assessments were already made when the circular had not yet been issued and therefore the assessments were a closed transaction. But obviously the assessments were not a closed transaction aw1 the Appellate Joint Commissioner of Taxes had the whole question of assessment open before him. If there was a subsequent circular of the National Board of Revenue requiring the assessing officer to treat the evidentiary value of an audit report in a particular manner then that circular was as much binding on the Appellate Joint Commissioner of Taxes as upon the original assessing officer because the assessment had still not attained a finality.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Dhaka Vegetable Oil industries Ltd.

But such right is given only to the holder of a policy and an insurer cannot claim such right to go to a civil Court. The intention of the legislature not giving any such right i.e. opening the doors of Civil Court to an insurer for avoiding the payment of the insured amount which he cannot avoid under the terms of the policy.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Homeland Life Ins.

Premiums were paid out of the account of the plaintiff. When the claims were placed and surveys held on the application of the plaintiff, the defendant never challenged and/or objected to such acts of the plaintiff.
