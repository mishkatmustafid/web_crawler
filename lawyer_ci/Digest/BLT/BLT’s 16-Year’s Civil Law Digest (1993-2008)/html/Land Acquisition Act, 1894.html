The purchase was made by one kabala. There is no presumption of jointness in the Muslim Law. The presumption under the Muslim Law is that the Muslim families are separate. The purchase made by the mother and the sons are independent purchases and accordingly the purchase made by the preemptee Nos. 1-4 who are strangers, is Preemptible excluding the purchase made by the mother by the self same kabala. This will not amount to partial pre-emption.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

From the aforesaid evidence it seems that although the witnesses did not state in unequivocal language that the plaintiff disclosed his Talab-i Mowsibat previous to his second demand but they have proved his first demand as well as his second demand and I am in respectful agreement with the decisions of Indian Jurisdiction as referred above in holding that if under these circumstances a Talab-i-ishad is made subsequently, and there is no express reference of Talab-i-Mowsibat, the right of preemption of the plaintiff is not defended, as subsequent demand is superfluous, further, Hedaya observed in his book Mohammadan Law at page 551 that no particu1ar form is necessary : what the law requires is that the demand must be to that effect and no more.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bangladesh Krishi Bank Vs Kazi Liakat Ali and Ors. 14 BLT (HCD)76.</p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
