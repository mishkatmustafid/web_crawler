In the meanwhile, Rule 10 of Rules, 1975 was amended on 30.12.97. The impugned orders were passed on 10.6.98 and 17.6.98 whereby the area in which a Nikah Registrar has been licensed was further curtailed. The orders having been passed after amendment of Rules 10 of Rules, 1975, those are not retrospective in nature. As a matter of fact those are prospective in nature—The petitioner’s licence as a Nikah Registrar has not at all been revoked affected but under the second proviso of Section 4 of the Act his area has been curtailed which the Government is authorised under the law to do.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mr. Raisuddin Vs.

It is not necessary to struck down this proviso. Interpretation of statute is necessarily in favour of maintaining the statute, if possible.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Moulana Ruhul Mannan Helali Vs.

Besides, a Nikah Registrar cannot resign his office or leave the place in which he has exercised the function of a Nikah Registrar without permission of the Government —Held A Nikah Registrar is a public servant.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Kazi Obaidul Haque Vs.

The very appointment has not created no legal right in the said post inasmuch as Second Proviso to section 4 of the Muslim Marriage and Divorces (Registration) Act, 1974 and the Rule 10 of the Muslim Marriage and Divorces (Registration) Rule, 1975 has been considered and found to be valid by this Court in 51 DLR (AD) 152.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.
