The trial court believed the plaintiffs settlement and dakhilas Ext.1 series upon assigning proper reasons. Plaintiff got the settlement as far back as on 15 Chaitra 1355 B.S. which corresponds to March, 1948 but the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949 came into force on 20th October, 1949. As such its application in respect of the suit property does not arise at all.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Mrs. Nir Bala Das Vs.

(1) claim adverse possession it must be specifically pleaded in the plaint. (2) hostile must be asserted, (3) adverse possession must be adequate in continuity (4) Evidence must be adduced to show when possession became adverse so that the starting point of limitation against the party there was no attempt to prove since when the adverse possession has started.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sree Mati Gouri Das &amp; Ors, Vs.

The tenancy in question was created prior to 22.3.42 which continued on 20.10.49 when Act XXIII of 1949 came into force and in view of Section 89A of the said Act, the plaintiffs accured an interest to continue such possession as of right which is protected from eviction. The interest of Abdul Hakim in the suit land in such tenancy has been transmitted by inheritance to the plaintiffs on the death of Abdul Hakim under clause (II) of Sub-section (5) of section 7.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Ramjan Mia &amp; Ors.

The High Court Division as well as the appellate Court in the materials on record as discussed above assumed that khatian No.3232/I/I (Ext.A) was started in the name of preemptors in respect of the land Abdul Gafur got in pursuant to the decree in partition suit and thereupon erroneously -allowed preemption.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Alfazuddin Ahmed Vs.

A co-sharer in land becomes entitled to pre-empt under Section 24(1) of the Act if any portion of such land is transferred to stranger.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md. Shah Aim Vs. Alhaj M.S. Shahifur Rahman &amp; Ors. 11 BLT (HCD)-189.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-24(1) read with Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 Section-2(2)</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A reference to Section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure shows that a decree may be either preliminary or final. Explanation to Section 2(2) provides that “a decree is preliminary when further proceedings have to be taken before the suit can he completely dispose of. It is final when such adjudication completely disposes of the suit”. In a suit for partition, after filing of the report along with the case map, field book, saham list by the Advocate Commissioner final decree takes effect and thereafter remains nothing to be done. In a pre-emption proceeding under Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, the question of co-sharership in the tenancy is relevant, but the Section 24(1) of Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act the co-shareship in the land is maternal. In that view of the matter, the passing of the final decree in a partition suit finally determines the rights of the co-sharers in the land. Hence, the application for the pre-emptor respondents on the basis of co-shareship is not maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md. Shafiuddin Chowdhury Vs. Abdul Karim &amp; Ors. 8BLT(AD)-165</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-24(1) read with State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 Section-117</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">There is no escape from the irresistible conclusion that even if the land in the expression. ‘co-sharer in the land’ in Section 24(1) of the Act, 1949 is not synonymous to a holding but conceiving of such land without reference to the word ‘co-sharer’ is neither feasible nor possible. And the word ‘co-sharer’ in the phrase ‘co-sharer in the land’ is the key to find whether the preemptor is entitled to preempt. A final decree passed in a partition suit or amicable partition though separates and divides the land for the purpose of possession but does not ipso facto terminate co-ownership in such land till subdivision of the holding and distribution of rents takes place only in accordance with law. Subdivision of a holding and distribution of rents may also take place in a revenue survey subsequent to the cadastral survey with or without the plot or plots divided into different small plots. As stated above, such subdivision may also takes place at the instance of one or more of the co-tenants of the holding in accordance with the provisions of S. 117 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950. Such subdivision always terminates the joint tenancy or more precisely co-sharership in the land, no matter whether the land is subdivided or separated or not and after such subdivision, the old co-owners of the holding in such land cannot be deemed to still continue as co-sharer in the land within the meaning of S.24(1) of the Act, 1949.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">S.
