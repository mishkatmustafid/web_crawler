Consequently, she did not get any share declared in the joint property in the preliminary decree. So the order of the appellate Court for allotment of a share to her and! or other defendants beyond the terms of preliminary decree is wholly Misconceive and baseless and arbitrary.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A. Ali  Sheikh &amp; Anr Vs. K. Ali Sheikh &amp; Ors. 11 BLT (HCD)-444</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Whether in a Suit for Simple Partition the court is debarred to decide question of title or genuineness of a document, incidentally</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">When a suit is based on joint ownership and enjoyment, a co-sheerer in possession is always entitled to seek partition simplicitor without seeking any declaration of his title. In deciding such suit, questions of title and nature of particular transaction may come up for decision, incidentally and need to be decided as incidental to adjudication of the shares of the co-owners.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Birendra Nath Mondal &amp; Ors Vs. Dulal Chandra Mondal &amp; Ors 13BLT (HCD)10</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-4</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">(a) “Dwelling house” co-sharer’s attachment to ancestral house intention of the legislators to make the provisions of S. 4 of the Partition Act</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">After considering the modes of our people, the co-sharer’s attachment to their ancestral house and their anxiety to preserve the purdah and privacy of the members and inmates of the undivided dwelling house, the legislators made the provisions of section 4 of the Partition Act. The expression a dwelling house belonging to an undivided family is to be liberally construed. We have done so in Sree Jugal Kishori Sarker Vs. Azizur Rahman &amp; Ors. 40 DLR(AD) 150. A co-sharer’s prayer to buy up a stranger-purchaser may not be refused on a technical ground.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Syesta Bibi and Other’s Vs. Juma Shah and Other’s 1BLT (AD)-34</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">(b) There is no time limit for filing an application under section 4 of the Partition Act</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The appellate Court’s finding that “That suit land is no doubt a homestead, but is not a dwelling house of an undivided family” is utterly Misconceived. In the suit land an undivided dwelling house is situated. The defendant himself claimed to be residing in a portion there. The suit property never lost its character of an undivided homestead because there had admittedly been not partition by metes and bounds by any previous arrangement. The impartible character of the suit property remained undisturbed when the suit was filed in 1962. There is no time limit for filing an application under section 4 of the Partition Act. In the instant case, the plaintiffs claim cannot be called sale.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Syesta Bibi and Other’s Vs. Juma Shah and Ors. 1BLT (AD)-34</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">(c) To buy-out a stranger purchaser-Inordinate delay in filing application under S-4 of Partition Act from the date of purchase consequences— What involves a kind of forced sale for the stranger purchaser</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">If an application under section 4 of the Partition Act is filed to buy out a stranger purchaser after an inordinate delay from the date of the purchase, then the applicant himself may suffer. When an applicant’s prayer is allowed under section 4 of the Partition Act, it involves a kind of forced sale for the stranger purchaser. And hence, the court would, in equity, determine the valuation of the transferred share on the date of the filing of the application for permission to purchase the share of the stranger purchaser.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Syesta Bibi and Others Vs. Juma Shah and Others. 1BLT (AD)-34</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-4</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Partition suit by transferee of share in dwelling house —the plaintiff petitioner is in possession of .5612 acres of land in ejmali by registered kabala, filed the present partition suit —opposite party No. 1 as defendant No.1 contested the suit, contending inter alia that he has been possessing the suit land as cosharer and suit land being dwelling house that the defendant is ready to purchase the share of the plaintiff-petitioner. The learned trial court decreed the suit in part with direction that the ‘defendant may purchase .04 decimals of homestead having the dwelling hut and courtyard on it and the plaintiff will get .5212 decimals of land out of the jote — the lower appellate court reversing the judgment and decree of the trial court in the manner and on the finding that the plaintiff is a stranger in the suit land, if plaintiff is allotted shaham in the ejmali homestead and ejmali tank the members of the Hindu family cannot conveniently use the homestead and the tank which is a cartilage of their dwelling house, trial court ought to have allowed pre-emption in favour of the contesting defendant No. 1 in full—Held: It appears that the appellate court while reversing arrived at its own independent findings on the issues involved in the case rule is therefore discharged.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Hafizuddin Bepari Vs.

If properties are left out in a partition suit it brooks further litigation. It is true that this rule is relaxable. But there are specific situations calling for relaxation. They are generally (a) where different portions of the property lie in different jurisdictions, or (b) when some portion of the property is at the time incapable of partition, or (c) when the property from its nature is impartible, or (d) when property is held jointly with strangers who cannot be joined as parties to a general suit for partition, or (e) where cotenants, by mutual agreement, decide to make partition of a part of the joint property retaining the rest in common.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Nurul Afsar Vs Rafiqul Ahmed 7BLT (AD)-335</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-4</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Decrees never put into execution within 12 years.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Decree in partition suit of I 1 6, appears that the decree in Title Suit No. 167 of l9I was never put into execution within 12 years and as such the decree holder plaintiff including plaintiff nos. 4 and 5 (Safunnessa and Jahra Bibi) could not get into possession in the decreetal land particularly in ‘Cha and Tha’ of the schedule upon evicting the defendants including the sons of Moinuddin Kochwan, the defendant no. 21, the substituted heirs of defendant no. 21-Kha Abdus Sattar, the predecessor-in-interest of defendant nos. 6-9 and Abdul Halim, the substituted defendant no. 21-Ga, the predecessor-in-interest of defendant nos. 1-5, the transferors of the defendant nos. 10-17.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sahani Bibi &amp; Ors.

Vs.

The final decree is just a follow-up of the preliminary decree whereby actual partition of the ejmali property is effected through the Court in execution of the preliminary decree. In effecting partition by metes and bounds the existing possession of the parties is usually maintained as for practicable and in so far it is not inconsistent with the decree. Possession or no possession in a particular plot or plots of an ejmali property cannot therefore, be a ground to refuse a decree for partition once the plaintiffs title and possession is found in any portion of the suit property.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

But entry in the register is not conclusive thereof and the presumption is rebuttable one. We have examined the sample, compared them and looked at their design as a whole and found that the design of the respondent is nothing but an imitation of the petitioner’s design. So, the design of respondent No.1 is not a new or original one. The respondent’s design is, therefore, liable to be called on all the grounds stated in Section 51A(1)(a) of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mr. Yar Mohammad Vs. Mr. Satadal Dhali 9 BLT(HCD)-31</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-51A</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Has no locus standi-in the instant case the petitioner has utterly failed to show how he is an interested person in respect of a design relating to cycle and rickshaw parts inasmuch as he has failed to bring home his claim that he is a dealer of those parts or that at any point of time he manufactured them. In that view of the matter it appears that he has failed to fulfill the condition precedent for filing an application under section 51 of the Act. Moreover, on a perusal of the materials on record it appears that it has been finally established that the registered design bearing No.01010, dated 12.8.92 is a new and original one-application is rejected.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md. Shahidullah Vs. Year Mohammad. 9BLT(HCD)-132</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-51A(1)</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It appears that the design of the respondent No.1 substantially resembles with the design of the petitioner, which is apparent in the neck eye. Therefore, it appears that the respondent No.1 by suppressing the fact that a similar design had already been registered as back as in 1994 obtained the registration of their design by committing a fraud upon the Controller of Designs. It further appears that the respondent No.2 also failed to discharge the legal duties cast upon him and after proper scrutiny failed to discover the fact that the design applied for already registered. Thus, the registration given by the respondent No.2 in favour of the respondent No.1 being registration No.01638 dated 14.5.96 in class-I is neither a new nor an original design and it has previously been published in Bangladesh and also registered by the petitioner in 1994. Thus the registered design No.01638 dated 14.5.96 is class-I is liable to be cancelled.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Golam Rabbani Chowdhury Vs. Md.
