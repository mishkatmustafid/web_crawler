Facts remain that the petitioner is entitled to the benefits allowedby the labour Court and we find no infirmity as to the claim as the petitioneris entitled to approach the labour court being the authority under Section 15of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936 for realisation of his benefits, thusenforcing his right guaranteed or secured to him i.e. which are legally dueupon his retirement from the service under the provision of Payment of WagesAct, 1936. It would operate as hardship and futile exercise of application oflegal provision, if the heirs of the deceased workers are put to a protractedlitigation afresh for realization of the benefits of their father who aftersuccessful completion of 31 years service with the petitioner retired from theservice. This Court can, as well for doing complete justice, in any causetreated the said application under Section 25(1)(b) as an application under thePayment of Wages Act, 1936 for realization of the benefits consequent uponretirement of the deceased worker.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>BWDB &amp; Ors.
