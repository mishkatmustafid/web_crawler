The only question that can be decided under Art. 3—whether aperson is qualified to be deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh. Thenotification indicates that the government did not ask the right question,namely, whether the respondent was a permanent resident in Bangladesh on 15December, 1972. It was not made in exercise of power under Art. 3 and it,therefore, must be held to be ultra-vires.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Bangladesh Vs.

There is complete unanimity on all handsthat the political conduct of the resident was wholly irrelevant for decidingthe question under Article 3 of P.O. No 149 of 1972. There is no power underArticle 3 for denuding a person of his citizenship for the offence ofcollaboration with the Pakistan Occupation Army. Indeed, there is nothing inP.O. No 149 of 1972 which authorised the Government on the date of the impugnednotification to disqualify a citizen on the ground of collaboration with thePakistan Occupation Army. Such P.O. was never intended to punish an allegedcollaborator of the said Army by stripping him of his citizenship.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Bangladesh Vs.

Secondly, even if theallegations are correct, citizenship law does not deny citizenship to those whoopposed the creation of Bangladesh and even killed freedom fighters and wereengaged in murder, rape, etc. There were many Muslims (and Hindus as well) whoopposed the creation of Pakistan Citizenship law did not deny them citizenship.They deemed to be citizen of Pakistan if they had permanent residence in theterritory of Pakistan and did not leave the same. Bangladesh also followed thesame principle. In Bangladesh, collaborators and Razakars were prosecuted underthe collaborators order P.O. No 8 of 1972, but they were not denied thecitizenship of Bangladesh.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Bangladesh Vs.
