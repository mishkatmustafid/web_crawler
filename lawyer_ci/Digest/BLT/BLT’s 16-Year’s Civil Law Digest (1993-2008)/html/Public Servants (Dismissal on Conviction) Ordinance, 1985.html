Therefore the provision of the said section 3(3) is of no avail to the respondent on the facts of the case — the dismissal of an incumbent takes effect from the date of order and not from the date of verdict of conviction and dismissal order is to remain valid unless the order itself is declared void by a court.</p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideogra ;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">BADC &amp; Ors Vs.
