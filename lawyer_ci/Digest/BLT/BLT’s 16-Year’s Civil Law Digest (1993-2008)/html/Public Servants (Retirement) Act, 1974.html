It was in fact a special arrangement made for those who voluntarily want to retire on getting certain monetary and other financial benefits—the special arrangement being not a law cannot be said to be illegal and unconstitutional.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

In that view of the matter, appellant cannot be asked to retire on completion of 57 years of age, as Act No. XII of 1974 is not applicable to a person who holds any office the tenure of which is determined by or under any law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Dewan Abdul Khaleque Vs.

In 1985 the Government formed Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh by abolishing the Department of Civil Aviation by Civil Aviation Authority Ordinance, 1985, about 2000 employees of the civil Aviation Department were transferred by the Government to the newly created Authority— They formed a Samannya Parishad and launched a movement for withdrawal of the Ordinance of 1985 —The appellant contended that on the basis of the secret report the Government retired the appellant under section 9(2) of Act XII of 1974, mala fide and in colourable exercise of power.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Held : The enquiry was made after a Gazette Notification. It was, therefore, not a secret enquiry as alleged by the appellant. It was a public and open enquiry. The persons who were appointed to conduct the enquiry were all responsible high officials of the Government against whom no complaint has been made by the appellant — The final Authority who took the decision to retire the appellant was supposed to know that a retirement under section 9 (2) of the Act is not a punishment at all—We do not think that under the special circum stances of this case it was a colourable exercise of power or a Misuse or abuse of power, as urged by the appellant.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">AbuTaleb Vs.
