This proceeding ended on 13.10.199 1 and the time limit that was there in the rule was withdrawn with effect from 3.2.1992 and from this the Administrative Tribunal found that there was no wrong in the judgment of the Tribunal in holding that the case is barred by limitation. We have considered the judgment of both the Tribunals and also the admitted position that there was approval of amendment of the rule on 3.2.1992 which has no retrospective effect and thereby it appears that the case is barred by limitation.</p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank Vs.
