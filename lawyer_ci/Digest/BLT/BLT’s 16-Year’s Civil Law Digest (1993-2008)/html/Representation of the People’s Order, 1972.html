Mere appearance of hole in the gunny bag inwhich the documents have been sent cannot, in our view, invalidate the order ofthe Tribunal calling for the records in question.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Dr. Alauddin Ahmed Vs. Md. Idris Ali Bhuiyan&amp; Ors. 15 BLT (AD)04</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Article-31(2)(d)(e)</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>IfArticle 31 (2)(d)(e) is to be followed in its full letter and spirit then aballot paper is to be stamped on its back with full official mark and acounterfoil is to be stamped with full official mark not on the back but on thefront side. This is the correct and legalistic position, but during the rushthat follows a brisk polling it may not be possible for Presiding Officer orthe Assistant Presiding Officer to follow Article 31(2)(d)(e) in its fullletter and spirit and they may have to opt for satisfying the said Article insubstance by putting the official mark on the back of the ballot papers leavinga part of the official mark in the ballot paper and the remaining part of thesame in the back of the counterfoil. If, however, the ballot paper does notcontain any official mark, either in part or in full the Presiding Officer hasno option but to exclude it from count. The impression of a part of theofficial seal on the back of a ballot paper is a shortening of the elaborateprocedure under Article 31 (2)(d)(e) under pressure of circumstances. We repeatwhat we stated in the case of Abdul Matin Ms. Election Tribunal, 31 DLR (AD)331, “The standard of care which is required with such strictness as in puttingthe official mark and initial may, due to bonafide error, fall short but thatshould not affect the valuable right of franchise” and further “It cannot bethat the legislature requires a voter to be vigilant regarding the performanceof duties by the Government functionaries”. We, therefore, hold that theTribunal was justified in not excluding the ballot papers from counting whichcontained a part of the official seal, because the law has not demanded in amandatory language the presence of a full seal on the ballot paper before itsexclusion from count.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Mou.

Neither theTribunal nor the High Court Division has any jurisdiction to add any otherextraneous requirement other than those contained in sub-clause (i)-(iv) ofclause (4) of Article 36. These sub-clauses do not require that a ballot paperis to be excluded from the count if it does not contain the Code number or thesignature or initial of the Assistant Presiding Officer. The High CourtDivision acted without jurisdiction in excluding the ballot papers of both theappellant and the election-petitioner containing the aforesaid omissions.Further, from the election petition we do not find that the election-petitionermade any allegation as to the illegal counting of votes by the PresidingOfficer of Char Baleswar polling centre. We have quoted the points fordetermination by the Election Tribunal. There is no point for determination onillegal counting of votes at Char Baleswar polling centre. The election—petitioner raised other specific allegations in connection with the centre andthe Tribunal specifically found those allegations not to have been proved. Insuch circumstances, the recounting of votes of Char Baleswar polling centre wasuncalled for and without jurisdiction and was an unnecessary roving exercise.The High Court Division did not apply its mind to the contending issues betweenthe parties. Its rejection of the valid ballot papers of the applicant at CharBaleswar polling centre without even seeing them was wholly withoutjurisdiction and its rejection of valid ballot papers of the appellant atBhairampur polling station was also without jurisdiction.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Mou.

The submission of the return of electionexpenses came after the election took place and the illegal practice of not submittingthe return in accordance with the law and the corrupt practice of notdisclosing all sources of fund as required by Article 44AA(4), would not haveany direct bearing on the election. Hence I am not satisfied under Art63(1)(c). However, clearly the returned candidate and/or his Election Agenthave committed corrupt and illegal practice in the way they have compiled thereturn of election expenses and the supporting bills and receipts (or lack ofthem) and the failure to notify subsequently received funds: and neither hascomplied with the mandatory requirement of law to swear the affidavit in FormXVIIE and XVIIF, at the end of the election expense return, that I am satisfiedunder Art. 63(1)(d). The provisions of Article 63(1) being couched in thealternative, satisfaction of any one of clauses (a) to (e) is sufficient todeclare the election of the returned candidate to be void. The defence providedby Article 63(2) is not applicable in the facts of the instant case, and henceI am of the view that the election of the returned candidate is liable to bedeclared void. I consciously do not make any declaration that the contestingcandidate be duly elected since I am of the view that Article 64 is notapplicable in the facts of the instant case.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>S.

Thus the Election Commission has got the authority to decide thematter. Without entering into the question as to whether the authorityexercised by the Acting Chief Election Commissioner is a quasi judicial orderor an order in its administrative capacity, it can be safely said that therewas no delegation by the Election Commission itself to perform such functionunder the Order we are of the view that the Acting Chief Election Commissionerhad acted Coram non judice in exercising his power in this particular case.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Jatiya Party Vs.
