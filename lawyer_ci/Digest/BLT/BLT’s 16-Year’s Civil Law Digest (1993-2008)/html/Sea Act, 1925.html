It remained at the port till it was sold in auction and was taken way on 29th April, 2003. The vessel remained in the port for more then 4(four) years, far beyond the period necessary for unloading a cargo of 8,430 m.t. of rice. As such, the contesting defendants filed a counter claim of Tk.27,76,84,9 10.00 under different heads. They also paid the necessary court-fees against their claimed amount. --- It is true that long before the detection of the damaged cargo, the defendant no.5, got its 90% of the invoice value of the cargo by committing fraud on them. It might be that the concerned officials realizing the said situation, tried to arrive at a compromise solution by asking the defendant no.5 to segregate the cargo but at the same time they ought to have appreciated that the vessel was not owned by the seller, rather, it was a chartered vessel by another charterer, again in violation of clause-7 of the contract, as such, delaying and detaining of the vessel would also cause serious loss to its owner who had no contractual obligation with the plaintiff. It might be that in order to balance the payment of 90% invoice value of the cargo they wanted to detain the vessel as a security against the payment fraudulently taken by the defendant no.5, but they ought to have realized that they ought not to have done so against a third party who is a stranger to their contract, causing loss and damage to them and for such loss and damage to the defendant nos. 1 and 3, the plaintiff would now be held liable in detaining the vessel illegally since 15th July, 1999.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Govt. of Bangladesh Vs.
