Admittedly, there is no other allegation neither in the grounds served vide Annexure-I nor in the affidavit-in-opposition submitted by the respondent Nos. I and 5 except those as stated there in the memo of grounds. Memo making of G.D. entry as contained in the memo of grounds. Mere making of G.D. entry as contained in the memo of grounds and describing him as terrorist, miscreant, bomber etc. are not enough to detain a citizen of the country in custody curtailing his civil liberties. We also find that there is no specific case mentioned in the grounds nor about his involvement in alleges supply of M- 16 Rifle. Even if there has been any specific case filed against the detenu subsequent to his arrest he will face legal consequence in the said case. Delivering of speeches, making of political statements, criticizing the Government and its activities and attending political meetings of the opposition political parties do not came within the mischief of prejudicial act as well.” —Held In view of the above, we do not find any substance in the submission of the learned Deputy Attorney General.

In the absence of any assertion or any evidence in that behalf the government is not permitted to treat a property as escheat and became government khas land under Section 92 (l)(a) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. Further, before taking any such steps the Revenue Officer shall cause a notice to be published in the prescribed manner declaring his intention to enter on the holding and specifying the reason thereof and also inviting objections from all persons interested in the holding and shall consider any objection that may be submitted to him within the period specified in that behalf in the notice and shall record a decision There is complete absence of pleading of this mandatory provision of Sub-section 3 of section 92 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. There is no evidence before the court that the Revenue Officer caused any notice published in the prescribed manner before he took the decision. The Revenue Office is again required to enter on the land in order to complete the vesting of the property in the government as khas land and to this item also there is no evidence that the Revenue Officer at any time entered on the suit land and complied with the provisions of Sub-section 2 of Section 92 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mollick Ali  Ahmed &amp; Ors Vs.

In terms of compromise the pre-emption case was allowed and the consideration money was withdrawn by the purchaser pre-emptee and had given delivery of possession of the case land to the pre-emptor, petitioner — The Appellate Court dismissed the preemption Misc. Case 409/73 on the ground that since the registration under section 60 of the Registration Act was not completed in time before filing the pre-emption case it was not maintainable — petitioner thereafter again filed the Misc Case 369/75 within the statutory period of limitation from the date of registration of the deed under section 60 of the Registration Act, and he made a prayer to exempt him in depositing the consideration money again. Trial court did not pass any order but kept the application with record—on appeal the appellate court allowed on the ground of non-depositing the consideration money along with the pre-emption application— Held: It is on record that in view of the compromise between the pre-emptor and the opposite party No. 2 who is the purchaser pre-emptee the money was withdrawn by the pre-emptee purchaser and in that view of the matter, she did not contest either in the trial court in the first or second time pre-emption cases or in the appeals. Since the money was withdrawn by the rightful person, the second deposit is not necessary and the conception of it in the present circumstances is a redundant one. So the appellate court wrongly and illegally under mis-interpretation of law and fact, has allowed the appeal by the impugned judgment and order which resulted and error in the decision occasioning failure of justice and the view taken by the trial court was a correct and legal one. Law and the courts of law have been established to meet the ends of justice to the deserving party in the litigation.

In such view of the legal position as well as the factual position, the court of appeal below was perfectly justified in holding that the joint tenancy of Golam Murtoza khan was never subdivided and the rents were never distributed amongst his heirs, pre-emptor and his brothers and sisters in accordance with law, and thereby the pre-emptor did not cease to be a co sharer in the joint tenancy left by him.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Harunur Rashid Vs.
