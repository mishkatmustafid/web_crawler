Ruhul Amin:<span style='Times New Roman","serif";'> It appears that the AAT was of the view thatin proceeding against the respondent there was violation of the Rules since the2’ Show cause notice was issued on the direction of the Chief Justice and intaking final decision for awarding punishment the same was not placed beforethe Chief Justice, but was considered by the Register (appellant) and finallyhe awarded the punishment. The fact being that it is the Registrar who is thecompetent authority in respect of the Respondent for taking disciplinary actionand that the Registrar on consideration of the materials on record having madethe decision for awarding punishment to the Respondent and having passed theorder of removal the same in my view cannot be said to have been passed inviolation of the Rules.</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Supreme Court of Bangladesh Vs.
