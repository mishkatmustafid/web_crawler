How much retainable khas land still belongs to which of the wards of said estate cou1d not be ascertained, we understand such survey was never made. It may be noted that it is misleading to say Bhawal Raj Court of Wards Estate since no such Court of Wards finds its existence in the Act. Similarly, whereabouts of the manager could not be ascertained. Who made whom manager could not be made clear. Nor any authority could be placed before us on behalf of the manager to represent the estate.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mrs. Romisa Khanam &amp; Ors Vs Govt. of Bangladesh &amp; Ors 16 BLT (HCD)461</p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
