This Rule provides to the Authority power to give direction on any owner to ply his vessel on any rule as per timetable in the public interest. This Rule also provides that is such case the Authority may waive their quarrymen’s of any or all the Rules provided in the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (Time and Fare Table Approval Rules 1970). Therefore even if it is conceded that certain Rules have not been complied with, the non-compliance of these rules will not make the time table issued under Rule 15(l)(c) in favour of M.V. Maraj to be illegal and without any lawful authority on the ground of non compliance of the Rules. It was contended that the Rule 15(1 )(c) cannot be relied upon if the requirement of section 54 of the Inland Shipping Ordinance 1976 to have a Route permit had been violated. We have been that while issuing the timetable the Authority did issue a route permit under section 54 of the said Ordinance.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sirajul Haque &amp; Ors.
