Even if the children prefer to live with the mother due to natural affection or attachment for her, that would not in any way affect the liability of the father to maintain the children. If the father objects to the custody of the children and want to assert his own legal right, the proper course for the father would be to apply for his custody, but so long as the custody of the children remains with the mother, he cannot on any plea refuse to pay maintenance for the children.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Bazlur Rahman Sikder Vs. Mrs. Tahera Begum Shamima 6BLT (HCD)-191</p><p> </p><p> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section 6 &amp; 7</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A close reading of section 6 and 7 of The Ordinance 1961 manifestly demonstrates that a Talaq in any form shall not stand effective and Talaq shall be no Talak in the eye of law unless provision contained in section 7(1) is sternly compiled with and marriage between husband and wife shall subsist and in the event of subsistence of existing marriage no man can enter into second marriage with a woman and if he enters second marriage he shall contribute himself to be punished under section 6(5) of The Ordinance.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Dilruba Aktar Vs. A H Mohammad Mohsin. 11 BLT (HCD)-447</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Subsection 5(b) of Section 6 read with Penal Code, 1860</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-64</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In subsection 5(b) of Section 6 of The Ordinance of 1961 provision of fine had been provided hut no consequence has been supplied in the event of default of payment of fine. In the absence of any consequence following nonpayment of fine, the imposition of fine becomes superfluous. This legal flaw perhaps went unnoticed by Lawmakers at the time of giving effect to certain recommendations of the commission of Marriage and Family Laws. The Ordinance of 1961 though is a special law, Laws engrafted The Penal Code can be pressed in aid of the flaw cropped up in subsection 5(b) of The Ordinance of 1961. Section 64 of The Penal Code can be pressed into service in the matter.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Dilruba Aktar Vs.

Giasuddin Khan Vs. Miss Beauty Begum &amp; Ors. 8BLT (FICD)-328</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-9</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Regarding the past maintenance</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">There is no provision for past maintenance in the Ordinance of 1961 and 1985. But in the instant case, it appears that for not fault of the opposite party (wife) the petitioner was neglecting and refusing to maintain her since 2 years before the institution of the suit— the court has the jurisdiction to pass a decree for past maintenance in an appropriate case like the instant one.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md. Sirajul Islam Vs Mosammet Helena Begum &amp; Ors. 3BLT (HCD)-40</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Whether a Muslim women could have claimed maintenance beyond the period of iddat.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Quran directs a woman who is divorced to undergo a period of iddat elsewhere and herein Quran directs a man to give maintenance in case he divorces his wife — a person after divorcing his wife, is bound to maintain her on a reasonable scale beyond the period of iddat, till she loses the status of a divorce by remarrying another person.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Hefzur Rahman Vs. S. Nahar &amp; Ors. 3BLT (HCD)-49</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Whether pronounced talaq by swearing an Affidavit is a valid talaq in the eye of law as no notice to the Chairman of the Union Council was served</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section 7 (1) of the Ordinance provides for giving of notice of talaq to the Chairman and a copy thereof to the wife and provides for punishment for contravention and this law overrides any other provision of any other law. But there being clear intention to divorce by the Affidavit on the part of the petitioner and the same having been disclosed and produced before the lower appellate court by the petitioner himself. The petitioner cannot take advantage of his own wrong and cannot claim the benefit of non-service of notice by him to the Chairman. He is bound by his admission. Payment of dower being obligatory as per Nikahnama the wife is entitled to the same on talaq.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md. Serajul Islam Vs. Most Helena Begum &amp; Ors. 7BLT(AD)-137</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Maintenance—Muslim Women—in the light of the Holy Quran Per ATM Afzal, CJ: Relying on Sura At-Talaq, verse 6(65:6); and opening verse of Sura At-Talaq (65:1)</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Held : There is a clear direction in respect of a pregnant woman who has been divorced and the direction is to bear her expenses till she has delivered. In the previous verse it has been stated that in the case of a pregnant woman her period of Iddat will be till delivery. It is therefore apparent that the maintenance has been related to the period of Iddat. The interpretation given by the learned Judges is thus apparently in conflict of the aforesaid verse—from the above, it is clear that the interpretation given by the learned Judges is not and cannot be acceptable because it brings conflict and even on the general criterion of interpretation as they also would not deny that a document should be read as a whole, the interpretation of the learned Judges must be rejected.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M. Hefzur Rahman Vs. Shamsun Nahar Begum &amp; Ors. 7BLT (AD)-33</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Per Mustafa Kamal, J : The relevant Suras and Ayats of the Holy Quran on iddat, reconciliation, maintenance and mata a after pronouncement of talaq are to be found in Sura Al-Baqarah 12:228, 237, 241], Sura At Talaq [65 : 1-61, Sura-Al-Ahzab 33:49 and Sura Al-Nissa [4:35]. The Holy Quran divides divorced women into 6 categories— Separate provisions have been made in the Holy Quran for no or separate periods of iddats and maintenance for each of the above categories of divorced women</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M. Hefzur Rahman Vs. Shamsun Nahar Begum &amp; Ors. 7BLT (AD)-33</p><p> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Per Latifur Rahman<strong>, J:</strong> In the Holy Quran there is no clear direction for payment of maintenance to a divorced woman. Verse 228 of Surah Baqarah translated in Bengali reads as follows:</p><p style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">“এবং তালাক প্রাপ্তগণ নিজেদের জন্য তিন ঋতু পর্যন্ত অপেক্ষা করবে।”</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">This is a direction of Allah as contained in the Holy Quran. Iddat is a period of waiting, After divorce the marriage tie between the husband and wife is dissolved and after the dissolution of marriage there remains no obligation between the parties outside the contract of marriage, but due to the period of iddat outside the contract of marriage an obligation for payment of maintenance has been created according to Muslim Law.... There being no direction of payment of maintenance during the period of “Iddat” in the Holy Quran, one is bound to follow the other sources of Islamic law for a guidance on the question of granting of maintenance to a divorced woman.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M. Hefzur Rahman Vs Shamsun Nahar Begum &amp; Ors. 7BLT (AD)-33</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-9, Read with The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 Section-488</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Past maintenance — A wife can claim past maintenance for herself and for her children for only 6 years prior to the filing of the suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">From a reading of the entire ordinance of 1985 it appears that the provisions thereof are intended to provide for the establishment of Family Courts and for matters connected therewith and are not intended to make provisions for modification or amendment of Mohammedan law or any other substantive law. The Ordinance is indeed procedural in nature.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Jamila Khatoon Vs. Rastom Ali 4BLT(AD)-97</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Under section 5 of Ordinance of 1985 the wife can claim past maintenance for the child if she has been supporting the child in the same household without any contribution from the father. But if she does not claim separate maintenance for the child, the court will consider the overall needs, keeping in view the fact that she has been supporting a child in the same household. In either case, the claim is subject to Article 120 of the Limitation Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Jamila Khatoon Vs. Rastom Ali 4BLT (AD)-97</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section-20</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The affidavit of divorce is a public document and it requires no formal proof the Appellate Court having the power of the original Court has rightly admitted the said instrument of divorce and legally marked the same as Ext. A.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sirajul Islam Vs.
