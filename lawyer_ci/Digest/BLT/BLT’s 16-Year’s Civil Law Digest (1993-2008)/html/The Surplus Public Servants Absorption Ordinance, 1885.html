A ‘just cause’ under this provision may exist apart from the invalidity of the will and if there is a valid subsisting will which is either proved or admitted, it will be useless to revoke the grant even if just cause has been established.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Namita Rani Biswas &amp; Ors Vs.

Therefore, one claiming independent of the will cannot be said to have an interest in the property of the testator. A person who claims outside the will or independent of the will and claims adversely to the testator and disputes his right to deal with the property, cannot claim any interest in the estate of the deceased.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">ADC (Revenue) Vs.

Decision of the Appellate Division is to the effected that the word “interest” in section 283 of the Succession Act means interest from the testator and that if a person claims independently of the Will cannot be said to have interest in the probate case relied on 35 DLR (AD) 254.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Chandi Proshad Dhar Vs.

By order dated 26.05.92 the learned District Judge transected the case to the Court of the Subordinate Judge Arbitration Court at Dhaka who was for the first time found in appeal that he did not have such authority to dispose the case. For this mistake of the learned District Judge, the petitioner cannot be held responsible nor his application would fail.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Muhaiminul Hassan Khan Vs.

It may be noted that any person may apply for the certificate but it is always expected that an heir of the deceased should make the application. A succession certificate is not the final adjudication of the question as to who is the next heir and as such, entitled to the estate of the deceased. Granting of a certificate merely clothed the holder with an authority only to recover the debts of the deceased and to give valid discharge. In law nomination or declaring one as the next of kin for official record does not operate as a transfer or assignment of the securities or debts, or more particularly the estate of the deceased. Similarly, aw decided in the case of Krishnamacharia v Venkatamma, ILR 36 Madras 214 and that of in re Estate of C V Nayagan, 1936 Rang 466, the Court is always empowered to grant a succession certificate to a minor on his application through his mother.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Muhaiminul Hassan Khan Vs.
