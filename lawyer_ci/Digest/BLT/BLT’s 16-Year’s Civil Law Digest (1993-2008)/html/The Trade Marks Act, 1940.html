Thus, it appears that prima facie there is no phonetically or visual resemblances between the marks applied for and the registered mark. It further appears that at the hearing stage before the Registrar the appellant expressed their desire to delete the device of coat of arms from their label and in that view of the matter it appears to ask that the Registrar ought to have proceed with the applications for registration after allowing the appellant to delete the device of coat of arms from their label.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sudhir Kanti Shil Vs. Registrar of Trade Marks 9 BLT (HCD)-74.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section- 10(2)</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">“Honest Concurrent Use”</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Since 1992 the appellants and the respondents are in litigation in respect of the Trade Mark “Banoful” and that the appellant got registration of the Trade Mark “Banoful” in his favour and at one stage the respondent no. 1 hereof got an order for registration of the Trade Mark “Banoful”, which has been disallowed by the High Court Division in Trade Mark Appeal No. 7 of 2000, against which the respondent No. 1 hereof preferred appeal in the Appellate Division and the same is pending and the operation of said judgment and order of the High Court Division has been stayed till disposal of the appeal. This shows that the appellant hereof is the registered owner of the Trade Mark “Banoful” in respect of this various items including Chanachur, Sweetmeat and laccha Semai and Confectionery and they are carrying on their business lawfully with the Trade Mark “Banoful”, whereas the contending respondent has applied for registration of the Trade Mark “Banoful” against which the appellants have filed the opposition cases. The respondent no. 1 is using the Trade Mark “Banoful” illegally and therefore the claim of use of the Trade Mark “Banoful” for over 14 years by the respondent hereof has no legal value and said period cannot be counted for the purpose of section- 10 (2) of the Trade Mark Act to get benefit as honest concurrent user and hence granting of registration of Trade Mark “Banoful” in favour of Respondent No. 2 under Section 10(2) of the Trade Marks Act is illegal.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Abdul Motaleb &amp; Ors Vs.

In the instant case in response to the notice served upon him under Section 14(1) of the Act the appellant did not take any steps whatsoever till the impugned order was passed by the Registrar and in that view of the matter it appears that the Registrar out stepped his authority in disposing the same on merits on the ground that the mark offends the provision of Section 10(1) and 8(a) of the Act. In the facts and circumstances of the case the Registrar ought to have resorted to rule 24(1) and treat the application as abandoned.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

None of the provisions is alternative to each other, nor resort to the Section 73 of the Act is made subject to Section 15 of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">M/S Hamja Robber Industries Vs.

Therefore, there is no doubt that their business in respect of export and sale of liberty shoes in Bangladesh is being substantially damaged and the respondent company has substantial interest in having the mark removed from the register and the respondent No.2 as such is a person aggrieved within the meaning of section 37 and 46 of the Trade marks Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Md.

Thus it appears that the commodity of respondent No. 2 was already in the market and naturally became popular among the people and they also obtained registration of the trade mark on 15.08.1990 and subsequently the same was renewed for another period for 15 years as per law. hence it is clear that the petitioners’ commodity was not in the market when the respondent’s commodity namely OLYMPIC BALPEN was in the market since 1988 and its registration was obtained —Held; The High Court Davison, therefore rightly held that the petitioners were not entitled to file applications for rectification of the trade mark registry as prayed for.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Tripti Industries Ltd &amp; Ors Vs.

Admittedly the importer also is not coming with any action against the registration of the marks of the appellant on the ground that use of the mark by the appellant has jeopardized his business as that mark was registered in Indian and the products were legally imported. The consumers are also not coming with any such grievance. In that view of the matter we hold that the respondents before the Registrar failed to make out any case as a person aggrieved.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Samah Razor Blades Industries Ltd.

However, the opponent has no cause of action to file the Opposition Case and the same has been filed on account of business rivalry and to delay the registration of the trade-mark SONYO and thereby to harass the applicant. The words “SONY” and “SONYO” are not visually and phonetically similar to an identical with each other. There is no chance on the part of the customers or consumers to get confused and embarrassed because of the two appellations, namely, SONY and SONYO Virtually, the initiation of the Opposition Case No. 1543 of 2000 is an exercise in futility. The said case is founded on false and frivolous allegations — After filing of the Opposition Case No. 1543 of 2000 as against the Trade Mark Application No.48468 in Class-9, the opponent—appellant filed a number of applications in Form TM-55 for extension of time and those were allowed. Lastly on 05.09.2001 the appellant put in another application in Form TM-55 for extension of time, but that was turned down on 09.09.2001 and the application for registration of the trade-mark SONYO filed by the respondent no. 1 was accepted. —Held it was incumbent upon the Registrar of Trade Marks to afford an opportunity to the opponent-appellant of being heard prior to disposal of the Opposition Case No. 1543 of 2000. Admittedly the Registrar did not comply with the mandatory provisions of Section 70 (c) of the Trade Marks Act and he having not complied therewith illegally and erroneously rejected the Opposition Case No. 1543 of 2000 and accepted the application of the applicant-respondent no.1 for registration of the trade-mark SONYO. The entire exercise undertaken by the Registrar of Trade Marks appears to be ‘de hors’ the law. Against this backdrop, the impugned order is liable to be struck down.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Sony Kabushika Kaisha Vs. Sonyo Industrial Co. Pvt.

Further neither respondent No. 1 nor its alleged registered user of the trade mark MIS Medley Industries has used the registered trade mark Tibet-570 for 5 continuous years until I month before the application as made. It is prayed that the registration of trade mark under Registration No. c-i 525 in class-3 in favour of respondent No. 1 be expunged on the ground of non-use of the trade mark under section 37 of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 as contended by the petitioner’s Advocate.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Held: In the instant case there Was an agreement entered into between MIS. Medley Industries and Kohinoor chemical Co, Ltd. Karachi, Pakistan, MIS. Medley Industries was also recorded as registered user of the Trade Mark — The customs authorities have also described Medley Industries as a concern manufacturing laundry soaps under Trade Mark Tibet-570 and they assessed custom duty for the period 1992-93. These evidence in my opinion to indicate that MIS. Medley Industries was manufacturing laundry soaps under the said trade mark at least one month before filing of this application — so the claim of the petitioner as an aggrieved person to have the trade mark expunged from the registry on the ground of non-use in the facts and circumstances of the case does not lie.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Kohinoor Chemical Co (Bangladesh) Ltd.

It, thus, appears that miscarriage of justice has been occasioned as the application praying for further time was disposed of on 30.4.97 after the expiry of the granted time and as such in the interest of justice the appellant should be given a chance to file the necessary documents.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Industro Chemic B.

The words “...but shall not be bound to do so”, used in the last part of Rule 23 in my opinion refers to “renewed search” by the Registrar Trade Mark but not to the initial search as required under the Rule. Consequently, the duty with which the Registrar is entrusted with under the Rule 23 of the Trade Marks Rules, 1963, to search all the pending application is binding upon him for public interest so that no confusion can be created in the minds of the public by not doing so and then give notice if other applications are pending.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Aarman Soap Factory Vs.
