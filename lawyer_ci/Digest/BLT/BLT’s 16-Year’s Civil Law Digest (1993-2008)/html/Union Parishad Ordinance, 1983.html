The matter of hearing objections was completed by the Upazila Nirbahi Officer, Galachipa vide his public Notice dated 17.9.2002 much earlier that is on 26.9.2002 following which the Deputy Commissioner, Patuakhali directed the Delimitation Officer as per provisions of section 19 of the Union parishad ordinance, 1983 to delimit the area of the said two Unions namely Bakulbaria and Kalagachia Unions as well as the territorial limits of the Thana with the said area. His act of hearing objections on the name of the Unions and thereafter changing the name of Kalagachia Union to Kallayan Kalash Union appears to have been done in excese of his jurisdiction and the subsequent naming of the said Unions as notified in the gazette public shed dated 30.1.2003 as Kallayan Kalash Union appears to have been done illegally and without lawful authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Shoeb Ahmed Masud Vs.
