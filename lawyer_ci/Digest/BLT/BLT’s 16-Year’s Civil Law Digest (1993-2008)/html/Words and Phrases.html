The lower appellate court further held that in respect of the acquiredland, the court cannot direct the Government to lease out the suit land to theplaintiffs simply because their predecessors—in-interest as the original ownershad been in possession even after acquisition. It does not appear either fromthe judgment of the trial court or from the lower appellate court that theplaintiffs had ever made out any case under section 16 of the Land AcquisitionAct, 1894, namely that no award regarding compensation for acquisition of theland was prepared by the Government or the original owners did not receive anycompensation for acquisition in question. It appears that the learned Judge ofthe High Court Division upon making out a third case, on consideration ofsection 16 of the said Act, has wrongly reversed the decree of the lowerappellant court and decreed the suit wrongly holding, inter alia, that althoughthe land had been acquired by the Government as far back as in 1941 the samedid not absolutely vest in the Government free from all encumbrance because theGovernment did not take physical possession thereof in pursuance of theacquisition in question. Moreover the learned Judge of the High Court Divisionwas not justified in considering the trial court’s finding that defendant No.1is a monthly tenant in respect of the suit land, overlooking that the lowerappellate court rightly held that the plaintiffs, who have no right, title andinterest in the suit land, had no legal authority to induct defendant No.1 as amonthly tenant in the suit land.</p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;Times New Roman","serif";'>Govt of Bangladesh&amp; Ors.
