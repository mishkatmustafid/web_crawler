First, if the property is needed. Or, if the property is likely to be needed. A property is either needed or it is likely to be needed but while acquiring a property the Deputy Commissioner cannot keep both the alternatives in his pocket. He has to choose between the two. If he keeps both the options open, then he does not know whether the property is needed for immediate use or it is likely to be needed for some future use. The use of both these alternative expressions in the notice under section 3 is indicative ofa lack of application of mind and the notice under section 3 is liable to be struck down on that ground as well.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Sankar Gopal Chatterjee vs Addi Commissioner Dhaka Division 41DLR326.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Section 3</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">Acquisition for a co-operative society per se is not a public purpose. The need to state the precise public purpose in the body of the notice under section 3 is imperative. Besides, under section 17 no acquired property under the Ordinance shall be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it is acquired.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Acquisition for a co-operative society per se is not a public purpose. The purpose for which the Co-operative Society proposes to use the acquired land is the ultimate test for a decision as to whether the acquisition is for a public purpose or not. There is a total lack of disclosure in the notice under section 3 as to for what purpose the Co-operative Society needs the acquired land. The need to state the precise public purpose in the body of the notice under section 3 is imperative, because under section 4 of the Ordinance any person interested in the disputed property has the right to object to the acquisition of the property challenging the public purpose stated therein, but if no specific public purpose is stated in the notice, then the right given to the objector under section 4 is rendered nugatory and illusory. Besides, under section 17 no property acquired under the Ordinance shall be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it is acquired without the prior approval of the Government.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Hence on the ground of lack of public purpose the acquisition proceedings fail.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Sankar Gopal Chatterjee vs Additional Commissioner, Dhaka Division 41 DLR 326</em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Sections 3 and 4</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">The objection raised in the facts of the case is merely technical and does not touch upon the genuineness of the requirement which is obviously of an immediate nature. It is on record that the petitioner filed successive objections for consideration. There being a consideration by the acquiring authority the impugned judgment need not be interfered.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Zahed Hossain Mia vs Deputy Commissioner 50 DLR (AD) 15.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Sections 3 and 4(3)(b )</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">The notice under section 3 suffers from a total lack of jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align:justify">When the Additional Commissioner directed the Deputy Commissioner, Kishoregonj to proceed from the stage of section 4(3)(b) of the Ordinance, there is a presumption thathe rejected the petitioner's contentions upheld by the Additional Deputy Commissioner. In all fairness the Additional Commissioner should have given a finding on those issues. Without disposing of those issues the Additional Commissioner could not have directed the Deputy Commissioner, Kishoregonj to proceed under section 4(3)(b) of the Ordinance. As we have independently found that the notice under section 3 suffers from a total lack of jurisdiction, no need to dwell at length on this point.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Sankar Gopal Chatterjee vs Additional Commissioner, Dhaka Division 41DLR326,</em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Sections 3 and 6</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">The description of the land sought to be acquired are vague, indefinite, unspecified and uncertain and did not enable the owners to make an effective objection in writing against the order of acquisition and the same has rendered the acquisition proceeding illegal.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Haji Abdur Rahim vs Secretary, Ministry of Land Administration and Land Reforms 46 DLR 378.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Sections 3 and 15</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">The provision of section 15 is mandatory-An agreement with the non­Government requiring body is a sine qua non for the exercise of power, before the Deputy Commissioner acquires the jurisdiction to publish a notice under section 3 of the Ordinance.</p><p style="text-align:justify">The provision of section 15 is not directory but mandatory. Before the Deputy Commissioner acquires the jurisdiction to publish a notice under section 3 an agreement with the non-Government requiring body is a sine qua non for the exercise of such power. It is a condition precedent. It cannot be whittled down by any device. It cannot be even accepted that an acquisition proceeding may be started without any agreement, but if a subsequent agreement is reached then it amounts to validation. The principle of subsequent validation cannot be entertained in a matter where the property rights of the citizen are involved.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Sankar Gopal Chatterjee vs Additional Commissioner Dhaka Division 41DLR326.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Sections 3 and 1</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">The acquisition proceedings are a colourable exercise of power as they were started without any agreement with the requiring body under sectiori 15 of the Ordinance and for circumventing a valid decree of the Civil Court.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Sankar Gopal Chatterjee vs Addi Commissioner Dhaka 41DLR326.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Sections 7 and 8</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">Assessment of award­ - Under section 7 the Deputy Commissioner is to make the award and while making it he must determine the compensation on matters as mentioned in section 8. The question of agreement between the Awardee and the Requiring Body is not very relevant within the scheme of the Ordinance in this regard.
