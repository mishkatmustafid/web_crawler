The Ordinance was promulgated on 28 November 1985 and the list under section 5(l)(a) thereof was published in the gazette on 28-4- 1986. Section 7 provides that any person claiming any right or interest in any building which is included in the list may within a period of 108 (perhaps 190) days from the date of the publication of the list in the official gazette make an application to the court of settlement for exclusion of the building from such list, etc. It is not disputed that although the notification was published on 28-4-1986 the court of settlement was constituted on 21-10-1986. The appellant filed the writ petition on 19-8-1986, apparently at a time when the court of settlement was yet to be constituted. The High Court Division may not have admitted the petition at all because of the aforesaid provision but having admitted the same, apparently being aware that the court · of settlement was not constituted then, it was not quite proper to decline interference after three yars on the ground of alternative remedy, more so. having itself noticed that the Ministry of Home Affairs did not even come up with an affidavit to asert the presence of a Police Box as stated by the contesting respondents in their affidavit-in­opposition in spite of a specific direction in that behalf.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Held: In the result, the appeal is allowed declaring the impugned notification has been made without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Begum Lutfunnessa vs Bangladesh 42 DLR (AD) 86. </em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 5(1)(b)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Serving notice to a wrong address making no attempt to take possession or to ascertain the status of the property casts doubt as to the bonafide of the respondents' intention to serve a proper and effective notice to surrender the possession of the property included in the 'Kha' list.
