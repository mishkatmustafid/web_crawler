The matter is otherwise after 1973. There was a change in the law of citizenship of Bangladesh. We find from Annexure-L that the petitioner has very clearly made a representation that by virtue of Act of 1973 he has become a citizen of Bangladesh by operation of law. The facts stated in favour of such claim have not been disputed by the respondent, nor any fact has been alleged so as to connect the petitioner with citizenship of Pakistan after the law of abandoned property came into operation. On the contrary, the petitioner has given convincing evidence that he surrendered his Pakistani passport obtained in 1963 in London and that the said passport has been destroyed by the Embassy of Pakistan as per Government instructions. Of course it is not claimed by the learned Deputy Attorney-General that by acquiring British citizenship the disputed property has become liable to be treated as abandoned property. For, a property can be treated as an abandoned property only if the owner thereof was a citizen of Pakistan at any time after the 25th day of March, 1971.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Mirza Shahab Ispahani vs Bangladesh 40 DLR 87.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Article 2 –</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">A person who is deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh under Article 2 is not required to take any oath of allegiance unless he is elected or appointed to any office mentioned in the Third Schedule of the Constitution: per MH Rahman J.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Per Mustafa Kamal J (agreeing): For purposes of being a "deemed citizen" of Bangladesh under Article 2, no person is required to express an allegiance to Bangladesh either by law or by the Rules. He becomes a "deemed citizen" of Bangladesh by operation of law.</p><p style="text-align:justify">The legal fiction as to continuance of residence in Bangladesh as provided in proviso to Article 2 must be limited to the purpose for which it is created and should be strictly construed and should not be extended in the name of beneficial construction beyond its context.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Where the proviso to Article 2 is attracted a citizen will not be required to explain further his case for staying abroad. That provision of law will not however, preclude a citizen from explaining his staying abroad on other good reasons. For example, from December 1971 to September 1973, due to snapping of all communications between Bangladesh and Pakistan and because of non-recognition of Bangladesh by Pakistan, hundreds of Bengali citizens were stranded in Pakistan.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Bangladesh vs Professor Golam Azam 46 DLR (AD) 192.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Article 2 –</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">If any person wishes to claim citizenship he must prove that he had a permanent home or domicile of origin in Bangladesh and that he had permanently so domiciled in the territory once called East Pakistan on 25th day of March 1971 and he continues to be so resident of that territory thereafter on and from 26th March, 1971.
