As to power of transfer, though the order of transfer was not an issue in that case this Court, by way of putting true construction of Article 17(1), made the observation that the order of transfer from the Jute Mills to the Zonal Office of the Corporation is "no doubt an instance of the powers of control and regulation." Reading the judgment of this Court in that case as a whole there can hardly be any doubt left for the view of this Court that power of control, supervision and regulation under Article 17(1) necessarily includes the power of transfer. This view has been strengthened by the Gazette Notification dated 15 September 1975 as referred to above which specifically empowers the Corporation to take any disciplinary actions against any officer of a nationalised enterprises under it. This Notification was issued under Article 5(a) of PO 27of1972.</p><p style="text-align:justify">The learned single Judge in the instant case was of the view that this Court did not decide the question as to whether the Corporation got power to transfer an employee of one nationalised unit to another nationalised unit but simply made an observation in this regard. With respect, we hold that the view taken and construction of law given by us in that case have not been properly appreciated by the learned Single Judge. He has placed reliance upon another decision of this Court in the case of Bangladesh Freedom Fighters Welfare Trust vs Burhanuddin Chowdhury reported in 33 DLR (AD) 32 1. In that case the Bangladesh Freedom Fighters Welfare Trust terminated the service of an employee of an industrial unit namely, Tabani Beverage Co Ltd., an abandoned property, under PO 16 of 1972 which was placed under the said Welfare Trust for running its business. The Freedom Fighters Welfare Trust was established under PO 94 of 1972. The order of termination was successfully challenged before the High Court Division in a Writ Petition and this Court on appeal affirmed the High Court Division's decision and held the order of termination in valid for lack of statutory authority on the part of the Welfare Trust.</p><p style="text-align:justify">The learned Single Judge in the instant case is found to have placed both the cases on the same footing overlooking the broad fact that the Corporation in the instant case exercised power of transfer under the provision of Article 17 of PO 27 of 1972, whereas there is no corresponding provision in PO 16 of 1972 or in PO 94 of 1972 empowering the Welfare Trust to take disciplinary action against employees of an abandoned property placed under it.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Nishat Jute Mills Ltd vs Md Sanaullah 40 DLR (AD) 298.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Articles 5(a) and 17(1)-</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">In view of the Gazette Notification issued under Article 5(a) and the provisions of Article 17(1) of PO 27 of 1972, the Corporation's powers to take disciplinary action including power to transfer now stand beyond question.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Nishat Jute Mills Ltd vs Md Sanaullah 40 DLR (AD) 298.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Articles 10 and 17-</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">The present definition of the local authority as contained in section 3(28) of the General Clauses Act included a corporation like Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation or Bangladesh Food and Sugar Industries Corporation which are brought into existence under the provisions of President's Order No. 27 of 1972.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Commissioner of Taxes vs Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation 53 DLR 509.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Articles 10 and 17-</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">The present definition of the local authority as contained in section 3(28) of the General Clauses Act includes a corporation like Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation brought into existence under the provisions of President's Order 27 of 1972.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Commissioner of Taxes vs BCJC (Statutory) 54 DLR 202.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Article 10(1A)-</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">This provision immunises an order of challenge only on the ground that the industrial enterprise had not vested in the Government or was not liable to be vested. If there is a lawful placing, vesting takes place under Article 10(1A) and a double vesting takes place under Article 4(1)(as introduced by Ordinance No. XXV of 1976). But if the placing itself was unlawful, the vesting did not take place, either under Article 10(1A) or Article 4(1).</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Bangladesh vs Dhaka Steel Works Ltd and others 45 DLR (AD) 69.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Article 10(1)(d)-</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">There is a general power of placement of any industrial enterprise by the Government under a corporation, followed by a special power of placement of two kinds of industrial enterprises but restricting the categories in the manner done in 30 DLR (SC) 1 69 was not quite right. When the Government places an industrial enterprise under a Corporation and such enterprise is neither an abandoned property nor owned by a statutory corporation, the vesting of its shares or other proprietary interests takes place for the first time under President's Order No. 27 of 1972.</p><p style="text-align:justify">This is what may be called the Government's general power of placement of any kind of industrial enterprise under a Corporation. Not being vested in the Government before its placement under a Corporation, the Government "shall pay" compensation to its former shareholders.If no compensation is payable, then the industrial enterprise must have been placed under a Corporation not under the general power of placement, but under the power of placement of abandoned properties or those owned by a statutory corporation.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Bangladesh vs Dhaka Steel Works Ltd and others 45 DLR (AD) 69. </em></strong></p></div></div>
