If any irregularity was there initially, it has been cured. After they were confirmed following probation of 2 years under the rules their services cannot be terminated arbitrarily in the manner as done by the impugned letter. The grounds of redundancy on which the petitioners have been retired is a colourable exercise of power. The respondent is therefore directed to reinstate the petitioners and pay them arrears salaries as claimed.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Kanaklata Halder vs Barisal Pourashava 42 DLR 533. </em></strong></p></div></div>
