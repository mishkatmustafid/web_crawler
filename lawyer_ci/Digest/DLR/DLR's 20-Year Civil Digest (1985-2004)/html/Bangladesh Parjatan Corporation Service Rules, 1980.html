<h2 class="blog_entry-title">Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation Service Rules, 1980</h2><div class="entry-content"><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Rule 41 (2)</strong>-</p><p style="text-align:justify">If an officer gives a notice in whatever form purporting to terminate his service, the Corporation on its part may issue an order of release and there will be nothing wrong in it. In the case of the respondent his letter seeking permission to retire was practically a notice for termination of his service to which the appellants agreed by issuing the impugned letter releasing him from service. In any view it cannot be said the order was misconceived or illegal.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation vs Mofizur Rahman 46 DLR (AD) 46. </em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Rule 41 (2)(i)(iv)-</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">Termination of service of employees of a statutory body-No reason was required to be assigned for their termination-If the termination is found to be within the four corners of the law the Court cannot nullify it on the ground that it is harsh. There is no requirement in the Rules that termination would be void when no reason for it was assigned. The principle of natural justice is also not applicable in the case as this principle has been excluded in the Rule itself. The appointing authority has got power to reinstate a terminated employee, in exclusion of some others, on the merit of individual case.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation vs Shahid Hossain Bhuiyan and others 43 DLR (AD) 154. </em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Rule 47-</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">An officer or employee of a statutory corporation is not entitled to a second show cause notice, unless the Rules specifically so provide. The said Rules do not provide for any second show cause notice. The respondent was given a second show cause notice ex gratia and he had no entitlement to it. The Corporation could have passed the order of punishment after the enquiry was over without serving any second show cause notice.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation vs AKM Abul Kalam 47 DLR (AD) 67. </em></strong></p></div></div>
