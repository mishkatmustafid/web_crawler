This definition has remained unaltered althrough. Under this section the bargader or adhiar is not a tenant, but he acquires the status of a tenant only in two circumstances: if he is admitted as a tenant by the landlord in any document executed by him or executed in his favour and accepted by him, or if he has been held by a Civil Court to be a tenant.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Shafiullah vs Sultan Ahmed Mir 37 DLR 193. </em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Section 3(17)-</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">For the purpose of creating lease of agricultural lands a written document is not necessary.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Hazrat Ali (Md) vs Government of Bangladesh and ors 47 DLR 246. </em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Sections 5(1), 52, 61, 86A and 195(e)-</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">­Applicability of the provision of Bengal Tenancy Act in respect of Patni tenures-A talukdar holds a tenure under a Zamindar, a Darpatnidar under a talukdar and so on. The same goes for a howladar and a Nim howladar and so on. The provision of Bengal Tenancy Act relating to tenures are, prima facie, applicable to Patni Laws. Bengal Tenancy Act cannot vary the relative rights of Zamindars and Patni talukdars as established by Regulation VIII of 1819 but if there are provisions in the Bengal Tenancy Act which are in the nature of supplementing the relationship without being in conflict with the Patni Laws, the provisions of Bengal Tenancy Act will apply in respect of Patni tenures.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Bangladesh vs Tobarak Ali Mia 43 DLR( AD) 130. </em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Section 22-</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">Explanation-A person having a right of occupancy does not lose it when jointly interested in the land as proprietor. But the 'Explanation' to this section is of fundamental importance in that it operates as an exception to the general principle of merger in sub-sections (1) and (2). It provides that if an occupancy raiyat acquires a share in the superior interest, that is, an estate or a permanent tenure, he shall not lose the raiyati interest. The doctrine of merger, under which the occupancy right disappears, is based on the commonsense principle that a person cannot be, at the same time, both landlord and tenant of the same premises.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Shafiullah vs Sultan Ahmed Mir 37 DLR 193. </em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Section 22(1)-</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">Complete merger is effected when the entire interest of the proprietor/ permanent tenure-holder and entire raiyati interest is united in the same person.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Shafiullah vs Sultan Ahmed Mir 37 DLR 193. </em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Section 22(1)(2)-</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">In case of a merger, the landlord holds only the superior interest and can possess the land as a tenant but he has to pay rent for the land in his khas possession "for use and occupation of the same."</p><p style="text-align:justify">As provided in the Explanation, a person holding occupancy right in a land does not lose it by becoming a joint proprietor in the land.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong><em>Shafiullah vs Sultan Ahmed Mir 37 DLR 193. </em></strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Section 22(2)-</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Provides for partial merger</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">Sub-section (2) provides for partial merger which takes place if a co-sharer landlord acquires the raiyati interest under him and his other co-sharer landlords.
