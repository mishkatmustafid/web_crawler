The disability attaches to the lawyer and not to the plaint. Court is to fix a date for steps to be taken by plaintiff when he may appear himself or by another recognised agent or by the same attorney after curing the defect. SSC Judge wrongly held that due to defect in power of attorney there was no cause of action for the suit, for it is the principal who has cause of action for the suit. Plaint can be rejected only when on the averments the plaintiffs is found not to have cause of action. Without rejecting the plaint the court has a clear duty to fix a date for the plaintiff to take steps.</p><p><strong><em>Anath Bandhu Guha &amp; Sons Ltd vs Babu Sudhangshu Shekar Halder 42 DLR (AD) 244. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Orders III-IV rule 1, Order VI rules 2, 14 and 15, Order VII rule 11-</strong></p><p>The rule does not specifically pinpoint as to who shall present the plaint.

In order to prove service of summons as per provision contained in Order V, rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure two conditions must be satisfied: (I) absence must be from residence: (2) if defendant is not found at his residence and there is no agent empowered to accept summons an enquiry has to be made to find out absentee defendant's adult male member residing with defendant and in process server's affidavit, these facts must be stated. Since process server concerned has not been examined nor service return of the summons been made exhibit, question whether aforesaid conditions stand satisfied or not does not arise for consideration. There is absolutely no evidence to show that Kasimuddin on whom the summons meant for opposite party defendant No. 20 was served, happens to be the male member of the opposite party's family and residing with him.</p><p><strong><em>Osiruddin Mandal vs Azizur Rahman 39 DLR 403. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order V rules 16 and 18-</strong></p><p>Service of summons-When the lower appellate Court finds that the name of the clerk who received the summons is not distinct and the names and addresses of witnesses in whose presence the summons was served have not been noted in the original summons, that provides a strong ground for the court below to hold that the summons was not served. The procedure provided for serving summons is not to be whittled down by importing the concept of "substantial compliance" as done by the High Court Division.</p><p><strong><em>Bangladesh vs Chand Mia &amp; others 44 DLR (AD) 98. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order V rule 17-</strong></p><p>Service of summons, proof of-Summons served by process-server without noting the names and addresses of Mokabila witnesses in the service return ­Process-server appearing in Court as a witness-­his evidence without examining the Mokabila witness not acceptable-It is obligatory upon the process-server to mention in his report the name and address of the person, if any, by whom the house in question was identified and in whose presence the copy of summons was affixed­ When service reports were devoid of these essential information, they were unacceptable­.

From perusal of the record of the court below I am unable to find that those requirements of law have been fulfilled in this case. In that view of the matter, I hold that there being no service of summons on the petitioner the ex parte decree passed by the court below is liable to be set aside.</p><p><strong><em>Nur Ahmed vs Mokter Ahmed 41 DLR 84. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order V rules 17 and 19-</strong></p><p>Procedure when the defendant refuses to accept service or he cannot be found and examination of the serving officer to be followed-has been stated.</p><p><strong><em>Ratan Chandra Karmaker vs Afsar Ali 40 DLR 147. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order V rules 17 and 19-</strong></p><p>Process-server's duty regarding the non-acceptance of the summons-Rules 17 and 19 of Order V of the Code of Civil Procedure to be read together­Court's function to examine the process-server on oath under rule 17 stated in such cases.</p><p><strong><em>Ratan Chandra Karmaker vs Afsar Ali 40 DLR 147. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order V rules 17 and 19-</strong></p><p>Provisions of rule 19 of Order V, CPC are mandatory.</p><p><strong><em>Ratan Chandra Karmaker vs Afsar Ali 40 DLR 147. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order V rules 17 and 19-</strong></p><p>When neither the bailiff files an affidavit in support of his endorsement on the service return of summons nor does the Court examine him on oath when there is no such affidavit, the service is not valid.

So, in absence of any statement by OPW 2 on the point of his identification, the recital as to the identification which is like other evidence remains uncorroborated and in the face of denial by the defendant there remains a genuine suspicion that the service was made, if at all, upon a wrong person.</p><p><strong><em>Alhaj Abdul Aziz vs Kalipada Das 41 DLR 170. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order V rule 19B(2) &amp; Order XLI rule 21-</strong></p><p>A summons sent by registered post and returned with the endorsement refused is prima facie evidence that the addressee had an opportunity to accept it and the service thus effected is a good and valid service.</p><p><strong><em>Shahabuddin Ahmed vs Abdur Rab Molla &amp; others 52 DLR 305. </em></strong></p></div></div>
