It consists of the entire set of facts which gives rise to a legal action and is to be provided to entitle the plaintiff to succeed in the suit. It has little relation either to the defence to be taken by the defendant or the nature of relief prayed for.</p><p><strong><em>Surat Sarder and others vs Aftal Hossain and others 49 DLR (AD) 99. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order VII rule l(e), Order VIII rule 3 &amp; Order XIV rule 1-</strong></p><p>Cause title forms very much a part of the application (for pre-emption). Statement made therein should be denied specifically or by implication.</p><p>What is stated in the cause title is not an averment and as a result the pre-emption application should fail, even then the revisional application is liable to be rejected because of the decision in the case of Mr. Matitur Rahman vs Md Iman Ali@ Md Iman Miah and others I981 BLD (AD) 280 wherein it has been held, that mere omission to making an assertion in respect of ceiling of land in the application by the pre­emptors or to adduce evidence to this effect in the absence of any averment to the contrary, will not render the application liable to be dismissed and an omission to record a finding to this affect in such a circumstance cannot be a ground for dismissal of the pre-emption case.</p><p><strong><em>Idris Mia vs Promode Ranjan Das 45 DLR 126.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Order VII rule 3-</strong></p><p>Failure to give specification of suit land-the plaintiffs having failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of law in giving description sufficient to identify the suit land, they are not entitled to any decree even if they succeed in proving their title.</p><p><strong><em>Noor Mohammad Khan vs Bangladesh 42 DLR 434. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order VII rule 3-</strong></p><p>Identification of the suit property-The lower appellate Court on scrutiny of plaint schedules came to the finding that the description of the suit land given by boundaries is quite identifiable and not vague and thereby rightly revised the trial Court's finding on identification. The suit being one for declaration of· title only and there being no prayer for confirmation of possession or recovery of possession, the point of alleged vagueness as to the description ofthe suit land was not so material for adjudication.</p><p><strong><em>Bangladesh vs Dewan Obaidur Reza Chowdhury 43 DLR 551. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order VII rule 7-</strong></p><p>The Code permits the grant of such general or other relief as the plaintiff is entitled to get upon the evidence even if the plaint does not contain a prayer for the relief.</p><p><strong><em>Commander (Rtd) AA Chowdhury vs AKM Imam Hossain and others 49 DLR 23. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order VII rule 7-</strong></p><p>In the name of granting general or other relief the Court cannot and would not mount any surprise on the defendant and make him liable for something which does not arise out of the plaint and, as such, he had no occasion to answer the same.

Furthermore, the jurisdiction of the civil Court having been vested in the Administrative Tribunal by the promulgation of special statute the jurisdiction of civil Court in respect of bank employees has been ousted, and in that view of the matter, the plaint was rightly returned by the civil Court for presentation to the proper Tribunal having jurisdiction.</p><p><strong><em>Mansur Ali vs Janata Bank 43 DLR 394.</em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order VII rule 10-</strong></p><p>Locus standi to invoke Admiralty jurisdiction-Only the owner or consignee or assignee of the Bill of Lading of any goods may claim damages against the owner, master or crew of the ship.

The Trial Court had recorded the finding that there was no inquiry before requisitioning the property in question. On the fact of such finding it is beyond comprehension as to how the plaint itself was rejected under Order VII, rule 11 CPC.</p><p><strong><em>Nur Muhammad vs Mainuddin 39 DLR (AD) 1. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order VII rule 11-</strong></p><p>Plaintiff alleges, that requisition has been made for collateral purpose-Rejection of the plaint in view of such allegations not proper. The main theme in the plaint is that the order of requisition was passed for a  collateral purpose and thus maia fide in nature. It may be that ultimately the plaintiffs cannot prove mala fide as alleged in suit but the plaint cannot be rejected outright under Order VII, rule 11 CPC upon entering into the question at issue on the basis of facts to be proved by evidence.</p><p><strong><em>Nur Muhammad vs Mainuddin 39 DLR (AD) 1.</em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order VII rule 11-</strong></p><p>A plaint will not be rejected unless it shows want of cause of action and is not barred by any law.</p><p><strong><em>Shahzadpur Central Co-operative Multipurpose Society Ltd vs Md Abdul Bari 37 DLR 178. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order VII rule 11-</strong></p><p>Rejection of plaint without recording evidence and without considering the facts that ought to come out after taking evidence not sustainable. The suit was filed on the basis of a loss of contingent right that the plaintiff, an alleged promoter, was left out in the formation of the proposed Bank-Such a promoter has always a cause of action for filing the suit.</p><p><strong><em>National Bank Ltd vs Haroon Malik &amp; others 42 DLR 103. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order VII rule 11-</strong></p><p>Bar of MLR and res judicata-The judgment by the Summary Military Court in the case being without jurisdiction the rejection of plaint on plea of earlier trial by such a court is not sustainable.</p><p><strong><em>Meher Ali vs AK Murshid 42 DLR 357. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order VII rule 11-</strong></p><p>'The plaint alone (and not the application of the defendant) should be considered for arriving at a decision whether rejection of the plaint under Order VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure merits or not. In so doing, the Court must apply its mind to the case of the plaintiff as set out in the body of the plaint as a whole assuming all the averments made therein to be true in the manner and form without taking into consideration the pleadings of the defendant.</p><p><strong><em>Abul Hassnat vs Ershad Ali Beg 41 DLR 244. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order VII rule 11-</strong></p><p>There is no legal bar for a defendant to pray for rejection of the plaint and no bar to. the court disposing of such a prayer before filing of the written statement.

To reject a petition for pre-emption at the initial stage on the ground of non-registration of the document before filing of the petition would cause unnecessary hardship. By deferring the decision on the point of pre-maturity of the pre-emption petition till final hearing of the case itself the trial Court committed no error of law.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Muhaimin Khan vs Bashiruddin 45 DLR 382. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order VII rule 11-</strong></p><p>Respondents in a civil suit alleged that they did not nominate any representative but the Chairman concerned out of grudge brought two of his men and showed them being nominated by the respondents in Village Court-Appellant (Defendant) proceeded for rejection of the plaint in the face of these allegations-Plaint in civil suit, cannot be rejected- To decide the truth of the matter evidence is necessary which can be available only in course of trial of the suit which is prima facie maintainable.</p><p><strong><em>Kazi Mobarak Ali vs Mohammad Yeasin Mazumder 43 DLR (AD) 60. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order VII rule 11-</strong></p><p>Rejection of plaint-At what stage it can be done- There is no hard and fast rule as to when and at what stage a plaint can be rejected.

The later suit having been brought before the dismissal of the Title Suit No. 210 of 1981 the bar of Or.
