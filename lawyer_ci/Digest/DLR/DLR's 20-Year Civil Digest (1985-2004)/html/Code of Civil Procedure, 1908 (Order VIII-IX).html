The impression is unmistakable that the learned Advocate for the petitioner was thereafter, not allowed to participate in the proceeding because the Labour Court was determined to proceed ex parte. We consider, thereafter that the ex parte proceeding was totally uncalled for and without jurisdiction both in terms of clause ( d) of sub-section (2) of section 36 of the said Ordinance and in terms of Order VIII of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p><strong><em>Adamjee Jute Mills vs Chairman Labour Court 39 DLR 11. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order VIII rule 1 (after amendment)—</strong></p><p>A party was not bound to put in a written statement under the old law, but now it is obligatory for the defendant to file a written statement.</p><p><strong><em>Adamjee Jute Mills vs Chairman Labour Court 39 DLR 11. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order VIII rule 1-</strong></p><p>Filing of written statement by the defendant within the prescribed period of time is now a mandatory provision of law.</p><p><strong><em>Lal Mamud and others vs Siraj Miah and others 45 DLR 638. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order VIII rules 1 &amp; 10-</strong></p><p>The defendant has given reasonable explanation for delay in filing his written statement in the case-ends of justice will be frustrated if the same is not accepted.</p><p><strong><em>Fazlul Huq vs Md Tohed Ali and others 47 DLR 326. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order VIII rule 1 &amp; Order XLI rule 12- </strong></p><p>Right 'to appear and answer an appeal' as given under rule 12 is completely different from that to contest a suit by filing a written statement under rule 8(1) of the Code. The appellate Court fell in serious error of law in equating both the rights as same and in allowing the opposite parties to file written statement for the first time in appeal.</p><p><strong><em>Narayan Chandra Saha and another vs Jatindra Chandra Saha and others 52 DLR 5. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order VIII rules 1-5 and Order XIII rules 1-2-</strong></p><p>Whether in view of the repeal of rules 1-2 of Order XIII the provisions of rules 15 of Order VIII, are applicable to the present case.</p><p><strong><em>Abul Hashem Khan vs Shamsuddin Khan 41DLR415. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order VIII rules 2 and 5-</strong></p><p>Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Ordinance [XL VIII of 1983] came into force on 5-9-1983 before the judgment which was delivered on 30-8-1984.

Before the decree is passed in a suit fixed for hearing in default of written statement, the defendants may come to the court and file a written statement and it remains in the domain of the court's discretion to accept or reject that written statement.</p><p><strong><em>KDH Laboratories Ltd vs Pubali Bank 40 DLR 1. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 6—</strong></p><p>If the court accepts the written statement in exercise of its discretion, it must give reasons for it on failure of which the superior Court will be at liberty to interfere with the decision.

The decision of the Indian Supreme Court reported in AIR 1964 (SC) 99 3 holding that there is no hiatus between the two stages of reservation of judgment and pronouncing the judgment so as to make it necessary for the Court to afford to the party the remedy of application under Order IX, rule 7 has no manner of application.</p><p><strong><em>KDH Laboratories Ltd vs Pubali Bank 40 DLR 1. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 8 and Order XVII rule 2- </strong></p><p>When prayer by the lawyer for adjournment of the plaintiff's case is refused by the Court, whereupon the lawyer withdraws from the case and the case thereupon is dismissed-the conclusion is there was no appearance on behalf of the plaintiff and as such the dismissal order is one passed under Order .

Any delay in filing application under Order IX, rule 9 CPC in circumstances like this is condonable.</p><p><strong><em>Shaikh A Kader vs Kalu Sk 37 DLR 304. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 9-</strong></p><p>Fresh suit-Same cause of action-Since two suits were filed one after another upon the same cause of action, the later suit ought to have been stayed. The later suit having been brought before the dismissal of the Title Suit No. 210of1981 the bar of Order IX rule 9 has no manner of application in the present case.</p><p><strong><em>Hajee Abdul Latif vs Abdul Haq and others 44 DLR 601. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 9-</strong></p><p>The Court below committed no illegality in holding that the subsequent application under Order IX rule 9 was not maintainable.</p><p><strong><em>Alhaj Mokler Hussain Talukder vs Ainuddin Ahmed and others 45 DLR (AD) 37. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 9-</strong></p><p>It is wrong to say that for a remedial action against an order time would start to run against one from the date of the order and not from the time when one comes to know about it.</p><p>When an injury is caused to a party due to any mistake or default committed by a court or its officers, it is not only the right but also the duty of the court to correct its own mistake.</p><p>The question of limitation is immaterial in a case, when the court in restoring the suit merely corrected the mistake of its own officers of not informing the lawyers of the parties about return of the record and the next date fixed.</p><p><strong><em>Keramat Ali Bhuiyan vs Ramizuddin Ahmed Bhuiyan 43 DLR (AD) 58. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 9-</strong></p><p>Since the Artha Rin Adalat Act does riot provide any provision, directly or indirectly, contrary to provision of Order 9 rule 9 CPC an application under Order IX, rule 9 CPC can be entertained by the Artha Rin Adalat.</p><p><strong><em>Sonali Bank vs Md Al-Akram (Badal) and others. 46 DLR 671. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 9-</strong></p><p>The trial Court was required to look into the previous orders and apply its mind as to whether prayer for adjournment was genuine. The Court having allowed 17 adjournments contributed to the abuse of the court process. The failure of the plaintiff to conduct the hearing of the suit, if considered in the context of his past conduct, cannot be said to be due to any sufficient cause.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Mannan Miah (Md) vs Abdul Jalil Miah and others 49 DLR 524. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 9-</strong></p><p>From the absence of any provision in the Ain prohibiting filling of an application under Order IX rule 9 of the Code and from the specific mention of the Code in sub­section (5) of section 5 of the Ain, provisions of Order IX rule 9 of the Code may be followed by the plaintiff financial institution before the Artha Rin Adalat for setting aside an ex parte order of dismissal of the suit for default.</p><p><strong><em>Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited vs Al-Haj Md Shafiuddin Howlader &amp; another 52 DLR (AD) 76. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 9-</strong></p><p>When a SCC Suit is dismissed for default provision of Order IX rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure is applicable.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Waresh vs Md Abdul Halim and others 53 DLR 608. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 9-</strong></p><p>Though High Court Division found relying upon the case of Sultana Jute Mills Ltd that a revisional application under section 115 of the Code against an order of the Artha Rin Adalat is not maintainable made the Rule absolute invoking inherent power of the court under section 151 of the Code.</p><p><strong><em>Agrani Bank vs Artha Rin Adalat and others 55 DLR 389. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 9-</strong></p><p>When the factslallegations pleadings in two suits filed one after another are same, the parties are same, the suit land islare same and that on the same pleadings the earlier suit was dismissed even though ex parte, the second suit on the same pleadings is barred under Order IX rule 9 of the Code.</p><p><strong><em>Taiyaba Zaman vs Gias Uddin Ahmed and other 55 DLR 523. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 9-</strong></p><p>Owing to absence of any provision in the Ain prohibiting filing of an application under Order IX rule 9 of the Code and the specific mention of the Code in sub-section (5) of section 5 of the Ain, the provisions of Order IX rule 9 of the Code may be followed by the plaintiff financial institution before the Artha Rin Adalat for setting aside an ex parte order of dismissal of the suit for default.</p><p><strong><em>Agrani Bank vs Artha Rin Adalat and others 55 DLR 389. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 9 &amp; Order XXII rule 10- </strong></p><p>Assignee's claim to be added as· a party in a Miscellaneous case under Order IX, rule 9 of the Code-It will be for the assignors to satisfy the Court that there was sufficient cause for their non­appearance in the suit they wanted to restore. The assignee is hardly in a position to prove independently the assignor's case as made out in the application under Order IX rule 9 and in that view the assignee is a redundant party in the Miscellaneous case.</p><p><strong><em>Almasuddin vs A Wadud Khan 42 DLR 391. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 9 and Order XLIII rule l(c) and section 151-</strong></p><p>Suit dismissed for not depositing cost within time-An order under Order IX, rule 9 is appealable under Order XLIII, rule 1 ( c ), but Court can restore the suit invoking its power under section 151 to secure the ends of justice.</p><p>An order passed by a Court under Order IX, rule 9 CPC is no doubt an appealable order under Order XLIII, rule l(c) CPC. In this case from the facts it appears that the application under section 151 of the Code was filed for restoration of the suit on setting aside the order of dismissal of the Miscellaneous Case which was dismissed not for non-appearance of the plaintiff when the case was taken up for hearing but for not depositing the cost within the time allowed by the Court. The power under section 151 of the Code is not a new one, it is inherent in it by virtue of its duty to do justice between the parties before it and it is within the province of the Court to invoke such power to secure the ends of justice regard being had to the facts and circumstances of a given case.</p><p><strong><em>Rajiqul Islam &amp; another vs Abul Kalam 42 DLR 19. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 9 read with Order XLIII rule 1(c)-</strong></p><p>When an application under Order IX rule 9 of the Code is dismissed for default, it is an appealable order but when the case is dismissed not for a default but for non-payment of cost, then the order can be set aside by invoking section 151 of the Code on acceptance of the costs subsequently.</p><p><strong><em>Wajeda Khatun and others vs Saonatun Bewa 55 DLR 460. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 9 and section 151-</strong></p><p>If there is specific provision in the Code of Civil Procedure which covers a particular case or if there is a positive prohibition against an act the powers under section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code cannot be invoked-An important exception to this general rule: Where a mistake of a Court's Officer causes injustice to a particular party, the power under section 151 of the Code can be exercised for the purpose of giving necessary relief.</p><p><strong><em>Syed Azizul Haque alias Nanna Miah vs Sonali Bank 42 DLR 198. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 9 and section 151-</strong></p><p>Provision of section 5 of the Limitation Act applicable to an application under Order IX, rule 9 CPC.

There is substance in the submission. Judgment and order of the courts below are therefore set aside and the Miscellaneous case is allowed.</p><p><strong><em>Khaleda Roushan Ara vs Md_ Nurul Huq 42 DLR (AD) 48. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 13-</strong></p><p>The compromise decree in question was passed even without issuing summons upon defendant No. 8. This speaks of fraud.

Since the petitioner who is the decree holder has been impleaded in this case, it cannot be said that the miscellaneous case suffers from any defect of party.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Mannan vs Waliul Huq 46 DLR 630. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 13-</strong></p><p>Appeal-Effect of its disposal-'Appeal' which has not been defined in the Code, is meant to be an application by an aggrieved party asking an appellate Court to set aside, modify or revise a decision of a subordinate court-an 'appeal' even if irregular, incompetent or time-barred is nonetheless an appeal-the order of dismissal of a memorandum of appeal as time-barred comes within the deeming provision of section 2(2) of the Code, because by such an order the rights of parties with regard to matters in dispute are finally determined.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Mannan vs Jobeda Khatun &amp; others 44 DLR (AD) 37. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 13-</strong></p><p>Setting aside ex parte decree-Before fixing the suit for ex parte hearing the trial Court must satisfy itself that notices were duly served upon the substituted heirs. No such satisfaction was recorded and then the records did not show that notices were issued both through the usual course of process server and under registered post (ref 40 DLR 314). In that view ends of justice will not be met if the original suit is not restored to its file and number.</p><p><strong><em>Gulshan Ara Begum vs Moazzem Hossain 43 DLR 481. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Order IX rule 13-</strong></p><p>Setting aside decree passed ex parte--Order of remand for considering the question of limitation-In the instant case no question of limitation was mooted or discussed by the trial Court and hence it could not be said that by restoring the case the delay was impliedly condoned.
