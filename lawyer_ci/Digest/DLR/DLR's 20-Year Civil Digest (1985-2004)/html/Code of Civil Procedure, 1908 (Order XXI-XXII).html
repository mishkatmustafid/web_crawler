An enquiry at the instance of a third party in possession is contemplated only under Order XXI r. 100 after he was dispossessed and not before.

High Court Division failed to consider that the decree was put into execution for realisation of decretal costs and the main question was whether the auction sale was legally held and to these material questions no judicial mind was applied.

A plaintiff cannot get the exemption automatically without filing an application or a Court cannot exercise the power of exemption after the suit has abated. This is also the view of the Calcutta High Court in AIR 1957 (Cal) 12.</p><p><strong><em>Hamidul Huq Chowdhury vs Amina Khatoon 47 DLR 446. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXII rule 4(4)-</strong></p><p>Under the law the heirs of a non contesting defendant need not be substituted.</p><p><strong><em>Jalaluddin (Md) and others vs Laily Begum and others 48 DLR (AD) 163. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXII rule 4(4)-</strong></p><p>Since opposite parties were non-contesting and did not file any written objection till the date of final hearing, no substitution of their heirs is necessary as procedural law the Code of Civil Procedure will apply.</p><p><strong><em>Jalal Uddin Ahmed (Md) and ors vs Delwar Hossain and ors 51 DLR 552. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXII rule 9-</strong></p><p>Addition of parties is permissible in respect of the representatives and heirs of persons relating to whom a suit had abated provided there were sufficient reasons for it.

The suit being one for declaration of title the revision is required to be disposed of on merit by the High Court Division.</p><p><strong><em>Nuruzzaman (Md) vs Moazzem Hossain and others 53 DLR (AD) 56. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXII rule 9-</strong></p><p>After recording and drawing up a preliminary decree in a suit for partition, there will be no abatement on the death ofa defendant and the legal heirs of the deceased­defendant can be brought on record at any time for effecting proper allotment of shares.</p><p><strong><em>Arabinda Das vs Sura Bala Das and others 53 DLR 97. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXII rule 9(2)-</strong></p><p>Prayer for setting aside an abatement order-Unless there is gross negligence, etc the expression "sufficient cause" may be liberally construed-If this abatement is not set aside the applicant is deprived of proving his claim-Court's power in dealing with such an application is discretionary, and Court when exercising it may afford to be liberal.</p><p><strong><em>Azimunnessa vs Rup Gaji 39 DLR 6. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXII rules 9(2)(3)-</strong></p><p>Effect of abatement can be overcome only by fulfilling the provisions of Order XXII, rule 9(2) and (3) of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p><strong><em>Bhupati Biswas vs Niranjan Biswas 40 DLR 517. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXII rule 9(2)(3)-</strong></p><p>Unless there is gross negligence and laches on the part of the applicant, the Court should liberally consider the prayer for setting aside abatement as an abatement deprives the applicant the opportunity of proving his claims.</p><p><strong><em>Shakainath Mohanta vs Md Tatikuddin Mondal and others 52 DLR 541. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXII rule 10—</strong></p><p>A writ application has to abate as against the dead person.

The Court failed to consider this material aspect that in the suit preliminary decree was drawn and the suit was not completely disposed of and before that stage application for assignment of shares was filed. The High Court Division misdirected itself in holding that the application was one under Order XXI rule 16 by which the question to be decided is whether the applicant is the person entitled to execute the decree but that stage did not reach till then.</p><p><strong><em>Manik Chand Bibi alias Rezian Nahar and another vs Abdul Mutakabbir Chowdhury 44 DLR (AD) 251. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXII rule 10—</strong></p><p>The court has ample power to treat an application filed under Order I rule 10 CPC as an application under Order XXII rule 10 CPC.
