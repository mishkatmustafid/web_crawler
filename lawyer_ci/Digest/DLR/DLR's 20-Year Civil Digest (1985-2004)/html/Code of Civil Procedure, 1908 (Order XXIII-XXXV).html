Besides, there had earlier been an order of remand and opportunity to produce all the papers.</p><p><strong><em>Khabiruddin vs Bangladesh 43 DLR (AD) 201. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rule l Order XLI rule 23- </strong></p><p>The appellate Court cannot direct the trial Court on remand to consider the application for withdrawal of the suitafter the suit had already been decreed bytl'le trial Court. In allowing the application the trial Court must come to a finding that the suit suffers from formal defect.</p><p><strong><em>Pradip Kumar Malakar vs Birendra Chandra Malakar 45 DLR 422. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rules 1 &amp; 2-</strong></p><p>The plaintiff is at liberty to withdraw his suit at any stage without any permission from the Court and he needs permission for withdrawal only when he wants to sue afresh on the same cause of action.</p><p><strong><em>Shyamal Chandra Roy vs Probhat Chandra Roy 51 DLR 504. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII(1)(2)-</strong></p><p>There is no legal bar in granting an application for withdrawal of a suit with liberty to file a suit afresh on the self-same matter even at the revisional stage provided the other requirements of the. law are complied with.</p><p><strong><em>Mustafa Kabir Uddin Ahmed vs Badrun Nessa Chowdhury 54 DLR 416. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rules 1 &amp; 2(a)(b)-</strong></p><p>The court may allow withdrawal of suit if it is satisfied that the suit must fail by reason of some formal defects or there are sufficient other grounds.</p><p><strong><em>Sk Abul Kashem vs Abdus Samad Biswas 51 DLR 70. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rule 1(1)-</strong></p><p>The withdrawal of suit by necessary implications blots out the effect of the judgments and decrees prior to withdrawal. If the application for withdrawal is allowed and at the same time the decrees passed by the courts below be retained it would create a situation contradictory in terms. An order of setting aside of judgments and decrees in the suit withdrawn should naturally follow.</p><p><strong><em>Abdur Rahman and others vs Kheru Malitha and others 50 DLR (AD) 71. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rule 1(2)-</strong></p><p>Where the trial Court dismissed the suit. not only on formal defects but also for want of merit in the plaintiff's case, permission to withdraw the suit with liberty to sue afresh on the same subject matter is not contemplated in law.</p><p><strong><em>Habibur Rahman Paikar (Md) vs Gour Gopal Datta and others 51 DLR 54. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rule 1(2)-</strong></p><p>Petition under Orders XXIII, rule 1(2) for withdrawal of suit­Court to decide whether there is any formal defect or sufficient ground-If there is none, duty of the court is to reject the application-But if it allows withdrawal, leave to bring a fresh suit cannot be refused.</p><p>There is no dispute whatsoever and the legal position is very much clear that without any formal defect or sufficient ground the prayer for withdrawal with permission to sue afresh cannot be allowed. It is now well settled as held in 5 DLR 89 that the first thing that the Court has to decide is whether there is any formal defect or sufficient ground for which the withdrawal should be allowed. If however there is no such defect or ground the clear duty of the Court is to reject the application. But if it allows withdrawal it cannot refuse leave to bring a fresh suit, for the obvious reason that the sole purpose for which the withdrawal is sought is to institute a suit afresh.</p><p>The application for permission to withdraw from the suit and to file a fresh suit on the same cause of action is to be regarded as one indivisible whole, and it is not open to the permission to bring a fresh suit.</p><p><strong><em>Shahabuddin Ahmed vs Upazila Election Officer 41 DLR 168. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIll rule 1(2)-</strong></p><p>Withdrawal of the suit with liberty to sue afresh-Plea of formal defects in the schedule to the plaint-Defects can be amended by filing a petition for amendment of the plaint-Discretion vested in the court under Order XXIII, rule 1(2) CPC has been properly exercised-No illegality committed in rejecting revisional application summarily.</p><p><strong><em>Md Badruddin Moral vs Santosh Kumar Sen 41 DLR (AD) 156. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rule 1(2)-</strong></p><p>The application for withdrawal of the suit ·having not stated specifically the legal, formal or other defects which cannot be cured even by amendment of the plaint and the assertions made therein being vague and in lump the order for withdrawal with liberty to sue afresh is set aside.</p><p><strong><em>Abdur Rahman vs Abdul Mabin 46 DLR 246. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rule 1 (1)(2)(3)(4)-</strong></p><p>Whether the right of withdrawal of a plaintiff from the suit is dependent on the consent of the other plaintiffs.</p><p><strong><em>Kumud Behari Majumdar vs Nirmal Krishna Majumdar 40 DLR 415. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rule 1(3)-</strong></p><p>Dismissal of a suit for non-prosecution does not amount to withdrawal of the suit and the plaintiff is not precluded to file a fresh suit on a new cause of action.</p><p><strong><em>Amir Hossain Khairati vs Abdul Aziz Bepari and others 47 DLR (AD) 106. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rule 1(4)-</strong></p><p>Controlling power of sub-rule ( 4) of rule l of Order XXIII. Is sub-­rule (1) of rule 1 independent of other sub-rules? Apart from the controlling power under sub-rule (4) whether the court has any power to impose restriction upon the right of one or more of the several plaintiffs to withdraw from the suit without the consent of others or in spite of such restriction as imposed under sub-rule (4) of rule 1 of Order XXIII, the court can exercise the inherent power to make appropriate order in the interest of justice. Is sub-rule 1 of rule 1 independent?</p><p><strong><em>Kumud Behari Majumdar vs Nirmal Krishna Majumdar 40 DLR 415. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rule 1(4)-</strong></p><p>In spite of controlling powers as reserved in sub-rule (4), the Court has inherent right to exercise powers in passing appropriate orders in all cases if the interests of justice so demand.</p><p><strong><em>Kumud Behari Majumdar vs Nirmal Krishna Majumdar 40 DLR 415. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rule 1(4)-</strong></p><p>Whether withdrawal of the plaintiff from the suit on behalf of himself and all others by virtue of a Power of Attorney is permissible under law-Whether the order passed allowing the suit to be dismissed for ·non-prosecution on the basis of solenama on the application of one proforma defendantlplaintiff would be hit by provisions of Order XXIII, rule 1, sub-rule (4).</p><p><strong><em>Tamijul Haque vs Yunus Ali (Md) 42 DLR234. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rule 1(4)-</strong></p><p>Withdrawal of co­plaintiff from the suit-The Court can exercise the inherent power to make appropriate order in the interest of justice.</p><p>A co-plaintiff, if he has a separate cause of action, can always be allowed to withdraw without affecting the rights of other co­plaintiffs-withdrawing plaintiff needs be transposed as proforma defendant in order to avoid the suit being dismissed for defect of parties.</p><p><strong><em>Suresh Majumder vs Govt of Bangladesh 42 DLR JO. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rule 3-</strong></p><p>Solenama remaining in possession of the defendant for about 4 years with no explanation why it was not filed in court, nor was any prayer ever made during this time for recording the solenama. This shows solenama was not acted upon.</p><p>The normal course in respect of a compromise is that whenever any compromise is made between the parties during the pendency of a suit, then the plaintiff or any other party does not proceed with the suit but that they file a compromse-petition with a joint-prayer through their lawyers for recording the solenama and then the proceeding of the suit shall stop there. But in this case, it appears that not only the plaintiff proceeded with the suit but also the defendant No. 2 (appellant) contested the suit all through till the date of final hearing on 31.1.90. Thiruvengada Mudaliar vs Thaugavelu Mudaliar and others AIR 1928 (Mad) 594 &amp; AIR 1934 Pat 582 held not applicable.</p><p><strong><em>AFM Safiyyullah vs AKM Bashirullah 46 DLR 146. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rule 3-</strong></p><p>When parties to a suit compromise their dispute in consideration of something not covered by the subject matter of the suit such consideration forming a stipulation in the petition of compromise cannot be effective part of the compromise decree but such stipulation being part of a valid contract can be enforced by a separate suit, though not by putting the decree into execution.</p><p><strong><em>Fazlu Molla vs Shamsul Hoque Molla 45 DLR 299. </em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Order XXIII rule 3 and Order XLIII rule 1(m)-</strong></p><p>In a case where decree has been passed in pursuance of an order recording compromise, there can be an appeal against the order itself and the decree drawn in pursuance to the said order will not be a bar to the right of appeal given under Order XLIII, rule 1(m) of the CPC.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Khaleque vs Siddiqur Rahman 42 DLR 29. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXIII rule 3 and Order XLIII rule 1(m)-</strong></p><p>Where compromise not denied and nothing to show the same was unlawful-Court has no option but to pass a decree on compromise.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Khaleque vs Siddiqur Rahman 42 DLR 29. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXV rule 1-</strong></p><p>The object of Order XXV, rule 1 CPC is to protect the defendant in cases where in the event of success he may face difficulty in realising the cost of suit-The Court can, either on an application by the defendant or of its own motion on a finding that the plaintiff or plaintiffs have no immovable property in Bangladesh other than the property in the suit, pass an order directing the plaintiff or plaintiffs to furnish security or costs.</p><p><strong><em>Ratan Krishna Ghose vs Rafique Miah 40 DLR 303. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXV rule I, Order XXXVIII rule 5 &amp; Order XLI rule 5-</strong></p><p>For mere non including of the properties in the security, the same cannot be brushed aside or rejected.</p><p><strong><em>Mr Sikder vs. Bangladesh Water Development Board 49 DLR 113. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXVI rule 9-</strong></p><p>A court can order local investigation for the purpose of elucidating any matter in dispute, if it deems such investigation necessary.</p><p>A reference to Order XXVI, rule 9 shows that local investigation can be ordered for the purpose of elucidating any matter in dispute in which the court deems that the local investigation is necessary. According to the plaintiff, he has title in the suit land and he has been illegally dispossessed by the defendant. The defendants also assert that the plaintiffs land is 200 yards away from the land of the defendant. This is really a matter of evidence and the trial Court will decide that in pursuance of the evidence both oral and documentary that will come up at the stage of trial.</p><p><strong><em>Maulana Abdul Matin vs Shah Alam Bhuiyan 41 DLR 243. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXVI rule 9-</strong></p><p>A matter which can be decided by evidence cannot be subject-matter of local investigation.</p><p><strong><em>Maulana Abdul Matin vs Shah Alam Bhuiyan 41 DLR 243. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXVI rule 9-</strong></p><p>Plaintiff described his land by giving boundary-Defendants in WS asserted that lands claimed by the plaintiff are not the same land as claimed by the defendant-Local investigation not necessary. <strong><em>Maulana Abdul Matin vs Shah Alam Bhuiyan 41DLR243. </em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Order XXVI rule 9-</strong></p><p>Local investigation ­</p><p>Further commission-Since the court will be in a position to determine the disputed point on the basis of the investigation done at the instance of the plaintiffs and other materials on record, further commission is redundant.</p><p><strong><em>Md Emdaduddin Sheikh vs Atiqur Rahman 42 DLR 416. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXVI rule 9-</strong></p><p>Local investigation</p><p>­Discretion-It is not to be fanciful-The Court has discretion in passing order allowing or not allowing a Pleader Commissioner but the discretion is to be judicious and not fanciful. The refusal of local investigation was perhaps for avoiding delay in disposal of the proceeding but it has actually been lingered because of the impugned order which could, be avoided by allowing the prayer for local investigation as warranted by the facts.</p><p><strong><em>Kazi Abdul Awai Zewar Rashid vs DMC 45 DLR 509. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXVI rule 9-</strong></p><p>In the absence of any pleading, evidence or application it is not the businesses of the Court to appoint an Advocate Commissioner for holding local investigation.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Kader Mondal and others vs Akbor Mondal and others 47 DLR 237. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXVI rule 9-</strong></p><p>The trial Court is not correct in rejecting the report of the Advocate Commissioner simply saying that some irrelevant things have been stated in the report-irrelevant things if any, could be deleted and at the time of trial objection could be raised against the report.</p><p><strong><em>Jahanara Begum and others vs Azizul Islam (Kanchon) and others 47 DLR 587. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXVI rule 9-</strong></p><p>If identity of the suit property is not challenged by the other side, the question of holding local investigation relaying the property does not arise.</p><p><strong><em>Lakshmi Bazar Shahi Masjid Committee and another vs St Francis Xavier's Girls High School 51 DLR 557. </em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Order XXVI rule 9-</strong></p><p>The report of the Advocate Commissioner is neither substantive nor conclusive evidence.
