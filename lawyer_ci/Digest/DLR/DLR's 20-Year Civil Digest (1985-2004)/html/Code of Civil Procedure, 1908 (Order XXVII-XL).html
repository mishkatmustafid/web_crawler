In matters of service a court has also to keep in view the difficulties and problems that are likely to be created in the matter of administration in that particular office or organisation before allowing a prayer for temporary injunction.

This is the main question before this court in this Rule. Other questions that incidentally arise are whether this court can interfere with the order of Election Tribunal in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction and whether it is proper for this court to interfere with the discretionary order of the Election Tribunal. An Election Tribunal constituted under the provisions of the Local Government Ordinance, 1976 being not a civil court cannot grant temporary injunction under Order XXXIX, rule I CPC. The Election Tribunal not being a civil Court had no power to grant temporary injunction under Order XXXIX, rule 1 for similar reasons as given under the decision case of Shamsul Hoque Sikdar. Subsequently in the case of Abdul Gafur vs Election Tribunal and Munsif Second Court, Feni a Division Bench of this Court constituted of Ruhul Islam CJ (as he then was) and MH Rahman J, decided that an Election Tribunal acting as such was not competent to issue temporary injunction under Order XXXIX, rule l, CPC as the Election Tribunal was not a civil Court.
