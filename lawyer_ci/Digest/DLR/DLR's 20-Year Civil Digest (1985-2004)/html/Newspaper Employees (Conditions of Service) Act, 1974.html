OurConstitution is not at pari materia with the Indian Constitution on this point.The decisions of the Indian jurisdiction on public interest litigation arehardly apt in our situation. The petitioner is not acting pro bono publico butin the interest of its members. The real question in this case is whether thepetitioner has the right to move the writ petition in a representativecapacity. The High Court Division has rightly relied upon the case of 29 DLR188 where the question has been answered in the negative. The petitioner mayrepresent the employers in the Wage Board but its locus standi to act on behalfof its members in an application under Article 102 of the Constitution is justnot there. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><b><i><span style='Cambria","serif";'>BangladeshSangbadpatra Parishad (BSP) vs Bangladesh 43 DLR (AD) 126. </span></i></b></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><span style='Cambria","serif";'> </span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><b><span style='line-height:115%;Cambria","serif";'>Sections 9, 10(3) &amp; 11–</span></b></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>"Personaggri­eved"– Question of locus standi to file writ petition–WhetherBangladesh Sangbadpatra Parishad, a registered association of owners of thenewspapers and newspaper organisations in Bangladesh, is competent to challengethe validity of the constitution of Wage Board and its authority of fixingminimum wages for newspaper employees. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>Held–In thefacts and circumstances of the case, the petitioner Bangladesh SangbadpatraParishad is not a "person aggrieved" to question the award of WageBoard or the connected law, as it has nothing to lose or win by the impugnedaward.
