Democraticinstitutions as provided in the Constitution spell out no narrowing of choiceof representatives either by direct or by secret ballot. The provisions of theConstitution left it to be decided on the basis of political expediency andnecessity at a given time. Voting by secret ballot or by open ballot or by adivision are all accepted modes of voting and different ways of choosingrepresentations are not foreign to our Constitu­tion. Only because an electionis ordered to be held by open vote, it would not be an illegal election. Theright to choose according to one's own conscience would be existing in both theprocedures, open vote or secret vote. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><b><i><span style='Cambria","serif";'>Abdus SamadAzad vs Bangladesh 44 DLR 354. </span></i></b></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><span style='Cambria","serif";'> </span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><b><span style='line-height:115%;Cambria","serif";'>Sections 4 &amp; 10—</span></b></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>Freedom ofconscience while voting as a member of the Parliament—Freedom of conscienceguaranteed under the Constitution would relate to private liberty to choosebetween two alternatives as directed by the elector's sense of moral values, inthose areas of life where the result of one's effort affects none else but onlythe individual.
