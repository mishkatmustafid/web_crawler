GeneralClauses Act (X of 1897) has been made applicable to the Martial Law Orders byreason of para 19(9) of the 4th Schedule to the Constitution enacted by theConstitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1986—Under the proclamation of Withdrawalof Martial Law, MLO No. 9 was repealed but the remedy of review provided underMLO 9 survived. •It· is obvious that unless some provision was made fordisposal of cases awaiting review the effect to the Proclamation could not befully given. In order to harmonise the effect of repeal of the MLO with theoperation of the Proclamation of Withdrawal of Martial Law, in thecircumstances as in the present case, provision has been rightly made in para 5of the Proclamation enabling the President to make an order where necessary. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><b><i><span style='Cambria","serif";'>PrincipalSecretary vs Mahtabuddin Ahmed 42 DLR (AD)214. </span></i></b></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><span style='Cambria","serif";'> </span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><b><span style='line-height:115%;Cambria","serif";'>Article 5—</span></b></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>Order ofretirement—Application for review—In view of the decision in 42 DLR (AD) 214the respondents are to communicate the result of the review application of thepetitioner.
