The petitioners are not accused of any offence and, as such, protection under Article 35(4) is not available to them. <em>Abu Siddique vs Ministry of Defence 54 DLR (AD) 154.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3—</strong>The officers of the Anti-Corruption Bureau in connection with investigation of a complaint to ascertain the truth thereof are authorised to issue notice under section 160 CrPC. <em>Abu Siddique and anr vs Ministry of Defence 54 DLR (AD) 154.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3—</strong>When the investigation is held by any officer of the Bureau of Anti-Corruption, the provisions of section 5A of Act II of 1947 shall not be applicable but provisions of section 3 of the Anti-Corruption Act, 1957 shall apply. <em>Nazrul Islam vs State 51 DLR 368.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3—</strong>The authority of the Anti-Corruption Officer requiring the petitioners to attend and give statements before him in the interest of an inquiry under the provisions of section 94 of the Code cannot be questioned. <em>Abdul Hafiz vs Director General, Bureau of Anti-Corruption, Government of Bangladesh 51 DLR 72.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3—</strong>Sanction to prosecute—The sanctioning authority is under a legal duty to act without bias and to apply its mind to the materials placed before it. A valid sanction is a pre-condition for launching a prosecution under section 6 of the Anti-Corruption Act, 1957 (repealed by the ACC Act, 2004). <em>Tofail Ahmed vs State 63 DLR 363.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(2)—</strong>The provision of section 5A of the Act II of 1947 and section 3(2) of the Anti- Corruption Act, 1957 when read with paragraph 59 of the Anti-Corruption Manual, it is seen that investigation of offences enumerated in Act II of 1947 and in the schedule of the Anti-Corruption Act, 1957 by an Assistant Inspector of the Bureau of Anti-Corruption is neither irregular nor illegal.<em> Bangladesh vs Md Amjad Ali Mridha 56 DLR (AD) 119.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 4—</strong>The contention that the provisions of this section are applicable only against public servants is not acceptable in law. <em>Tarique Rahman vs Director General, Bureau of Anti- Corruption 52 DLR 518.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 4 &amp; 5—</strong>Any private person whether he has any connection with a public servant or not can also be tried and punished under the Act of 1957. <em>Abdul Kabir vs State 50 DLR 306.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 4 &amp; 9</strong>—Satisfaction under section 4 of the Act is the satisfaction of the Government alone as the satisfaction aspect of the section is retained by the Government and it can not be delegated as it is incapable of delegation. <em>Begum Tahmina vs Bangladesh 52 DLR 503.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 4(1)—</strong>There is no fundamental right to privacy or secrecy in respect of property and wealth of a person and therefore calling upon the petitioners to submit statement of their properties does not violate any fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution. <em>Tarique Rahman vs Director General, Bureau of Anti-Corruption 52 DLR 518.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 4(1)—</strong>There is no scope for violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioner as guaranteed by Article 35(4) of the Constitution inasmuch as the issuance of the notice under section 4(1) of the Act will be presumed to be the fact collection process only. <em>Begum Tahmina vs Government of Bangladesh 52 DLR 503.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 4(1)—</strong>It does not reflect from the evidence that before issuance of notice any preliminary inquiry was done by the Government or any direction was given to the bureau of Anti- Corruption to issue notice on being satisfied that the appellant had properties disproportionate to his income. So the notice served under section 4(1) of the Act is lacking in jurisdiction. <em>Saidur Rahman vs State 54 DLR 489.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 4(1)—</strong>ln view of the provision of law prescribing the punishment for failing to submit the statement and in view of the fact that the accused-petitioner failed to furnish such statement in spite of being called upon he cannot be absolved of the consequence that resulted in his conviction after due trial. <em>Habibur Rahinan vs State 58 DLR (AD) 12.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 4(1) &amp; 9—</strong>Even in exercise of power under section 9 of the Anti-Corruption Act the initial satisfaction of the Government as provided in section 4(1) of the Act cannot be delegated and the initial satisfaction, before proceeding against the appellant, must be of the Government<em>. Saidur Rahman vs State 54 DLR 489.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 4(2) &amp; 5(1)—</strong>Provision of the Act can be resorted to enquire into or for investigation of pecuniary resources or property of any person whether he is a public servant or any other else or words ‘an ordinary citizen’.<br/> <br/>Expressions “certain persons” “any person” and “whoever” that. have been used in different of the Act apparently show that same are unspecified and general in nature as well as in character or in other words the said expressions are in no way referable to any specified class or persons, like public servant, as has been contended by the petitioner in support of his prayer for discharging him from the proceeding. <em>AKM Muhituddin vs State 51 DLR 274.</em></div></div></div>

See 62 DLR (AD) 290. <em>Barrister Nazmul Huda vs State 63 DLR 252.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(2)—</strong>ACC did never wanted to know it by affording the petitioner an opportunity of being heard or by calling for a written statement from him, which it had power to under Rule 8 and 11 of the ACC Rules, 2007 Such discretion is neither unfettered, nor it has been vested in the ACC to arm it with redundant power or to exercise its discretion with caprice, but be guided by the provisions of section 3(2) of the Act. <em>Obaidul Kader vs State 63 DLR 425.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(2)—</strong>The ACC should not abstain from exercising its discretionary power arbitrarily or without recording any reason for such abstention, so that it can be judged if the ACC had acted in compliance with provisions of section 3(2) of the Act. <em>Obaidul Kader (Md) vs State 63 DLR 425.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(2)—</strong>The word ‘স্বাধীন’ or independent cannot be read in isolation of the, expression “ও নিরপেক্ষ” i.e. “and neutral”, inasmuch as the word ‘স্বাধীন’ has been used in the company of the expression “ও নিরপেক্ষ” with intent to denote that the ACC should be an independent and neutral body in exercising its powers and discretion under the Act. <em>Obaidul Kader (Md) vs State 63 DLR 425.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 5 and 8—</strong>Section 5 of the Ain, 2004 “Commission” means all the three members of the Commission. The provision as laid down in section 18 has clearly empowered member of the Commission to perform the duty of the Commission. Admittedly one of the members of the Commission has been empowered to accord sanction on behalf of the Commission. <em>Habibur Rahman Molla vs State 61 DLR 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 9—</strong>Act of 2009 though not included in the schedule to the ACC Act, 2004, yet Section 9 of the Ain of 2009 provides that the offences committed under the said Ain shall be deemed to be scheduled offences under the ACC Act, 2004. <em>Tarique Rahman vs Governrnent of Bangladesh 63 DLR (AD) 18.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 17—</strong>Section 17 of the ACC Act, 2004 the ACC shall enquire into and conduct investigation of offences mentioned in the schedule and file cases on the basis of inquiry or investigation and conduct prosecution of the case before the Court of Special Judge. <em>Tarique Rahman vs Government of Bangladesh 63 DLR (AD) 18.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 18 &amp; 26—</strong>Section 26 envisages that before issuance of the notice, the Commissioner(s) must be satisfied about the allegation. It is their satisfaction and of nobody elses. But by sub-section (2) of section 18, the Commissioners can only ratify the ‘satisfaction’ of the Secretary which is certainly not stipulated in section 26. <em>Anti-Corruption Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir 62 DLR (AD) 290.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 18(2)—</strong>lf any person acts beyond his authority, to the prejudice of any person, such acts cannot be ratified of validated by post facto legislation and, as such, his action remains void. <em>Iqbal Hasan Mahrnood @ Iqbal Hasan Mahmood Tuku vs State 63 DLR 660.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 26—</strong>Satisfaction—Satisfaction must be of the Commission itself constituted of no other person than its Commissioners. The relevant order to submit assets may be issued by any of its authorised officials but the decision to issue such an order must be recorded by the Commissioner(s). <em>Anti-Corruption Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir 62 DLR (AD) 290.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 26—</strong>If any person acts beyond his authority, to the prejudice of any person, such acts cannot be ratified or validated by post facto legislation, his action remains void. <em>Anti-Corruption Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir 62 DLR (AD) 290.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 26—</strong>Notice—A notice must allow a reasonable time to check-up the details of the assets of a person, if necessary, on examination of his records and after consultation with his lawyers and other concerned persons. Section 26 certainly does not envisage a notice upon a person who is in detention and he is not expected to give any details of his assets within the time specified. The person concerned must be afforded a fair and reasonable opportunity to respond to the notice, otherwise, it is no notice in the eye of law. A notice issued under section 26 of the Act to a detenu, away from his hearth and home, cannot be said to be a fair and bonafide exercise of power. <em>Anti-Corruption Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir 62 DLR (AD) 290.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 26 &amp; 27—</strong>Whether the appellant has disproportionate wealth, he has concealed his known source of income, there is mis-joinder of charges and the trial of the appellant on facts allegedly committed prior to the promulgation of Durnity Daman Commission Ain, 2004 constitute offence under the Durnity Daman Commission Ain are disputed facts can only be decided on evidence at the trial. <em>Habibur Rahman Mollah vs State 62 DLR (AD) 233.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 26 &amp; 27—</strong>Since the prosecution is almost over and the appellant put his defence by cross-examining the witnesses, in view of the consistent views of the superior courts of this sub-continent that the High Court Division which exercising its power under section 561A of the Code should not usurp the jurisdiction trial Court. <em>Habibur Rahman Mollah vs State 62 DLR (AD) 233.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 26(1)—</strong>A well-established legal principle is that a person upon whom power is delegated cannot delegate the same to another person. In the instant case the legal provision in Rule 17(1) is such that the Commission itself could delegate the power to issue a notice for submission of wealth statement to anyone of its officers not below the rank of Deputy Director(DD). <em>Akbar Khan vs Anti-Corruption Commision 62 DLR 20.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 26(1)—</strong>In any event, the Commission may itself issue the notice or delegate the authority to issue the notice or may empower any of its Commissioners to delegate the authority to issue the notice. The memo dated 9-11-2009 issued by the Director (Additional charge), ACC Divisional Office, Chittagong specifically directed the DD to issue the notice under his (the DD’s) signature and to serve the same. This chain of delegation is not contemplated by the law. A Director of the Divisional Office does not have the power of delegation. <em>Akbar Khan vs Anti- Corruption Corn-mission 62 DLR 20.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 26(1)—</strong>The strict interpretation of the law, is that the power to delegate lies with the ACC or any Commissioner empowered by the ACC. There is nothing to prevent the ACC even now to authorise the DD of the Anti-Corruption Commission, Integrated District Office (সমন্বিত জেলা কার্যালয়) Rangamati to issue the notice upon the petitioner. The Commission may directly authorise any DD of the Commission. Equally, the ACC could empower any of its Commissioners and that Commissioner so empowered could delegate his authority upon anyone not below the rank of DD of Anti-Corruption Commission to issue the notice and there is no legal bar to do so even now by issuing a fresh authority in accordance with law. The delegatee, namely the DD, if so authorised by the proper authority, may issue a fresh notice. But from the facts and circumstances of the instant case, we do not find any authority given to the Director of the Divisional Office, Chittagong to delegate his authority to the DD to issue the impugned notice. It is a highly technical legal defect which can be cured. <em>Akbar Khan vs Anti-Corruption Commission 62 DLR 20.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 26(2)—</strong>No legal impediment for the Commission to issue fresh notice under section 26 of the Act, if so advised, but not in those cases where the accused has already been acquitted on merit of the case as is in this case. <em>Anti-Corruption Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir 62 DLR (AD) 290.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 26(2)—</strong>The matter is at the very initial stage and no proceedings are yet drawn up against the petitioner. It may be legitimately argued that the petitioner did not suffer any prejudice since the notice was issued by a DD who under the law has the rank and status to be authorised to issue the notice. The point raised by the petitioner is highly technical and should not be allowed to obstruct the course of justice. <em>Akbar Khan vs Anti-Corruption Commission 62 DLR 20.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 27—</strong>Section 109 of the Penal Code is included in paragraph ‘Gha’ of the schedule to the ACC Act, 2004 for abetment to any offence under the schedule is committed by any sort of involvement or complicity. Such offence could never be intended or could be a substantive offence. The High Court Division held that no such offence of abetment could be conceived of in respect of an offence under section 26(2) or 27(1) of the ACC Act, 2004. Accordingly, lodging of FIR, taking cognizance, initiation of criminal proceedings against the writ-petitioners are unwarranted, unauthorized and without jurisdiction. <em>Anti-Corruption Commission vs Shamima Begum 62 DLR (AD) 277.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 27—</strong>In the absence of any statement of assets; there was no scope to submit any explanation for acquisition of assets there was no scope for him to submit any explanation for acquisition of the assets. No citizen could be arraigned for such a severe offence in the absence of service of any notice or order for explaining the source of income. Offence of abetment under section 109 equally could not be conceived of with regard to such an offence. <em>Anti-Corruption Commission vs Nargis Begum 62 DLR (AD) 279.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 27(1)—</strong>Bail in a pending appeal— The matter of granting bail by the High Court Division, during the period of emergency, in a pending appeal filed by the convict who has been convicted and sentenced under the provision of Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 in case of short sentence not exceeding 3 years, when the appeal could not be disposed of within 90 working days for no fault of the appellant and/or in the case of serious illness endangering life to be certified by duly constituted Medical Board, may consider the matter of granting bail in an appropriate case in an appeal. <em>Government of Bangladesh vs Sabera Aman 62 DLR (AD) 246.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 27(2)-</strong>It transpires from the FIR and charge-sheet that there is independent allegation against the accused-petitioner Mrs. Rowshena Jahan that she was owning and possessing some properties which are alleged to be disproportionate to her known source of income. It is necessary to spell out as to how she acquired those properties. Therefore, the accused- petitioner is liable to rebut presumption in the Court during the trial as contemplated under section 27(2) of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004. <em>Rowshena Jahan vs State 63 DLR 90.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 27(2)-</strong>Schedule of offences under section 17(a) of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 shows that an offence of abetment under section 109 of the Penal Code can lawfully be applied in respect of schedule offences under the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 in appropriate cases. <em>Rowshena Jahan vs State 63 DLR 90.</em><br/><strong>Section 28(2)—</strong>Respondent Nos. 5 and 6 committed the offence under section 409 of the Penal Code in their personal capacity and not in their official capacity as a police officer and, as such, the sanction in the present case was not at all necessary under section 6(5) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act. <em>Salauddin Ahmed vs Princpal Secretary, Office of the Hon’ble Prime Minister 57 DLR 730.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong>There is no scope to challenge the efficacy of the sanction which has been accorded in Form No. 3 under rule 15(7) of the ACC Rules, 2007 prescribed by the legislature. The recital of the sanction order clearly shows that sanctioning authority was satisfied, on scrutinizing the record, produced in respect of the allegation brought against the accused-petitioner accord sanction for prosecution. <em>Habibur Rahman Molla vs State 61 DLR 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong>The sanction in question has not been accorded as per prescribed Form-3, mandatorily required by rule 15(7), and that apparently the same has been given mechanically Hence the questioned sanction is not a sanction in the eye of law. <em>Bayazid vs State 61 DLR 772.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong>No sanction is required to file a complaint (অভিযোগ) and the unamended as well the amended section 32 requires only one sanction from the Commission. <em>Anti-Corruption Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir 62 DLR (AD) 290.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong>Sanction from the Commission will be required when the charge-sheet is filed under sub section (2) and on receipt of the charge-sheet along with a copy of the letter of sanction the Court takes cognizance of the offence for trial, either under the original section 32 or the amended section 32. As a matter of fact, only one sanction will be required under section 32, unamended or amended. <em>Anti-Corruption Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir 62 DLR (AD) 290.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong>After completion of the investigation, the Investigating Officer, under subsection (2) of section 32, on obtaining the sanction from the Commission, would submit the police report before the Court along with a copy of the letter of sanction. The Court, under sub-section (1), would take cognizance, only when there is such sanction from the Commission. Both the sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) of the section 32 envisages only one sanction, not two. Subsection (1) does not spell out or even envisage filing of any fresh sanction when the sanction to prosecute has already been filed along with the charge-sheet of the Investigating Officer, It only envisages that without such sanction from the Commission (কমিশনের অনুমোদন ব্যতিরেকে) as spelt out in sub-section (2), no Court shall take cognizance of the offence (কোন আদালত এই আইনের অধীন কোন অপরাধ বিচারার্থ আমলে গ্রহন করিবে না) under sub-section (1) of section 32. <em>Anti-Corruption Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir 62 DLR (AD) 290.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong>Since the decision of apex Court clearly spelt out the provision of section 32 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act in this context holding no sanction is required before filing a case under the Act and also on the point that a case cannot be quashed unless cognizance has been taken by the Court having jurisdiction we are of the view that both the points apply adversely in the instant writ petitions. <em>Azam-e-Sadat vs Bangladesh 62 DLR 455.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong>Confusion arises with the use of the words-“মামলা দায়েরের ক্ষেত্রে” as used in the provision. Obviously it does not mean lodgment of first information report. Subsequent expression in the next line has made it clear that such sanction is only necessary at the time of filing case to the Court and not to the police station. The words “মামলা দায়েরের ক্ষেত্রে” does not mean initiation of a criminal case by lodging first information report which is an absurd proposition. <em>Habibur Rahman Mondal vs State 63 DLR 23.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong>Sanction given before submission of charge-sheet which is absolutely a mechanical sanction and contrary to law, and, as such, the very initiation of the proceeding itself is barred by law. <em>Sheikh Hasina vs State 63 DLR 40.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong>In the four corners of this case there is not an iota of allegation that the petitioner received any gratification from anybody in connection with the awarding of the work to the concerned company or there is no ingredients of Section 5(1) of the aforesaid act being punishable under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. The concerned Officer of the Anti-Corruption Commission most hurriedly and at the behest of the then Government lodged this FIR without any sanction from the Anti- Corruption Commission violating the mandatory provisions of Section 32 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004. <em>Sheikh Hasina vs State 63 DLR 162.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong>A malice has worked behind the screen and the Anti-Corruption Commission as well as the learned Special Judge acted mechanically for jeoparding the political and personal carrier of the petitioner by connecting her in this case and the proceeding of the case having been initiated in such a manner which cannot be accepted as bonafide and valid proceeding. Since the fact as well as the law cut whole root of the case, the proceeding should be quashed at least in respect of the petitioner. <em>Sheikh Hasina vs State 63 DLR 162.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong>A valid sanction being a condition precedent to a valid prosecution, The impugned proceeding has been launched without a valid sanction and the same, based on such a sanction amounts to an abuse of the process of the Court. <em>Obaidul Kader (Md) vs State 63 DLR 425.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32(1)(2)—</strong>No sanction is required for lodging any FiR in contemplation with section 32(l)(2) of the Anti-Corruption Act 2004 unamended or amended. This view reached in its finality in a very recent decision of the Appellate Division in the case of Anti-Corruption Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir reported in 62 DLR (AD) 290. <em>Azam-e-Sadat vs Bangladesh 62 DLR 455.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32(1)(2)—</strong>The requirement of subsection (1) of section 32 was complied with when the charge-sheet was filed along with a copy of the sanction from the Commission.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="entry-content"><p><b>Citation:</b>  62 DLR 33, 62 DLR (AD) 290, 63 DLR 368, 62 DLR 20, 63 DLR 162, 63 DLR 368, 63 DLR 425,  61 DLR 772, 61 DLR 1,  63 DLR 294.</p><p><b>Subject:</b>  Anti-Corruption Commission </p><p><b>Delivery Date:</b>  1970-01-01</p><!DOCTYPE html><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Anti-Corruption Commission Rules, 2007</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>Rule 2—</strong>Inquiry and Investigation— ‘Inquiry’ and investigation’ are not one and the same. They are distinct terms. They are distinguishable from each other. Investigation (তদন্ত) of can only be commenced and carried out conclusion of inquiry (অনুসন্ধান) and lodgment of an FIR against a person. <em>Tofail Ahmed vs Chairman, Anti-Corruption Commission 62 DLR 33.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Rules 3 &amp; 4—</strong>Words ‘মামলা দায়ের’ means institution of a case by submission of a charge-sheet by an officer of the Commission, before the concerned Court and certainly not an first information report as envisaged under section 154 the Code of Criminal Procedure or a complaint (অভিযোগ) as envisaged under Rule 3 and 4 of the Rules.<br/>The irresistible conclusion is that no sanction will be required to file a complaint (অভিযোগ) either with the Commission or with the police. But sanction from the Commission shall be required both under the unamended and the amended 32, before institution of a case “মামলা দায়েরের ক্ষেত্রে” in the concerned Court. <em>Anti-Corruption Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir</em> <em>62 DLR (AD) 290.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Rule 3 &amp; 4—</strong>An officer of the Commission lodged a first information report on 6-3-2007 with the Tejgaon Police Station and a case started. This is not envisaged under rules 3and 4 of the Rules. Those Rules provide only for filing of the complaint involving the offences mentioned in the schedule to the Act. However, those provisions are merely directory and deviation from provisions in lodging an first information report instead of a complaint, would not vitiate the proceedings. <em>Anti-Corruption vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir 62 DLR (AD) 290.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Rules 3 &amp; 4—</strong>Commissioners resigned from the Commission on 7-2-2007 and it was reconstituted on 24-2-2007, as such, although the Commission existed as an Institution on 18-2-2007, when the notice was issued, but there was no Commission within the meaning of section 3 read with section 5 of the Act on that date. <em>Anti-Corruption Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir 62 DLR (AD) 290.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Rules 4 and 16—</strong>Rule 16 of the Anti- Corruption Commission Rules, 2007 is applicable only in the case of any officer of the Anti-Corruption Commissioner, who lay the trap and conduct the trap operation only. This provision of law being a special law like Anti-Corruption Commission Rule, 2007 or Section 20 or 17 of the Anti- Corruption Commission Act, 2004 did not oust the jurisdiction of other law enforcing agencies. Occurrence took place on 23-1-2011 and FIR was lodged on 24-1-2011 and on the same day it was transmitted to the Anti-Corruption Commission for investigation following the procedure of Rule 4 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Rule, 2007. <em>SM Sabbir Hasan vs State 63 DLR 368.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Rules 7(1)(2) &amp; 17(1)—</strong>A well-established legal principle is that a person upon whom power is delegated cannot delegate the same to another person. In the instant case the legal provision in Rule 17(1) is such that the Commission itself could delegate the power to issue a notice for submission of wealth statement to anyone of its officers not below the rank of Deputy Director (DD). <em>Akbar Khan vs ACC 62 DLR 20.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Rules 8 and 15—</strong>ACC did never wanted to know it by affording the petitioner an opportunity of being heard or by calling for a written statement from him, which it had power to under Rule 8 and II of the ACC Rules, 2007. Such discretion is neither unfettered, nor it has been vested in the ACC to arm it with redundant power or to exercise its discretion with caprice, but be guided by the provisions of section 3(2) of the Act. <em>Obaidul Kader (Md) vs State 63 DLR 425.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Rule 10—</strong>In respect of submission of charge-sheet and its requirement for sanction the learned Counsel submits that sub-rule (1) of Rule 15 to 18 of the Anti-Corruption rules speaks about the sanction and filing of the case and charge- sheet thereto. The sanction as given by one of the Commissioner of the Commission to submit charge-sheet purported to have been signed by one of the Commissioner of the Commission is not at all valid sanction, as he did not apply his mind to the requirement of the law and the materials available on record. Even, he did not go through the 161 and 164 statements of the witnesses at all. Having been done so he ought to have refused to accord sanction. In short, it may be called that the alleged sanction is a mechanical sanction and it did not fulfill the requirement of the law rather it is contrary to decisions of the Apex Courts and, as such, taking of cognizance on such charge-sheet is illegal, malafide which amounts to a malice in law. <em>Sheikh Hasina vs State 63 DLR 162.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Rule 10—</strong>The Court below has seen the CD and became sure about the transaction. The matter is still under investigation and if the mighty accused is granted bail the investigation of the case will be hampered as he holds very powerful position in the Anti-Corruption Commission. <em>SM Sabbir Hasan vs State 63 DLR 368.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Rule 11—</strong>The act of the Commission in according the sanction, without affording the accused any hearing under Rule 11 of the ACC Rules, 2007, amounts to colorable exercise of power by the ACC and its failure to remain স্বাধীন ও নিরপেক্ষ which is the touch stone to judge the validity of its acts and deeds. <em>Obaidul Kader vs State 63 DLR 425.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Rule 15—</strong>A valid sanction being a condition precedent to a valid prosecution, The impugned proceeding has been launched without a valid sanction and the same, based on such a sanction amounts to an abuse of the process of the Court. <em>Obaidul Kader vs State 63 DLR 425.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Rules 15 &amp; 16—</strong>The sanction in question has not been accorded as per prescribed Form-3, mandatorily required by rule 15(7), and that apparently the same has been given mechanically. Hence the questioned sanction is not a sanction in the eye of law. <em>Bayazid vs State 61 DLR 772.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Rule 15(7)—</strong>Form 3—”Form 3” is the part of the statute and accordingly when a specified Form has been prescribed in the statute for particular purpose the sanctioning authority has no scope to assign any reason of its satisfaction beyond the said format given in the form. <em>Habibur Rahman Molla vs State 61 DLR 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Rule 15(7)—</strong>Form 3—There is no scope to challenge the efficacy of the sanction which has been accorded in Form No. 3 under rule 15(7) of the ACC Rules, 2007 prescribed by the legislature. The recital of the sanction order clearly shows that sanctioning authority was satisfied, on scrutinizing the record, produced in respect of the allegation brought against the accused-petitioner to accord sanction for prosecution. <em>Habibur Rahman Molla vs State 61 DLR 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Rule 16(2)—</strong>Neither the seizure list witness PWs 4 and 5 nor the PWs 9, 10 and 11 who<br/>accompanied with PW 1 did support the prosecution case in respect of recovery of marks notes from the possession of the appellants. Rather the defence case was that due to fail in the Dispute Case No. 129 of 2003 on 2-7-2003 out of the grudge PW 8 Abul Kalam Azad who proved himself as a ‘Mamlabaz’ subsequently created a false case against the accused-appellants with the help of PW 1 who without taking any effective permission as per Rule 16(2) of the Anti-Corruption Commission Rule brought the case is more probable. <em>Jahangir Alam vs State 63 DLR 294.</em><br/> </div></div></div>

Kiriz no doubt has not been mentioned in the short list of ”arms” but that does not exclude it from the category of arms. <em>Ershad Ali vs State 52 DLR 544.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 4—</strong>One of the weapons recovered from the possession of the accused appears to be a dagger used as weapon of offence or defence. A dagger cannot be said to be used as household instrument. <em>Rezaul Karim Razu vs State 57 DLR 104.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 4—</strong>To bring under the definition of “dagger” an article must be a “stabbing weapon” with pointed and edged blade and it must also be a “deadly weapon”. The prosecution, appears to have failed to prove that “Disco razor” or “Spring Knife” are “arms” within the definition of the Arms Act even if they are taken to be “daggers’. <em>Saiful Islam Milon vs State 50 DLR 529.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 4, 13, &amp; 19(e)—</strong>No licence is required to keep a dagger and consequently a person cannot be convicted if he is found in possession of a dagger. <em>Mozammel Hossain vs State 49 DLR 614.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 14, 15 and 18—</strong>A person being possessed of any firearms under licence granted by the authority cannot be said to be an illegal possessor of arms—An offence under the Arms Act for such possession would not be deemed committed unless licence is validly cancelled following the provision of law—Unless he is asked to deposit and surrender the arms within certain time and he fails to deposit the arms within the time. <em>Altaf Hossain Golondas vs Bangladesh 57 DLR 323.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 16 &amp; 18—</strong>Appellant was neither given any notice of enquiry nor was he given any hearing before cancellation of arms—Enquiry undertaken on a sprawling private complaint made by the local upazila Chairman—No emergency or any other compelling situation preventing giving of notice of enquiry to the appellant—Nothing on record to show that any specific case was started against the appellant involving alleged misuse of revolver— Inquisitorial nature of enquiry aggravating the degree of unfairness—Principles of natural justice to be observed in proceedings affecting “the person or property or other right of parties concerned”—Court adds a rider to the observance of the principle of natural justice that so far as exercise of power under section 18 of the Arms is concerned, the absence of a prior notice or hearing may not always invalidate the order passed thereunder if the security of the public peace is involved. <em>Sk Ali Ahmed vs Secretary, Home Affairs 40 DLR (AD)170.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 16(1) and 19(1)—</strong>The Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Shariatpur had no jurisdiction whatsoever to cancel the licences of the guns in question under section 18(a) of the Arms Act or under any provision of the Arms of 1924. As the licences of the guns in question were not cancelled by any legally competent authority such as the District Magistrate or by any authorised officer to whom he is subordinate as required under the provisions of Arms Act or the Arms Rules, cancellation thereof by the SDO is illegal. Conviction under section 16(1) and 19(1) of the Arms Act read with section 26 of the Special Powers Act is not sustainabIe in law. <em>Anawar Hossain vs State 40 DLR 251.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 18—</strong>Cancellation and suspension of licence for arms—The necessity of recording reasons by the appropriate authority in writing for the cancellation of the licence to be emphasised as a general rule—If the appropriate authority chooses to make its order a speaking one and merely relies on the materials on record, its order stands a greater risk of being struck down. <em>Sk Ali Ahmed vs Secretary, Home Affairs 40 DLR (AD) 170.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 18-</strong> Orders passed by the District Magistrate cancelling licences of guns of the petitioners without giving them any notice and opportunity of being heard and giving no reason for cancellation are illegal, being violative of the principle of natural justice. <em>Rezaul Karim vs Ministry of Home Affairs 44 DLR 110.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 18—</strong>The petitioner has acquired a legal right of being heard before any action is taken in respect of licence which were duly granted to him. But in the instant case it is clear and obvious that the licences were cancelled in flagrant violation of the provision of section 18 of the Arms Act as well as the principle of natural justice. <em>Riazuddin vs Government of Bangladesh 52 DLR 361.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 18 &amp; 26—</strong>The respondents having not filed any affidavit-in-opposition disclosing materials justifying retention of the petitioner’s gun and licences in their possession, the impugned order is liable to be declared as having been issued without lawful authority and of no legal effect. <em>Major (Retd) M Asaduzzaman vs District Magistrate, Jessore 51 DLR 471.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19(a) &amp; (f)—</strong>Mere knowledge of the accused that the arms or ammunition was lying at the spot pointed out by him, in the absence of any evidence or circumstance to show that he had exclusive possession over the spot or that none else had access to it, cannot make him liable for conviction. When the first information report named and seizure list witnesses, who are the owners of shops and businesses concerns adjacent to the place of the occurrence. do not support the prosecution story of recovery of arms or ammunition from the possession of the accused, it is unsafe to base conviction on the evidence of police personnels interested in the prosecution case. <em>Iftekhar Hasan Choudhury vs State 47 DLR 451.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19(a) &amp; (f)—</strong>The arms in question have not, been recovered from possession of the appellants and admittedly, they were not present at the place of occurrence—The arms and ammunition were recovered from the possession of the arrested accused persons and they disclosed the names of their other companions who are the appellants—The appellants cannot be held to be in possession of any arms. <em>Pannu Mollah &amp; anr vs State 56 DLR (AD) 142.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19(a) &amp; 19(f)—</strong>There may not be separate arms and ammunition in the possession of the two accused petitioners but when all of them were jointly together and the police party was receiving revolver shots and cocktails it cannot be said that the revolver and the cartridges recovered from Mokim Gazi were only in his exclusive possession. The law will ascribe joint possession in such circumstances. <em>Lutfar Rahman vs State 51 DLR (AD) 120.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 19(a) &amp; 19(f)—</strong>Having regard to the submissions made by the learned Advocate as well as the manner of arrest of the convict- petitioner after chasing them following the encounter in the face of firing by the convicts towards the police force and the recovery of the arms and ammunitions from their possession, we are of the view that discrepancies pointed out by the learned Advocate cannot disprove charges levelled against the convict-petitioner. The convict-petitioner and others were caught red handed. The High Court Division considered the materials and evidence on record and on detailed discussion has correctly arrived at its decision dismissing the appeal. <em>Jahedul Islam vs State 62 DLR (AD) 270.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19(a) &amp; (f)—</strong>The Tribunal under the Jana Nirapatta (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain has no jurisdiction to deal with the cases under section 19(a) and (f) of the Arms Act, which falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Special Powers Act and since the charges have been framed by this Tribunal also against offences which falls under the Arms Act, the trial as proceeding is illegal. <em>Ahmed Hossain alias Mohammad Hossain vs State 55 DLR 680.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19(f)—</strong>To constitute offences under the aforesaid sections of law possession and control must mean conscious possession and actual control with necessary mens rea.<br/>When incriminating articles involving offences under section 19(f) of the Arms Act and section 5 of the Explosive Substances Act are recovered from a place in the occupation or possession of more than one person and it is not possible to fix the liability of any particular individual, the head of the family cannot be held liable for the offences. <em>Kashem alias Md Abdul Kashem vs State 47 DLR 438.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19(f)—</strong>The ammunition in question was kept by the accused persons in the ditch which was under their exclusive control and no approach was there by any one else except that of the accuseds. In view of such facts and circumstances the impugned judgment and order of conviction is set aside. <em>Hanif Khan vs State 50 DLR 541.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19(f)—</strong>Appellants leading the police to place of occurrence and recovery of arms— Appellants cannot be held guilty of the charge of unauthorised possession of arms under section 19(f) of the Arms Act. <em>Abdul Khaleque vs State 40 DLR 493.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19(f)—</strong>Recovery of arms—culpability—mere knowledge of the accused that the arms were lying at the spot pointed out by him in the absence of evidence that he himself kept the same there or that he had exclusive possession over it, he cannot be made liable under section 19 (f). <em>Abul Hashem Master vs State 44 DLR 159.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19(f)—</strong> ”Possession’ or “Control” essential to constitute offence under section 19(f) of the Act must be conscious possession or actual control-- Possession or control of incriminating articles constitute offence. To constitute offence there must be mens rea or guilty knowledge. <em>Babul vs State 57DLR 158.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19A— </strong>The place of recovery being a public place it cannot be said that the appellant was in exclusive possession of that place. That being so appellant cannot be held liable under section 19A of the Arms Act. <em>Abul Kashem vs State 50 DLR 356.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19A—</strong>Uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice cannot be basis of conviction of an accused. <em>Kazi Ibrahim vs State 41 DLR 524.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19A—</strong>A person cannot be convicted on surmises and conjectures and from any analogical deduction. <em>Kazi Ibrahim vs State 41 DLR 524.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Secton 19A—</strong>The place of recovery being a public place it cannot be said that the appellant was in exclusive possession of that place. The appellant be held liable under section 19A of the Arms Act. <em>Abdus Sattar vs State 62 DLR 298.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19A(f)—</strong>Even if the incriminating articles were recovered from the thatched hut of the appellant such recovery ipso facto will not connect him with the offence under the Arms Act in the absence of any evidence to show that he had himself kept the same there or none else had any access to that place. <em>Nazrul Islam vs State 50 DLR515.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19A &amp; (f)—</strong> Accused cannot be convicted for constructive possession of arms and ammunition. He must have either exclusive or conscious possession or actual or effective control of the same.<br/>It the Court finds that the accused had neither exclusive nor conscious possession nor effective or actual control of any arms and ammunition the accused is not liable to be convicted. In the instant case we find that the accused had conscious possession and effective or actual control of the revolver and live bullets recovered from him. <em>Abul Bashar Shaikh vs State 51 DLR 252.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 19(A) &amp; (f)—</strong>There is no reason why the evidence of the police personnel should be discarded simply because they belonged to police force. They came before the court and testified to the occurrence. They were fully cross- examined. Their evidence is also evidence within the meaning of section 3 of the Evidence Act. <em>Asadul Hossain vs State 57 DLR 615.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 19A and (f)—</strong>When a place is not under the exclusive possession of the accused and the possibility of access of others to the place cannot be ruled out, he cannot be held guilty of offence under the Act. <em>Talebur Rahman alias Taleb vs State 49 DLR 167.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 19A and 19(f)—</strong>As it is found from the evidence on record that the place from where the arms and ammunition were recovered as per showing of the appellant was absolutely an open place accessible to others. The appellant had no exclusive possession and control of the arms and ammunition in question consciously with mens rea. His appeal is therefore allowed. <em>Anisur Rahman Gazi alias Chhotu vs State 59 DLR 488.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 19A and 19(f)—</strong>Even if independent witnesses and the seizure list witnesses do not support the prosecution case conviction can be given relying only upon the evidence of Police witness if it inspires confidence or is worthy of credit. <em>Tuta Pramanik (Md) vs State 59 DLR 492.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 19A &amp; 19(f)—</strong>Conviction can be well based on the testimony of the Police personnel if it is supported by other evidence on record or to if it inspires confidence. <em>Faruq vs State 59 DLR 104.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 19A &amp; 19(f)—</strong>Even if the seizure list witnesses do not support the prosecution case or speak for the prosecution the conviction can be given if the case is proved otherwise on the basis of evidence. <em>Faruq (Md) vs State (Criminal) 59 DLR 104.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19A &amp; 19(f)—</strong>It would be unjust and illegal to pass a conviction in a situation wherefrom the entire evidence on record shows that the place of recovery of arms and ammunition even though shown by the appellant was an open place free for everyone to enter. <em>Faruq (Md) vs State 59 DLR 104.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 19A &amp; 19(f)—</strong>There is nothing in this clause about exclusive or sole possession or exclusive or sole control. The test provided by the section is not as to whom the arms belong but whether they are in the possession or under the control of the persons charged. What is contemplated by this clause, is actual and physical possession and control and not merely a possession or control by construction of law. The word control means effective control and the word possession means exclusive possession under this clause. <em>Mohinuddin vs State 61 DLR 35.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 25—</strong>Since the arms were recovered at the instance of the accused, no search was necessary, invoking the application of the provisions provided in law for carrying out a search. No question of following the provisions of sections 103 and 165 of the Criminal Procedure Code and section 25 of the Arms Act therefore arises. <em>Kamruzzaman vs State 47 DLR 416.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 26—</strong>Only the Government is empowered to seize arms of any person and to detain the same for such time as it thinks necessary for the public safety. The District Magistrate has acted in this respect without jurisdiction and beyond his authority which cannot be sustained in law. <em>Mukbul Hossain Santu vs Bangladesh 50 DLR 591.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 25 &amp; 30—</strong>These provisions shall apply when a Magistrate passes an order for search.

Even if one were to accept for the sake of argument that offences committed were civil offences within the meaning of section 8(2) read with section 59(2) of the Army Act, there is no legal bar in trying those accused persons in the Sessions Court in compliance with the provisions of section 94 of the Army Act read with section 549 of the CrPC. There is no legal bar for trial of the appellants in the Criminal Court in the relevant case, inasmuch as, the offences committed are in the nature of murder simpliciter. <em>(Per Md Muzammel Hossain J) Major Baziul Huda vs State 62 DLR (AD) 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 8(2)—</strong>Plea of ‘mutiny’—Since the prosecution witnesses did not say anything in support of the plea of mutiny, the defence ought to have made out a case at least by way of suggestion to the witnesses that the army officers involved in the mutiny submitted their charter of demands to the authority in the armed forces and that as their demands were not redressed, they revolted. Secondly, if there was rebellion as claimed the rebellious force would have attacked their commanding officer, and if the commanding officer was involved, they would have attacked the Chief of army staff but they did not attack them, rather killed the President which proved that it was not a mutiny. <em>(Per SK Sinha J) Major Baziul Huda vs State 62 DLR (AD) 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 31—</strong>The charges against the accused were for conspiracy and for killing the President Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his family members and relations, which has got no relevance too mutiny as detailed in the aforesaid Acts or Ordinance. <em>State vs Lieutenant Colonel Syed Farook Rahman 53 DLR 287.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 31(a)(b)(c) and (d)—</strong>Clause (a) of section 31 of the Army Act relates to the substantive offence of mutiny and insubordination, while other three sub-clauses (b), (c) and (d) relate to the abetment of the offence of mutiny. In order to bring an offence of mutiny within the ambit of the Act, there must be evidence of overthrowing or resisting lawful authority of the armed forces or disobeying the authority in such circumstances as to make the disobedience subversive of discipline or to impede the performance of any duty or service in the armed forces of Bangladesh. There is nothing on record to show that the appellants and other accused have collectively in subordinated or defied or disregarded the authority in the armed forces or refused to obey authority in order to bring their act within the ambit of mutiny or abetment for mutiny. <em>(Per SK Sinha J). Major Baziul Huda vs State 62 DLR (AD) 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 94—</strong>Where a criminal Court and a Court Martial has each jurisdiction in respect of a civil offence, it shall be in the discretion of the prescribed authority to decide before which Court the proceeding shall be instituted <em>State vs Lieutenant Colonel Syed Farook Rahman 53 DLR 287.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 94/95—</strong>Concurrent Jurisdiction— Sections 94 and 95 of the Army Act provide for concurrent jurisdiction to the Court Martial and ordinary criminal Court. Section 94 envisages that in respect of a civil offence, when a Court Martial and a criminal Court have concurrent jurisdiction, the prescribed officer of the army has discretion to decide before which Court the proceeding shall be instituted and if he decides that the case shall be instituted before a Court Martial, it shall direct that the accused persons be detained in military custody. In a case under section 95 of the Army Act, when a criminal Court having jurisdiction is of the opinion that proceedings ought to be instituted before itself in respect of any civil offence, it may by written notice require the prescribed officer to produce the offender to nearest Magistrate or to postpone proceedings pending a reference to the Government. <em>(Per Md Muzammel Hossain J).

This makes the order of conviction and sentence in respect of Shiplu liable to be set aside for want of jurisdiction. <em>Shiplu vs State 49 DLR 53.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 5(3)—</strong>Since the jurisdiction over the offences contained in the special laws are not specifically excluded by inclusion in section 5(3) of the Children Act, jurisdiction over offences committed by youthful offenders will be exercised by the Juvenile Court. <em>State vs Md Roushan Mondal Hashem 59 DLR 72.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 5(3) &amp; 66(1)—</strong> When an accused claims to be below 16 years of age, a duty is cast upon the court to direct an enquiry to satisfy itself as to whether the accused is a child below 16 years of age on the day of framing charges against him. <em>Rahamatullah (Md) vs State 59 DLR 520.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 6—</strong>Once a child offender crosses the age of 16 years and then charged with an offence or tried for the same, the statutory requirement of the child being tried by a Juvenile Court comes to an end. <em>Baktiar Hossain vs State 47 DLR 542.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 6—</strong>Intention of section 6, Children Act requiring separate trial of a child is to ensure a special procedure and to secure certain legal rights for the accused child. An adult is not entitled to those rights and the adult accused in this case has not been prejudiced because of the joint trial. <em>Ismail Howlader vs State 58 DLR 335.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 6-</strong>The trial is without jurisdiction since the petitioner was a minor and the trial was held by a Special Judge and not by a juvenile Court. The petitioner has gone through the motion of a full scale trial without jurisdiction will be an if injustice if he is required again to go for a fresh trial. <em>Solaman vs State 58. DLR 429.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 6 &amp; 66-</strong>A close scrutiny of the section will show that the age referred to therein relates to the age of the accused when he is “charged with or tried” or, “and not to the age when the offence has been committed”. Once a child offender crosses the age of 16 years and then charged with an offence or tried for the same the requirement of the child being tried by a Juvenile Court comes to an end.<br/>From the records it appears that the appellant has admitted that at the time of occurrence the appellant was 15 yeas 11 months and 10 days, only 20 days less than 16 years. We have already seen that by the time the appellant was charged with the offence he had reached the age of 16 years and thereby forfeiting his right to claim a trial by a Juvenile Court. In our view the appellant’s interest has not been prejudiced by the failure of the Special Tribunal to give a finding on his age as under the circumstances it has become an unnecessary exercise on the part of the Special Tribunal. <em>Bimal Das vs State 46 DLR 460.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 6 &amp; 66(1)—</strong>When age of the accused is claimed to be below 16 years a duty is cast upon the Court to direct an enquiry to be satisfied itself as to whether the accused is a child below 16 on the day of framing charges against him. <em>Monir Hossain @ Monir Hossain vs State 53 DLR 411.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 7(2)—</strong>Juvenile Court—When the jurisdiction over a person is established then no other Court has power to try a child below the age of 16 years. The trial of the accused found below the age of 16 years at the framing of charge was without jurisdiction. <em>State vs Md Roushan Mondal @ Hashem 59 DLR 72.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 35—</strong>The Sessions Judge may also, whether the situation demands it, exercise the power of a Juvenile Court, <em>Bimal Das vs State 46 DLR 460.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 53—</strong>Children are entitled to trial before the Juvenile Courts and positive step should have been made to make their trial in accordance with law of Juvenile Court, not to be tried jointly with the adults. The respondents are directed to comply with the earlier direction and report compliance within six months from date. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust vs Bangladesh 57 DLR 11.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 66—</strong>Under this section it is for the ourt to consider whether a person charged with ai offence and brought before it for trial appears to be a child or not and then proceed accordingly. <em>Abdul Munem Chowdhury @ Momen vs State 47 DLR (AD) 96.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 66—</strong>Child accused—Since the accused Tonmoy did not appear to be a child’ within the meaning of the Children Act and no petition was filed before the trial Court to the effect that he was a ‘child’. The Court below did not deem it necessary to make any enquiry into the alleged childhood. In such view of the matter, the lower Court concluded the trial of the case treating the accused Tonmoy as an adult. No exception can be taken thereto at this stage. <em>State vs Md Faziur Rahman Tonmoy 61 DLR 169.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 66-</strong>In view of the fact that the trial Judge opined that the accused was not a minor, it cannot be said that the provisions of section 66 of the Children Act were contravened. When the accused was claiming to be a minor, the learned Judge ought to have followed the provisions of section 66 of the Children Act in order to allay any possibility that the accused was indeed a minor and to give him an opportunity to prove his entitlement under the Children Act. <em>Jaibar Ali Fakir vs State 61 DLR 208.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 66(1)—</strong>In the absence of any finding as to the age of the accused-petitioner or determination of the accused-petitioner’s age by holding an inquiry, the Special Tribunal and Sessions Judge has failed to comply with section 66(1) of the Children Act. <em>Baktiar Hossain vs State 47 DLR 542.</em><br/> </div></div></div>

Section 339C of the Code being not inconsistent with any provisions of the Act shall apply to the proceedings before Special Tribunals constituted under the Act. Section 339C is intended for expeditious trial; the special statute is intended for “more speedy trial”. If the provision for speedy trial is not applied to trial under the Act, it will bring a situation not intended by the law-makers. <em>Kamruzzaman vs State 42 DLR (AD) 219.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 1(2) &amp; 417(1)—</strong>Appeal filed under section 417(2) CrPC against the judgment and order of acquittal passed by a Special Tribunal is not maintainable—An appeal against a judgment of Special Tribunal will have to be filed under section 30—i) of the Special Powers Act—The Code of Criminal Procedure shall not affect any special forum of procedure prescribed by any law. <em>State vs Wanur Rahman 40 DLR 346.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 2—</strong>The order passed by the Sessions Judge taking cognizance in revision from naraji petition has no support of law as it is the duty of the Magistrate to take cognisance of the case and by the impugned order, the Sessions Judge usurped the jurisdiction of the Magistrate which the law does not permit him to do. <em>Abdul Aziz Master vs State 59 DLR 468.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 2—</strong>The effect of the amendment is that the accused may be released on bail by the Magistrate or by the Sessions Judge in case of failure of the Investigating Officer to complete investigation within the specified period. <em>Amalendu Majumder vs State 49 DLR 204.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 2(h) &amp; 200—</strong>The term ‘naraji’ means disapproval of the Final Report True. It may either challenge the report on certain grounds and pray for its rejection or may pray for further action by the Court and rejection of the report by reiterating the allegations made in the petition of complaint. When the naraji does not contain allegation of any offence but is more a protest petition it does not take the nature of a complaint and there is no question of examining the complainant and taking fresh cognizance of any offence.<br/>The action upon the naraji petition by the Court depends on whether the naraji petition is made before or after the order of discharge has been passed by the Magistrate. If it is filed after an order of discharge it will in all probability be treated as a complaint by the Magistrate as in almost all such cases it will contain allegation of offence and the person filing the naraji petition will be examined by the Magistrate as a complainant under section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In case of discharge by the Magistrate the only course remaining open to the complainant is by way of approaching the Sessions Judge with an application for further investigation. But if the naraji petition is filed before an order of discharge has been passed, the Magistrate can take cognizance without examining the complainant if the intention appears only to draw the attention of the Magistrate by way of protest, or the Magistrate may treat it as a complaint and examine the complainant, as he thinks fit. <em>Abu Bakar vs State 46 DLR 684.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 4(1)(q)—</strong>The meaning assigned to the word “public” strongly indicates that a particular case may also be tried in a place other than the normal place where the sitting of the Court of Sessions takes place. <em>Sayeed Farook Rahman vs Sessions Judge of the Court of Sessions, Dhaka 49 DLR (AD) 157.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 4(1) and 167—</strong>The provisions intend to prevent any possible abuse by the police officer of his power while trying to make discovery of crime by means of wrongful confinement and do not intend to protect illegal act of the police officer. <em>Saifuzzaman vs State 56 DLR 324.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 4(h)—</strong>Definition of expression “Complaint”—whether a Special Judge can be said to have taken cognizance on a complaint after it is taken cognizance of and then sent to him by the Magistrate. The expression “complaint” has been defined in section 4(h) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is defined there to mean an allegation made in writing or verbally to a Magistrate. Therefore, a complaint made orally or in writing to a Magistrate would be a complaint and when the Magistrate would be sending that complaint to the Special Judge along with the deposition of the witnesses and his comments for the deposition of the witnesses and his comments for the Special Judge to take cognizance and if that cognizance is taken again it could not be said that the Special Judge had not taken cognizance on a complaint. <em>Matiur Rahman vs State 40 DLR 385.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 4(b), 195(1)(c) &amp; 417A(2)—</strong>The word “complainant” occurring in section 417A(2) must be extended upto the “aggrieved person” otherwise legislation so far it relates to a proceeding under section 195(1) of the Code will be of no avail. The aggrieved person at whose instance complaint petition was filed by the Magistrate under section 195(l)(c) is to be considered as a “complainant” as required under section 417A(2) with the aid of definition of complaint appearing in section 4(h) though not for all other purposes. <em>Abdul Ahad vs State 58 DLR 311.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 5—</strong>The urge of the petitioners to get their matter disposed of by the High Court Division or by this Division through Islamic law has got no leg to stand in view of the aforesaid provisions. Under Article 152 of the Constitution, the word “law” means any Act, Ordinance, etc. having the force of law in Bangladesh. The urge of the petitioners for trying their cases in accordance with Islamic law is nothing but an imaginary dream. <em>Iftekhar Hasan (Md) @ Al Mamun vs State 59 DLR (AD) 36.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 5(2) and 167(5)—</strong>The powers conferred under the general provisions of the Code are subject to any special provisions enacted under the Special Powers Act. The Special Powers Act having made provisions with regard to the offence in question must be deemed to supersede the provisions of the Code. <em>Taslima Begum vs State 42 DLR 136.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 5(2) &amp; 339D—</strong>Where the charge has been framed under section 409 of the Penal Code and section 5(2) of Act II of 1947, and in the absence of any provision for revival of the case on the expiry of the period of 2 years provided in section 8(a) of the Criminal Law Amendment (Amendment) Act there was no legal authority to revive the case under the provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure. <em>Nur Israil Talukder vs State 52 DLR (A D) 51.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 6 &amp; 7—</strong>The new Act has effected a change in the procedural law but it has not affected any vested right of the accused and the prosecution, because the accused had not, in fact, any absolute and vested right of stoppage and release.<br/>In that view of the matter it cannot be said that the appellant had any vested right under the old provision of sub-section (4) of section 339C to be released on the proceeding being stopped. The effect of repeal of the old provision followed by its reenactment will be that in the pending cases the new procedural law will apply because as a general rule alterations in the form of procedure are retrospective in character unless there is some contrary provision in the enactment. In our considered opinion the provision of sub-section (4) of section 339C of the Code of Criminal Procedure as amended by Act No. XLII of 1992 will be applicable to the pending cases. <em>Abdul Wadud vs State 48 DLR (AD) 6.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 9, 17, 408 &amp; 409—</strong>Admission of appeal or revision do not fall in the category of urgent application as mentioned in sub-section (4) of section 17 of the Code. When provisions of sections 9, 17,, 408 and 409 of the Code are considered together, it is clear to me that a Sessions Judge-in-charge cannot admit an appeal. <em>Ibrahim Khalil vs State 50 DLR 192.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 9(2)—</strong>The order that was passed was absolutely without jurisdiction inasmuch as the place where it was passed was not a Court of Sessions Judge as contemplated under section 9(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. HM Ershad [former President Lieutenant General (Retd)] vs State 48 DLR 95.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 9(2)-</strong>A special order cannot be restricted to mean a particular situation according to a pre set formula. <em>Sayeed Farook Rahman vs Sessions Judge of the Court of Sessions, Dhaka 49 DLR (AD) 157.</em><br/>Section 9(2)—Section 9(2) gives the Government the power to direct at what place or places the Court of Sessions shall hold its sitting. <em>Sayeed Farook Rahman vs Sessions Judge of the Court of Sessions, Dhaka 49 DLR (AD) 157.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 9(2)—</strong>The contention that a Court of Sessions cannot have two sitting places is negatived by the very language of the section itself. <em>Sayeed Farook Rahman vs Session Judge of the Court of Sessions, Dhaka 49 DLR (AD) 157.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 9(2)-</strong>If there is a special order to try a particular case at a particular place the original place of sitting continues to remain the place of sitting of the Court of Sessions and the new place indicated in the special order is meant for trial of only that case or class of cases which the special order specifically provides. <em>Sayeed Farook Rahman vs Sessions Judge, 49 DLR (AD) 157.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 9(3), Proviso—</strong>Interpretation of statute—A proviso is subservient to the main provision—It is not an enacting clause independent of the main enactment.<br/>Our view is that a proviso cannot possibly deal with an entirely different topic or subject and it is subservient to the main provision. A proviso must be considered in relation to the principal matter to which it stands as a proviso. To treat the proviso as if it were an independent enacting clause instead of being dependent on the main enactment is to sin against the fundamental rule of construction, as observed by Moulton, LJ in RV Dibdin, (1910) (Prob Dn) 57. The same view has been expressed in Corpus Juris Sedondum Vol. 82 (pp. 887-88) <em>Nurul Huda vs Baharuddin 41 DLR 395.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 9(3), Proviso and 28—</strong>Canon of construction of provisos—Jurisdiction occurring in sub-section (3) of section 9 is limited to trial jurisdiction if read with section 28.<br/>Applying the afore-quoted well-known canon of construction of provisos, we may now say that Assistant Sessions Judges who shall be deemed to have been appointed as Additional Sessions Judges will carry their appointment for the exact purpose set out in the main sub-section, namely, to exercise jurisdiction in one or more such Courts”, that is, in the Courts of Session. Read with section 28, contained in the same Part II, the “jurisdiction” referred to in sub-section (3) of section 9 is limited to the trial jurisdiction. Hence the Assistant Sessions Judges deemed to be appointed as Additional Sessions Judges under the proviso to sub-section (3) shall exercise only trial jurisdiction as Additional Sessions Judges and nothing else. Part II of the Code does not control or government Part VII of the Code titled “Of Appeal, Reference and Revision.” <em>Nurul Huda vs Baharuddin 41 DLR 395.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 9(3), Proviso and 31(4)—</strong>Distinction between Court of Sessions and Sessions Judge—Court of Sessions is a Court and the Sessions Judge is an office. <em>Nurul Huda vs Baharuddin 41 DLR 395.</em><br/><strong>Sections 9(3), Proviso and 31(4)—</strong>Assistant Sessions Judge deemed to have been appointed as Additional Sessions Judge does not acquire the status of an Additional Sessions Judge. <em>Nurul Huda vs Baharuddin 41 DLR 395.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 9(3), 29C and 31(4)—</strong>Consequence of change brought in sections 29C and 31(4) àf the Code of Criminal Procedure—An Assistant Sessions Judge deemed to be an Additional Sessions Judge shall not be deemed to be an Additional Judge for all purposes under the Code, namely for hearing appeals revisions references and reviews if they are made over and transferred to him by Sessions Judge. <em>Nurul Huda vs Baharuddin 41 DLR 395.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 9(3), 29C, 31(4), 409—</strong>An Assistant Sessions Judge deemed to be appointed as Additional Sessions Judge has the limited power of passing higher sentences except a Death Sentence in those sessions cases which are now triable by him by deeming and treating him to be an Additional Sessions Judge, consequent upon the changes brought. He shall not be deemed to be an Additional Sessions Judge for all the purposes under the Code, e.g. for hearing appeals, revisions, reference and reviews if they are made over or transferred to him by the Sessions Judge. Under section 409 the Sessions Judge can transfer the hearing of an appeal only to an Additional Sessions Judge and not to an Assistant Sessions Judge deemed to have been appointed as an Additional Sessions Judge. The dismissal in the instant appeal by the Assistant Sessions Judge and refusal of interference by the High Court Division in revision are therefore illegal. The appeal against conviction is therefore allowed and it is directed that the Sessions Judge may himself dispose of the appeal or transfer it to an Additional Sessions Judge for disposal. Abul Kashem vs State 43 DLR (AD) 77.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 10, 18, 20 &amp; 21—</strong>A close look into section 4 of the said Ordinances vis-a-vis sections 10, 18, 20 and 21 of the Code, it would appear that in a Metropolitan Area some of the powers which were dealt with by the District Magistrate, have been given to the Police Commissioner, and some of them have been given to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrates and Metropolitan Magistrates, debarring the District Magistrate to exercise all or any of the powers which could be exercised by him before the promulgation of the said Ordinances and the amendments made in the Code and the Special Powers Act. <em>Anwar Hossain vs State 55 DLR 643.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 18 and 167(7)-</strong>The Additional District Magistrate, Mymensingh had the jurisdiction to pass order for revival of the investigation within six months of the release of the accused. <em>Faziul Hoque vs State 41 DLR 477.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 26—</strong>The statutory provisions recognise the Rule against double jeopardy and the principle of res judicata should apply to criminal proceedings in the same way as to civil proceedings but there being no conviction in the cases under reference, the principle of double jeopardy does not apply. <em>Parveen vs State 51 DLR 473.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 28 and 29(2)—</strong>An offence under section 382 of the Penal Code (XLV of 1860) is triable by Court of Sessions as per Column Eight of the Schedule. <em>Karim Dad vs Abul Hossain 40 DLR 441.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 29—</strong>Labour Court and a Magistrate, 1st Class, having jurisdiction in the relevant matter, shall have concurrent jurisdiction to try an offence punishable under the Industrial Relations Ordinance. Under section 64 of the Ordinance a Magistrate, 1St Class, has also been invested with power to try ‘any offence under this Ordinance. The decision reported in 1985 BLD (AD) 278 is not applicable in the facts of the present case. <em>Kamaluddin Chowdhury vs Mashiudowllah 43 DLR 137.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 30—</strong>A statement that contains self- exculpatory matter cannot amount to confession, if the exculpatory statement is of some facts which if proved would negative the offence alleged to be confessed. Moreover, a confession must either admit in terms of the offence or, at any rate, substantially all the facts which constituted the offence. <em>State vs Al Hasib Bin Jamal alias Hasib 59 DLR 653.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 31—</strong>Question of sentence to be imposed on the accused after conviction. Although it is a matter of discretion of the trial Court interference by the appellate Court will be justified when trial Court fails to impose proper sentence. <em>Santosh Mia vs State 42 DLR 171.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 31—</strong>Sentence increased from 2 years to 5 years because of the appellant’s being a member of the law enforcing agency and the heinousness of the crime. <em>Santosh Mia vs State 42 DLR 171.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 31—</strong>A sentence must not be lenient vis-a-vis the nature of the offence committed and at the same time it must not be harsh either, so that the offender is sent to a point of no return turning him vindictive to the society. <em>HM Ershad vs State 53 DLR 102.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 31—</strong>Sentence is essentially a matter of judicial discretion but it must be commensurate with the gravity of the offence.<br/>The appellants have already lost their jobs and they have undergone the sustained spectre of the jail for a pretty long time by which they may be deemed to have purged their sins to a considerable extent and the same may be considered a mitigating circumstance for taking a lenient view in the matter of sentence. <em>Abdur Rouf vs State 51 DLR 192.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 31—</strong>The trial Courts while awarding sentence must bear in mind that the sentence to be imposed upon the accused must be commensurate with the gravity of the offence. <em>Nurul Alam Chowdhury vs State 51 DLR 125.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 31—</strong>As a matter of principle, it is not proper that by installments the question of sentence should be considered once in the High Court Division and again in the Appellate Division.<br/>The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division while disposing of the criminal appeal was in seisin of the case both on fact and law and as such, he was competent to reduce the sentence. We do not think that it will be proper in the facts and circumstances of the present case to consider afresh the question of sentence on the ground of old age alone which consideration was there in the High Court Division. <em>Mawlana Abdul Hye vs State, Hatem Ali Howlader vs State 51 DLR (AD) 65.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 35—</strong>Since both the condemned prisoners are sentenced to imprisonment for life there is no necessity for a separate sentence to be passed against them under section 201 of the Penal Code. <em>State vs Hamida Khatun 50 DLR 517.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 35A—</strong>On a plain reading of the provision of section 35A, sub-section (1) and consequences thereof appearing in sub-section (2) with the preamble and section 29 of the Act and on consideration of the submissions made by the Attorney-General, the Court holds that provision of section 35A is quite consistent with the scheme of the Act and it will apply to the proceeding of the Act. <em>Hazrat Ali vs State 59 DLR 496.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 35A—</strong>The inclusion of section 35A in the Code of Criminal Procedure was intended to deduct the period of custody from the total imprisonment. There is no provision in section 35A that such benefit will be applicable only in case of convict triable under the Penal Code. The intention of inclusion of 35A is to give benefit to all classes of convicts including the convict tried under the Special Powers Act. <em>Nur Hossen Md vs State 60 DLR 363.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 35A—</strong>The offence committed by the accused, found aggressive with the intention of committing murder, is a culpable homicide not amounting to murder falling within exception No. 1 of section 300, Penal Code considering the state of his mind and it is a punishable offence under section 304 part—I of the Penal Code. <em>Abdul Mazid vs State 58 DLR 355.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 35A—</strong>It is apparent that the provisions of the Code are applicable to a special law if a specific provision has been made to that effect either in the special law itself or in the Code. In this connection the decision in the case of Gahena vs State reported in 20 DLR (WP) 271 is relevant. <em>Hiru Mia vs State 58 DLR 607.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 35(d)—</strong>Transitory Provisions, purpose of—Investigation pending immediately before commencement of the Ordinance—Magistrate did not accept the Final Report and directed further investigation—Police on further investigation submitted charge-sheet far beyond the “specified period” of 60 days as stated in section 167(5) and also of 90 days as stated in section 35(d) of the Transitory Provision—Charge-sheet was submitted one year after the Magistrate’s order for further investigation—Accused-respondents, whether entitled to be released—Provision in section 3 5(d) of the Ordinance is not mandatory and intended to save an investigation which had started at the time when there was no time limit for its conclusion—Investigation on which the Police submitted charge-sheet, not governed by section 167, and the charge-sheet not hit by section 167(7)-Consequently the charge-sheet stands. <em>Kazi Abdul Jalil vs Jashem Munshi 43 DLR (AD) 116.</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 54—</strong>Since the detenu was arrested under section 54 of the Code it was incumbent upon the police to produce her before a Magistrate within 24 hours but the police having not done so the right guaranteed to her under of the Constitution has been violated. <em>Mehnaz Sakib vs Bangladesh 52 DLR 526.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 54—</strong>The provisions of this section shall also apply when a police officer receives any credible information that a person may be concerned in any cognizable offence or has a reasonable suspicion that a man might have com-mitted an act in any place out of Bangladesh which if committed in Bangladesh would have been punishable as an offence. <em>Kalandiar Kabir vs Bangladesh 54 DLR 258.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 54-</strong>The word ‘concerned’ used in the section is a vague word which gives unhindered power to a police officer to arrest any person stating that the person arrested by him is ‘concerned’ in a cognizable offence. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) vs Bangladesh 55 DLR 363.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 54-</strong>A police officer can exercise the power if he has definite knowledge of the existence of some facts and such knowledge shall be the basis of arrest without warrant. There can be knowledge of a thing only if the thing exists. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) vs Bangladesh 55 DLR 363.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 54-</strong>If a person is arrested on the basis of credible information nature of the information, source of information must be disclosed by the police officer and also the reason why he believed the information. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid &amp; Services Trust vs Bangladesh 55 DLR 363.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 54-</strong>if a person is arrested on ‘reasonable suspicion’, the police officer must record the reasons on which his suspicion is based. If the police officer justifies the arrest only by saying that the person is suspected to be involved in a cognizable offence, such general statement cannot justify the arrest. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) vs Bangladesh 55 DLR 363.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 54-</strong>The power given to the police officer under this section to a large extent is inconsistent with the provisions of Part Ill of the Constitution. In view of this position such inconsistency is liable to be removed. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) vs Bangladesh 55 DLR 363.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 54-</strong>The very system of taking an accused on ‘remand’ for the purpose of interrogation and extortion of information by application of force is totally against the spirit and explicit provisions of the Constitution. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) vs Bangladesh 55 DLR 363.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 54-</strong>If the right to be informed of his grounds for arrest and the right to consult a legal practitioner are denied this will amount to confining him in custody beyond the authority of the Constitution. So some amendments in section 54 are needed so that the provisions of this section are made consistent with the provisions of Part III of the Constitution. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust vs Bangladesh 55 DLR 363.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 54-</strong>Police officer cannot arrest a person under section 54 of the Code with a view to detain him under the Special Powers Act. Such arrest is neither lawful nor permissible under section 54. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) vs Bangladesh 55 DLR 363.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 54</strong>—The “reasonable suspicion” and “credible information” must relate to definite averments considered by the police officer himself before arresting a person under this provision. What is a “reasonable suspicion” must depend upon the circumstances of each particular case, but it should be at least founded on some definite fact tending, to throw suspicion on the person arrested and not on a mere vague surmise. <em>Saifuzzaman vs State 56 DLR 324.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 54</strong>—A bare assertion without anything more cannot form the material for the exercise of an independent judgment and will not therefore amount to credible information. <em>Saifuzzaman vs State 56 DLR 324.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 54</strong>—The authority made the orders of detention the moment the police officer made proposal for detention after arrest under section 54 of the Code. This shows the report of the police officer replaced the “satisfaction” of the authority in making an order of detention. It is beyond the scheme of the law that an order of detention can be made in respect of a person on the basis of a report of the police officer after his arrest under section 54 of the Code. <em>Saifuzzaman vs State 56 DLR 324.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 54</strong>-First information report—It can be used for the purpose of testing the truth of the prosecution story and the Court may note any departure therefrom. <em>State vs Billal Hossain Gazi 56 DLR 355.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 54, 161, 163 &amp; 167</strong>—It is not understandable how a police officer or a Magistrate allowing ‘remand’ can act in violation of the Constitution and provisions of other laws including this Code and can legalise the practice of ‘remand’. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) vs Bangladesh 55 DLR 363.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 54 and 167</strong>—This Court, in exercise of its power of judicial review when finds that fundamental rights of an individual has been infringed by colourable exercise of power by the police under section 54 or 167 of the Code, the Court is competent to award compensation for the wrong done. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) vs Bangladesh 55 DLR 363.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 54 and 167</strong>—Provisions of these Sections are to some extent inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution—To remove the inconsistencies some recommendations as given herein are needed. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) vs Bangladesh 55 DLR 363.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 54 and 167</strong>—”State terrorism”— There are complaints of indiscriminate arrest of innocent persons who are subjected to third degree methods with a view to extracting confessions. This is termed by the Supreme Court of India as “state terrorism” which is no answer to combat terrorism. <em>Saifuzzaman vs State 56 DLR 324.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 61 &amp; 167</strong>—An accused cannot be detained in custody of the police for a longer period than under all the circumstances of the case is reasonable and such period must not, without an order of remand by a Magistrate, exceed 24 hours, exclusive of the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Court of the Magistrate.<br/>In the instant case before us, no incriminating articles, e.g. currency notes, soiled notes or stamps were recovered within the first 24 hours of arrest pursuant to any information given by accused Farook Mahajan, and so it cannot be said with an equal degree of certainty that the unlawful detention of the prisoner without any order of remand beyond 24 hours had no effect on the confession made by him. <em>Faruque Mahajan vs State 49 DLR 47.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 61 and 167</strong>—Since some incriminating articles were recovered within 24 hours of the arrest, the High Court did not find any harmful effect of the illegal detention in violation of sections 61 and 167 of the Code on the confession made by the accused. <em>Hasmat Ali vs State 53 DLR 169.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 61 and 167</strong>—There is no evidence that the appellants were detained in police custody under an order of remand of any Magistrate and hence their such custody beyond 24 hours is unauthorised. <em>Belal vs State 54 DLR 80.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 74 &amp; 114(e)</strong>—Objection as to admissibility of evidence is to be taken at the first instance. In the instant case no such objection was raised against the Commissioner’s report in question which can also be relied upon as the same is an official document and was prepared in due course. <em>Abdul Quader Chowdhury vs Sayedul Hoque 43 DLR 568.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 87 &amp; 88</strong>—The prerequisites for publication of a proclamation are the issuance of a warrant and abscondance of the accused so as to evade the execution of the warrant. Attachment under section 88 of the Code of the property, movable or immovable, belonging to the proclaimed person can be made after the order of proclamation issued under section 87. <em>Maulana M A Mannan vs State 48 DLR 218.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 87, 88 &amp; 339B(1)</strong>—Notice as to absconding accused—The notice with regard to the absconding accused was not published in two widely circulated newspapers, as required under section 339B(1) of the Code, rather, it was published in two dailies, namely, ‘Karatoa’ and ‘Nowab’, of which the latter was hardly known and was far from being widely circulated. Although the daily ‘Nowab’ cannot be regarded as having a wide circulation, the other daily has a wide circulation. Therefore, there is substantial compliance with the provisions of section 339B(1) of the Code since prior to such publication, the compliance with the provisions of sections 87 and 88 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is found to have been duly complied. <em>State vs Hamidul 61 DLR 614.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 87 &amp; 88</strong>—There is a gulf of difference between absence and abscondance— absence is not abscondance. For holding that a person is an absconder something more has to be shown. <em>Jobaida Rashid, wife of Khondaker Abdur Rashid vs State 49 DLR 189.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 87 &amp; 88</strong>—The trial Court without taking steps or ascertaining about the compliance of sections 87 and 88 of the Code directed publication of notice. On such facts it cannot be said that the accused was concealing himself from appearing in Court and publication of notice in news-paper and commencing the trial was in clear violation of the mandatory provision of law. So the case is sent back on remand for retrial giving opportunity to the petitioner for cross-examining the PWs already examined. <em>Balayet Howlader vs State 49 DLR 520.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 87 and 88</strong>-From a careful reading of the provisions of sub-section (6) of section 27 of the Act it appears that the lawmakers have consciously excluded the use of the provisions of</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">sections 87 and 88 of the Code in respect of trial under the Special Powers Act. <em>Sirajul Islam vs State 55 DLR 536.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 87, 88 and 339B</strong>—For compelling an absconder accused to be brought to trial coercive power under sections 87 and 88 could be used—Section 339B added to the Code to provide for trial in absentia. This trial in absentia, needs to be held only when all attempts had failed to bring the offender to trial and not just as a matter of course of only, on police showing them in the chalan to be absconders. <em>Lal Mia vs State 42 DLR 15</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 87, 339B and 537</strong>—The expression ‘in at least one news-paper’ occurring in section 339B CrPC is mandatory and, in this view of the matter, the learned Sessions Judge ought to have condoned the delay and should not have dismissed the appeal summarily without deciding the same on merit. The order passed by the learned Sessions Judge on 19-11-1986 dismissing the appeal summarily on the ground of limitation is set aside. <em>Moktar Ahmed vs Haji FaridAlam 42 DLR 162.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 94</strong>—A Court or an officer-in-charge of a police station may issue summons or a written order to the person in whose possession or power such document or thing is believed to be there, for investigation, requiring him to attend and produce it at the time or place stated in the summons or order. <em>Abdus Satter Bhuiyan vs Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka 42 DLR 151.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 94</strong>—Section 94 CrPC speaks of production of any document or other thing but not of seizure by any police officer from any bank relating to bank’s account. The Sessions Judge acted illegally in passing the order according permission to seize the record from the bank’s custody. <em>Arab Bangladesh Bank Ltd vs Md Shahiduzzaman 51 DLR 14.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 94, 155 &amp; 156</strong>—The combined effect of the provisions of sections 94, 155 and 165 is that without an order of a competent Magistrate a police officer cannot investigate a non-cognizable case; and even if he is authorised, he has to observe the formalities as laid down in sections 94 and 165 of the Code before he can compel the production of any document or seize any incriminating article. <em>Humayun Majid vs Bangladesh Bureau ofAnti-Corruption 54 DLR 12.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 94 and 160</strong>—The contention that action of notice by the respondent No. 3 was violative of Article 35(4) of the Constitution is of no substance since the same were issued in connection with an enquiry as regards the information received against the petitioners. The petitioners are not accused of any offence and, as such, protection under Article 35(4) is not available to them. <em>Abu Siddique vs Ministry of Defence 54 DLR (AD) 154.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 94 and 160</strong>-The officers of the Anti-Corruption Bureau in connection with investigation of a complaint to ascertain the truth thereof are authorised to issue notice under section 160 CrPC. <em>Abu Siddique vs Ministry of Defence 54 DLR (AD) 154.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 94 &amp; 160</strong>-No police officer can ask any person to attend or to appear before him and no person is required to attend a police officer merely because he is ordered or required verbally or in writing unless his attendance is so required in connection with investigation of a criminal case or any proceeding. <em>M Mohsin Hossain vs Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh 55 DLR 56.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 94</strong>—As section 94 of the Code does not contemplate seizure of any document from the custody of a bank or a banker as defined in the Bankers’ Books Evidence Act, the question of seizure of the bank accounts of Muon and Abdul Momin Tulu by the concerned officers of the defunct Bureau of Anti-Corruption does not arise at all. <em>Tofail Ahmed vs Chairman, Anti-Corruption Commission 62 DLR 33.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 94 &amp; 160</strong>—The authority of the Anti-Corruption Officer requiring the petitioners to attend and give statements before him in the interest of an inquiry under the provisions of section 94 of the Code cannot be questioned. <em>Abdul Hafiz vs Director General, Bureau of Anti-Corruption, Bangladesh 51 DLR 72.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 94(1)</strong>—The information asked for by the impugned order from the petitioner is not something which is capable of being searched. Therefore the information asked for does not conform to section 94 of the Code. The impugned order purported under section 94 of the Code and Articles 31/50 of the Anti-Corruption Manual is unauthorised and illegal as they do not confer any power to direct a person to give information.<br/>The information asked for the purpose of inquiry was of a roving nature and was merely fishing for information. If we are to believe that the inquiry was in response to the information received by the anonymous letter then the wholesale information of all cases handled by the petitioner from 1393 to 20394 cannot be said to be connected with the alleged remittance of the sale proceeds of the house at Motijheel and Guishan. The asking for such wholesale information of the cases handled by him for that period appears to us to be malafide, fishing for information only to harass the petitioner. <em>Imtiazur Rahman Farooqui (Md) (MI Farooqui) vs Bureau ofAnti-Corruption 51 DLR 421.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 94(1)</strong>—The inquiry stage of an offence, the provisions of Clause (a) to the Proviso to sub-section (1) of section 94 of the Code cannot be called in aid and the same are only meant for the purpose of investigating offences under sections 403, 406, 408 and 409 and sections 421 to 424 (both inclusive) and sections 465 to 477A (both inclusive) of the Penal Code, with the prior permission in writing of the Sessions Judge concerned. <em>Tofail Ahmed vs Chairman, Anti- Corruption Commission 62 DLR 33.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 94(1)(a)</strong>—The applicability of Clause (a) to the Proviso to sub-section (1) of section 94 of the Code to the investigation of an offence under any of the sections of the Penal Code has not been brushed aside by the Appellate Division in the case reported in 1996 BLD (AD) 200 = 2 BLC (AD) 78. <em>Tofail Ahmed vs Chairman, Anti-Corruption Commission 62 DLR 33.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 96</strong>—The submission that by search and seizure no fundamental right of the petitioner is violated is misconceived on the facts of the instant case. <em>Government of Bangladesh vs Husssain MohammadErshad 52 DLR (AD) 162.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 96(1)(3)</strong>—Appeals disposed of on a petition of compromise—High Court Division later vacated the order and restored the two appeals on the allegation of the respondents that the petition of compromise was forged and collusively created.<br/>On a petition of compromise the two appeals were disposed of by the High Court Division on 17th May, 1983 in terms contained in that petition. The respondents filed an application for the restoration of those appeals on the ground that the petition of compromise was created collusively and it was a forged document. The High Court Division vacated the order dated 17th May, 1983 and restored the two appeals to their file and number by an order dated 6th April, 1986. This Court refused on 31st August, 1986 to interfere with that order. <em>Abdul Gafur vs State 41 DLR (AD) 127.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 98</strong>—Provision of section 98 is applicable only when the magistrate is satisfied that the place to be searched is used for deposit or sale of stolen property. <em>Qari Habibullah Belali vs Captain Anwarul Azim 40 DLR 295.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 98</strong>—Even if the facts disclosed in the complaint are true and the properties of the complainant are wrongfully retained, recovery of such goods by issuing search warrant is not at all contemplated under section 98 of the Code. <em>Saiduzzaman vs Munira Mostafa 56 DLR 274.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 99A</strong>—Forfeiture Notice—Forfeiture of a book is a preventive provision so that the author or the publisher of the book does not continue to commit the offence. Under the scheme of law forfeiture is provided and the remedy against the forfeiture having been provided under section 99B of the Code, the Government was not required to issue any notice to the author or publisher of the book giving him opportunity of being heard before passing the impugned order. <em>Sadaruddin Ahmed Chisty vs Bangladesh 48 DLR 39.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 99A(1)(c)</strong>—To forfeit a publication the government is only required to state by notification in the official Gazette the grounds of its opinion, not its satisfaction for formation of opinion. <em>Sadaruddin Ahmed Chisry vs Bangladesh 50 DLR (AD) 119.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 99A</strong>—Forfeiture of book— Government is not required to issue notice—The provision may be invoked when the writing and publishing of a book constituted a penal offence. The order of forfeiture is a preventive action requiring no notice to the author or the publisher to give them opportunity of being heard. <em>Bangladesh Anjuman-e-Ahmadiyya vs Bangladesh 45 DLR 185.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 100 &amp; 552</strong>—A Magistrate cannot detain a person unless he or she is an accused in a criminal case. The petitioner being above 16 cannot be a minor within the meaning of section 361 Penal Code and as such, the Magistrate has no jurisdiction to keep her in custody or to deliver her to the custody of her father. <em>Fatema Begum @ Urmila Rani vs Gageswar Nath and State 46 DLR 561.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 103</strong>—Applicability of the provision relating to search—For the purpose of conducting search in order to find out as to whether a person is guilty of an offence under section 46 of the Excise Act the provision of section 103 CrPC has no application. <em>Dilip Kumar Ghose vs State 42 DLR 464.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 103</strong>—Procedure of search— Applicability—The fulfillment of the provision under section 103 CrPC is not required, because the pipe-gun was not recovered by the police on search but it was produced by the accused himself. <em>Abdul Hashem Master vs State 44 DLR 159.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 103</strong>-Search—The provisions for search to be made in presence of witnesses are designed to create a safeguard against possible chicanery and a concoction on the part of the Investigating Officer and it is obligatory for him to ensure that the search was conducted honestly. <em>Subodh Ranjan vs State 45 DLR 521.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 103</strong>—Prosecution cannot be disbelieved merely because of the fact that the seizure list witnesses stated that the arms were not recovered in their presence.<br/>Now, the question is whether in a case like this, evidence of the informant and the Investigating Officer can be disbelieved or not. Here, we have found that there is no suggestion from the side of the defence that the informant and the Investigating Officer PW 13 had any enmity with or grudge against the accused persons for which they were falsely implicated in this case. The only suggestion given to the prosecution witness is that the accused persons were falsely implicated by the informant for his personal gain in his service. <em>Rana Madbar vs State 51 DLR 499</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 103</strong>—The Court should not take too rigid a view regarding the provisions of section 103 of the Code. In the absence of any cogent reason to disbelieve the members of law enforcing agency, the Court is competent to convict the accused relying on their testimony without being corroborated by the local seizure list witnesses. <em>Kashem vs State 54 DLR 212.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 103</strong>—Search for and seizure of incriminating articles without strictly complying with the requirement of section 103 of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be held legal. This principle of law is applicable in the instant case. <em>A Wahab vs State 60 DLR 34.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 103</strong>—There is no legal bar to convict and sentence the accused under Arms Act mainly on the evidence of Police personnel if there appears no falsehood in their evidence. We do not find any bar to convict the accused Mohiuddin on the basis of unimpeachable evidence of the Police witnesses who made the search and seizure. This view finds support in the case of Nurul Islam vs State report in 1988 BLD 106. <em>Mohin Uddin vs State 61 DLR 35.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 103</strong>—There is no legal bar to convict the accused under Special Power Act mainly on the evidence of police personnel if there appears no falsehood in their evidence. Thus there is no bar to convict the accused Yunus Ali and Shawkat on the basis of unimpeachable evidence of the police witnesses who made the search and prepared the seizure list. <em>Yunus Ali vs State 61 DLR 793.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 103</strong>-If a person makes a confessional statement to a police officer which led to the discovery of the article or leads the police to the place where it is lying, and the police officer seizes contraband article on compliance of procedures contained in section 103 of the Code, and if such officer proves to the satisfaction of the Court the seizure of the article and the prosecution examines the attesting seizure list witnesses in Court, and proves their signatures in the seizure list, whether or not the attesting seizure list witnesses support the prosecution case, the Court may infer a presumption in favour of the prosecution that the police officer or other officer conducting the search and seizure has acted in an official capacity, that the act of the officer in seizing the articles has been done regularly in discharge of his public duties and that the attesting seizure list witnesses are making obliging statements for fear of reprisal. <em>Rabiya Khatun vs State 58 DLR 458.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 103</strong>—Now it is time to review the criminal law, at least to amend section 103 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, to review the principle that burden of proof never shifts in criminal cases, specially in the cases of corruption, offences against sexual violence, murder of women and children, trafficking in arms, drug, narcotics, women and children. <em>Nasir vs State 62 DLR 49.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 103 &amp; 165</strong>—Since the arms were recovered at the instance of the accused, no search was necessary, invoking the application of the provisions provided in law for carrying out a search. No question of following the provisions of sections 103 and 165 of the Criminal Procedure Code and section 25 of the Arms Act therefore arises. <em>Kamruzzaman vs State 47 DLR 416.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 103(1)</strong>—Search was done on 24-1-2007 whereas the seizure list was made on 31-1-2007 after seven days of the search which clearly proves that the action of the respondent is a malafide which is clear misuse of power and the same should be interfered with by this Court. <em>Insab Au vs Magistrate, Abu Zafar, Jessore 63 DLR 290.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 103(1) &amp; (2)</strong>—The provision relating to search and seizure provided in subsections (1) and (2) of section 103 of the Code of Criminal procedure are mandatory and any search and seizure without strictly complying with the aforesaid provisions must be deemed to be illegal. <em>Habibur Rahman alias Jane Alam vs State 47 DLR 323.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 107</strong>—Conspiracy—Its meaning— This word is not defined in the Ain, 1995. The ordinary meaning of the word abetment and also the definition thereof in section 107 of the Penal Code can be taken as a guideline, according to which abetment includes conspiracy or instigation, and also aid to an illegal act or omission. <em>State vs Shahidul Islam alias Shahid 58 DLR 545</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 144</strong>—Status quo is not contemplated in a proceeding under section 144 CrPC. <em>Nazibul Islam vs Dr Amanullah 40 DLR 94.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 144</strong>—A Magistrate has no jurisdiction under section 144 CrPC to issue notice upon the parties to file written statement before him showing cause by a certain date. <em>Nazibul Islam vs Dr Amanullah 40 DLR 94.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 144 and 145(4)</strong>-The instant case is not one of conversion from section 144 to 145 CrPC. By the impugned order the application under section 144 CrPC was disposed of and a proceeding was drawn under section 145 CrPC being satisfied as to the apprehension of serious breach of peace. <em>Nazibul Islam vs Dr Amanullah &amp; the State 40 DLR 94.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145</strong>-A proceeding under section 145 CrPC is not a criminal matter. As to proceedings under section 145 CrPC it is erroneous to designate the complainant as an informant, having regard to the provisions of that section. Once an information is brought to the notice of the Magistrate he has to be satisfied that a dispute as to immovable property is likely to cause a breach of the peace. Further proceedings which he starts are not proceedings in the interest of any private party but in the interest of public peace. (See Babu vs Shyam, ILR 1950 All 543). It is, therefore, highly doubtful if a proceeding under section 145 CrPC can properly be termed as a “criminal matter”. <em>Jobeda Khatun vs Momtoz Begum 45 DLR (AD) 31.</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 145</strong>—The jurisdiction of the Magistrate under section 145 CrPC is ousted when the civil Court is seized with the subject matter of dispute. <em>Jobeda Khatun vs Momtaz Begum 45 DLR (AD) 31.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145</strong>—Bid money—When it cannot be forfeited—Receiver appointed by the Magistrate being an agent of the Court can attach any condition to the auction held for leasing out the attached property. But in the absence of any such condition attached by him or the Magistrate the part of the bid money deposited cannot be forfeited on the bidder’s failure to deposit the balance money, though the bid can be cancelled and fresh auction held. <em>Amir Hossain Farhad vs DrA Mannan 44 DLR 401.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145</strong>—Under section 145 CrPC the Court deals with the limited scope of finding possession. <em>Haji Golam Hossain vs Abdur Rahman Munshi. 40 DLR (AD) 196.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145</strong>—A Magistrate making an inquiry under section 145 CrPC is to decide the fact of ‘actual possession’ without reference to the merits or the claims of any of the parties of a right to possess the subject of dispute.<em> Aminul Islam vs Mujibar Rahman 44 DLR (AD) 56.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145</strong>-Jurisdiction of Magistrate acting under sub-section (1) does not cease until and unless the proceeding is either cancelled under sub-section (5) or is finally disposed of under sub-section (6).<br/>Exercise of power under sub-section (5) not dependent upon the result of inquiry under sub section (4).<br/>The jurisdiction once validly acquired by the Magistrate acting under sub-section (1) of section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not cease until and unless the said proceeding drawn under sub-section (1) is cancelled under subsection (5) or the subject-matter of the proceeding is finally disposed of under sub-section (6) declaring a party to be entitled to possession thereof. At any stage of the proceeding the Magistrate may come to the conclusion that there is no longer any case for continuing the inquiry.<br/>The exercise of power under sub-section (5) is not dependent upon the result of inquiry under sub-section (4).<em> Moslemuddin Dhali vs Helaluddin Dhali 41 DLR 120.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145</strong>-Right to show that no dispute exists or existed—in moving for cancellation for preliminary order a party has liberty to produce evidence—What is evidence depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case—Single piece of paper may prove to the satisfaction of the magistrate that a dispute exists or existed or that there is no apprehension of breach of peace. <em>Moslemuddin Dhali vs Helaluddin Dhali 41 DLR 120.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145</strong>—The High Court Division should not interfere with the finding of possession passed by the Magistrate on proper evidence unless the finding is perverse. <em>Soleman vs Ahbarek Khalfa 46 DLR 298.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145</strong>-Court’s concern in a proceeding under this section—The basic condition for a proceeding under section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is the existence of a dispute regarding any land, etc, between the rival claimants. The concern of the Court in such a proceeding will therefore be the factum of possession of either claimant at the relevant time and also whether there is any apprehension of breach of peace regarding the possession of the parties and not title or other incidental rights. <em>Abdul Jabbar vs Azizul Haque 46 DLR 416.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145</strong>—A Magistrate’s satisfaction while exercising jurisdiction under this section cannot be presumed extrinsic to his order, it must be gathered from the express statements made in the order. <em>Abdul Quddus vs State and Md Mobarak Hossain Ratan 47 DLR 506.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145</strong>—Filing of case under section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure during pendency of a civil suit between the same parties cannot be said to be proper.<br/>A party to a civil suit, if threatened in his possession, can seek remedy from the civil Court and should not seek such remedy from a criminal Court as civil Court if final arbiter of land disputes. <em>Serajul Islam vs Faziul Haque 47 DLR 480.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145</strong>—Dispute of ownership was beyond the scope of determination in a proceeding under section 145 of the Code. <em>Shah Gauhar Jamil Palash vs Shah Md Mansur 57 DLR 298.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145</strong>—It is the dispute relating to possession that was for a Magistrate to consider in a proceeding under section 145 of the Code. <em>Shah Gauhar Jamil Palash vs Shah Md Mansur 57 DLR 298.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145</strong>—Since appellate Court is in seisin of the matter after a decree of the Court in favour of 2nd party the Magistrate’s power under section 145 CrPC is not available. <em>Abdur Rahman Sikder (Md) vs Nur Mohammad Khan. 57 DLR 239.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145</strong>—In a proceedings under section 145 of the Code the Magistrate is required to decide which of the contending parties was in possession of the disputed property on the date of drawing up of the proceedings or whether two months next before such date on the basis of evidence of possession and not to decide which of the parties has lawful claim of possession therein on the basis of document of title. <em>Shebait Mohanta Sree Kedar Nath Achari vs Sree Khitish Chandra Bhattacharya 52 DLR 176.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145, 439A and 537</strong>—Though the Sessions Judge prematurely intervened, he has passed the order correctly and legally and any irregularity as pointed out is curable by the provisions in section 537 CrPC. <em>Shah Gauhar Jamil Palash vs Shah Md Mansur 57 DLR 298.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145, 439A and 561A</strong>—The revisional jurisdiction at the instance of the second party respondents under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not lie as it is a device of invoking a second revision under the garb of an application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure which is not maintainable. <em>Shamsuddin alias Shamsuddoha vs Mvi Amjad All 56 DLR (AD) 59.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 &amp; 146</strong>—Dispute as to possession of land—Attachment to continue until civil Court’s decision on title—The parties are litigating their title, as also possession in a Title Suit. It is for them to raise all the questions therein. All comments, observations and findings of the Magistrate in the proceedings under section 145 CrPC and of the High Court Division while disposing of the application under section 561A CrPC with regard to the title and possession of the disputed property (the subject matter of the proceeding under section 145 CrPC) will be ignored by the civil Court while deciding the title suit. It will be fit and proper, in the facts and circumstances of the case, to keep the Magistrate’s order directing the receiver to hand over possession of the case land to the 1st party of section 145 proceeding in abeyance for .the present and it is so ordered. It is further ordered that pending disposal of the title suit the disputed land will remain under attachment and the 1st party is to hand over possession thereof to the receiver. On receipt of judgment in the title suit, the Magistrate shall dispose of the proceeding before him in conformity with the decision of the civil Court. <em>Samirun Nessa vs Kamaluddin 43 DLR (AD) 175.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 &amp; 146</strong>—Sections 145 and 146 of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be read together as they provide a composite provision to meet a situation as aforesaid. The scheme is that once a proceeding has begun with preliminary order it must be followed by attachment of the property, appointment of a receiver and final determination of right and title by the civil Court.<br/>Unfortunately this aspect of the case was not taken into consideration by the Revisional Court which has resulted in failure of justice. The Courts below have travelled beyond their jurisdiction in finding title of the parties which is not their business but the business of the civil Court. The impugned order accordingly needs to be modified by way of keeping properties in custody of the receiver till such time as the parties decide their respective title in a civil Court in accordance with section 146 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. <em>Abdul Jabbar vs Azizul Haque 46 DLR 416.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 &amp; 146</strong>—When the receiver is a police officer he could not be dispossessed from the disputed property since he has authority to arrest anyone and send him to jail and also prosecute him for committing a cognizable offence or for violating law and order. <em>Abdul Karim vs Gousddin 51 DLR 259.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 &amp; 146</strong>-The Magistrate is duty bound as the custodian of the disputed property to take over possession of the same from the 2nd party who is bound by the decree of the civil Court and to make over the same to the first partv. <em>Abdul Karim vs Gousddin 51 DLR 259.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 and 146</strong>-The Criminal Court exercising the limited summary jurisdiction could regulate the possession of the disputed property. On the failure of the learned Magistrate to ascertain factum of possession in favour of either party direct the parties under section 146 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to go to the Court of competent civil jurisdiction. <em>Shamsuddin vs Mvi AmjadAli 56 DLR (AD) 59.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 &amp; 146</strong>—Order under section 146 could have been passed only after being satisfied on evidence in the proceeding under section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that neither party could prove his possession in the subject matter of the proceeding and therefore the order passed by the learned magistrate was misconceived and beyond the authority under section 146 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. <em>Bangladesh Co-operative Book Society Ltd vs Md Dastagirul Huq 61 DLR (AD) 62.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 and 146(1)</strong>—The purpose of the proceeding under section 145 CrPC is to find out the possession of the property. <em>Haji Golam Hossain vs Abdur Rahman Munshi 40 DLR (AD) 196.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>Sections 145 and 161</strong>—The GD Entry being the earliest in point of time containing facts of the murder though not signed by the information was in fact the First Information Report and the information recorded by the police later on the basis of statement of PW 1 could at best be related as one under section 161 CrPC. <em>Shahjahan vs State 46 DLR 575.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 and 561A</strong>—As the order of the Civil Court was passed earlier there could not be any proceeding under section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of that property. <em>Abdul Alim vs State 53 DLR (AD) 64.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 and 561A</strong>—As the order of the civil court was passed earlier regarding possession of the property, there cannot be any proceeding under section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of the same property. <em>Abdul Alim vs State 52 DLR 616.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 and 164</strong>—A statement of witness is not legally acceptable evidence to prove or disprove any accusation, particularly when the witness herself is available in the court to depose about the occurrence. <em>Alam vs State 54 DLR 298.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 &amp; 561A––</strong>Though two civil suits, instituted before the drawing up of the proceeding under section 145 CrPC, are pending, the civil Court has not passed any order regulating possession of the case land, nor a decree for possession or permanent injunction has been granted. In this view of the matter, the jurisdiction of the Magistrate to act under section 145 CrPC is not ousted. <em>Mozaffar Ahmed vs State 49 DLR 485.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 &amp; 561A</strong>—When the Civil Court is already seized with the question of regulating possession of the land between the same parties, the Magistrate acted without jurisdiction in initiating the impugned proceeding under section 145 CrPC. <em>Abul Bashar vs Hasanuddin Ahmed 51 DLR (AD) 14.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 &amp; 561A</strong>—When the Civil Court is already seized with the question of regulating possession of the land between the same parties the Magistrate acted without jurisdiction in initiating the proceeding under section 145 CrPC. <em>Abdul Majid Mondal vs State 51 DLR 287.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145(1)</strong>—Grounds of satisfaction not stated in the preliminary order—Additional Sessions Judge could inquire whether there were materials on record for such satisfaction and come to a conclusion that the same was not based on materials. <em>Moslem uddin Dhali vs Helaluddin Dhali 41 DLR 120.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145(1)(5)</strong>—Subjective satisfaction in passing order under sub-section (1) but not when moved under sub-section 5.<br/>When a Magistrate passes a preliminary order under sub-section (1), he has to exercise a subjective satisfaction with regard to the apprehension of breach of peace. But when he decides to cancel or not to cancel the preliminary order on being moved under sub-section (5), his satisfaction is no longer subjective.<br/>Decision under sub-section (5) is subject to scrutiny on a wider ground than in an order under sub-section (1). This subsequent decision under sub-section (5) is subject to scrutiny by the revisional Court on a wider ground than the Magistrate’s order passed under sub-section (1). Order under sub-section (5) based on objective satisfaction—open to wider challenge on revision. But an order passed under sub-section (5) is based on objective satisfaction and it is open to wider challenge before the revisional Court. <em>Moslemuddin Dhali vs Helaluddin Dhali 41 DLR 120.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145(4) &amp; 561A</strong>—When an order of attachment and appointment of receiver was legally made by the Magistrate to prevent serious apprehension of immediate breach of peace, such order is to be restored by setting aside the order of Sessions Judge who illegally set aside the order of the Magistrate in exercise of inherent jurisdiction of High Court Division for securing ends of justice. <em>Alauddin vs State 58 DLR 364.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145(4)</strong>—Power in section (4) of section 145 CrPC is an extraordinary power to be exercised in a case of emergency and should not be resorted to as a matter of routine—No apprehension of breach of peace and parties being in joint possession, the order is to be vacated. <em>Gura Miah vs Fazar Ali 42 DLR 70.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145(4)</strong>—Before passing any order under sub-section (4) the Court is required to enquire as regards the fact of actual possession of evidence to be adduced by the parties and if the Magistrate does not comply with this mandatory requirement then ex fade the order must be held to be adduced by the parties and if the Magistrate does not comply with this mandatory requirement then ex facie the order must be held to be illegal as in the instant case. <em>Abdul Quddus vs State and Md Mobarak Hussain Ratan 47 DLR 506.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145(5)</strong>—Magistrate came to the conclusion that there is apprehension of breach of peace on the basis of a certain material—In revisional jurisdiction a different view may be taken. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate by his order dated 12-4-87 came to the conclusion that the posting of Ansars is a further material for coming to a conclusion that there is apprehension of breach of peace. Sitting in the revisional jurisdiction from an order under sub-section (5) the learned Additional Sessions Judge was perfectly entitled to take a different view. <em>Moslemuddin Dhali vs Helaluddin Dhali 41 DLR 120.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 146</strong>—Court’s concern in a proceeding under this section—The basic condition for a proceeding under section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is the existence of a dispute regarding any land, etc. between the trial claimants. The concern of the Court in such a proceeding will therefore be the factum of possession of either claimant at the relevant time and also whether there is any apprehension of breach of peace regarding the possession of the parties and not title or other incidental rights. <em>Abdul Jabbar vs Azizul Haque 46 DLR 416.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 147</strong>—Removal of obstruction—If the Magistrate, after recording evidence, finds merit in the case, he will pass orders prohibiting interference with the right of using the disputed land as the 1st Party’s pathway. In passing such order the Magistrate has sufficient jurisdiction to pass ancillary orders so as to make his order of prohibition effective and, if necessary, to pass orders for removal of any obstruction in the pathway. <em>Farhad Hossain vs Mainuddin Hossain Chowdhury 46 DLR 127.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>—FIR—delay——The Court has always viewed First Information Report with grave suspicion when there had been unexplained delay in lodging it. It can be presumed that the delay was used for manipulation of the prosecution story. <em>Abdul Latif vs State 44 DLR 492.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>—FIR does not contain detailed facts of the prosecution case. Its main purpose is to give information of a cognizable offence to the public and set the law in action. <em>Ataur Rahman vs State 43 DLR 87.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>—FIR—Effect of departure from FIR story—where the prosecution has a definite case, it must prove the whole of it; partial departure from the prosecution case affects credibility of the witnesses and complete departure makes their testimony to be entirely discarded. <em>Gopal Rajgor vs State 42 DLR 446.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>-A FIR may be lodged by any person for, it is meant just to set the machinery of law in action. <em>Shah Alam vs State 42 DLR (AD) 31.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>—Where FIR does not contain an important statement deposed to by the witnesses, it is clear that there has been subsequent embellishment of the prosecution case which makes it untrustworthy. <em>Nazrul Islam vs State 45 DLR 142.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>—FIR can be used only to corroborate or contradict the maker thereof. There is neither any law nor any principle on the basis of which the testimony of another witness can be ignored or rejected, because the informant had made an omission to mention about the fact which the witness stated in his deposition. <em>State vs Abdus Sattar 43 DLR (AD) 44.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>-The first information report is not a substantive piece of evidence and can be used only for the purpose of corroborating or contradicting the matter thereof, but its value lies in being the earliest version of the prosecution story. <em>Seraj Miah vs State 49 DLR 192.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>––The first information report is not a substantive piece of evidence but it can be used to corroborate the informant or to contradict him. It cannot be used to contradict the evidence of any witness other than the informant. The Court is, of course, entitled to note the conflict between the first recorded version of the prosecution case and the case made out in the course of the trial. <em>State vs Tajul Islam 48 DLR 305.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>-The First Information cannot be treated as the first and the last word of a prosecution case—Weight is to be give to the legal evidence adduced by a witness before the Court at the time of trial. <em>Al Amin vs State 51 DLR 154.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>-When the First Information Report is lodged within minimum possible time, such First Information Report story should not be disbelieved only because of any somersault on the part of the informant.<br/>We have already found that for saving his full brother, the informant suppressed the truth at the time of deposing in the Court and, as such, we are of the view that in this case before us conviction may be given on the basis of the statement made in the First Information Report and on the basis of the evidence of the witnesses who corroborated the First Information Report story. <em>Khorshed vs State 51 DLR 317.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>—The filing of the first information report by the victim’s father that she died after taking poison was no bar to file a second first information report if subsequently it transpires that the death was homicidal in nature. <em>Abdul Khaleque vs State 53 DLR (AD) 102.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>—Publication of a report in a news-paper about commission of a cognizable offence against a particular person is not “information” within the meaning of section 154. <em>Mohammod Hossain, Advocate vs Quamrul Islam Siddique 54 DLR 88.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>—The first information report is a matter of special importance when its maker died shortly after he made it. The FIR is clearly admissible in evidence. This may also be treated as a dying declaration in view of the fact that victim himself dictated the ejahar at a time when his condition was really critical. <em>State vs Rashid Ahmed &amp; others 54 DLR 333.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>—There could not be any second first information report and there could not be any investigation on the strength of such a first information report. <em>Kazi Mahbubuddin Ahmed alias Mahbub vs State, represented by the DC, Dhaka 57DLR 513.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>—The entire period of trial is to be calculated on the basis of the concerned Judge’s working days. On 5 occasions the concerned judge was on leave which are to be excluded from the period of trial. Such period excluded, this case is not hit by section 10 of the said Act., This aspect has not also been raised during the trial before the Judge to count his working days as contemplated in section 10 of Act. <em>State vs Naimul Islam 60 DLR 481.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>-FIR—Delay—Mere delay in lodging a case is not a ground for disbelieving a prosecution case, for there are various circumstances in which lodging any case as to the commission of offence may be delayed. <em>(Per SK Sinha J) Major BazIul Huda vs State 62 DLR (AD) 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>-Words ‘মামলা দায়ের’ means institution of a case by submission of a charge- sheet by an officer of the Commission, before the concerned Court and certainly not an first information report as envisaged under section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or a complaint (অভিযোগ) as envisaged under Rule 3 and 4 of the Rules.<br/>The irresistible conclusion is that no sanction will be required to file a complaint (অভিযোগ) either with the Commission or with the police. But sanction from the Commission shall be required both under the unamended and the amended section 32, before institution of a case (মামলা দায়েরের ক্ষেত্রে) in the concerned Court. <em>Anti- Corruption Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir 62 DLR (AD) 290.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 154 and 157</strong>—‘Information’— News-paper Report—The use of the word ‘information’ in section 157 normally means the information received under section 154 of the Code. In section 157, besides using the word ‘information,’ the expression ‘or otherwise’ has also been used. This cannot empower a police officer to start investigation on the basis of a report published in a news-paper. <em>Mohammod Hossain, Advocate vs Quamrul Islam Siddique 54 DLR 88.</em><br/><strong>Sections 154 and 157</strong>—Receipt of information is not a condition precedent for investigation—The officer-in-charge of a police station can start investigation either on “information” or “otherwise”. <em>Saifuzzaman vs State 56 DLR 324.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 154, 156 &amp; 157</strong>—If an officer-in-charge of a police station does not investigate a case, some reasons must be recorded and with such reasons he should notify the informant that he would not investigate into the case. <em>Yasmin Sultana vs Bangladesh 54 DLR 269.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 154, 156 &amp; 157</strong>—An officer-in-charge of a police station is legally bound to reduce an information of cognizable offence into a first information report and to start investigation into the case. <em>Yasmin Sultana vs Bangladesh 54 DLR 269.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 154 &amp; 161</strong>—The GD Entry being the earliest in point of time containing facts of the murder though not signed by the informant was in fact the First Information Report and the information recorded by the police later on the basis of statement of PW 1 could at best be treated as one under section 161 CrPC. <em>Shahjahan vs State 46 DLR 575.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 154 and 161</strong>—The information of commission of a cognisable offence earliest in point of time, on the basis of which law was already set in motion, is the first information report within the meaning of section 154 of the Code and the first information report lodged later on during investigation is a statement of PW 1 under section 161 of the Code and, as such, it is inadmissible. <em>State vs Al Hasib Bin Jamal 59 DLR 653.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 154 &amp; 161</strong>—The written information that was handed over by PW Ito the SI (PW 12) of the Sonargaon PS and Investigating Officer at 19-45 hours of 4th March, 1987 and on receipt whereof PW 12 started Sonargaon PS.Case No. 2 dated 4th March, 1987, is in the eye of law not a FIR but a statement in writing by PW 1, whoh heard from PW 2 about the incident, to the Investigating Officer, subsequent to commencement of the investigation and, as such, the same is a statement under section 161 of the CrPC (38 DLR (AD) 311). <em>Ansar (Md) Chan Mia vs State 53 DLR (AD) 115.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 154, 161 &amp; 162</strong>—First Information Report is an accusation, an information relating to the commission of cognisable offence reported to the Police by any person with the object of putting the Police in motion in order to investigate. <em>Nure Alam vs State 54 DLR 242.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 154 &amp; 162</strong>—The document exhibited as FIR in the case should not be treated as an FIR for the reason that an information as to the murder was lodged earlier and there was a GD Entry thereon, but the same had not been produced. <em>Akhtar Hossain vs State 44 DLR 83.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 155</strong>—A police officer is not to investigate into a non-cognizable case under section 155 CrPC without the order of a Magistrate of the first or second class. Under the l4w when the police has a report of a non-cognizable offence he is bound to refer the informant to the Magistrate for initiating the process of investigation. <em>Aroj Ali Sarder vs State 41 DLR 306.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 155, 190 &amp; 195</strong>-There is nothing in the law to prevent a police officer from making a complaint when some facts come to his knowledge even if he cannot investigate them. <em>Abul Hossain vs State 55 DLR (AD) 125.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 155, 190 &amp; 537</strong>—Non cognizable offence—Mere irregularity like investigation by an officer not authorised to investigate a non - cognizable offence does not affect the legality of a proceeding of a Court below Investigation by a police officer in the instant case is an antecedent proceeding. It is neither the foundation stone nor a prerequisite of the proceeding nor a sine qua non of a valid trial in the Court. It is difficult for us to see why such an irregularity, i.e. investigation by an officer not authorised, should affect the proceeding in a Court or prevent the Court from taking cognizance of a non-cognizable offence under clause (a) or (b) of section 190(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the absence of a clear enactment, expressed or implied preventing the Court from doing so. <em>Golam Moula Master vs State 46 DLR 140.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 155(2)</strong>—There is no legal bar on the part of the police officer receiving an information about a non-cognizable offence in recording the same in the general diary and obtaining permission from a competent Magistrate to investigate into the case. <em>Nasiruddin Kazi vs Aleya Khatun alias Fulu 48 DLR 216.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 155(2)</strong>—Without complying with the provisions of section 155(2) of the Code the police held investigation of the non-GR case. The subsequent taking of cognizance by the Magistrate is certainly an abuse of the process of the Court. <em>Mohiuddin Ahmed vs State 63 DLR 564</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 155(2), 241A</strong>—The matter should be sent back to the Magistrate for hearing specifically on the point whether the investigation can be proceeded and police report can be submitted under section 509 Penal Code without the permission of the Magistrate. <em>Abul Hossain vs State 53 DLR 402.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 156(3) &amp; 200</strong>—There is nothing wrong in the procedure adopted by the Magistrate directing the police to hold investigation treating the petition of complaint as a First Information Report Cases reported in 6 DLR (WP) 205 and 54 Cal 305 are not applicable in the facts of the present case. <em>Yakub Ali vs State 47 DLR (AD) 94.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 156(3) &amp; 190(1)</strong>-The prayer made by the accused for holding further investigation against some other persons is, in fact, a prayer cancelling the charge-sheet filed against them. This is nothing but an indirect way of reopening the case by making reinvestigation but there is no provision of law for cancelling the charge-sheet once filed against some accused and accepted by the Magistrate. <em>Sukhil Kumar Sarkar vs Kazi Wazed All @ Subed 47 DLR 252.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 157</strong>—First Information Report— FIR cannot be substituted for evidence given on oath and when there is no other evidence the facts mentioned in the information could not be relied upon as proof of the offence alleged. <em>Babul vs State 42 DLR (AD) 186.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 160</strong>—Since there is no reference as to any investigation or inquiry in the notice issued by the police officer asking the petitioner to produce documents the same has been issued in an unauthorised manner. <em>Mohsin Hossain vs Bangladesh 49 DLR 112.</em></div></div></div>

The right given to the accused of getting copies of the statements under section 161 CrPC is a valuable right. End of justice requires setting aside the conviction. <em>State vs Zahir 45 DLR (AD) 163.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161</strong>—The examination of prosecution witnesses under section 161 CrPC after a considerable lapse of time casts serious doubt on the prosecution story. <em>Mom Ullah vs State 40 DLR 443.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161</strong>—The investigation officer having not been cross-examined on the question of delay in recording the statement under section 161 CrPC, there is no substance in the contention that the delay should have been taken as a factor to question the veracity of the witnesses concerned. <em>Shadat Ali vs State 44 DLR 217.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161</strong>—The trial Court illegally referred to and considered the statements of witnesses recorded under section 161 Criminal Procedure Code, which could only be used to contradict or corroborate the witness. <em>Abu Bakker vs State 49 DLR 480.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161</strong>—Due to lapse of time in recording of their statements, witnesses indulge in concoction of the prosecution case, more so when they are inimically disposed to the accused. Moreover, one tainted evidence cannot corroborate another tainted evidence.<br/>In a case where enmity is admitted the evidence of such witnesses are liable to be closely scrutinised and unless there are corroboration by cogent, independent and disinterested witnesses the evidences of such witnesses who are inimically disposed are not accepted as the basis for conviction, particularly in a murder case. <em>State vs Hosen Sheikh @ Hochen 50 DLR 508.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161</strong>—Because of belated examination of witness by the Investigating Officer for no plausible reason, possibility of embellishing the prosecution case by the witness cannot be ruled out. <em>State vs Babul Hossain 52 DLR 400.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161</strong>—Judges are competent to take judicial notice of the fact about the present condition of law and order situation in the country and, as such, it is not unlikely that a witness will hesitate to tell the truth for fear of his life. <em>Mahmudul Islam vs State 53 DLR (AD) 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161</strong>—Unusual delay cannot be caused in the matter of noting down statement of a person/witness and mandate of law demands immediate recording of statements when memory of witness remains fresh as human memory is always fleeting. <em>Kazi Mahbubuddin Ahmed alias Mahbub vs State, represented by the DC, Dhaka 57DLR 513.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161</strong>—The contradiction of the statement under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure with the ultimate testimony of the PWs made before the trial Court has adverse effect upon the reliance of the prosecution witnesses which reduces the evidentiary value of the testimony of the PWs as adduced at the trial which makes the witness unreliable on the point on which the witness has contradicted. <em>Zamir Ali (Md) vs State 59 DLR 433.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 161</strong>—Inordinate delay in examining the important prosecution witnesses casts a serious doubt as to the truth of the prosecution case and in the circumstances their evidence cannot be relied on and are to be left out of consideration. <em>State vs Al Hasib Bin Jamal alias Hasib 59 DLR 653.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161</strong>—Investigating officer did not assign any reason for the long delay in examining the PWs. Delay in examining the witnesses under section 161 of The Code is fatal to prosecution case and statements of witnesses are required to be left out of consideration. <em>Sahabuddin vs State 61 DLR 54.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161</strong>—Under certain circumstances delay of a few days even, may render the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses doubtful but yet there may be cases is which delay of years together may not do so. <em>State vs Resalder Moslem uddin 61 DLR 310</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161</strong>—Benefit of doubt—It was the failure on the part of the Investigating Officer tO detect all the 5 assailants who had entered inside the jail, otherwise none of them could deserve any sort of lenient attitude from the Court because of their involvement in such a horrendous crime, but these 2 condemned prisoners namely Dafader Marfat Ali Shah and LD Dafader Abul Hashem Mridha cannot be connected with the crime beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, the two condemned-prisoners are entitled to be acquitted on the principle of benefit of doubt. <em>State vs Resalder Moslemuddin 61 DLR 310.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161</strong>—Unexplained delay in recording the statements of eye-witnesses by Investigation Officer casts a doubts as to the truthfulness of their testimonies. They had been given chance of concoction and false implication. Therefore, their evidence should be left out of consideration. When a witness is cross examined bya party calling him, his evidence is not to be rejected either in whole or in part but the whole of evidence so far as it affects both parties favourably or unfavourably must be taken into account and assessed like any other evidence for whatever its worth. <em>Jalaluddin vs State 58 DLR 410.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161</strong>—The witness claiming to have seen the occurrence admittedly resides at a far off place—Some time had therefore elapsed to find him and for recording his statement No adverse presumption should be drawn because of the delay in recording his statement. <em>State vs Mokammel Hyeath Khan 58 DLR 373.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 161 &amp; 162</strong>—A statement of a witness recorded under section 161 CrPC couldn’t be used as substantive evidence. It can only be utilised under section 162 CrPC to contradict such witness in the manner provided by section 145 of the Act. <em>State vs Nazrul Islam 57 DLR 289.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 161 &amp; 162</strong>—Statements made under section 161 CrPC are not substantive evidence.

The certified copies of the statements under sections 161 and 164 of the Code of the maids and others of the house of the accused filed by the accused at the time of examination under section 342 of the Code in support of his case that the deceased committed suicide by hanging are not evidence and, as such, cannot be considered. There is no evidence that the deceased committed suicide by hanging. Moreover the accused’s explanation that the deceased committed suicide by hanging has been proved untrue. It is proved beyond doubt that the deceased was done to death. There is nothing to hold that anybody else besides the accused could cause the death of the deceased. <em>State vs Azam Reza 62 DLR 399.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 161 &amp; 241A</strong>—Consideration of the statements made under section 161 of the CrPC while framing of charge or otherwise is a necessary part of the Court’s duty. <em>Shaheb All vs State 52 DLR 366.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 162</strong>—Test identification—The substantive evidence of a witness as regards identification is the statement made in the court. In order to carry conviction, the evidence should ordinarily show as to how and under what circumstances the witness came to pick out the particular accused person and the details of the part which the accused had played in the crime in question with reasonable particularity. <em>Shamsul Alam vs State 56 DLR 218.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 162</strong>—Statements made to the Police in course of investigation of an offence started on the basis of FIR are admissible in evidence. Ext I not being statements made in course of investigation to the Police comes within the above provision of law. <em>Nurul Islam vs State 40 DLR 122.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—The trial Court misdirected itself when he had convicted appellants on the basis of statements of witnesses made under section 164 by treating them as confessional statements. <em>Muslim vs State 47 DLR 185.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—Statements recorded under section 164 of the Code cannot be treated as substantive evidence of the facts stated therein. <em>Syed Nazakat Hossain alias Ujjal vs State 48 DLR 139.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—Retraction of confession—Once a confession is found to be true and voluntary, a belated retraction will be of no help to the confessing accused. The necessity even of some sort of corroboration in such cases is not a requirement of law but it is usually desired as a rule of prudence. <em>State vs Tajul Islam 48 DLR 305.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—It is settled principle that one part of the confession cannot be accepted and other part be rejected. It is an error to split up the confessional statement and use that part only which is favourable to prosecution. <em>State vs Lokman Miah 48 DLR 149.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>-The defect of non-compliance of section 164 CrPC by the Magistrate while recording a statement cannot be cured by his examination in Court. <em>State vs Raisuddin 48 DLR 517.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—Before a confessional statement is relied upon it must be found that it was not only voluntary but also true. Voluntariness and truth together make it worthy of acceptance. <em>Moslemuddin vs State 48 DLR 588.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—Confessional statement recorded on a plain paper without the narration of questions and answers and without complying with the provisions of section 164 CrPC becomes inadmissible. The accused was kept in police custody for 3 days preceding his confession and the forwarding report mentions injuries on his person. Confession is involuntary. <em>Alaluddin alias Alauddin vs State 49 DLR 66.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—Statement of a person recorded under section 164 CrPC is not a substantive piece of evidence of the fact stated therein. Such statements recorded by a Magistrate under section 164 CrPC can only be used for contradicting the maker of it under sections 145 and 155 of the Evidence Act or for the purpose of corroborating him under section 157 of the Act. <em>Seraj Miah vs State 49 DLR 192.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—The rule of prudence requires that a retracted confession needs corroboration inasmuch as it is open to suspicion. It is unsafe to rely on such confession without corroboration from other sources. <em>Alaluddin alias Alauddin vs State 49 DLR 66.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>-As against the maker himself his confession, whether judicial or extra judicial, whether retracted or not retracted, can validly form the sole basis of his conviction, if the Court believes that it was true and voluntary and was not obtained by torture or coercion. <em>Abul Kashem vs State 49 DLR 573.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—When the accused were kept in police custody for two days, it was the duty of the Magistrate, who recorded their confession, to put questions as to how they were treated in the police station, why they were making confession and that if they made a confession or not they would not be remanded to police custody. Further, it is found in the record that the Magistrate did not inform the accused persons that he was not a police officer but a Magistrate. On scrutiny we find in the record that magistrate sent the accused persons to the police custody after recording their confessional statements. Therefore, we find the Magistrate had no idea or acumen that it was his legal duty to remove the other, inducement and influence of the police completely from the mind of the accused before recording their confession, So, therefore, we hold that the confessions made by the accused cannot be considered either against the maker or against their co-accused. <em>State vs Abul Hashem 50 DLR 17.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>-Exculpatory statement uncorroborated by any other evidence cannot be the basis of conviction. <em>Abu Jamal vs State 51 DLR 57.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>-There is no hard and fast rule that a retracted confession must be discarded. Retracted confession can form the basis of conviction if it is found true and voluntary. <em>State vs Tota Mia 51 DLR 244.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—There is no requirement under the law for the Magistrate to inform the confessing accused that whether he confessed his guilt or not he will not be handed over to the police.<br/>The submission of the learned Advocate that the absence of observing the formalities by the Magistrate regarding recording the confessional statements by saying that whether they confess of not they will not be handed over to the police and in view of not reporting of the fact by the confessing accused themselves that they confessed their guilt due to physical torture the submission of the learned Advocate for the appellants appears to have no bearing in this case. <em>Rafiqul Islam @ Rafiq vs State 51 DLR 488.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—A retracted confession cannot be used to base a conviction for murder unless corroborated by credible independent evidence. <em>State vs Manik Bala 41 DLR 435.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—Statement recorded under section 164 CrPC cannot be used as substantive evidence against the accused person except for contradicting or corroborating its maker. <em>State vs Manik Bala 41 DLR 435.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>-Confessional statement subsequently retracted—To base a conviction for murder upon a refracted confession alone is not safe when the proof of factum of murder is dependent upon that confession. <em>State vs Manik Bala 41 DLR 435.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>-Confession—Question of credibility when part of the occurrence is omitted or suppressed—It cannot be found nor it could be suggested by either the prosecution or the defence why throttling part of the occurrence was omitted or suppressed. Even if it be taken that accused Rina had deliberately suppressed the throttling part of the occurrence in her judicial confession that cannot mean that the confession was not true.<em> Shahjahan Manik vs State 42 DLR 465.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—Confession—Its nature and credibility—The recording Magistrate having not made any genuine effort to satisfy himself to find out the real character of the confession it casts a serious doubt on the voluntariness of the confession which is the basic requirement of law. <em>Akhtar Hossain alias Babul Akhtar alias Akhtar Ali vs State 44 DLR 83.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>-Confessional statement—Such statement whether retracted or not, if found to be true and voluntary, can form the basis of conviction of the maker.<br/>Confessional statements, credibility of—The UNO stated that he recorded the statements merely in his own language—there is nothing to show that he gave the accused warnings before recording the same, there is nothing to show the time given for reflection, it was not mentioned whether police were present at the time of recording—The Magistrate also did not inform the accused that they would not be sent to police custody after the making of the statements and the Magistrate’s statement as to the presence of PW 5 at the time of recording of the statements is contradictory to that of the latter—the confessional statements, in such facts and circumstances, are neither voluntary nor true. <em>Hafizuddin vs State 42 DLR 397.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—Conviction can be based solely on confession, if found true and voluntary, though retracted subsequently. <em>Hazrat Ali &amp; Abdur Rahman vs State 42 DLR 177.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>-Confession—Rule of law as opposed to rule of prudence—Whether conviction</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">can be based on confession if voluntary and true. For ascertaining as to whether the confession is voluntary and true or not the Court has to examine the confession itself and consider the same in the light of the materials on record and broad probabilities of the case. There is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of the learned Magistrate who recorded the confession. No material could be elicited by the defence that the confession was the result of torture and maltreatment and hence it was not voluntary and not true as well. <em>Hazrat Ali &amp; Abdur Rahman vs State 42 DLR 177.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—Retracted confession—A confession can be taken into evidence, though retracted, if found to be true and voluntary. A belated retraction at the end of the trial would be of no value. <em>State vs Nurul Hoque 45 DLR 306.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—Statement made by the victim of an offence, when it can have evidentiary value—In the absence of examination of the alleged victim, her statements allegedly made to the police or to the Magistrate cannot be treated as evidence against the accused. As neither the victim girl nor the magistrate was examined, the statements recorded by the latter is not even a secondary evidence and in that view it is no legal evidence to prove the prosecution case. <em>Abul Kashem vs State 43 DLR 420.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—Confessional statement—The Magistrate having admitted that after recording the confessional statement, the condemned- prisoner was sent back to the police custody, his confessional statement is to be treated as not voluntarily made. <em>State vs Ali Kibria 43 DLR 512.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—The Magistrate while recording the confession did not record any questions and answers. But then he made real endeavor for coming to the conclusion that the statement was voluntary. The omission to record questions and answers cannot be considered as fatal defects when confession was made duly, though not recorded duly, for want of prescribed form. Facts stated in the confessional statement appear to be consistent with the evidence of PWs. In that view, the confessional statement is true as well. <em>State vs Kalu Bepari 43 DLR 249.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—Credibility of confessional statement—No substantial compliance would cure the defect of noncompliance with the provisions of section 164 CrPC on material points. Confessional statement in a plain paper without the narration of questions and answers would not, by itself, make it inadmissible in evidence. Certificate given by the Magistrate, who had recorded the confessional statement, as to what had happened, how he warned and gave time for reflection to the person confessing, how yet he insisted on making confession and his admitting the same to be correct and the Magistrate’s j believing the same to be voluntary ought to be treated as conclusive evidence of facts stated J therein unless shown to be otherwise. <em>Abdul Hakim vs State 43 DLR 389.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—Confessional statement of appellant Dablu runs counter to the prosecution case.<br/>The whole story is inconsistent with the “confessional statement of the appellant—PW 2 changed the version in Court which differs from the FIR about the number of participants in the murder.<br/>Circumstances of the case—PW 4 statement differs from the confessional statement of appellant Dablu rendering it contradictory to each other. <em>Mizazal Islam vs State 41 DLR (AD) 157.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—The shivering condition in which the accused made confession indicated that he was subjected to threat and torture before he was produced for recording the confession. His conviction though could be based on the retracted confession, even if it was uncorroborated, is illegal when it appears to be neither voluntary nor true. <em>Sanwar Hossain vs State 45 DLR 489.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—When an accused is under threat of being sent back to the police remand he is likely to make confession out of fear. His statement in such a position should not be considered as voluntary. <em>Nazrul Islam vs State 45 DLR 142.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>-Previous statement, use of—The statement of a witness made u/s 164 CrPC is meant for binding him down to the statement made during investigation. The defence may use it to contradict the witness, whereas the prosecution may use it to corroborate him when he gives evidence in Court (per Shahabuddin Ahmed CJ concurred by MH Rahman &amp; ATM Afzal JJ). <em>Abu Taher Chowdhury vs State 42 DLR (AD) 253.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>-If a statement recorded under this section is true and voluntary, the same alone is sufficient for convicting the confessing accused.

Such statement can be used to corroborate or to contradict a statement made in the court in the manner provided in sections 145 and 157 of the Evidence Act. <em>Hobi Sheikh vs State 56 DLR 383.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>-A statement made by a witness under section 164 CrPC can only be used by the accused for the purpose of cross examining in the manner provided by section 145 of the Evidence Act. <em>State vs Nazrul islam @ Nazrul 57 DLR 289.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>-The conviction on confession alone can be maintained if it is found inculpatory in nature, true and voluntary. <em>Gour Chandra Pal vs State 59 DLR 17.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—The confessional statement could not be said to be voluntary since it was recorded three days after the accused was arrested and certainly after illegal detention in police custody. <em>State vs Md Roushan Mondal 59 DLR 72.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—The Tribunal appears to have used 164 statement of PW 60 as a piece of evidence. This is a gross illegality. Such statement was recorded by the Magistrate behind the back of the accused persons, it can never be used as substantive evidence against them in any way. <em>State vs Kajal Ahmed Jalali 59 DLR 345.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164</strong>—From the confession it transpires that accused Shahjahan made confessional statement being fully aware of its consequence and his repentance led him to make the confession as he killed the mother of his friend. Admittedly, police did not arrest accused Shahjahan who voluntarily surrendered and made the confession at the earliest possible time. During recording of the confessional statement accused Shahjahan did not complain of any torture by the police while in custody and the Magistrate also did not find any marks of assault on the person of accused Shahjahan and no such endorsement is found in Exhibit 6, confession. <em>Shahjahan Ali (Md) @ Md Shahjahan vs State 59 DLR 396.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 164</strong>-There is no earthly reason to disbelieve the statements of the victim which she also gave under section 164 of the Code. It is also not acceptable to us why a minor girl would give her deposition and statement narrating the involvement of the appellant in such a manner as she has given, if there would have been no forceful abduction by the appellant and that if she went with him on her own. <em>Monir Hossain vs State 59 DLR 416.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164-</strong>From the form of the recording statement, it is clear that the Magistrate did not state when she started recording the statement. How much time she allowed the accused for reflection. So, on scrutiny of the above confessional statement, it is difficult for us to hold that the same recorded in full compliance with the provision of 164(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that the same is not voluntary and true. <em>Bashar vs State 60 DLR 347.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164 &amp; 241A</strong>—To frame a charge or to consider an application of the accused person that the charge brought against him is groundless trial Court is not obliged to consider the statements of any witness recorded under section 164 CrPC. <em>Forhad Hossain vs State 50 DLR 337.</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sections 164 &amp; 342</strong>—The witnesses deposed disclosing involvement of petitioner Mamun in the meeting of conspiracy and the occurrence of bomb blast resulting in the murder of the two Judges—In his examination under section 342 CrPC he admitted to have committed the offence and he felt proud being able to kill the judges according to the premeditated plan of his leader—His confessional statement and admission before the Court coupled with evidence on record proved the case against him Per Amirul Kabir Chowdhury J dictating the Full Court Judgment. <em>Iftekhar Hasan (Md) @ Al Mamun vs State 59 DLR (AD) 36.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164, 342 and 364</strong>—The Court is required to see not only that the forms under sections 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were complied with but the substance underneath was equally adhered to. There must not be any reason for doubt as to the truth of the statements, be it circumstantial or proved otherwise. In the circumstances it is difficult to deny the accused an opportunity to cross-examine the Magistrate who allegedly recorded the statements. <em>Sadeque @ Sadequr Rahman vs State 61 DLR 498.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164 &amp; 364</strong>-Presumption as to confession—Even though provision is there for making certain presumption in respect of a confession by an accused person produced before a Court taken in accordance with law and purporting to be signed by a Magistrate, having regard to the facts of the case it was injudicious to rely upon such confession without calling the Magistrate as a witness. In respect of a confession the Court is required to see not only that the forms under sections 164 and 364 CrPC were complied with but the substance underneath the law was equally adhered to—There must not be any reason for doubt as to the truth of the statements, be it circumstantial or proved otherwise. In this particular case it is difficult to deny accused appellants an opportunity to cross-examine the Magistrate who allegedly recorded their statements. <em>Babul vs State 42 DLR (AD) 186.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164 and 364</strong>-All the formalities in recording the confessional statement were observed. The magistrate recording the confessional statement was satisfied that the confession was voluntary and free from taint. Facts revealed in confession substantially corroborate the prosecution story. <em>State vs Mizanul Islam 40 DLR 58.</em><br/><br/><strong>Sections 164 and 364</strong>-No hard and fast rule as to the time to be given to the accused for reflection before confession. <em>Ratan Kha vs State 40 DLR 186.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164 and 364</strong>—Confession— Statement not recorded in the language of the maker but in the language of the Magistrate—Accused admitted nothing. State vs Abdur Rashid 40 DLR (AD) 106.<br/>Sections 164 and 364-Giving of remand of the confessing accused after recording his confessional statements is against the principle of law and as such the prosecution cannot get any benefit out of the confessional statements. <em>Shah Alam vs State 52 DLR 566.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164 &amp; 533</strong>—Confession—Noncompliance with provisions for recording confession, effect of—In a case of non-compliance with the provisions of section 164 CrPC on material points, no question of any substantial compliance would arise. Certificate given by the Magistrate as to what had happened, how he warned, gave time for reflection, yet how the accused insisted on making the confessional statement ought to be treated as conclusive evidence of facts therein unless shown to be otherwise.<br/><br/>Section 533 CrPC is the curable section but it would not cure a non-compliance if the error had injured the accused in the defence on merits. Thus, when the statements were not even’ read out to him or could not possibly be read over to him for him to admit or to deny or to examine its correctness or not even shown to him and signed by him, specially when the said are made against his interest and would be used against him, it could not be said that the said would be cured under section 533 CrPC. <em>Abdul Hakim vs State 43 DLR 291.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164 and 537</strong>—The recording Magistrate did not make any genuine effort to find out the real character of the confession.<br/>Omissions in the filling up of many paragraphs cast serious doubt upon the voluntary character of confessional statement.<br/>On a careful perusal of the confessional statement we are satisfied that the recording Magistrate did not make any genuine effort to find out the real character of the confession which he recorded. The omissions to fill up the above mentioned paragraphs are not mere omissions curable under section 537 CrPC and the manner in which the confession was recorded casts serious doubt as to the voluntary character of the statement. <em>Azad Shaikh vs State 41 DLR 62.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164 &amp; 374</strong>—Part of the confessional statement found true may be accepted by the Court to convict the accused rejecting the other part which is not true. There is no merit in the contention that when one part of the confessional statement is rejected, other part, even if true, cannot be accepted.<br/>Learned Sessions Judge could reject a part of the confessional statement if he found the same contrary to other evidence on record. But he could not reject the same on mere surmise and conjecture. A part of the confessional statement favourable to the accused should be given due weight to it unless Court fmds the same not true being contrary to other evidence on record. <em>State vs Afazuddin Sikder 50 DLR 121.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164,342 &amp; 537</strong>—Since the attention of the accused was not drawn to his confessional statement when he was examined under section 342, he is obviously prejudiced. Such defect is not curable under section 537 of the Code. <em>Abu Jamal vs State 51 DLR 57.</em><br/><br/><strong>Sections 164 &amp; 364</strong>—It was injudicious to rely upon confession without calling the Magistrate as a witness.

The breach of the provision of law, if any, is a technical one and by that the evidentiary value of the confessional statement cannot be blown away.

The requirement of adherence to the provisions of section 164(3) CrPC is not a mere matter of form but of substance that has to be complied with—Viewed in the light of the principles indicated above we have no hesitation to hold that the recording of the confessional statement Ext. 5(c) was not done in compliance with the requirement of sub-section (3) of section 164 read with section 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. <em>Azad Shaikh vs State 41 DLR 62.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164(3)</strong>-Corroborative evidence— For corroborative evidence, the Court must look at the broad spectrum of the approver’s version and then find out whether there is other evidence to corroborate and lend assurance to that version. The nature and extent of such corroboration will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Corroboration need not be in the form of ocular testimony of the witnesses and may even be in the form of circumstantial evidence. <em>State vs Md Faziur Rahman Tonmoy 61 DLR 169.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164(3)</strong>—In the absence of any evidence concerning the direct participation of Moti in the planning of the occurrence, it is difficult to hold that he had ‘mens rea’ in the commission of the offence. The confessional statement of the accused dated 21-4-1993 (Exhibit 6) does not indicate that the confession-recording Magistrate complied with the mandatory provision of sub-section (3) of section 164 of the Code. <em>State vs Md Faziur Rahman Tonmoy 61 DLR 169.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164(3)</strong>—The requirement of adherence to the provisions of section 164(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not a mere matter of form, but substance. Section 164(3) is a mandatory provision of law as has been settled by the Privy Council in the case of Nazir Ahmed vs King Emperor, AIR 1936 PC 253 Before recording a confession a Magistrate is bound to make real and substantial inquiry as to the voluntariness of the confession. In so doing he must put questions to the accused with a view to find out the real object of the confession, whether it is made out of repentance or for any other such good reason or whether it is the result of torture or tutoring by somebody or whether it has been caused by any inducement, threat or promise.<br/>A confessional statement, even if it is partly true or partly false or, in other words, does not disclose the full picture, can be used against the maker and there is no legal bar in upholding the conviction on the basis of such confession. <em>State vs Suman Saha 61 DLR 253.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164(3) &amp; 553</strong>—Procedure mandatory in nature—It is ex facie clear from the Exhibit 7 that the confession-recording Magistrate has not explained to the accused Tonmoy that he is not bound to make any confession and if he does so, it may be used as evidence against him. This is a very vital question to be explained by the confession-making accused. The provision of subsection (3) of section 164 of the Code is mandatory in nature. It appears from column 6 of the Exhibit 7 that the Magistrate put a question to the accused Tonmoy as to whether he is making the confession voluntarily and he has replied in the affirmative. But the non-putting of any question to the effect that the accused Tonmoy is not bound to make any confession and if he does so, it may be used as evidence against him at the trial has rendered the confession involuntary, invalid and unreliable, though it purports to be inculpatory in nature and may be true in some respects. <em>State vs Md Faziur Rahman Tonmoy 61 DLR 169.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 165 &amp; 166(3)</strong>—The position of search by police officers of a different jurisdiction has been spelt out in section 166(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure according to which a police officer is entitled to conduct search within the jurisdiction of another police station, if he has reason to believe that in having the place searched by the police of that place a delay would be accused and as a result evidence would be destroyed.<br/>In such a case presumption of regularity of official acts will be invoked otherwise the purpose of the section will be defeated. If a police officer conducts a search within the limit of another police station, it may be presumed, unless otherwise proved, that reasons have been recorded by that officer that delay would have occasioned and evidence destroyed, if he had waited to have the place searched by police having jurisdiction of the place. <em>Kamruzzaman alias Babul Sikdar vs State 47 DLR 416.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 167</strong>—Order of remand—Its validity—The word ‘forward’ used in section 167 CrPC means ‘act of sending’. Unless the accused is sent to the Magistrate and the Magistrate passing the order of remand without the accused being forwarded to him, the legal requirement is not complied with for the Magistrate to assume jurisdiction to pass the order of remand. The accused must be brought before the Magistrate prior to passing of an order of remand, no matter whether the accused is in police lockup or judicial custody. <em>Aftabur Rahman vs State 45 DLR 593.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 167</strong>—Law did not provide for automatic stopping of further investigation and release of the accused after expiry of the time limit nor for stopping proceedings by the Sessions Judge or Special Tribunal on such ground. <em>Niamatullah @ Chand (Md) vs State 48 DLR 148.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 167</strong>—The provisions of section 167 CrPC being a procedural law, there being no express provisions for its prospective operation, shall operate retrospectively. <em>AKM Azizul Islam vs State 9DLR (AD) 115.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 167</strong>—While producing a person arrested without warrant before the Magistrate, the police officer must state the reasons why the investigation could not be completed within 24 hours and what are the grounds for believing that the information received against him is well- founded. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) vs Bangladesh 55 DLR 363.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 167</strong>—The order for detaining in police custody is passed by a Magistrate in exercise of the power given to him under subsection (2) of this section. If the requirements of sub-section (1) are not fulfilled, the Magistrate cannot pass an order under sub-section (2) for detaining a person even in jail not to speak of detention in police custody. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) vs Bangladesh 55 DLR 363.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 167</strong>—Though the provisions empower the Magistrate to authorise the detention in police custody, no guideline has been given in sub-sections (2) and (3) as to the circumstances under which detention in police custody may be authorised. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) vs Bangladesh 55 DLR 363.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 167</strong>—Entries in the Diary—It is for the Magistrate to decide on certain materials placed before him such as the material contained in the diary relating to the case whether or not the detention of the accused was necessary. In coming to the conclusion the Magistrate has to exercise his judicial mind and only when the Magistrate did apply such a mind, it could be said that the order made for detention is a valid order. <em>Saifuzzaman vs State 56 DLR 324.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 167</strong>—Remand order should be made in presence of the accused in view of the expression “forwarded” used in sub-section (2) of section 167 of the Code. <em>Saifuzzaman (Md) vs State 56 DLR 324.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 167 &amp; 61</strong>—An accused cannot be detained in custody of the police for a longer period than under all the circumstances of the case is reasonable and such period must not, without an order of remand by a Magistrate, exceed 24 hours, exclusive of the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Court of the Magistrate.<br/>In the instant case before us, no incriminating articles, e.g. currency notes, soiled notes or stamps were recovered within the first 24 hours of arrest pursuant to any information given by accused Farook Mahajan, and so it cannot be said with an equal degree of certainty that the unlawful detention of the prisoner without any order of remand beyond 24 hours had no effect on the confession made by him. <em>Faruque Mahajan and 4 (four) others vs State 49 DLR 47.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 167 &amp; 173</strong>—Charge-sheet submitted not upon the revival of the case under section 167 but following the further investigation under section 173 CrPC—The power to make further investigation is available to the police if there has been no order under 167 CrPC stopping the proceeding and releasing the accused after the expiry of the period of investigation under the said section. <em>Shah Alam Chowdhury vs State 42 DLR (AD) 10.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 167, 173, 190 and 561A</strong>— Proceeding before a Court starts when the competent Court takes cognizance of an offence on Police report or on a complaint or upon his own knowledge.

Rule for quashing the proceedings is liable to be discharged. <em>Mokbul Hossain vs State 40 DLR 326.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 167 and 364</strong>—The statement of the condemned-prisoner having been recorded on the same day after giving him only one hour for reflection of mind and with no assurance that he would not be sent back to police custody, all create a serious doubt as to the true nature of the confessional statement. <em>State vs Harish 54 DLR 473.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 167, 339C and 494</strong>-Children are entitled to trial before the Juvenile Courts and positive step should have been made to make their trial in accordance with law of Juvenile Court, not to be tried jointly with the adults. The respondents are directed to comply with the earlier direction and report compliance within six months from date. <em>Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust vs Bangladesh 57 DLR 11.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 167(5)</strong>—The accused-petitioner did not stand released under section 167(5) on stopping further investigation on the ground of expiry of the limitation of specified or extended period of investigation—Charge-sheet validly submitted in accordance with law. <em>Shah Alam Chowdhuiy vs State 42 DLR 49.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 167(5)</strong>-Stopping of investigation being subject to order of Sessions Judge, no absolute right, not to speak of any vested right of release, could be created in favour of the accused with the passing of order stopping further investigation by the Magistrate on the expiry of specified or extended time for investigation.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the case of <em>Mohitullah vs State</em> reported in <em>38 DLR (AD) 240</em> it has been held that an accused would be tried in accordance with procedure prevailing on the day trial commenced and if the procedure is changed by the time trial commenced the accused cannot claim vested right to be tried in accordance with the provisions of the repealed procedure. It is well settled that procedural law takes effect retrospectively. In this connection reference nay be made to the case reported in (1994) 14 BLD (AD) 143 (State vs Ana Mia). <em>Sultan Ahmed vs State 47 DLR 196.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 167(5)</strong>—The effect of the amendment is that the accused may be released on bail by the Magistrate or by the Sessions Judge in case of failure of the Investigating Officer to complete investigating within the specified period. <em>Amalendu Mazumder vs State 49 DLR 204</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 167(5)</strong>—In view of the proviso to this section the period spent awaiting sanction of the government for prosecution of the accused should be added to the statutory period for submission of charge sheet. <em>Saheb Ail Miah vs State 46 DLR 238.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 167(5)</strong>-At a time when the report to prosecute the petitioner was submitted there was no provision in section 167(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for stopping investigation of a case and releasing the accused because of non- completion of investigation within the statutory period and as such, the proceeding cannot be stopped and the accused cannot be released. <em>Bimal Chandra Adhikari vs State 51 DLR 282.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 167(5)</strong>—After the amendment of the provisions of sub-section (5) of section 167 of the Code in 1992 there is no scope of stopping the investigation on the ground of expiry of time limit specified for investigation. <em>Nazrul Islam vs State 51 DLR 368.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 167(5) &amp; 498</strong>—The fixation of the period of investigation is meant for speedy trial of the case and to save the accused from unnecessary harassment in jail custody.

In the present case the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate exercised his power to stop the proceeding under subsection (7) but he exercised a different power that was provided by sub-section (7A) for revival of the proceeding. It cannot therefore be said that he exhausted his jurisdiction after the exercise of power to stop proceedings and became functus officio. <em>Md Arab All vs State 42 DLR 524.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 167(7A)</strong>—Whether Additional District Magistrate is not included within the term “District Magistrate” as contended by the petitioners’ Advocate. <em>Faziul Hoque vs State 41 DLR 477.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 167(7A)</strong>—Prosecution had no alternative but to approach the District Magistrate for revival of the case under the now repealed provision of sub-section (7A) of section 167 of the Code as no other higher authority was mentioned in the said provisions. <em>Niamatullah @ Chand (Md) vs State 48 DLR (Criminal) 148.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 167 (7A)</strong>—Ministry of Establishment’s Notification bearing No. MF/JAIII/ VEST/84-377 dated Dhaka 17-10-84 vested all powers of District Magistrate in Additional District Magistrates. <em>Fazlul Hoque vs State 41 DLR 477.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 167(7A) &amp; 339C</strong>—On a plain reading of the provision of section 339C the District Magistrate’s authority and jurisdiction arises to revive the case under section 167(7A) on and from the date on which the order of stopping investigation and release of the accused persons is actually passed and not from the date when such order of stopping proceeding and release of the accused should have been passed or deemed to have been passed. <em>Hamizuddin vs State 40 DLR 287.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 169</strong>—Section 169 of the Code of has not given the Police Officer any power to judge the credibility of the witnesses and to decide the defence plea of alibi. <em>Abdur Rouf vs Jalaluddin 51 DLR (AD) 22.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 169, 202(1), (2B)</strong>—Interpretation of statute—Whether order of discharge of the  accused by the Magistrate on receipt of final report (true) is in a way like releasing the accused by the Investigating Officer under section 169 CrPC on the ground of deficiency of evidence. <em>Shah Alam Chowdhury vs State 42 DLR 49.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 171(1)(2)</strong>—The police officer who has investigated the case shall be responsible for the attendance of witnesses at the trial. <em>Daily Star and Protham Alo Patrika vs State 53 DLR 155.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 172</strong>—The Case Diary of an Investigating Officer which is not a public document cannot be made public by swearing affidavit. <em>Bangladesh vs Dr Shamima Sultana Rita 54 DLR (AD) 151.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 172</strong>—A case diary maintained by the Police cannot be treated as substantive evidence but it may be used for the purpose of ascertaining the truth or otherwise of the evidence appearing in the case. <em>Abdus Sukur Miah vs State 48 DLR 228.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173</strong>—The Police can file supplementary charge-sheet even after acceptance of the previous charge-sheet. There is no limitation in this regard to taboo in the law. <em>Sultan Ahmed alias Sentu vs State 48 DLR 143.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173</strong>—There cannot be any reinvestigation into a case after charge-sheet is submitted. <em>Mubashwir Au vs State 46 DLR 535.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173</strong>—There is no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure entitling the accused persons to file an application to the Magistrate for further investigation or reinvestigation into a case in which charge-sheet has already been submitted against them.<br/>In the case of Sukhil Kumar vs State reported in 47 DLR 252 =15 BLD 311 distinction between further investigation and reinvestigation with reference to earlier decisions was considered and it was held that prayer for further investigation made by the accused persons against whom charge sheet has already been submitted is nothing but a prayer for reinvestigation in the name of further investigation and the same cannot be allowed. We, therefore, find merit in this Rule <em>Shajahan All vs Belayet Hossain 47 DLR 478.</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 173</strong>—In the name of further investigation police cannot make reinvestigation of the case and discharge the accused person against whom charge-sheet has already been submitted. <em>Moslemuddin vs State 47 DLR 420.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173</strong>—Section 27 of the Special Powers Act is a departure from the provision if section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure— Special Tribunal alone is empowered to take cognizance of the offence on the report of a Police Officer of the rank of Sub-Inspector and hold trial on the same— Sections 26 and 27 of the Special Powers Act provided for special machinery for investigation and trial by special tribunal. <em>Taslima Begum vs State 42 DLR 136.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173</strong>-If the investigation officer fails to mention proper section in charge-sheet or in his report, the court is empowered to take cognizance under proper section on consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case. <em>Alauddin vs State 54 DLR 564.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173</strong>—There is no scope of filing a final report meaning not sending up any accused for trial and then a separate report for sending up some other accused for trial as one report is sufficient to serve both the purposes. <em>Abdur Rouf @ Rab Howlader vs State 55 DLR 202.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173</strong>-After investigation in respect of the relevant allegations the police submit a report under section 173 of the Code. If the report contains sufficient materials for taking cognizance by a Magistrate, it is commonly known as a charge-sheet. But a mere police report has got no bearing on the question of conduct of an accused. <em>Air Marshal Jamaluddin Ahmed (Retd) vs Bangladesh 57 DLR 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173</strong>—Charge-sheet being a police report is not admissible in evidence and as such the case has no legs to stand. This is nothing but an abuse of the process of the Court and, it can be safely held this case is preposterous one and barred by law and outcome of the evil desire of the then ruling Government being dictated and guided by the Four Parties alliance and, as such, continuation of the proceedings will be an abuse of the process of the Court. <em>Dr Kamal Hossain vs State 63 DLR 204.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 173, 190</strong>—There is nothing either in section 173 or in section 190 of the Code providing for ejection or acceptance of a police report.

It is obvious from section 205C that when a Magistrate receives charge-sheet and an accused appears or is brought before him, the Magistrate shall send the case to the Court of Session if it appears to him that the case is exclusively triable by the Court of Session. The Magistrate has no option to decide whether charge-sheet was properly submitted. <em>Ibrahim vs State 53 DLR 533.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 173 &amp; 439A</strong>—So far as the direction by the Sessions Judge to hold further investigation into the case is concerned, it is quite lawful; but his direction to submit charge-sheet is clearly without jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Per Mustafa Kamal J (agreeing): By making absurd comments, uninformed criticisms and vituperative innuendos on the judgments of the Appellate Division the learned Judges have placed themselves well inside the perimeter of contempt of this Court. By openly, blatantly and consciously flouting Article. 111 they have also put themselves within the ambit of steps to refer the matter to the Supreme Judicial Council. Yet we decide to follow the course to caution the learned Judges not to repeat the performance in future.<br/>It will be useful for all to remember that as human beings are not infallible, the judgments of the Appellate Division are too not infallible. Yet in all disciplined and constitutional societies and governments, the pronouncements of the highest Court are given a finality and a binding effect for the simple reason that there must be a finality to litigation at some point and that there must be judicial discipline, the lower judicial hierarchy being bound by the decision of the higher judicial hierarchy. To allow or even to tolerate a breach of this time honored and constitutionally fixed duty is to invite judicial anarchy and judicial indiscipline. This will create confusion in the administration of justice and erode people’s confidence in the orderly and disciplined dispensation of justice under the Constitution. We hope that the learned Judges will appreciate the merit of judicial restraint and will desist in future from the temptation of treading on a beaten path.<br/><br/>Per Latifur Rahman J (agreeing): The pronouncement in respect of the power and jurisdiction of the High Court Division with regard to 561A of Code having been clearly stated in several decisions of this Division, it does not lie in the mouth of the High Court Division to take a contrary view of the same. The judgments of this Division as per the mandate of Article 111 of our Constitution is binding on the High Court Division. It is a clear violation of the Constitutional mandate by the learned Judges of the High Court Division. Is it not a violation of the oath of Office of a Judge to protect and preserve the Constitution of Bangladesh. <em>Sher Ali vs Stale 46DLR (AD) 67.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173(3A) &amp; (3B)</strong>—Before conclusion of trial the Investigating Officer may send further report if new and important evidences are available which may be considered by the Court during trial. <em>Rahmatullah vs State 48 DLR 158.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173(3B)</strong>—By further investigation the police officer can bring to the notice of the Court additional facts and even prosecute persons against whom charge-sheet was not submitted earlier.<br/>But the police in the name of further investigation cannot exclude the persons against whom charge-sheet had already been submitted. In the present case supplementary charge-sheet having been filed against the FIR named accused persons excluded in the earlier charge-sheet we find no illegality in this case. <em>Ear Ali (Md) vs State 47 DLR 405.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173(3B)</strong>—The police may make further investigation in respect of an offence after submission of a report and submit a further report or a supplementary charge-sheet in respect of any accused against whom evidence has been collected during further investigation, but the Magistrate has no power to direct further investigation in respect of accused persons against whom the police has once submitted a charge- sheet just to obtain a final report, nor can the police, after further investigation, submit final report in respect of a person against whom a charge-sheet was once submitted. <em>Golam Mostafa vs State 47 DLR 563.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173(3B)</strong>—When it is not provided in the law itself as to under whose order a Police officer may hold further investigation, no illegality was committed by the Police officer concerned in holding further investigation on the order of his superior officer. <em>Idris alias Jamai Idris vs State 52 DLR 184.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173(3B)</strong>—A witness once narrating the occurrence without implicating the appellant with the offence in any manner cannot be permitted to depose for the second time with a view to implicating the accused and play double standard. <em>Ruhul Amin Kha vs State 56 DLR 632.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173(3B)</strong>—The CID committed no error of law in holding further investigation as per provision of section 173(3B) of the CrPC. Had further investigation been done after the case record was transmitted to the Senior Special Judge after taking cognizance of the offence or passing any order whatsoever then permission of the Special Judge would have been necessary. The police had the power to hold further investigation as per provision of section 173(3B) of the Code as the provision of this section is in no way derogatory to the provision of sub-section 5(6) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958. <em>Abdus Samad Khan vs State 50 DLR 143.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173(3B)</strong>—The provision does not have any scope for the Sessions Judge to direct further investigation by the police. The order of the Sessions Judge directing further investigation on an application by the informant is without jurisdiction and is liable to be set aside. <em>Abdul Malek vs Payer Ahmed Chowdhury and State 46 DLR 455.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 173(3B)</strong>—The Government’s decision to withdraw a case from the Criminal Investigation Department after withdrawing the earlier order for investigation by the CID is not illegal. <em>Abu Talukder vs Bangladesh 49 DLR (AD) 56.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 174</strong>—A perusal of section 174 of the Code indicates that the object of the proceeding is merely to ascertain whether a person died under suspicious circumstances or an unnatural death and, if so, what is the apparent cause of death. The question regarding the details of death is foreign to the ambit and scope of proceeding under section 174. <em>Babul Sikder vs State represented by the DC 56 DLR 174.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 176 and 197</strong>—Meaning of taking cognizance of offence—Stage of determination of guilt when reaches under section 176 CrPC— difference between “prosecuted” without prior sanction under section 6(5) and “taking cognizance” without prior approval. <em>Matiur Rahman vs State 40 DLR 385.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 177 and 179</strong>—Criminal trial — Interpretation of the provisions of section 179 of the Code of Criminal Procedure—Territorial jurisdiction of the Criminal Court—Offence of forgery took place in Noakhali but trial being held in Comilla—In view of the provision of section 179 CrPC the Court of competent Magistrate of Noakhali district where false documents were made and the Court of Additional District Magistrate, Comilla where consequences ensued had both jurisdiction to try the offence of forgery complained of. <em>Jagenath Chandra Bakshi vs State 42 DLR 238.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 177-180</strong>—The offence under section 138 of the Act can be completed with the concentration of a number of facts i.e. (i) drawing of the cheque, (ii) presentation of the cheque, (iii) returning of the cheque unpaid by the drawee bank, (iv) giving notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque demanding payment of the cheque amount and (v) failure of the drawer to make payment within 15 days of receipt of the notice. As per provisions of sections 177, 178, 179 and 180 of the Code of Criminal Procedure if the aforesaid five different acts were done in five different localities any of the Courts exercising jurisdiction in one of the five local areas can become the place of trial for the offence under section 138 of the Act and complainant can choose any one of the Courts in whose jurisdiction any of the 5 components of the said offence was done. The legal notice was issued from a lawyer at Chittagong District Bar and the complainant, for encashing the cheques, presented the same at a Bank at dliittagong. As such, on the ground of initiating the proceeding at Chittagong this proceeding cannot be quashed. <em>Abdul Aiim vs Biswajit Dey 59 DLR 236</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 179</strong>—Applicability of section 179 CrPC to the offences defined in section 463 Penal Code—provisions of section 463 PC analyzed. Two essential ingredients of section 463 PC pointed out—both the competent Criminal Courts at Noakhali and Comilla have jurisdiction to try the offence. <em>Jagenath Chandra Bakhi vs State 42 DLR 238.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 179(c)</strong>—Since in the sequel of the criminal acts of accused Nos. 3 and 4 by way of obtaining signatures of the complainant in blank papers at Jeddah money was withdrawn in Bangladesh, a Criminal Court of competent jurisdiction in Bangladesh can take cognizance in the case in accordance with illustration (c) of section 179 of the Code. <em>Abdus Sattar vs State 50 DLR (AD) 187.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 188</strong>—It was obligatory on the part of the Magistrate to make a written complaint about the nature of the order made by him which was alleged to have been disobeyed and the manner of violation in order to form an opinion that accused persons have committed an offence punishable under section 188 Penal Code. <em>Abdul Ahad@ Md Abdul Ahad vs State 52 DLR 379.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 188 &amp; 196</strong>—The alleged offence having been committed in India, the trial of. the case in question cannot be proceeded with without sanction of the Government for the purpose in view of the proviso to section 188 of the Criminal Procedure Code and sanction obtained in his case under section 196 of the Code cannot do away with the requirement of proviso to section 188.<br/>This sanction however can be accorded by the Government even after cognizance has been taken of the case if it is found desirable. Since the cognizance of the case has been taken upon a petition by an order of the Government in accordance with section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the complaint case itself need not be quashed. In this view of ours we are fortified by the decision in the case of Ranjit vs Sm Parul Hore, and another reported in 1980 CrLJ Noc 57 (Cal); (1979)1 Cal FIN 414. <em>Dr  Taslima Nasrin vs Md Nurul Alam 48 DLR 280.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 190</strong>—Sessions Judge cannot take cognizance of a case against the accused sent up in the supplementary charge-sheet without cognizance being taken by the Magistrate. <em>Sultan Ahmed alias Sentu vs State 48 DLR 143.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 190 &amp; 436</strong>—A Court of Session has no power to take cognizance of any offence as a Court of original jurisdiction and the Magistrate having power to take cognizance of any offence has exclusive power to take cognizance of an offence and to issue process irrespective of any offence, either he has power to hold trial of the case or not. <em>Ziaul Hoque Chowdhury vs State 58 DLR 193.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 190(1)(b)</strong>—A naraji petition is a complaint for all practical purposes and if a Magistrate having power to take cognizance of the offence is satisfied on examination of the complainant that the complaint discloses an offence he can take cognizance of the offence, against the accused under section 190(1)(b), irrespective of an offence which is exclusively triable by a Court of Session. <em>Ziaul Hoque Chowdhury vs State 58 DLR 193.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 190, 155 &amp; 537</strong>—Non cognizable offence—Mere irregularity like investigation by an officer not authorised to investigate a non--cognizable offence does not affect the legality of a proceeding of a Court below.<br/>Investigation by a police officer in the instant case is an antecedent proceeding. It is neither the foundation stone nor a prerequisite of the proceeding nor a sine qua non of a valid trial in the Court. It is difficult for us to see why such an irregularity, i.e. investigation by an officer not authorised, should affect the proceeding in a Court or prevent the Court from taking cognizance of a noncognizable offence under clause (a) or (b) of section 190(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the absence of a clear enactment, expressed or implied preventing the Court from doing so. <em>Golam Moula Master vs State 46 DLR 140.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 190 and 193</strong>—Orders passed by the Sessions Judge starting from registering the complaint as petition case upto the orders date directing the Assistant Superintendent of Police for further enquiry are without jurisdiction.<em> Eman Ullah vs Abdul Kader 54 DLR 623.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 190, 195 and 196—198</strong>—Provisions in section 195 like the provisions in sections 196-198 CrPC are exceptions to the general and ordinary powers of a criminal Court to take cognizance of an offence under section 190 of the said Code. A private party may be the real victim of the commission of an offence, but he is debarred from making a complaint directly to the Court. <em>Abdul Hai Khan vs State 40 DLR (AD) 226.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 190, 200 and 202</strong>—An enquiry or an investigation can be directed by the Magistrate under section 202 of the Code in order to ascertain the nature of the allegation and to decide whether cognizance of the offence should be taken because till then he is in seisin of the case. <em>Golam Rahman vs Md Bazlur Rahman (Babu) 53 DLR 461.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 190(1)</strong>—Refusal to take cognizance against some of the accused persons amounts to dismissal of the complaint as against them and application filed before the learned District Judge by the complainant is maintainable.<br/>Magistrate’s power of taking cognizance under section 190(1) in all cases, including those exclusively triable by a Court of Sessions, has remained unaffected by (the repeal of the provision for committing the accused to the Court of Sessions. <em>Syed Ahmed vs Habibur Rahman 42 DLR 240.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 190(1) &amp; 156(3)</strong>—The prayermade by the accused for holding further investigation against some other persons is, in fact, a prayer cancelling the charge-sheet filed against them. This is nothing but an indirect way of reopening the case by making re-investigation but there is no provision of law for cancelling the charge-sheet once filed against some accused and accepted by the Magistrate. <em>Sukhil Kumar Sarkar vs Kazi Wazed All @ Subed 47 DLR 252.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 190(1)(b) &amp; 200</strong>—It appears that the naraji petition has been filed on a complaint but as an application out of apprehension that the Magistrate might accept the recommendation of the Investigation Officer.

Seraj uddowla vs Abdul Kader 45 DLR (AD) 101.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 195(1)(b)</strong>—Complaint of Court— Requirement—When the Magistrate considered the prayer of the Investigating Officer that he appellant be prosecuted for making a false charge and the prosecution report upon which cognizance was taken shows that the same was filed as directed by the Magistrate it is clear that the prosecution of the appellant was sanctioned by the Magistrate himself and, as such, it could not be said that the cognizance was taken in violation of section 195(1)(b). <em>Serajuddowla vs A Kader 45 DLR (AD) 101.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 195(1)(c)</strong>—The view taken in AIR 1943 Nagpur 327 “all the High Courts are now agreed that once a forged document is brought then private complaints subsequent to this are barred by section 195 even in respect of anterior forgeries—anterior, that is, to the litigation”—has been consistently followed in 20 DLR Dhaka 66 &amp; other cases. <em>Abdul Hai Khan vs State 40 DLR (AD) 226.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 195(1)(c)</strong>—Legislature did not intend any anomalous situation that might arise if the trial of one offence may be made dependent upon a possible complaint by the Court while the other offence is tried upon a private complaint. <em>Abdul Hal Khan vs State 40 DLR (AD) 226.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 195(1)(c)</strong>—Jurisdiction of a criminal Court when barred. Which Court is empowered to take cognizance of offences in the section 195(1)(c) <em>Abdul Hal Khan vs State 40 DLR (AD) 226.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 195(1)(c)</strong>—No cognizance can be taken against one of the appellants who appears to have forged the document expect on complaint by the Court. <em>Abdul Hal Khan vs State 40 DLR (AD) 226.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 195(1)(c)</strong>—Private complaint, when incompetent—Ingredients of offence such as forging of a document and making use of such documents in Court by a party to the proceeding if found present in a case then the mandatory provision against filing of a private complaint comes into play. The instant proceeding initiated by the complainant opposite party is a bar under section 195(1)(c) CrPC and the Courts concerned only have sole jurisdiction to make a complaint in the interest ofjustice. <em>Ajit Kumar Sark.er vs Radha Kanta Sarker 44 DLR 533.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 195(1)(c)</strong>—Prosecution for a document given in evidence—From a perusal if the provision of law it appears that the words “documents produced or given in evidence” contemplate the original documents alleged to be forged and not a certified copy of the same. If the document in question is not produced in Court, but a certified copy of the same is produced, no complaint from the Court is necessary for prosecution of the alleged offenders In view of the decision in the case of Saurnakhsingh vs King AIR 1950 (PC) 31 the absence of complaint cannot stand as a bar to the trial of the accused- petitioner in the present case for forgery relating to the sale deed produced in Court in the earlier SCC suit.<em> Shambhu Nath Saha vs State 43 DLR 660.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 195(1)(c)</strong>—Stay of proceeding—In the facts of the case as in point of time the civil suit was instituted before the filing of the FIR and the questioned documents in their originals are yet to be produced and examined by the civil Court. The criminal proceeding where the documents are claimed as forged, may, in the interest of justice, be stayed till the disposal of the civil suit. <em>Zakir Hossain vs State 43 DLR (AD) 102.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 195(1)(c)</strong>—Use of a photo copy of the forged document could not amount to the use of a forged document.<br/>It would appear that the photocopy of the kabala which is said to be forged by the opposite party gave only a clue or inkling to the forgery. The action brought by the opposite party against the petitioner is an action independent of the filing of photocopy of the forged document in the Court of Magistrate. Therefore, it is clear to see that we are not to depart from the views held by the superior Courts including the Privy Council that when the original forged instrument is not used in the Court section 195(i)(c) is no bar to a proceeding for forgery. <em>Moklesur Rahman Sharif vs State, Jamiruddin Sharf47 DLR 229.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 195(1)(c)</strong>—Words “document produced or given in evidence’ contemplate to produce original document alleged to have been forged and not a photocopy. <em>Abdul Gafür alias Kana Mia vs Md Nurul Islam 56 DLR 519.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 195(1)(c)</strong>—Forged document produced before a revenue officer not being considered as a Court does not stand as a bar for initiation of a criminal proceeding by the private person for a commission of forgery. <em>Chitta Ranjan Das vs Shashi Mohan Das 56 DLR 276.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 195(1)(c)</strong>—In the instant case, in the absence of the original document being produced in the proceeding the bar under section 195(1)(c) will not apply. <em>Abdus Sattar Pramanik vs State 56 DLR 452.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 195(1)(c)</strong>—Since the alleged forged document has been filed in the civil Court which is the subject matter of a suit for Specific Performance of Contract, it is for the concerned Civil Court to lodge any complaint before the criminal Court if it finds the forgery relating to the said document But since the instant proceeding in GR Case No. 190 of 2000 under sections 420/467/ 468/471 has been initiated on private complaint the same cannot continue in view of the provision of section 195(1 )(c). <em>Abur Rahman vs State 59 DLR 683.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 195(1)(c) and (4)</strong>—Ambit of sub- section (4) of section 195 CrPC—It is therefore clear that the offences referred to in cl.(c) when committed in pursuance of a conspiracy or in the course of the same transaction, will fall within the ambit of sub-section (4) of seãtion 195 including their abetments or attempts independent of the dates of their commissions. <em>Abdul Hye Khan vs State 40 DLR (AD) 226.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 195(1)(c) and 476</strong>—Restricted application of clause (c) to be discarded—I Ain, therefore, inclined to think that reading clause (c) with section 476 of the Code, there does not seem to be any compelling reason to restrict the application of the said clause limiting the control of the Court only to few offences committed (pendente lite) as would be the practical result of such interpretation. The clause will be applicable even when the offence alleged is committed by the party to proceeding in any Court before becoming such party if it is produced or given in evidence in such proceeding. <em>Abdul Hye Khan vs State 40 DLR (AD) 226.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 195(1)(a)(b)(c) and 476</strong>—There is specified procedure and method for filing complaint by a Court in respect of offences describçd in clauses (a) and (b) but there is no such specified procedure for offences in clause (c) of section 195 CrPC. <em>Abdul Hye Khan vs State 40 DLR (AD) 226.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 195(1)(c), 476 and 561A</strong>—No Court can take cognizance of any offence under section 467 of the Penal Code without a complaint in writing by the Court in which the document was given in evidence or by a Court to which the said Court is subordinate. <em>Sona Mia vs State 42 DLR 8.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 195(2)</strong>—A Revenue Officer holding an inquiry in a mutation proceeding, in the premises, does not become a court as he does not really adjudicate a right and he does not give a decision which is binding on the parties. <em>Shahera Khatun vs State 53 DLR 19.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 197</strong>—After arrest at dead of night the victim was beaten to death on his way to the Singra Police Station. He was not even shown any warrant of arrest nor any case number. Such an act of the accused-petitioners can never be said to be an act done by them while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of official duty. <em>AbdulAwal vs State 50 DLR 483</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 197</strong>—Previous sanction of the Government is required under section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before commencing any criminal prosecution against the petitioner. <em>Kazi Obaidul Haque vs State 51 DLR 25.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 197</strong>—It appears <em>prima facie</em> that Md Mahabubur Rahman, the then Officer-in-Charge of Ramna Police Station on 3-3-2004, fabricated false evidence by way of making a photocopy of a GD Entry, which he attested as true copy of the GD Entry Register. Such an act by the officer-in- charge can be brought within the mischief of sections 193/ 194/195 of the Penal Code, since the evidence was used in the trial to secure conviction of innocent accused for commission of an offence involving the death penalty. It further appears that Ahmad Kamrul Islam Chowdhury, who at the relevant time was engaged in the trial of the instant case as Special Public Prosecutor, Chittagong, took positive steps to testify, to the genuineness of the attested photocopy of the GD Entry declaring that he had seen the original GD document. The falsity of their respective attestation/declaration is evident from a cursory glance at the photocopy which shows the original printed form to be upside down.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, an Officer-in-Charge of a police station does not fall in this category as Government sanction is not required for his removal from service. Secondly, in the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the provisions of section 197 would not be attracted in any event since the act alleged to have been done constituting an offence was certainly not done while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty. In no way does the act of fabricating evidence have any nexus with the official duty of the officer concerned as contemplated in section 197 of the said Code. The learned Magistrate is to take a note of this aspect of law accordingly. <em>State vs Sajauddin 60 DLR 188.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 197</strong>—The evidence of the witness including the report of the inquiry held by a Magistrate leads to irresistible opinion that the offence alleged has not been committed by the accused in the discharge of their official duties and, as such, we do not find any force in the submission of the learned Advocate as to applicability of section 197 of the Code regarding the two petitioners. <em>ASI Md Ayub All Sardar vs State 58 DLR (AD) 13.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 198 and 199</strong>— If the provision of section 199 is allowed to be continued, then husband of a woman can compel her to yield to any sexual harassment to attain his personal gain. The provisions of sections 198 and 199 of the Code not only degraded the dignity of a woman, but the same are offending against the fundamental rights of a woman to be treated equally as well as seek protection of law. These two sections may either be deleted from the Code or be modified in a way to ensure that the victim or aggrieved woman herself can launch a prosecution against a person liable to be pro-secuted for committing offence under sections 497 and 498 of the Penal Code. <em>Aftabuddin vs State 63 DLR 235.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 200</strong>—Taking cognizance of a fresh case without examining the complainant under section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is illegal.<br/>When the naraji does not contain allegation of any offence but is more a protest petition it does not take the nature of a complaint and there is no question of examining the complainant and taking fresh cognizance of any offence. <em>Abu Bakar vs State 47 DLR 527.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 200</strong>-The Tribunal disposed of the final report not on merit, but mechanically. It is now well established that naraji petition is nothing but a petition of complaint under section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On receipt of such Naraji petition, the Tribunal may take cognisance against the accused if it is found reasonable and proper or direct further investigation by higher authority or by another agency of investigation. <em>Abdul Halim Md vs State 60 DLR 393.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 200</strong>-If the naraji petition is filed before an order of discharge has been passed, the Magistrate can take cognizance without examining the complainant if the intention of the appellant appears only to draw the attention of the Magistrate by way of protest, or the Magistrate may treat it as a complaint and examine the complainant, as he thinks fit. <em>Abu Bakar vs State 47DLR 527.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 200</strong>-Naraji petition—Naraji petition is nothing but a petition of complaint under section 200 of the Code and on receipt of such petition Magistrate may take cognizance against</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">accused persons or may direct further investigation by the Police. The Magistrate is not bound by the final report and may take cognizance against the accused persons on consideration of materials on record or may direct further investigation on his own motion also. <em>Shahjahan Ali Mondal vs Belayet Hossain 47 DLR 478.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 200</strong>—There is no question of prejudice to the accused-petitioner due to the irregularity of non-examination of the complainant by the Magistrate under this section before he transferred the case for judicial enquiry. <em>Kazi Rashidur Rahman vs Md Giasuddin 48 DLR 299.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 200</strong>—A second prosecution of the same accused is permissible if his order of discharge was not passed earlier on merits. <em>Nurul Hoque vs Bazal Ahmed 48 DLR 327.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 200</strong>—If cognizance is taken on the basis of a fresh complaint there can be no objection to the proceedings at all and in a proper case an application for revival also may amount to a fresh complaint. <em>Nurul Hoque vs Bazal Ahmed 48 DLR 327.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 200</strong>-A Naraji petition is a fresh complaint and a Magistrate is competent to take cognizance on the basis of a naraji petition by complying with the requirements of the Code.<br/>By passing the order of discharge of the accused-petitioner from custody at the instance of $ie police the Magistrate did not become functus fficio and his order of discharge of the accused-petitioner from the custody at the instance of the lice cannot operate as a bar to take cognizance against the accused-petitioner. <em>Nurul Hoque vs Bazal Ahmed 48 DLR 327.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 200</strong>-Since there is no requirement of law to record reasons for taking cognizance we find no illegality in those orders on that count. <em>Shinepukur Holding Ltd vs Security Exchange Commission 50 DLR 291.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 200</strong>—Use of the word “report” in this section in contradiction to the word “complaint” used in section 200 of the Code appears to be significant. The word “report” presupposes enquiry or investigation and without making enquiry or investigation a report cannot be prepared and submitted. <em>Shinepukur Holding Ltd vs Security Exchange Commission 50 DLR 291.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 200</strong>-Both the Magistrate and the Sessions Judge committed error of law resulting in miscarriage of justice by rejecting the Naraji petition and discharging the accused opposite parties on the basis of the police report. The Magistrate ought to have held an inquiry on the Naraji petition before rejecting the case. <em>Jalaluddin Bhuiyan vs Abdur Rouf 51 DLR 408.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 200 and 190</strong>—An enquiry or investigation can be directed by the Magistrate under section 202 of the Code in order to ascertain the nature of the allegation and to decide whether cognizance of the offence should be taken because till then he is in seisin of the case. It is wrong to say that simply because the case was started on a petition of complaint, the Special Tribunal constituted under the Special Powers Act would have no jurisdiction to try the case, if it is otherwise triable under the Act<em>. Golam Rahman vs Md Bazlur Rahman (Babu) 53 DLR 566.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 200 &amp; 202</strong>—Judicial inquiry held after police report and upon a naraji petition is permissible under provision of section 202 of the Code and it does not amount to reopening of a case. After receiving the petition of complaint the learned Magistrate proceeded under section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and himself held the judicial inquiry and in that inquiry as the complainant was examined, the action of the learned Magistrate has not vitiated the proceedings in any way for not examining the complainant immediately after filing of Naraji petition. In view of our discussion above, we therefore find no merit in this Rule. <em>Dilu alias Delwar Hossain vs State, represented by the Deputy Cornmissioner 48 DLR 529.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 200 and 202</strong>—Either there must be some information before police officer about commission of a cognizable offence or there must be a formal complaint before a Magistrate for starting orholding investigation in a case of cognizable offence. <em>Mohammod Hossain, Advocate vs Quamrul Islam Siddique 54 DLR 88.</em><br/><strong>Sections 200 &amp; 202</strong>—In order to bring home the charge under section 420, it is necessary for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the representation made by the accused was known to him to be false and that acting on that false representation, the complainant purchased the land in question.<em> Abul Kashem vs State 59 DLR 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 200 &amp; 202</strong>—[n the judicial enquiry the complainant was examined and thereafter, having found a prima facie case against the petitioner, the Magistrate took cognisance. In such a position the Magistrate committed no illegality in taking cognisance against the peti-tioner without examining the complainant under section 200 of the Code. <em>Nirode Baran Barua vs Mrinal Kanti Das 59 DLR 456.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 200, 202 &amp; 561A</strong>—When a naraji petition was filed the same petition should have been treated as petition of complaint and the learned Magistrate was required to act in accordance with provisions laid down in section 200 or 202 of the <em>CrPC. Abul Hossain vs State 52 DLR 222.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 200, 202, 204 and 205C</strong>—Jurisdiction of the Magistrate in cases exclusively triable by a Court of Session. Whether the Sessions Judge has jurisdiction to direct the Magistrate to send the case to him after its dismissal by the Magistrate. <em>Bangladesh vs Yakub Sardar 40 DLR (AD) 246.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 200 &amp; 204 1(A) &amp; 1(B)</strong>— From the language of sub-section (IA) and (TB) of section 204 of the Code it is clear that taking of cognizance under section 200 of the Code will not be illegal if list of witnesses and copy of the complaint are not filed before issuance of the process of warrant of arrest or summons. <em>Shinepukur Holding Ltd vs Security Exchange Commission 50 DLR 291.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 200 &amp; 561A</strong>—The purpose of examination of the complainant under section 200 CrPC is to see whether is sufficient ground for proceeding and not whether there here is sufficient ground for conviction. Whether the evidence is adequate for supporting conviction can only be determined at the trial and not at the stage of enquiry. Allegations made in the petition of complaint having made out a prima facie case of cheating against the accused-appellant, it is not a fit case to quash the proceeding at the present stage. <em>SA Sultan vs State 44 DLR (AD) 139.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 202</strong>—If the prosecution failed to prove that the accused killed the victim on account of dowry, the trial of the accused by the Bishesh Adalat would be without jurisdiction and the proper course would be to send the case back on remand for fresh trial under the general law. <em>State vs MdAbu Taher 56 DLR 556.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 202 and 241A</strong>—Before framing charge, a Magistrate is required to hear the parties and consider documents submitted along with the record of the case by the prosecution. <em>Abul Kalam Azad vs State 52 DLR 583.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 202(1), (2A)</strong>—Under section 202(1) and proviso to section 202(2A) of the Code of Criminal Procedure in a case exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions, a Magistrate for the purpose of ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the complaint is to consider the evidence in order to find whether prima facie case is made out or not, but he cannot assess the evidence as if in a trial. <em>Syed Ahmed vs Habibur Rahman 42 DLR 240.</em><br/><strong>Sections 202 and 561A</strong>—The Sessions Judge had no jurisdiction to direct the Magistrate for taking cognizance. Even he could not make observation that there was evidence against the petitioner. <em>Basiran Bewa vs State 56 DLR 553.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 202(2B), 241A &amp; 265C</strong>—Dis- charge under the provisions of these sections is of different character than the discharge of the accused under sub-section (2B) of section 202 where discharge is made before taking of the cognizance.<br/>In our view there is no scope for making further enquiry after discharge if the accused under sections 241A or 265C of the Code as the same is made after taking cognizance. Moreover at the time of hearing under section 241 A or under section 265C the Court considers the record of the case, the documents submitted therewith and the submissions made by both parties. So, all necessary materials are before the Court and as the order is passed on consideration of all such materials, there is no scope for passing any order for holding further inquiry. But there is scope for further enquiry when accused is discharged under the provision of sub-section (2B) of section 202 of the Code as the said order is made before taking of the cognizance. <em>Abdul Hal vs State 50 DLR 551.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 203</strong>—Complaint filed for prosecution of defamation against a party who made such statement in a judicial proceeding—Complaint dismissed under section 203 of the Code of Criminal Procedure without either admitting the complaint petition or examining the complainant. <em>AY Mashiuzzaman vs Shah Alam 41 DLR 180.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 203 and 439A</strong>—Whether the Sessions Judge has got power under section 439A, Criminal Procedure Code or any other provision of the Code to direct a Magistrate to send the case to him for trial when the Magistrate dismissed the complaint under section 203 of the Code. <em>Bangladesh vs Yakub Sardar 40 DLR (AD) 246.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 203, 204(3) &amp; 436</strong>—The order of dismissal of the complaint passed under sections 203 and 204 (3) CrPC does not amount to discharge. So for a further enquiry in such a case no notice to the accused is necessary.<br/>The principle, that an order prejudicial to an accused should not be made, without giving him an opportunity to be heard, has no application where the accused is not discharged. A revisional application before the learned Sessions Judge at the instance of an aggrieved complainant against an order of dismissal of a complaint by the Magistrate can be gone into without notice to the accused. <em>Sirajudullah vs State 48 DLR 76.</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sections 203, 205(1) &amp; 436</strong>—Neither the Sessions Judge nor the High Court Division is invested with any power to direct any Magistrate to take cognizance of a case.<br/>Their power is strictly limited to directing a further enquiry into the petition of complaint. It will be for the Magistrate concerned to take or not to take cognizance after the result of further enquiry. After the dismissal of the petition of complaint under section 203 CrPC the informant respondent’s remedy was to approach the higher Court under section 436 CrPC for further enquiry into his petition of complaint. The penultimate order of the High Court Division in directing the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence and to issue process in accordance with section 205(1) CrPC is not sustainable. <em>Yusuf A Hossain vs KM Rezaul Ferdous 48 DLR (AD) 53.</em><br/><br/><strong>Sections 203 and 241A</strong>—A decision regarding framing of charge cannot be made without considering the inquiry report. <em>Abul Kalam Azad vs State 52 DLR 583.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 203, 204 and 436</strong>—Since the Magistrate accepted the final reports and discharged the accused person as per provisions of law and since specific remedies have been provided in the Code against such discharge, the Magistrate has become functus officio and has no power to revive the proceeding. <em>Rasharaj Sarker vs State 52 DLR 598.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 203, 205(1), 436 and 561A</strong>— Sessions Judge cannot direct the Magistrate to take cognizance of a case. The power of Sessions Judge is limited to directing a further enquiry into it. It will be for the Magistrate concerned to take or not to take cognizance after the further enquiry. <em>A Rouf vs State 52 DLR 395.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 204(3), 435 and 436</strong>-Provisions under which Courts are competent to direct the Magistrate.—The Sessions Judge and, for that purpose, the District Magistrate, Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and the High Court Division, got power under section 435 CrPC to call for the record of any case pending before any Magistrate and direct the Magistrate under section 436 to make further enquiry into any complaint which has been dismissed under section 203 or subsection (3) of section 204 CrPC. <em>Bangladesh vs Yakub Sardar 40 DLR (AD) 246.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 205</strong>—Section 205 CrPC was and is applicable only to cases in which summons has been issued although expressions in Chapter XVII are meant for cases in which summons is issued and warrant is issued. <em>Hazi Hafeez vs Abdul Mabud 41 DLR 321.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 205</strong>-Considering the hardship of the female accused in attending the Court at Naichiti from Jessore the Magistrate may consider their prayer for appearing in Court through lawyer. <em>Salam Mollick vs State 48 DLR 329.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 205C</strong>—Under the newly added provisions of section 205C jurisdiction has been vested in the Magistrate to examine the police report or other materials on record and if it appears to the Magistrate that the offence as disclosed from such materials is triable exclusively by the court of Sessions he is empowered to send the case to such court<em>. Maksudur Rahman Hilaly vs State 47 DLR 314.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 205C</strong>—From a reading of thisj section, it is found that there is any dead-end time limit for producing those documents in Court. <em>Nurul Islam Manzoor vs State 52 DLR 276.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 221</strong>—Charge—Charge is a precise formulation of the specific accusation made against a person who is entitled to know its nature at the very earliest stage. <em>Abdur Razzaque @ Geda vs State 48 DLR 457.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 221 &amp; 222</strong>—The failure of the trial Court in not mentioning the particulars which are required to be mentioned under sections 221 and 222 of the Code while framing charge deprived the accused proper defence and, as such, the error has occasioned failure of justice. <em>Bashir Kha vs State 50 DLR 199.</em><br/><br/><strong>Sections 221 &amp; 232</strong>—Charge——charge under section 201 Penal Code was framed against the appellants and although no charge under sections 302/34 Penal Code was framed they were convicted thereunder. Conviction without such a charge being framed is illegal. <em>Muslim vs State 47 DLR 185.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 221 &amp; 537</strong>—A charge is an important step in a criminal proceeding and the accused is answerable to the charges levelled against him. The object of framing charge is to ensure that the accused may have as full particulars as are possible of the accusation brought against him.

Section 232 CrPC contemplates a new trial or remanding of the case to the trial Court in such a situation. It is too late now to direct a retrial after a long lapse of time. <em>Abdur Razzaque @ Geda vs State 48 DLR 457.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 233</strong>—দুটি খুনের জন্য আসামীদের বিরুদ্ধে একটি চার্জ গঠন করা হয়েছে । ইহা আইনসংগত হয় নাই । দুটি হত্যার জন্য পৃথক পৃথক ভাবে চার্জ গঠন করতে হবে । <em>Abdul Aziz vs Sekendar Ali 111.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 233</strong>—The element of continuity of action was also present in the instant case in that the petitioner and others encircled the house of the victims and that thereafter petitioner and some others entered into the hut of the victims and caused injuries by sharp cutting weapons in consequence whereof the death occurred. In this state of the matter it can in no way be said that the offences or, in other words, causing death of the two persons by the petitioner and others was not committed or done in the course of the “same transaction” or in one transaction. <em>Delower Hossain Khan vs State 54 DLR (AD) 101.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 233</strong>—The object of this section is to save the accused from being embarrassed in his defence if distinct offences are tried together in one case. The legislature has engrafted certain exceptions to the provision contained in section 234, 235, 236 and 239. <em>Zahed Hossain vs State 60 DLR 386.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 234</strong>—The period of one year is available in section 234 of the Code of Criminal Procedure but it is absent in section 6(1B) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act and thereby in view of the provision laid down in section 6(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 section 6(1 B) excludes the application of section 234 which relates to the period of the commission of the alleged offence. <em>Habibur Rahman Molla vs State 61 DLR 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 234</strong>—Mis-joinder of charges—One charge both under sections 460 and 302/34 Penal Code framed against all the accused is defective and conviction thereunder is set aside. <em>Abdul Quddus vs State 44 DLR 441.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 234 and 236</strong>—Applicability of sections 234 &amp; 236 Manner of—Section 234 and section 236 apply to cases where one person may be dealt with at one trial for more than one offence while section 239 applies to the trial of more persons than one jointly. Where two incidents are independent and wholly unconnected with each other, no joint trial is permitted. <em>Lal Mia vs State 40 DLR 377.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 234-236</strong>—Mis-joinder of charge— When the accused have been charged under sections 302/34 Penal Code on the allegation that they committed murder in furtherance of common intention, the addition of section 460 Penal Code in the charge is materially defective. The accused having been convicted and sentenced under sections 302/34 their, conviction and sentence at the same time under section 460 in the same case is bad in law and should be set aside. <em>Khelu Mia vs State 43 DLR 573.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 234 and 561A</strong>—The contention that there cannot be three separate cases out of single transaction and the petitioners cannot be put on trial in three separate cases arising out of one transaction is of no substance. <em>Abul Fazal (Md) alias Abul Fazal alias Badal vs State 53 DLR (AD) 100.</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 235</strong>—The various acts were done in pursuance of a particular end in view and they were connected together by proximity of time, unity of purpose and continuity of action and those acts formed parts of the same transaction within the meaning of section 235, CrPC. (Per Siddiqur Rahman Miah J: agreeing). <em>Zahed Hossain vs State 61 DLR 386.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 235 and 239</strong>—The provisions of section 235 and 239 of the Code vest a discretion with the Court to try offences of the kinds indicated therein jointly in the circumstances mentioned, but there is nothing in them to indicate that the Court is bound to try such offences or persons together. (Per Siddiqur Rahman Miah I agreeing). <em>Zahed Hossain (Md) vs State 61 DLR 386.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 235-237</strong>—Where from the facts of the case it is not clear which of the several offences has been committed, the accused may be charged with having committed all or any of such offences and he may be convicted of the offence which he is shown to have committed, although he was not charged with it. <em>Parveen vs State 51 DLR 473</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 235-237 and 403</strong>—When facts of the case are such that it is doubtful which of the several offences has been committed the accused may be charged with having committed all or any of such offences; and after trial for one such offence the accused may be convicted for the other offence even though he was not charged thereof—In the instant case “robbery” and “unauthorised possession of fire arms” are not offences of the same nature contemplated in sections 236 and 237 (1) CrPC, but these are two distinct offences for which a person may be charged for each of them as provided in section 235(1) CrPC. <em>Arfan Ali vs State 42 DLR (AD) 22.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 235 and 239</strong>—Section 235 empowers trial of a person for more offences than one if those are committed in the same transaction but section 239 provides for persons accused of different offences committed in the course of the same transaction. <em>State vs Lieutenant Colonel Syed Farook Rahman 53 DLR 287.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 235 and 239</strong>—Whether a series of acts are so connected as to form the same transaction is purely a question of fact depending on proximity of time and place, continuity of action and unity of purpose and design. A comprehensive formuia of universal application cannot be framed regarding the question whether two or more acts constitute the same transaction. <em>State vs Md Abu Taher 56 DLR 556.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 236, 237, 238 &amp; 337</strong>—The accused raised no objection on the score of defect in charge at any stage of the trial. The objection raised for the first time in the Appellate Division is not entertainable by virtue of explanation appended to section 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. <em>Rajib Kamrul Hasan vs State 53 DLR (AD) 50.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 236 &amp; 237</strong>—An offence under a particular section if not proved but some other offence is made out by the prosecution, the accused persons can be very well convicted and sentenced for the other offences proved before the court through legal evidence. <em>Al-Amin vs State 51 DLR 154.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 236 &amp; 237</strong>—When an accused is charged under sections 302 and 134 Penal Code his conviction under section 201 Penal Code is legal. <em>Kalu vs State 45 DLR (AD) 161.</em><br/><br/><strong>Sections 236, 237, 238, 417 and 423</strong>—A fmding of acquittal can be converted into one of conviction only in an appeal under section 417 which being in accord with section 423 CrPC is the correct view taken in Bawa Singh’s case. <em>Mofizuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 286.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 237</strong>—In view of the provisions of section 237 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the conviction of the petitioner under section 381 is maintainable although he was charged under section 408 but not under section 381 of Penal Code.<br/><br/>In view of the provisions of section 237 CrPC and being in respectful agreement with the pronouncements of the learned Judges, I am of the view that although in this case the petitioner was charged under section 408 of the Penal Code and not under section 381 of the Penal Code still his conviction under section 381 of the Penal Code is quite maintainable as the petitioner was fully aware of the nature of accusation against him and had the opportunity to meet the elements of offence punishable under section 381 of the Penal Code and he was not also prejudiced by conviction under section 381 of the Penal Code. <em>Mahbubul Alam vs State 41 DLR 7.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 237</strong>—Where an accused person is charged with one offence and it appears in evidence that he committed a different offence for which he might have been charged in respect of a single act or series of acts, then, subject to absence of prejudice, the accused may be convicted of the offence, which he is shown to have committed although he was not charged with it. <em>Parveen vs State 51 DLR 473.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 237</strong>—The trial Court committed gross mistake in passing sentence under different penal provisions with which the convicted accused persons were not even charged with. <em>Alam vs State 54 DLR 298.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 237</strong>—Law is well settled that if an offence under a section is proved though not charged the accused can be convicted for the offence proved on the strength of the provision of section 237 of The Code. <em>State vs Ershad Au Sikder 56 DLR 305.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 237 and 238</strong>—Appellate Court can alter the conviction for other offence for which no charge was made. <em>Jahangir Hossain vs State 40 DLR 545.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 238</strong>—An offence to be a minor offence to a major one must be a cognate offence to the major one, having the main ingredients in common. <em>State vs Sree Ranjit Kumar Pramanik 45 DLR 660.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 238</strong>—An offence under section 342 of the Penal Code which is not included in the schedule of the Special Powers Act cannot be the basis of conviction as the same is a non-schedule offence. Had the original offence charged been one under Penal Code then the learned Judges by application of section 238 of the Penal Code could come to a finding that the offence constitutes a minor offence and in that view could have convicted the appellant under a minor offence, but here the original offence charged was exclusively triable by the Special Tribunal and in that view the alteration of the conviction from a schedule offence to an offence which is only referable under Penal Code is not legally permissible. <em>Abdur Rahman vs State 51 DLR (AD) 33.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 238(2)</strong>—It is true that no charge was framed against the accused under section 25B(2) but in view of the provisions of section 29 of the Special Powers Act and sub-section (2) of section 238 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, he may be convicted under sub-section (2) of section 25B of the Special Powers Act, 1974. <em>Shamsul Haque vs State 49 DLR 528.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 239</strong>—Mis-joinder of charges— Validity of trial—In a case where it is found that the trial is vitiated by misjoinder, then in the eye of law there has been no valid trial and therefore an accused cannot be acquitted after setting aside conviction. <em>State vs Constable Lal Mia 44 DLR (AD) 277.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 239</strong>—Joinder of charges—Sameness of transaction—Circumstances which must bear on the determination whether certain acts or events constitute a single transaction in each individual case are proximity of time, proximity of place, continuity of action and community of purpose or design. Which factor or factors shall be given relative importance depends on the facts of each case. State vs Constable Lal Mia 44 DLR (A D) 277.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 239 &amp; 537</strong>—Sameness of transaction—Defect—If there is good evidence that the transaction was one and the same, then mere absence of certain links in the accusation will not make the trial illegal. If at all it is a defect which is curable under section 537 CrPC. <em>State vs Constable Lal Mia 44 DLR (AD) 277.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 241, 241A</strong>—Forgery—fabrication of bank record taking recourse to forgery and using the same as genuine by deceitful means for taking pecuniary advantage for themselves and for others—Prima facie case made out against the accused—Order of discharge of the accused (Shafiqul Islam) shows total non-application of judicial mind of the Special Judge to the materials on record. Provision of section 241A is to be strictly followed. An order of discharge can be made only when no case is made out against the accused. <em>State vs Shafiqul Islam 40 DLR 310.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 241A</strong>—Magistrate cannot discharge accused persons on the plea of alibi that they were at different places at the time of commission of offences alleged by the prosecution—Magistrate’s “finding” in this regard is based on no evidence. Mere submission of some papers supporting alibi is neither sufficient nor admissible as the stage of adducing defence evidence was not yet come. Magistrate’s order of discharge was not sustainable as it was based on gross misconception of law. <em>Nannu Gazi vs Awlad Hossain  43 DLR (AD) 63.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 241A</strong>—This provision casts a duty on the Judge to discharge the accused when there is no ground for proceeding with the case and his order must record reasons therefor. <em>HM Ershad vs State 45 DLR 533.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 241A</strong>—Trial Court has a wide power regarding framing of charge. This cannot be interfered with lightly either by the revisional court or the appellate Court. <em>Forhad Hossain vs State 50 DLR 337.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 241A</strong>—At the stage of framing the charge the Magistrate is to consider documents of the prosecution and not those of the defence which could form part of the record after the charge is framed. Additional Sessions Judge on consideration of some documents produced by the accused opposite party before him came to the conclusion that the charge was groundless. Accused opposite party could not produce such document before the trial begins and the learned Additional Sessions Judge was not justified in considering those documents to pass the impugned order. Additional Sessions Judge acted illegally in passing the impugned order relying upon the documents filed by the accused-opposite party for the first time before him. <em>Mahbuba Akter vs Mozemmel Hoque 47 DLR 404.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 241A</strong>—The time of producing defence alibi is during the trial and after the prosecution has adduced its own evidence and they must be given a chance to prove their case. <em>Jalaluddin Bhuiyan vs Abdur Rouf 51 DLR 408.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 241A &amp; 164</strong>—To frame a charge or to consider an application of the accused person that the charge brought against him is groundless trial Court is not obliged to consider the statements of any witness recorded under section 164 CrPC. <em>Forhad Hossain vs State 50 DLR 337.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 241A and 242</strong>—Court is to record the reasons for discharging the accused under section 241A of the Code, but no such reasons are required to be recorded in farming charge against the accused as per provisions of section 242 of the Code. The Special Judge framed charge against the accused-petitioner after hearing both the parties and being satisfied that there was ground for framing of charge. No illegality in framing of charge against the accused-petitioner and there is no ground of setting aside the impugned order. <em>Amanullah vs State 62 DLR 382.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 241A, 265B &amp; 265C</strong>—The Sessions Judge is directed to allow the Advocates of the accused to go through the papers and documents upon which the prosecution will rely for framing charges in the case. <em>Hossain Mohammad Ershad [former President Lieutenant General (Rtd)] vs State 48 DLR 95.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 241A &amp; 439A</strong>—The accused-petitioner, if he would have felt aggrieved, against the order passed by the Magistrate framing charge against him, could have invoked the jurisdiction of the Sessions Judge under section 439A for the relief. The inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Division has been wrongly invoked. <em>Rustom All Matubbar alias Alam vs Mohammad Salahuddin 50 DLR 301.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 241A &amp; 265C</strong>—অভিযোগ গঠন বিষয়ে শুনানীর সময় আসামীর দাখীলী প্রমাণ তথা দলিল পত্র বিবেচনা করা যায় না এবং তার ভিত্তিতে আসামীর বিরদ্ধে মামলা বাতিল করা যায় না । <em>Nazrul Islam vs State 50 DLR 103.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 241A, 265C &amp; 561A</strong>—An accused can only prefer an application under section 561A for quashing the proceeding if he becomes previously unsuccessful in his application either under section 265C or 241A, otherwise his application for quashing shall be premature.<br/><br/>Section 265C speaks of discharge of an accused in a trial before Court of Sessions. Section 241A speaks of discharge in a trial by a magistrate. These sections indicate that when an accused is brought for trial before a Court of law the Court upon hearing the parties and on consideration of the record of the case and the documents may discharge the accused. These sections have nothing to do with quashing of a proceeding. Section 561A is an independent inherent power of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court and this power can be exercised in case of abuse of process of Court and for securing the ends of justice and or to give effect to any order under the Code ref. <em>Latifa Akhter vs State 51 DLR (AD) 159.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 241A, 439, 439A and 561A</strong>—Even a party unsuccessful in a revision before the Sessions Judge may invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. <em>Matiur Rahman vs Nuru Sikdar 56 DLR 246.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 241A &amp; 242</strong>—The trying Magistrate is required to exercise his own independent judgment and to see whether there is a prima facie case to proceed with the trial. The report of the judicial Magistrate cannot be binding on the trying Magistrate. <em>Abul Ahsan Joardar vs Kazi Misbahul Alam 45 DLR 606.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 241A &amp; 242</strong>—The trial Court has a wide power to frame charges and this cannot be interfered with by the Revisional Court by way of giving direction for altering a charge or framing a charge. <em>Sharful Islam vs Billal Hossain and the State 45 DLR 722.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 241A &amp; 242</strong>—The Court has jurisdiction to pass an order of discharge if it was satisfied that the charge was groundless for which it was to give reasons but if it framed charge it was not required of the Court to record reasons. <em>HM Ershad vs State 45 DLR 533.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 242</strong>—Consideration of the statements made under section 161 CrPC while framing of charge or otherwise is a necessary part of the Court’s duty. <em>HM Ershadvs State 45 DLR 533.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 242</strong>—Consideration of the statements made under section 161 CrPC while framing of charge or otherwise is a necessary part of the Court’s duty. <em>Saber Ahmed vs Manzur Mia 35 DLR 213 &amp; State vs Md Safikul Islam 40 DLR 310 relied. NM Ershad vs State 45 DLR 533.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 243 and 537</strong>—Violation of the mandatory requirements of section 243 in recording the individual statements of the accuseds either in their language or in words as nearly as expressed by them is not curable by Section 537. Conviction and sentence are not sustainable in law accordingly. <em>Ali Newaj Bhuiyan vs State 40 DLR 398.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 243 &amp; 537</strong>—The alleged admission of guilt was not recorded as nearly as possible in the words used by the accused. Section 243 CrPC is mandatory, the violation of which causes prejudice to the accused and is not curable under section 537 CrPC. The order of conviction and sentence as against the appellant on the basis of such so-called admission of guilt cannot therefore be sustained in law and the same should therefore be set aside in the interest ofjustice and the case should be sent back on remand to the trial Court to hold that trial afresh from the stage of framing the accusation or charge again after hearing the parties and considering the materials on record in accordance with the law in the light of the observations made above. <em>Saheb Ali Miah vs State 46 DLR 238.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 245(1)</strong>—The prosecution having not taken any steps the learned Magistrate rightly acquitted the respondents under section 245(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. <em>Mobarak Ali vs Mobaswir Ali 49 DLR (AD) 36.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 247</strong>—The Magistrate had no reason to adjourn hearing of the case as neither the complainant or his advocate appeared and took any steps whatsoever. The Magistrate was therefore bound to acquit the respondent. <em>Ayub Ali Bangali vs Mia Manir Ahmed 46 DLR 330.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 247</strong>—Summons must be issued for securing the attendance of the accused on the day appointed for hearing of the case. <em>Shajib vs Md Abdul Khaleque Akand 51 DLR (AD) 119.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 247</strong>—Interpretation of Statute— Words “Summons” and “Warrant”—Meaning of —Whether they convey different meanings though they are different modes of process to compel appearance—Whether there is scope to interpret the “summons” to include “warrant”— Court cannot put a word in legislation which is not there. <em>Hazi Hafez vs Abdul Mobud 41 DLR 321.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 247</strong>—Section 247 CrPC shall apply to a case in which summons has been issued on complaint and shall not apply to a case in which warrant has been issued though on complaint. <em>Hazi Hafez vs Abdul Mabud 41 DLR 321.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 247, Proviso</strong>—Complainant petitioner a Deputy Attorney-General of Bangladesh Government, busy with official matters could not present himself in the Court of Magistrate and pray for adjournment. His witnesses were examined and cross-examined but no adjournment was given though the petitioner was entitled to such privilege. His petition was not rejected but simply stated therein “Not admitted”;<br/><br/><strong>Held</strong>—The Magistrate’s order is not sustainable in law. <em>Sultan Ahmed vs Golam Mostofa 41 DLR 219.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 247</strong>—Appraisal of evidence—Complainant petitioner’s evidence was discredited because, in the opinion of the Magistrate, he had not filed any GD entry about the incident alleged by him.<br/>Held—This is not necessary at all in law. S<em>ultan Ahmed vs Golam Mostofa 41 DLR 219.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 247</strong>—Learned Magistrate did not base his finding on proper appreciation of evidence on record and was rather biased against the petitioner for reasons not known. <em>Sultan Ahmed vs Golam Mostafa 41 DLR 219.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 247</strong>—Applicability of section 247 CrPC—Case to be originated from a petition of complaint and summons to be issued following the complaint—But warrant was issued in the present complaint case and the necessary condition such as issuance of summons for the application of the section is absent—After amendment there is no distinction between summons case and warrant case at the trial stage. <em>Hazi Hafez Md Shamsul Islam vs Abdul Mabud 41 DLR 321.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 247</strong>—Acquittal—Accused present but complainant absent in Court—complainant filed an application for adjournment through his advocate—No order was passed by the Magistrate on the adjournment application—He acquitted the accused of all charges—The order of acquittal was not in keeping with law. <em>Md Musa Khan vs Farookh Hossain 42 DLR 257.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 247</strong>—A complaint case ought not to be dismissed for non-appearance of the complainant on an adjourned date unless his attendance in the court is specially required on that date or unless the Court is convinced that the complainant is not keen about prosecuting his case. <em>A Jabber Howlader vs Ali Akbar Howlader and State 52 DLR 329.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 247</strong>—It is necessary for the Magistrate before dismissing the complaint to see whether the complainant had been dilatory in the prosecution of the case or not. <em>GM Morshed vs City Bank Ltd 56 DLR 205.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 247</strong>—Power to dismiss the case is undoubtedly there when the complainant is found absent but that power must be exercised judicially and it must be seen and considered having regard to the circumstances of a given case. <em>Tofael Ahmed vs Chand Mia, State 56 DLR 614.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 247</strong>—When evidence was closed, statement under section 342 CrPC was recorded after due examination of the accused and the case reached the stage of argument, acquittal of the accused under section 247 CrPC was not proper judicial exercise of the power. <em>Tofael Ahmed vs Chand Mia, State 56 DLR 614.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 247 and 403</strong>—Acquittal under section 247 CrPC will bar fresh complaint or trial under section 403 CrPC. <em>Tofael Ahmed vs Chand Mia, State 56 DLR 614.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 247 &amp; 403</strong>—Acquittal of the accused under section 247 CrPC is not an acquittal within the meaning of section 403 of the Code and cannot bar a fresh prosecution. <em>Gadahar Namadas vs Joytun Akhtar 7 DLR 31</em><em>4</em><em>3.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 247(2)</strong>—It was for the Magistrate to ascertain before dismissing the petition of complaint whether the complainant was notified properly or whether she took delay dalling tactics in order to harass the accused inspite of receipt of notice issued by the court. <em>Nabiran Bibi vs Md Panna Miah 52 DLR 394.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 249, 339C(4) &amp; 403</strong>—Fresh proceeding on self-same facts against the same accused persons after a proceeding is stopped and the accused is released—When a proceeding is stopped without a judgment either of acquittal or of conviction and the accused is released, it does not operate either as acquittal or discharge—the same proceeding is not revivable unless there is legislative intent to that effect. Section 339C(4) was inserted providing for revival within 90 days those proceedings of which trial was stopped—In the present case, more than 90 days having elapsed before the Ordinance came into force and revival of the proceeding being out of question, there was no legal bar against fresh prosecution on same allegations. Taking cognizance for the second time must however depend on facts and related considerations of each case—Fresh cognizance should not be taken where there is default in taking revival proceeding without sufficient cause. <em>Niamat Ali Sheikh vs Begum Enayetur Noor 42 DLR (AD) 250.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 250</strong>—The Assistant Sessions Judge acted beyond jurisdiction in making the impugned order under section 250 CrPC as the offence under section 382 Penal Code is triable by Court of Sessions, and not by a Magistrate. The offence under section 382 of the Penal Code being triable by a Court of Sessions and not by a Magistrate the Assistant Sessions Judge acted beyond his jurisdiction in making the impugned order inasmuch as, provisions of section 250 of the Code of Criminal Procedure do not relate to an offence which is not triable by the Magistrate. <em>Karimdad vs Abul Hossain 40 DLR 441.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 250</strong>-Section 250 CrPC empowers only a Magistrate to invoke the said provisions while trying a case by him he finds that the accusations are false and either frivolous or vexatious and the same does not empower an Asstt. Sessions Judge. <em>Karimdad vs Abul Hossain 40 DLR 441.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 265A</strong>—ln sessions cases of this nature it is the Public Prosecutor who represents the State as provided under section 265A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In such cases the role of an Investigation Officer is that of a witness. If such an application is to be filed it ought to have been filed through the Public Prosecutor. <em>Rahmatullah vs State 48 DLR 158.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 265B</strong>—From a scrutiny of this section it does not appear that the section requires the actual production of documents before the court. <em>Securities and Exchange Commission vs Abu Tyeb 55 DLR (AD) 47.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 265B, 265C, 265D &amp; 265E</strong>— Sections 265B, 265C, 265D and 265E form a composite session and steps to be taken under these sections are to be taken in the same session. No question arises of fixing another date for taking steps under section 265C or of separate hearing under section 265C of the Code. <em>Securities and Exchange Commission vs Abu Tyeb 55 DLR (AD) 47.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 265C</strong>—ln discharging an accused under section 265C of the Code, the Court is obliged to record the reasons for so doing, which reasons should be reasonable. <em>Ferdousi Islam vs Nur Mohammad Kha 54 DLR 418.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 265C</strong>—The admitted position is that the respondent was the Chairman of the Company and she was never involved in the business of stock brokerage—In the absence of any allegation in the complaint-petition, the High Court Division rightly discharged the respondent from the charge. <em>Securities and Exchange Commission, represented by its Chairman vs Runa N Alam 57 DLR (AD) 161.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 265C</strong>—The accused has no scope to have any shelter under Section 265C of the Code since a prime facie case has already been disclosed against him. <em>Md Lokman @ Lokman vs State 63 DLR (AD) 156.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 265C, 241A &amp; 202(2B)</strong>—Discharge under the provisions of these sections is of different character than the discharge of the accused under sub-section (2B) of section 202 where discharge is made before taking of the cognizance. In our view there is no scope for making further enquiry after discharge if the accused under sections 241A or 265C of the Code as the same is made after taking cognizance. Moreover at the time of hearing under section 241A or under section 265C the court considers the record of the case, the documents submitted therewith and the submissions made by both parties. So, all necessary materials are before the court and as the order is passed on consideration of all such materials, there is no scope for passing any order for holding further inquiry. But there is scope for further enquiry when accused is discharged under the provision of sub-section (2B) of section 202 of the Code as the said order is made before taking of the cognizance. <em>Abdul Hai vs State 50 DLR 551.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 265C and 265D</strong>—While framing charge against the accused the trial Court is to apply independent judicial mind to the facts and circumstances of the case and the materials on record, particularly the First Information Report, so as to be satisfied that innocent persons are not harassed unnecessarily. <em>Khandaker Md Moniruzzaman vs State 47 DLR 341.</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sections 265C, 265D &amp; 439</strong>—High Court Division under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure having supervisory jurisdiction can scrutinise and go into facts to examine the propriety of the orders passed under section 265C or 265D of the Code. <em>Jobaida Rashid vs State, represented by the Deputy Commissioner; Dhaka 49 DLR 373.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 265C &amp; 265D</strong>—Sections 265C and 265D are abridged substitutions of the now repealed chapter XVIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure and these cast a duty upon the Sessions Judge to apply his judicial mind in considering the materials collected by the prosecution in order to come to a decision whether charge should be framed. <em>Jobaida Rashid vs Stale, represented by the Deputy Commissioner; Dhaka 49 DLR 373.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 265C, 265D &amp; 221-223</strong>—আসামী পক্ষ থেকে মামলা অব্যাহতি দেয়ার জন্নে কোন দরখাস্ত দেয়া হোক বা না হোক আসামীর বিররদ্ধে অভিযোগ গঠন করা হবে কি না সে সম্পর্কে ২৬৫ সি ও ২৬৫ ডি ধারার বিধান অনুযায়ী দায়রা আদালত তথা যে কোন ট্রাইবুনালের দায়িত্ব হচ্ছে  উপরোক্ত বিষয় বিবেচনা করে এবং পদক্ষের বক্তব্য শুনে সঠিক সিদ্ধান্ত উপনীত হওয়া । শুধুমাত্র এজাহারে নাম উল্লেখ থাকলে এবং আসামীর বিরুদ্ধে পুলিশ অভিযোগপত্র দাখিল করলে বা অভিযোগের দরখাস্তে আসামীর নাম উল্লেখ থাকলেই তার বিরুদ্ধে যান্ত্রিক ভাবে অভিযোগ গঠন করা সমীচীন নয় । <em>Nazrul Islam vs State 50 DLR 103.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 265C &amp; 561A</strong>—We do not find any reason to quash the instant criminal case by involving our inherent jurisdiction under section 561A CrPC as the Code under section 265C provides for an alternative remedy. <em>Salahuddin vs State 51 DLR 299.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 265C &amp; 265D</strong>—The Tribunal without considering the facts and circumstances and materials on record and applying its judicial mind to the provisions of section 265C and 265D of the Code of Criminal Procedure framed charge mechanically. The impugned order framing charges against the accused is thus liable to be set aside. <em>Ruhul Amin Kha vs State 56 DLR 632.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 265C and 435/439</strong>—The order of the Additional Sessions Judge discharging the accused is not based on correct appreciation of the facts disclosed in the first information report and charge-sheet, and therefore, it suffers from illegality. <em>Abdur Rahman Kha vs Stale 56 DLR 213.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 256C and 265D</strong>—The provisions of section 265C and 265D are mandatory. A duty is cast upon the Court to scrutinise the record and the document submitted there before discharging or framing a charge in a case as the case may be. Just because name of a particular person is mentioned in the FIR or charge-sheet is not sufficient to frame charge against him or frame charge mechanically so that innocent person may not be harassed on false and vexatious allegations. <em>Debobrota Baiddya Debu vs State 58 DLR 71.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 265C &amp; 561A</strong>—Procedural law is generally applied retrospectively, hi the cases here neither cognizance has been taken nor charge framed.

The plea of the accused is nothing but the defence plea. Be that as it may, the proposition of law is now well settled that on the basis of defence plea or materials the criminal proceedings should not be stifled before trial, when there is aprimafacie case for going for trial. <em>Shamsul Alam vs State 60 DLR 677.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 265D</strong>—Statements made under sections 164 and 161 CPC are documents on record within the meaning of section 265D. <em>State vs Auranga @ KM Hemayatuddin 46 DLR 524.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 265E and 412</strong>—There is no bar to the acceptance of the plea of guilty, even cases involving capital punishment or imprisonment for life—But no conviction should normally be based on the plea of guilty. The practice has been that the plea of guilty in such cases is not usually accepted. It is desirable for the Court to record the evidence and judge the case in the light of the evidence so recorded. <em>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman @ Razibulla vs State 58 DLR 393.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 265E and 412</strong>—An accused person who pleads guilty and is convicted has no right of appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence. ‘Where the facts alleged by the prosecution do not amount to an offence, the plea of guilty of an accused cannot stand in the way of his acquittal and section 412 of the Code cannot bar an appeal from his conviction. <em>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman @ Razibulla vs State 58 DLR 393.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 265G</strong>—The mere fact that witnesses examined were not mentioned in the FIR is no ground for disbelieving them. <em>Siraj Mal vs State 45 DLR 688.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 265G &amp; 37</strong>—Submission of sentence for confirmation—the order of conviction under section 302 Penal Code by the Sessions Judge on the basis of part of the evidence recorded by an Assistant Sessions Judge, who is not competent to hold trial under that sections is illegal. The death reference is rejected and the case is sent back for re-trial of the condemned- prisoner in accordance with law and in the light of observations made. <em>State vs Imdad Au Bepari 42 DLR 428.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 288 [omitted by Ordinance XLIX of 1978]</strong>—Two ways of making the previous recognition of the accused admissible in evidence. Rules stated in <em>1925 AIR (All) 223</em> have been relied on by the State (Respondent).<br/>One way, being by putting in his statement before the committing Magistrate under section 288 CrPC and “The other method is to elicit from the witness at the trial a statement that he identified certain persons at the jail and that the persons whom he there identified were persons whom he had seen taking part in the dacoity. <em>Ratan Kha vs State 40 DLR 186.</em><br/><br/>—Principle of identification of an accused by witness in dock when there was a previous TI parade—Circumstances when a witness cannot possibly identify the accused in dock stated. Ratio decidendi in <em>1925 AIR (All) 223</em> approved. We are in respectful agreement with the ratio decidendi reported in <em>1925 AIR (All) 223.</em><br/><br/>—It is well-settled that the evidence that a witness gives in the witness box is the substantive evidence and it is always desirable that the witness should be able to identify the accused persons in dock when there was a previous TI Parade, but owing to lapse of time and other compelling reasons it may not be possible for the witness to identify the accused persons in dock. <em>Ratan Kha vs State 40 DLR 186.</em><br/><br/>—Failure of witnesses to identify accused persons who are strangers to the witnesses— Identification if made without naming them Court’s duty to sift evidence in that circumstance—Any statement, express or implied, made by a witness identifying the accuseds but without naming them, it qualifies as substantive evidence—Test of. <em>Ratan Kha vs State 40 DLR 186.</em><br/><br/>—Improbable suggestion categorically denied by PWs.

This section of the Code provides that a person who earlier accepted the pardon may be tried for the offence in respect of which the pardon was tendered, if the Public Prosecutor certifies that in his opinion the person has either wilfully concealed anything essential or had given false evidence and has not complied with the condition on which the tender was made. This implies that the whole basis for the prosecution of a person to whom pardon has been tendered under section 337 or 338 of the Code for the offence in respect of which the pardon was tendered is a certificate by the Public Prosecutor that in his opinion the person who has accepted the pardon has either wilfully concealed anything essential or had given false evidences and has not complied with the condition on which the tender was made. <em>Angur vs State 41 DLR 66.</em><br/><br/>—Prosecution of approver who has not [complied with the condition on which pardon wasreceived. <em>Angur vs State 41 DLR 66.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 337, 338, 342 and 494</strong>—Unless the ditions are attached before allowing his application, it cannot be said that the accused has been legally pardoned for examining him as an accomplice. Therefore, attachment of terms of which he has been tendered is a condition precedent in allowing an application under section 338. <em>State vs Ershad Ali Sikder 56 DLR 185.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339B</strong>—The High Court Division did not give any finding on this point of circulation of the newspaper. Since it is a question of fact about the sufficiency or otherwise of circulation of the newspaper this cannot be raised at this stage. <em>State vs Anowar Hossain Pinto alias Anowar Hossain 61 DLR (AD) 108.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339(1)</strong>—The defects pointed out above are not cured by the provisions of the said section of the Code. Here in the present case before us the prosecutor who conducted the earlier sessions case in the 4th Court of Assistant Sessions Judge Mymensingh has not issued any certificate as required under sub-section (1) of section 339 CrPC and there is also no finding that the approver has broken the condition on which the pardon was tendered which is sine qua non for prosecuting an approver. In that view of the matter we are of the view that section 537 has no manner of application in this case. <em>Angur vs State 41 DLR 66.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339(1)</strong>—No material available to conclude that TI parade was conducted legally. Appellant entitled to benefit of doubt. From the materials on record it is also found that this appellant was produced before the Court on 4-6-78 for the first time and thereafter was produced in Court on various occasions before the holding of the TI Parade on 11-6-79 and definitely therefore, it was possible for the witnesses like PW 3 Joynal to see the appellant in Court. In such circumstances of the case the identification by PW 3 in the TI Parade is found to be quite unreliable and without any significance.  Furthermore, the Magistrate who conducted the TI Parade has not been examined during the trial. There is no material before the Court to find definitely that the TI parade was conducted legally and after observing legal formalities. In view of the above it is found that the identification of appellant Angur by PW 3 Joynal is very much unreliable and the appellant is entitled to the benefit of doubt. <em>Angur vs State 41 DLR 66.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339(1)</strong>—Conviction of the appellant who was identified by PW 3 who saw the appellant earlier while deposing as PW 7 in the case is not sustainable. <em>Angur vs State 41 DLR 66.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339(1)</strong>—Non-compliance of section 339(1) CrPC by the APP. In the present case before us the Assistant Public Prosecutor who conducted the case before the Assistant Sessions Judge, 4th Court, Mymensingh has not issued any certificate regarding his opinion as contemplated under sub-section (1) of section 339 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. <em>Angur vs State 41 DLR 66.</em><br/><br/>The petition for prosecuting the appellant (approver) by the successor APP cannot be termed as a certificate contemplated under section 339(1) of the Code. The Assistant Public Prosecutor who conducted the case before the Assistant Sessions Judge, 4th Court, Mymensingh filed a petition before the trial Court on 8-12-82 praying for the prosecution of the present appellant (Approver) as, according to him, the appellant has not fulfilled the conditions on which pardon was tendered and accepted. The learned Assistant Sessions Judge on the basis of this petition directed for framing charge against the appellant. This petition dated 8-12-82 and the petition dated 23-3-85 submitted by successor APP Mr. Khan at Kishoreganj cannot be termed as a certificate issued by the Public Prosecutor as contemplated under section 339(1) of the Code. <em>Angur vs State 41 DLR 66.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339(1)</strong>—Condition for tendering pardon—Enmity between the approver and the other two accused—Whether such pardon is a pardon on condition. Furthermore, from the perusal of the record it is found that as regards the condition for tendering pardon it is at best a pardon on the condition that the approver will speak the truth and in this case he has spoken the truth by saying that he implicated accused Jamir and Sattar as he had litigation and disputes with them and, on the other hand, none of the other witnesses said that accused Jamir and Sattar participated in the dacoity or were present there. <em>Angur vs State 41 DLR 66.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 339(1) &amp; 537</strong>—Certificate required under section 339(1) CrPC. If not complied with section 537 has no manner of application. The defects pointed out above are not cured by the provisions of the said section of the Code. Here in the present case before us the prosecutor who conducted the earlier sessions case in the 4th Court of Assistant Sessions Judge, Mymensingh has not issued any certificate as required under sub-section (1) of section 339 CrPC and there is also no Finding that the approver has broken the condition on which the pardon was tendered which is sine qua non for prosecuting an approver. In that view of the matter, we are of the view that section 537 has no manner of application in this case. <em>Angur vs State 41 DLR 66.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339(1)(2)(3)(4)(6)</strong>—Time for disposal of criminal cases—”Working days” mean “working days of a particular Judge or a Magistrate” and not the “working days of a particular Court”. <em>Aminul Huq vs State 40 DLR 144.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339B</strong>—Frequent adjournment of criminal trial—Court’s duly in the matter— Disinterested witnesses are losing interest to appear before the Court to avoid harassment of going to court again and again. It is desirable in the interest of administration of justice that witnesses be summoned on a day when the Court is in a position to examine them. No adjournment at the instance of any party should be allowed causing inconvenience to witnesses. Practice of adjourning criminal trial frequently on the prayer of the defence in spite of appearance of prosecution witnesses on the ground of absence of any accused overlooking provision of section 339B CrPC is contrary to law and should be discontinued. <em>Mahbubur Rahman Khan vs State 45 DLR</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339B</strong>—Accused facing trial on capital charge—Entitled to be defended by a lawyer even if the trial is held in absentia— Court’s responsibility to appoint a lawyer to defend—Section 339B CrPC does not come in conflict with the rule of PR Manual—Cardinal principle of criminal administration of justice stated. <em>State vs Jahaur Ali 42 DLR 94.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339B</strong>—The appellants were tried in absentia although they were in custody in connection with another case and not produced in the present case for no fault of their own. In such a position prayer for fresh trial is not entertainable. <em>Muslim vs State 47 DLR 185.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339B, sub-section (1)</strong>—Failure to publish the order in at least one Bengali daily news-paper is violative of the provision of section 339B CrPC and also of principle of natural justice. <em>Moktar Ahmed vs Hazi Farid Alam 42 DLR 162.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 339B(2) &amp; 512</strong>—Since section 339B(2) provides for absentia trial, section 512 has no application in the case of an accused who appeared before the court but thereafter absconded. <em>Baharuddin vs State 47 DLR 61.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C</strong>—Provisions of this section s not merely a procedural law. It is a law vesting the accused with a right which could not be taken away by a subsequent amendment if the law. <em>Abu Sufian vs State 45 DLR 610.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C</strong>—Section 29 of the Special Powers Act makes the Code of Criminal Procedure applicable to the proceedings of the Special Tribunal—the time-limit imposed by section 339C CrPC will also apply to the procee-dings of Special Tribunal. <em>Chand Miah vs State 42 DLR 97</em>.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C</strong>—”Working days” for disposal of criminal cases—stopping proceedings for release of the accused—”Working lays” of the Court—”Working days” shall bç understood to mean the “Working days” during which the learned judge will hold the charge of the trial Court—A Division Bench of the High Court Division rightly excluded the period of 53 days from the statutory period for the trial s the Additional District Judge held the charge of the District and Sessions Judge for 53 days which were not treated as “Working days” for the trial Court. The application for quashing the proceedings rightly rejected. <em>Abul Kashem vs State 40 DLR (AD) 97.</em><br/> <br/>Section 339C read with Ordinance No. 37 of 1983 (coming into force on 8-8-1983 extending the time-limit upto 30-6-1985 in his case and later on fmally upto 30-9-1985) Charge-sheet was submitted on 16-6-83 before SDM who in due course forwarded the record to the Sessions Judge for trial. The case comes within the ambit of the lime limit of the Ordinance No. 37 of 1983 which was intended to save such trials. Construction put to the Ordinance by the HC Division is not correct to conclude that this case is “not pending” on the date of commencement of the Ordinance. <em>State vs Madhu Mridha 40 DLR (AD) 99.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C</strong>—Concluding a trial beyond time—The Sessions Judge having received the case for disposal on 8-12-84 and delivered his judgment on 29-9-87 long after the expiry of the stipulated time for disposal of the case the trial was without jurisdiction and the conviction illegal in view of the provision of section 339C. <em>Abdul Quddus vs State 44 DLR 441.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C</strong>—The provision of this section does not show legislative intention to permit exclusion of the days of adjournment taken by the defence or non-production of the accused in a case on the ground of illness. <em>Motiar Rahman vs State 47 DLR 593.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C, 339D(b)</strong>—Section 339C and 339D(b) of the Code are inconsistent with the provision of section 8 of the Ordinance and due to this inconsistency these two provisions 339C and 339D(b) are not applicable in the cases revived under the Ordinance. “Working days” of the Court as provided in section 339D(b) cannot be brought into the ambit of section 8 of the Ordinance. The provisions of section 8 provided that trial of such cases must be concluded within two years from the date of commencement of the Ordinance. In the present case it appears that the case was revived on 17-2- 87 and in view of the provision of section 8 the trial ought to have been concluded within 20-1- 87. But the trial Court failed to conclude the trial within that period and when the petitioner approached the court for stopping the proceeding his prayer was rejected applying the section 339D(b). But in view of the above the provision of section 339D(b) has no manner of application. <em>Abdul Nur Mehidi vs State 46 DLR 303.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C(6)(b)</strong>—The trial could not be held for 26 working days of the Tribunal as the accused after being released on bail remained absent. The absence is on his own peril and he cannot take advantage of his own wrong so as to ask for deduction of 26 working days. <em>Humayun Kabir vs State 46 DLR 410.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C</strong>—Non-working days of a particular judge for reasons beyond his control like unsuitable working condition in the Court room should be excluded while computing the working days<em>. Abdul Motaleb Shaque vs State 47 DLR 24.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C</strong>—The days on which the case was adjourned due to default of the accused should not be considered as working days, otherwise it will be easy for the accused to stretch the trial beyond the statutory period. <em>Abdul Motaleb Shaque vs State 47 DLR 24.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 339C</strong>—The whole purpose of unamended section 339C was to whip up the prosecution and activise the trial Court so as not to delay the trial of a case unnecessarily. <em>Abdul Wadud vs Slate 48 DLR (AD) 6.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C</strong>—The Sessions Judge made a mistake in holding that after receipt of records of the case for trial in December 1988 by his predecessor, a fresh period of 270 days will start for him to complete the trial since he had taken charge of the Sessions Division in January 1991. Section 339C referred to an office, not a person. <em>Abdul Wadud vs State 48 DLR (AD) 6.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C, 339D(b)</strong>—Section 339C and 339D(b) of the Code are inconsistent with the provision of section 8 of the Ordinance and due to this inconsistency these two provisions 339C and 338D(b) are not applicable in the cases revived under the Ordinance. <em>Abdul Nur Mehedi vs State 46 DLR 303.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 339C(1)(4)(6), 435 and 439</strong>— Section 339C(4) does not provide for abating any case nor does it provide for acquittal of the accused but merely provides for stopping the trial of the case and releasing the accused’ person— Impugned order by the learned Magistrate suffers from manifest illegality as only 22 days out of 30 extended days have passed—339C(6) provides for counting of working days in determining the time for disposal of cases. <em>Sultan Ahmed vs Golam Mostafa 40 DLR 85.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C(2)(3)(4)(6)</strong>—Time for completion of trial of Sessions case within the statutory period of 270 days including the extended time— Case pending before the sessions Judge, Narail since 12-12-1985—After examination of one witness the petitioner filed a petition under section 339C(4) of the Code for release of the accused petitioner on he ground that the specified period of 240 lays and extended time of 30 days totalling 270 working days for trial of the accused petitioner had already elapsed—Dictionary meaning of the word is not a safe guide for interpreting an expression in a statute—Calculation sheet showed that more than 361 working days of the court had passed from 12-12-85 to 30-3-87 and the number of 361 days excluded only holidays and Fridays but not the days during which the Sessions Judge could not sit in court when the Court was open— “Working days” shall be interpreted as ‘working days” of the Judge and not of the Court—Non- working days of a particular Judge for reasons beyond his control should be excluded from the “working days” when counted. <em>Ekramul Hoq vs State 40 DLR 139.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C(4)</strong>—It was incumbent upon the Special Tribunal to allow the accused to go on bail when it could not complete the trial within the time provided. <em>RaJIq Hasan alias Biplob vs State represented by the Deputy Commissioner 48 DLR  274.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 339C(4) &amp; 497</strong>—Besides inordinate delay in prosecuting the trial of the case and the provision of section 339C(4) of the Code, the fact that the appellant has been suffering from enlarged prostate gland and problems in his urinary track attracts the proviso to section 497 CrPC for consideration to enlarge the accused on bail. <em>Captain (Retd) Nurul Huda vs State 55 DLR (AD) 33.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 339C(4) and 498</strong>—Even in a non- bailable offence the accused is entitled to be enlarged on bail unless the Court decides otherwise assigning reasons which are relevant to the fact of the case. <em>Captain (Retd) Nurul Huda vs State 55 DLR (AD) 33.</em><br/><br/><strong>Sections 339C(4) &amp; 498</strong>—The prosecution could not give plausible reason for inordinate delay in proceeding with the case—This circumstance can be considered as a ground for granting bail to an accused. <em>Captain (Retd) Nurul Huda vs State 55 DLR (AD) 33.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 339C(4) &amp; D</strong>—Revival of a case— By the use of expressions in an unambiguous manner the legislature has left absolutely no doubt that the limitation regarding making an application by the Government to the court for revival of the relevant case shallrun from the date on which the court concerned actually stopped the proceedings and not from the date on which the proceedings of the trial of the case should have been stopped. <em>AHM Kamaluddin vs State 43 DLR 294.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C, sub-section (6)</strong>—Criminal trial—”Working days” to be counted in determining the time for disposal of criminal cases— “Working days” mean the days on which a Judge works as such. So, the days when the learned Sessions Judge was on leave and outside the stations should not be regarded as “Working days” of the learned Sessions Judge. The court is of the opinion that these days should be excluded while computing the time required for disposal of the sessions case. This being the legal position 150 days did not expire in the present case and application for stopping of the proceeding of the sessions case and for release of the accused petitioners has rightly been rejected. <em>Akbar Au vs State 40 DLR 29.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339D</strong>—Revival of a case under section 339D. Under the scheme of the Code itself, the Public Prosecutor is competent to file application for revival of a ease on behalf of the Government without any authority or instruction whatsoever. <em>Dr SM Abu Taher vs State 42 DLR 138.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339D</strong>—The petitioner being the full brother of the deceased victim and a charge-sheet prosecution witness, is no doubt an aggrieved person and competent to file the application for revival of the case. <em>Abdus Sobhan vs Ali Akbar 47 DLR 598.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339D</strong>—A Public Prosecutor represents the State in a case “of which he has charge” which is under enquiry, trial or appeal. Any action taken by the Public Prosecutor in such a case particularly when a case has been stopped due to expiry of the time-limit (which law has since been repealed) will be deemed to be an action on behalf of the Government so long as the Government do not disown it. <em>Alimuddin vs State 49 DLR (AD) 118.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339D</strong>—Where a case is revived under section 339D(1) whether the statutory period of 240 days should be counted from the date the case was received by the trial Court after revival or from the date of revival? A careful examination of all the sub-sections of section 339D will show that the sub-section (5) of section 339D reconciles section 339D(4) with section 339C(2) by laying down in an unambiguous language that the starting point of computation of the statutory period in a case revived under section 339D(1) is the date of revival which, according to sub-section 5 of section 339D, is deemed to be dated on which the case is received for trial. <em>Belayet Hossain vs State 46 DLR 413.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339(4)</strong>—Working days should be understood to mean actual working days during which the learned Judge holds the Court. <em>Nurul Islam Monzoor vs State 53 DLR 59.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 339(4)</strong>—There is no absolute direction to allow bail, even in case of failure to complete the trial within the statutory period, as the mandate, if any, for allowing bail is subjected by the words, “unless for reasons to be recorded in writing, the Court otherwise directs”. <em>Nurul Islam Monzoor vs State 53 DLR 59.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 340</strong>—An Advocate to defend an undefended accused charged with capital offence should be appointed well in time to enable him to study the case and the lawyer should be of sufficient standing and able to render assistance. He should be provided with papers which are ordinarily allowed to the accused. The deficiencies as on the record are due to the appointment of State lawyer without giving him sufficient time to prepare the case. This has seriously prejudiced the accused persons and their defence was materially affected. The State defence lawyer could not to justice to the case of the absconding accused who have been sentenced to death. The impugned order of the learned Sessions Judge convicting and sentencing condemned-prisoner Hanif and convict Waliur to death under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code is set aside and they are directed to be tried of the charge already framed. The case is sent back on remand for fresh trial in the light of the observation made. <em>State vs Hanif Gani 45 DLR 400.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 340</strong>—The requirement of law is that irrespective of whether the accused is absconding or not he is as of right entitled to be represented and defended by a lawyer appointed by the court and the trial Court must ensure that it has been done before the commencement of the trial or else the trial and the resultant conviction and sentence would be vitiated. <em>Mobarak Ali vs Bangladesh 50 DLR 10.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 340</strong>—The condemned-prisoner was in custody and he was produced before the court from time to time but he was not represented by any lawyer of his choice. So it was the duty of the court to appoint a lawyer at the cost of the state to defend the condemned-prisoner as the offence was punishable with death. <em>State vs Rabiul Hossain alias Rob 52 DLR 370.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 340</strong>-Right of an accused to be defended by a lawyer in a case charged under section 302 of the Penal Code being punishable with death is, an inalienable right guaranteed in the law of our land and if any trial takes place refusing such fundamental right the trial is a misnomer and the judgment passed convicting an accused is no judgment in the eye of law. <em>Babu Khan vs State 55 DLR 547.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 340</strong>-Right of an accused to be defended by a lawyer in a case charged under section 302 of the Penal Code being punishable with death is an inalienable right guaranteed in the law of our land and if any trial takes place refusing such fundamental right, the trial is a misnomer and the judgment passed convicting an accused is no judgment in the eye of law. <em>Abdul Hannan vs State 61 DLR 713.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 340, 342, 343</strong>—A self-confessed accused may be treated as an approver but who does not participate in the criminal act along with others cannot be accepted as an accomplice. <em>State vs Ershad Ali Sikder 56 DLR 185.</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>Sections 340(1) &amp; 352</strong>—Any person accused of an offence before a Criminal Court, or against whom proceedings are instituted under this Code in any such Court, may of right be defended by a pleader. The law has not given any authority to the learned Sessions Judge to limit the appointment of lawyer by each accused. The order limiting the appointment of lawyer by each accused is absolutely without jurisdiction. Section 352 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the learned Judge of the court will consider the accommodation of the general public in the Court room. If one accused engages for himself one hundred lawyers, the lawyers are entitled to defend the accused and as regards sitting arrangement the Judge will control, but he cannot pass any order limiting the appointment of lawyer. <em>Hossain Mohammad Ershad [former President Lieutenant General (Retd) vs State 48 DLR 95.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 340(3)</strong>—As the accused has right to know about the prosecution’s evidence so the prosecution should have right to know about the accused’s evidence before trial. <em>Ali Akbar vs State 51 DLR 268.</em></div></div></div>

In such circumstances also the confessional statement cannot be used against the appellant. The trial court also should not state anything regarding any incriminating evidence against the appellant under section 342 CrPC. <em>Angur vs State 41 DLR 66.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—There being nothing on record to show that the main aspects of the confessional statement of the accused was brought to his notice he was certainly prejudiced and, as such, the statement could not be used against him. <em>Kabir vs State 45 DLR 755.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—The accused appellant was asked questions during statement under section 342 CrPC with the preconceived notion that he was already found guilty under sections 395/397 of the Penal Code. This type of questions being against all norms of procedure of criminal jurisprudence are highly prejudicial to the accused. <em>Abu Taleb vs State 41 DLR 239.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—No question relating to bloodstained cloth or injury in the hand was put to the condemned-prisoner. This circumstance has no basis to base conviction.<br/>It is surprising that though some of the PWs alleged to have seen the said blood-stained shirt, no attempt was made even by the police to seize the same and also to examine the said blood by any chemical examiner. Further, in the examination under section 342 CrPC no question relating to such blood-stained cloth or injury in the hand was put to the condemned-prisoner. So, this circumstance has no basis and the same has not been established at all by any reliable evidence. <em>State vs Badsha Mollah 41 DLR 11.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Provisions of section 342 having not been followed strictly, Exhibit 5, the confessional statement, was wrongly relied upon.<br/>Since the officer who conducted the test identification parade was not examined by the prosecution, the test identification report is not admissible in evidence.<br/>So far as accused appellant Amir Hossain is concerned since his confessional statement has not been mentioned in his examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he cannot be convicted relying upon his confessional statement.<br/>Since the prosecution can neither rely upon his confessional statement nor take advantage of the evidence of identifying witnesses there is no other legal evidence against accused Amir Hossajn to sustain his conviction under sections 395/397 of the Penal Code. <em>Amir Hossain vs State 41 DLR 32.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—A statement of the accused under section 342 CrPC is meant for giving him an opportunity to explain the circumstances appearing against him in the evidence adduced by the prosecution—This is entirely for the benefit of the accused and the accused only—This statement cannot be used by the Court against him, nor is the prosecution permitted to use it to fill up any gap left in the prosecution evidence. Relied on (1923) ILR Lah 50. <em>Shah Alam vs State 42 DLR (AD) 31.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—One of important items for linking up the accused with the crime, namely the sandal, was not at all put to the accused as a circumstance appearing in the case against him while he was examined under section 342 CrPC. <em>Mizazul Islam vs State 41 DLR (AD) 157.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—The trial Court failed to take into consideration along with evidence on record the accused’s written reply giving vivid description of the highhandedness of BDR personnel in support of their defence that they were implicated in the case at the instance of their rival businessmen. <em>Subodh Ranjan vs State 45 DLR 521.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Presence at the place and time of murder—reasonable doubt as to guilt—In his examination under section 342 CrPC, though all the evidence against him were brought to his notice to prove the charge of murder, accused Kashem did not explain away his presence with co-accused Abbas at the place and time of the murder to raise doubt in the mind of the Court about his guilt, not to speak of raising any reasonable doubt. <em>Abul Kashem vs State 42 DLR 378.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Allegation of torture made in statement recorded under section 342 CrPC—No reliance can be placed on the belated allegation of torture by police in obtaining confession in the absence of materials on record to substantiate the same. <em>Hazrat Ali &amp; Abdur Rahman vs State 42 DLR 177.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Conviction of co-accused who has not confessed—Circumstances show the accused Shahjahan Manik had intimacy with accused Rina and this put them on visiting terms and the visits had strengthened his intimacy with Rina. Their guilty conscience is also evident from the false plea in their statements made under section 342 CrPC that they did not know each other. <em>Shahjahan Manik vs State 42 DLR 465.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—The provision of this section is meant for giving the accused an opportunity to explain the circumstances appearing against him. There is no merit in the contention that the appellate Court acted illegally in relying on his statement under section 342. <em>Abdul Karim vs Shamsul Alam 45 DLR 578.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Omission to examine the accused under this section is not curable under section 537. After the prosecution closes its evidence the court shall examine the accused and ask them whether they will adduce any evidence in defence. Omission to do so vitiates the conviction if such omission has prejudiced the accused in their defence. The conviction is set aside and it is directed that the accused be examined under section 342 CrPC by the trial Court and thereupon the case be disposed of according to law. <em>A Gafur vs Jogesh Chandra Roy 43 DLR (AD) 62.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Non-mentioning of memo of TI parade, the basis of conviction of the accused appellant in his examination under section 342 CrPC, has definitely prejudiced him inasmuch as, in absence of the same he could not explain the matter showing his innocence. <em>Mizanur Rahman vs State 49 DLR 83.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—The only evidence of involvement of the accused appellants comes from their confessional statements, but during their examinaion under section 342 CrPC the confessional statements were not put up before them and they were denied the opportunities of offering any explanation on the same. This has prejudiced the appellants in their defence. <em>Abul Kashem vs State 49 DLR 573.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Nothing was put before the accused about the alleged confession while examining them under section 342 CrPC and for this non-compliance of the mandatory provision, the accused persons have been seriously prejudiced. <em>Abul Hossain vs State 46 DLR 77.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 342 &amp; 537</strong>—When confessional statement is found to be true and voluntary and it gets corroboration from some other evidence, the appellant had not been prejudiced for non- mentioning of his confession in his examination under section 342 CrPC. This irregularity or omission is curable under section 537 CPC in the facts of the case and the same has not vitiated the trial. <em>Abul Khayer vs State 46 DLR 212.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Non-mentioning of memo of TI parade, the basis of conviction of the accused appellant in his examination under section 342 CrPC, has definitely prejudiced him inasmuch as, in absence of the same he could not explain the matter showing his innocence thereto. <em>Mizanur Rahman vs State 49 DLR 83.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—The only evidence of involvement of the accused appellants comes from their confessional statements, but during their examination under section 342 CrPC the confessional statements were not put up before them and they were denied the opportunities of offering any explanation on the same. This has prejudiced the appellants in their defence. <em>Abul Kashem vs State 49 DLR 573.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—The trial Court is under an obligation to properly comply with the requirement of law so as to avoid any possible prejudice to the accused on this Count. <em>Nurul Alam Chowdhury vs State 125.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—The provision of section 342 CrPC has been codified providing opportunity to the accused to make out his case of innocence. As he was denied the right to present his case for no fault of his own, the accused was seriously prejudiced in his trial. The order of his conviction is quashed. <em>Shahidul vs State 51 DLR 222.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Incriminating circumstances appearing in the evidence of PW 1 complainant having not been pointed out to the accused he is likely to be gravely prejudiced in his defence. <em>Nibash Chandra vs Dipali Rani 52 DLR 87.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—This provision of law is intended for the benefit of the accused. The trial Court is under an obligation to properly comply with the requirement of law so as to avoid any possible prejudice to the accused on this count. <em>Nurul Islam Chowdhury vs State 52 DLR 397.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—The accused-appellant took some alibi in retraction petition but when he did not adduce any evidence in support of his alibi he did not discharge his burden to prove the alibi. <em>43 DLR (AD) 63, Nannu Gazi vs Awlad Hossain ref. Shahjahan vs State 53 DLR 268.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Incriminating evidence or circumstances sought to be proved by the prosecution must be put to the accused during examination under section 342 CrPC otherwise it would cause miscarriage of justice. <em>State vs Monu Miah 54 DLR (AD) 60.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Since the petitioner has admitted his guilt no examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is required while convicting and sentencing the accused on the basis of the same. <em>Jashimuddin vs State 56 DLR (AD) 223.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—The dying declaration, if be treated as true, cannot form the basis of conviction, as it was not referred to the accused while examined under section 342 of the Code. <em>Noor Hossain vs State 55 DLR 557.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—The examination of the accused under section 342 of the Code is not a mere formality it is the fundamental principle of law that the attention of the accused must be drawn to the evidence on record in a precise manner—Any dying declaration and confessional statement of any accused person must be stated to the accused to enable them to resist the case of prosecution. <em>State vs Kabel Molla 55 DLR 108.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Trial will not be vitiated if there is no question of prejudice due to any flaw in the examination under section 342 CrPC. <em>Zakir Hossain vs State 55 DLR 137.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Non-consideration of written statement and documents and papers in support of written statement by trial Judge and his absolute silence on those caused a prejudice of a grave nature to the convict. <em>Kazi Mahbubuddin Ahmed alias Mahbub vs State, represented by the DC, Dhaka 57 DLR 513.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Section 342 of the Code being a mandatory provision of procedural law the departure from the principles of the section causes grave prejudice to the accused. In this case the accused having not been given any opportunity to explain the circumstances, the order of their conviction is liable to be set aside. <em>Mohiruddin Mondal vs State 57 DLR 779.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—৩৪২ ধারার বিধান হচ্ছে সাক্ষীদের  আসামীর বিরুদ্ধে যে তথ্য প্রকাশ পায় তা বিচারক দ্বারা আসামীর দৃষ্টিগোচরে এনে তাকে তা ব্যাখ্যা করার সুযোগ দেয়ার জন্য তাকে প্রয়োজনীয় প্রশ্ন করা । আসামী দোষী কি নির্দোষী তা জিজ্ঞাসা করা উক্ত বিধানের উদ্দেশে নয় । <em>A</em><em>bdul Razzak Talukder vs State, represented by the Deputy Commissioner Barisal </em><em>51</em><em> DLR 83.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—যেহেতু আসামী পক্ষে বিজ্ঞ এডভোকেট ৩৪২ ধারায় আসামীকে একটি পূর্ণভাবে প্রশ্ন করা সম্পর্কে কোন প্রশ্ন উত্থাপন করেননি সে জন্নে আমরা ৩৪২ ধারায় আসামীকে প্রশ্ন করা ত্রুটিপূর্ণও বলে সে সম্পর্কে কোন সিদ্ধান্ত দেয়ার প্রয়োজনীয়তা দেখি না । তা ছাড়া আসামী ঘটনা সম্পূর্ণ অস্বীকার করে ছাফাই সাক্ষী দেয়ায় তদ্রুপ ত্রুটিপূর্ণ প্রশ্নের দ্বারা আসামী বিচারে ক্ষতিগ্রস্থ হয়েছে বলেও আমরা মনে করি না । <em>Abdul Razzak Talukder vs State, represented by the Deputy Commissioner, Barisal 51 DLR 83.</em><br/> <br/> <strong>Section 342</strong>—The accused retracted his confession during his examination under section 342 CrPC—Such belated retraction of confession always creates doubt about its genuineness. <em>State vs Mokammel Hyeath Khan 58 DLR 373.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—The essence of section 342 CrPC is to enable the accused to comprehend the allegations and evidences levelled against him for the purpose of affording him a good defence by bringing and pointing at only the incriminating materials that exist against him. He cannot be vexed with long series of questions. <em>Ibrahim vs State 58 DLR 598.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—It appears that while examining the accused-appellants under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the trial Court failed to put the incriminating evidence against the accused-appellants for the purpose of enabling them to explain any circumstance and thereby the accused-appellants have been prejudiced. <em>Shahid Mia vs State 60 DLR 371.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—It is well settled that at the time of examination of the accused under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure his attention must be drawn to the incriminating evidence or circumstances sought to be proved against him, otherwise he would be prejudiced (vide 54 DLR (AD) 60. <em>A Wahab vs State 60 DLR 34.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Written statement submitted by the appellant when he was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not evidence within the meaning of section 3 of the Evidence Act. Such statement is to be considered along with the evidence and the circumstances and if the statement gets support from the evidence on record due weight may be given on it. [Vide 42 DLR (AD) 31]. Thus such statement cannot be the sole basis of conviction. <em>Hasan Md vs State 60 DLR 56.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—It is the fundamental principle of law that the attention of the accused must be drawn to the evidence on record in a precise manner. <em>Kazi Ranimul Islam vs State 62 DLR 6.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342</strong>—Sending back the case on remand for fresh trial from the stage of the examination of the accused under section 342 of the Code for the purpose of bring the incriminating evidence including the confessional statement to the attention of the appellant cannot be taken as giving of undue privilege to the prosecution to fill up any lacuna. Rather, remand of the case to the trial Court is for removing a procedural defect only which was caused for non-application of the mind of the trial judge. If such type of procedural defect is not allowed to be cured and the accused is acquitted for such procedural defect that will cause great injustice to the informant side who brought the matter before the Court of law for justice. <em>Sohel Sanaullah @ Sohel Sanaullah vs State 63 DLR (AD) 105.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 342 &amp; 537</strong>—Omission of charge as to common intention—Non-mentioning of section 34, Penal Code during his examination under section 342 CrPC has not in any manner prejudiced the accused in their defence. It is a mere irregularity which is curable and there has been no failure of justice for such non-mentioning. <em>Abul Kashem vs State 42 DLR 378.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 342, 164 &amp; 537</strong>—Since the attention of the accused was not drawn to his confessional statement when he was examined under section 342, he is obviously prejudiced. Such defect is not curable under section 537 of the Code. <em>Abu Jamal vs State 51 DLR 57.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344</strong>—Stay of proceeding—In the facts of the case as in point of time the civil suit was instituted before the filing of the FIR and the questioned documents in their originals are yet to be produced and examined by the civil Court. The criminal proceeding, where the documents are claimed as forged, may, in the interest of justice, be stayed till the disposal of the civil suit. <em>Zakir Hossain vs State 43 DLR (AD) 102.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344</strong>-In view of the provisions of section 344 of the Code, it appears necessary that the trial of the CR Case No. 2969 of 2004, now pending in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, be postponed for a limited period facilitating the disposal of the OC Suit No. 110 of 2002 for Specific Performance of Contract based on Bainapatra dated 10-4-2001 between the parties. <em>Hanjf vs State 60 DLR 634.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344</strong>—Refusal of prayer for ad- interim stay while issuing Rule in criminal revision. When appellant clearly stated before the High Court Division while obtaining the Rule that she gave birth to a child just five months ago and it would be injurious to her health as also to the baby if both were to be placed under any type of custody at that critical stage it was not a judicious and sound exercise of discretion to refuse the said stay. <em>Azima Begum vs Yusuf Khan 43 DLR (AD) 53.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344</strong>-Prayer for stay of judgment in criminal case on the ground of pendency of civil suit—Section 344 CrPC authorises the Court to adjourn a trial. That a judgment in a criminal court is pronounced “after the termination of the trial” is provided in section 366 CrPC. Therefore, the prayer for stay of delivery of judgment under section 344 was misconceived. <em>HM Ershad vs State 44 DLR (AD) 145.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344</strong>-Power to postpone proceedings—Applicability of such power to postpone judgment in a criminal case pending disposal of a civil suit—The application under section 344 CrPC had been moved at a belated stage after the evidence was closed and the trial came to an end. Only because the judgment remains to be delivered, the application does not appear to be one as contemplated under section 344. In fact the petitioner knew of this and prayed for adjournment of the judgment, not of the trial. The application at this stage does not appear to be maintainable. <em>HM Ershad vs State 44 DLR 116.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344</strong>-Stay of criminal proceedings—Remand—A case and counter case over the self-same occurrence are to be tried by the same Court one after another. The judgment in both the cases is to be pronounced on the same date by the same Magistrate so that there is no conflicting decision and the parties are not prejudiced. The impugned judgment and order is set aside and the case remanded back to the Magistrate with direction to try CR Case No. 155 of 1989 and CR case No. 152 of 1989 by the same Magistrate giving opportunity to the parties to adduce their evidence and keeping the evidence already recorded in Cr Case No. 155 of 1989 intact. <em>Sharif vs Md Obaidur Rahman 43 DLR 66.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344</strong>-The custody spoken of is jail custody. The Magistrate can remand an accused person to custody for a term not exceeding 15 days at a time provided that sufficient evidence has been collected to raise a suspicion that the accused may have committed an offence. <em>Saifuzzaman vs State 56 DLR 324.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344</strong>—Stay of proceeding in criminal matter when not entertainable—The proceeding under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act appears to be quite independent in nature with a very limited scope for adjudication which is not at all related to the issues involved in the Civil Suit. Moreover, at the fag end of trial of the criminal case, such an application praying for stay order was not at all justified and entertainable. <em>Zafar Ahmed vs Mir Iftekharuddin 61 DLR 732.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344</strong>—Magistrate can make such order of remand in the absence of the accused if he is seriously ill and cannot be produced in Court. <em>Saifuzzaman vs State 56 DLR 324.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344</strong>—The accused had already been taken to police remand twice, yet there is nothing before the court to show the outcome of such remand—The respondents are directed not to go for further remand of the accused and in case of the ongoing remand he should not be subjected to physical torture of any kind. <em>Ministry of Home Affairs 56 DLR 620.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344</strong>—It is desirable that for ends of justice as well as to avoid any future complication all the counter-cases be tried by same Judge one after another which may not prejudice the parties. <em>Tareq Shamsul Khan alias Himu vs State 56 DLR 622.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 349A</strong>—Sessions Judge acted illegally in deciding the case upon the evidence recorded by the Special Martial law Court. This was the precise argument made on behalf of the respondents in the High Court Division which should have been upheld but the High Court Division misdirected itself in relying upon paragraph 4 of the Proclamation of Withdrawal of Martial Law dated 10-11-86. Although the reason was wrong but its conclusion was right that the order of conviction and sentence was illegal and without jurisdiction. Martial Law Court. <em>State vs Golam Mostafa 49 DLR (AD) 32.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 364 &amp; 164</strong>—It was injudicious to rely upon confession without calling the Magistrate as a witness. The Court is required to see not only that the forms under sections 164 and 264 CrPC were complied with but the substance underneath the law equally adhered to. <em>Bimal Chandra Das alias Vim vs State 51 DLR 466.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 364 &amp; 164(3)</strong>—The provisions under these two sections are mandatory and required to be strictly followed to make the confession voluntary and true and fit for reliance for convicting the accused on his confession. <em>Abul Hossain vs State 46 DLR 77.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 367</strong>—There has not been any miscarriage of justice caused by non-compliance with the provisions of section 367 CrPC while acquitting the accused persons by the Magistrate though his judgment was not in proper form. <em>Nurul Huda vs Bhashanu Sardar 40 DLR (AD) 256.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 367</strong>—Judgment—Writing of a proper judgment—If the trial Court’s judgment is such that it cannot be termed as a judgment as per requirement of this section, hence an order of writing a proper judgment may be necessary-- When the entire matter is open to the criminal Appellate Court which is required by law to assess the evidence independently and come to its finding, then merely because there has been some omission made by the Trial Court in not considering a piece or pieces of evidence, would hardly offer a valid ground for sending the case on remand for a proper judgment. <em>Md Moslehuddin vs State 42 DLR (AD) 160.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 367</strong>—Remand—As a general rule an order for retrial would be proper if the trial in the lower Court was vitiated by illegality or irregularity or for other reason. <em>Md Moslehuddin vs Slate 42 DLR (AD) 142.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 367</strong>—The sentence of only 3 days for the offence punishable under section 475 is shockingly inadequate, as such, the order of enhancement of sentence passed by the appellate Court needs no interference. At the same time, the punishment awarded by the appellate Court but not prescribed by section 471 of the Code is reduced on the ground discussed. <em>Abdul Ahad vs State 58 DLR 311.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 367 as amended by the Law Reforms Ordinance (XLIX of 1978), Section 2 and Schedule thereto read with the Penal Code(XLV of 1860), Section 302.</strong><br/> <br/>Substitution of sub-section (5) of section 367 CrPC by the Law Reforms Ordinance—Effect of change on sentencing—Previously death sentence was the normal sentence for murder and the court was required to give reasons if the lesser sentence of life imprisonment was given—After the substitution now reasons have to be given in either case—A death sentence is to be justified in as much in the same way as in the case of lesser sentence of life term imprisonment. <em>Abed Ali vs Slate 42 DLR (AD) 171.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 367 &amp; 424</strong>—The Additional Sessions Judge sitting on appeal did not apply his mind at all in order to come to an independent decision. He came to the conclusion “found nothing illegal in the impugned order” just after quoting in his judgment some portions of the judgment of the trial Court. In such a position, no Rule need be issued—the case is sent back for delivering a proper judgment. <em>Ekram All Fakir vs Abdus Samad Biswas 47 DLR 53.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 367 and 424</strong>—While disposing of a criminal appeal, the appellate Court must consider at least the material evidence of the case and arrive at independent findings on all material points at issue. Mere saying that it concurred with the findings of the trial Court is not sufficient to meet the requirements of law. <em>Yasin Mollah vs State 53 DLR 99.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 367, 439A and 561A</strong>—The revisional court is competent to direct the trial Court to write a fresh judgment in a case where the trial court has failed to discuss and assess the evidence and written its judgment without trying to determine the fact in issue. <em>Abul Hossain vs State 56 DLR 12.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 367(1)</strong>—Mere stating by the Appellate Court that the appeal is dismissed on merit and the order of conviction and sentence is confirmed without considering the evidence on record and the cases of the parties cannot be said to be a judgment on merit. <em>Abul Basher vs State 40 DLR 248.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 367(1)</strong>—Section 367(1) relates to Criminal Court of original jurisdiction but the same has been made to apply to the Appellate Court except the High Court Division by reasons of section 424 CrPC. <em>Abul Basher vs State 40 DLR 248.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 369</strong>—Review—Application praying for review of judgment passed in a criminal case is totally contrary to the provisions of section 369. <em>Samad Ahmed vs State 45 DLR 394.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 369</strong>—Judgment in criminal case after it is signed cannot be altered or reviewed except to correct clerical error. There is no question of correcting clerical error in rehearing the matter by setting aside judgment already pronounced and signed. <em>Serajul Islam vs Faziul Hoque 47 DLR 480.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 369</strong>—The provision of section 369 of Code of Criminal Procedure clearly bars alteration of a judgment in a Criminal matter where it is already signed excepting to correct clerical error if any. <em>Mostafa Aminur Rashid vs State 51 DLR 543.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—Commutation of sentence— extenuating circumstances for commutation — condemned-prisoners are under peril of death sentence for almost 3 years suffering agony and torments and thereby partially purged their guilt. Their life may be spared. Sentence of death commuted to one of imprisonment for life. <em>Abul Kashem vs State 42 DLR 378.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—Accused Rina is a young woman aged 24 with an infant and she confessed expressing repentance. Both the convicts suffered pangs of death sentence for about 3½ years. There are extenuating circumstances for sparing them from the extreme punishment of death. <em>Shahjahan Manik vs State 42 DLR 465.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—Commutation—Delay by itself is no extenuating circumstance for commuting the sentence. There must be other circumstances of a compelling nature which together with delay will merit commutation. <em>Abdul Khair vs State 44 DLR (AD) 225.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—Commutation of sentence—In the instant case there is an immediate voluntary confession. The accused could have taken a plea of innocence but being repentant he made rather an open breast of everything and may be asking for mercy of God. This aspect of his character needs be kept in view and then the delay in hearing this reference had not been done by him but he had suffered the agony all these 6 years. <em>Abdur Rahman Syed vs State 44 DLR 556.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—A death reference made by the Court of Session may be disposed of even if the condemned accused is absconding. <em>State vs Abdul Khaleque 46 DLR 353.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—Commutation of death sentence—In consideration of the evidence that the appellant is a young man of 35 and initially he had no premeditation to murder, ends of justice would be met if he is sentenced to imprisonment for life. Accordingly, the sentence of death is commuted to imprisonment for life. <em>Mojibur Rahman Gazi vs State 46 DLR 423.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—Since the words “as if the sentences were passed by him” appearing in paragraph 3 of the Proclamation relate to execution of sentence of death, they need be given an interpretation favourable to the condemned- prisoners. Pursuant to such interpretation the Sessions Judge is under an obligation to follow the provision of section 374 CrPC and make a reference to the High Court Division for execution of the sentence passed by the Martial Law Court before issuing warrant therefor. <em>Abdul Baset vs Bangladesh 47 DLR 203.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—There is no bar to hear the death reference against an accused absconding from the inception of the case. <em>State vs Balai Chandra Sarker 47 DLR 467.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>-The extenuating circumstances like lack of premediation, sudden quarrel and in the heat of passion, he inflicted the injuries which nevertheless falls within the purview of section 302 of the Penal Code.

But the offence they committed is a heinous one and, as such, they were rightly served, sentencing them to death and so no leniency ought to have been shown to them. We are unable to see eye to eye to the order of modification of their sentence. <em>ASI Md Ayub Ali Sardar vs State 58 DLR (AD) 13.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>-The Deputy Attorney-General could not offer any explanation for non-filing of the GD Entry nor could he controvert the argument of the defence lawyer regarding leaving of the police station by the police personnel for arrest of a dacoit without any command certificate and any arms whatsoever. Nor the prosecution could offer any explanation regarding non-examination of the SI, a vital witness in the case. All these facts create a strong doubt about the truth of the prosecution story. <em>State vs Mukul @ Swapan 58 DLR 40.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—The prosecution has been able to bring home the charge under section 302 of the Penal Code against the accused-person. He deserves extreme punishment in the present case— The trial Court has not committed any mistake in recording conviction and awarding capital sentence. Accordingly, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence does not call for interference. <em>State vs Maku Rabi Das 58 DLR 229.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—In view of the fact that the condemned-prisoner has been experiencing the agony of death in his death cell for more than 3 years, it is proper to commute his sentence of death to imprisonment for life.<em> State vs Md Ershad Ali Sikder 55 DLR 672.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—It is, also, not possible to lay down any cut and dried formula in imposing proper sentence but the object of sentencing should be to see that the crime does not go unpunished and the society have the satisfaction that justice has been done. In imposing sentence both mitigating and aggravating circumstances are to be taken into consideration and a corelationship has to be drawn up. <em>State vs Mir Hossain alias Mira 56 DLR 124.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—Non-appealing accused Nizamuddin, has not filed any appeal and he is still in custody. Justice must not be stopped to the deprivation of anyone and its flow be allowed to continue, so that every-body may share justice equally. In that view of the matter, the entire order of conviction and sentence be set aside and the non-appealing accused is also entitled to get the benefit of the order. <em>Zamir Ali (Md) vs State 59 DLR 433.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—Accused Fazilutennessa made a confessional statement which was not only true but also voluntary. A person confesses from remorse. Therefore, she could realise what she had done with her husband, Moreover, she has been languishing in the condemned cell since 14- 2-2000—the above fact is a mitigating circumstance and, as such, her death sentence should be commuted to orte for imprisonment for life. <em>State vs Saiful Islam 56 DLR 376.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>-The mere fact that the victim luckily survived for weeks on account of treatment in the hospital is no ground to award lesser sentence. <em>ErshadAli Sikder vs State 57 DLR (AD)75.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—Imposition of proper and appropriate sentence is amalgam of many factors, such as nature of offence, circumstances mitigating and aggravating. A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up before subjecting a person to a sentence. <em>State vs Anjuara Khatun 57 DLR 277.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—Punishment— Mitigating circumstance— The case does not show that the accused used any heavy or sharp cutting or lethal weapon or acted with cruelty in committing the murder. There is also nothing on record that the murder was preplanned and cold-blooded.

It was the State that frequently prayed for fixation of the death reference in the High Court Division and on its prayer a Bench was constituted for hearing the death reference. After the death reference was disposed of by the High Court Division, the appellants after filing leave petitions did not take any step for hearing of their petitions. It was only on the prayer of the State that the leave petitions were heard and the appeals were also heard. <em>Major Bazlul Huda vs State 62 DLR (AD) 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374</strong>—The death of the victim was due to asphyxia resulting from exerting pressure on the throat, neck, head and facial region, which was ante-mortem and homicidal in nature and it is ex-facie clear that the petitioner strangled the victim with the intention of causing her death and there is no circumstances that may impel the Court to take a lenient view in commuting the death sentence as there is no mitigating or extenuating circumstances on record for the purpose of commutation of the death sentence, rather all the circumstances are aggravating. <em>Alam Uddin vs State 62 DLR (AD) 281.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 374 &amp; 164</strong>—Part of the confessional statement found true may be accepted by the court to convict the accused rejecting the other part which is not true. There is no merit in the contention that when one part of the confessional statement is rejected, other part, even if true, cannot be accepted.<br/>Learned Sessions Judge could reject a part of the confessional statement iF he found the same contrary to other evidence on record. But he could not reject the same on mere surmise and conjecture. A part of the confessional statement favourable to the accused should be given due weight to it unless Court finds the same not true being contrary to other evidence on record. <em>State vs Afazuddin Sikder 50 DLR 121.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 374-376</strong>—There was quarrel between the accused and his mother on the day preceding the occurrence as he pressed for sale of a cow and the sale proceeds and the quarrel led to the occurrence of murder—this apart he is a young man of only 20—In such circumstances his death sentence is commuted to that of life imprisonment. <em>State vs Md Jamaluddin 50 DLR 67.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376</strong>—Sentence—Commutation of death sentence—Delay of about two years or so in the disposal of the Death Reference Cases and the Jail Appeal in the High Court Division, cannot by itself be a ground for awarding lesser sentence<em>. Abed Ali vs State 42 DLR (AD) 171.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 376</strong>-There is nothing or record to show that there was (any real) love between the appellant and deceased Dilara. The appellant being not a jilted lover, it is difficult to commute the sentence of death to one of imprisonment for life. Further, soon before the occurrence there was no provocation from the prosecution side and there was no occasion for the appellant to show any emotional imbalance and disequilibrium. On the contrary, the evidence on record shows that the appellant with a premeditated and pre-planned manner entered into the hut of the deceased with a dagger and killed her. The trial Court as also the High Court Division found no mitigating circumstances. Nor did we. <em>Abdul Quddus vs State 43 DLR (AD) 234,</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376</strong>—Death sentence, commutation of—Death sentence not executed after more than four years from the date of confinnation of the sentence.

Death sentence commuted to one of life imprisonment. <em>Wajear Rahman Moral vs State 43 DLR (AD) 25.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376</strong>—The condemned-prisoners being in the cell for 4 years 7 months in the agony of death sentence hanging over their neck, their death sentence is commuted to life imprisonment. <em>State vs Kamal Ahmed 49 DLR 381.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376</strong>—Provocation in the mind of the condemned-prisoner which was a continuous one because of illicit intimacy between the deceased and the wife of the condemned-prisoner led to the killing of the deceased victim. So the sentence of death should be altered into sentence of imprisonment for life. <em>Shahjahan vs State 51 DLR 373.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376</strong>—Since this is not the rarest of the rare cases, ends of justice will be met if the sentence of death of accused Kashem is converted into one of imprisonment for life. <em>State vs Anowar Hossain Pinto alias Anowar Hossain 61 DLR (AD) 108.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 376</strong>—In view of the omissions and laches on the part of the State defence lawyer, the submission of the learned Advocate on point of sentence deserves consideration. <em>State vs Md Khosbar Ali 52 DLR 633.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376</strong>—The convict is a young man of 24 years and there is nothing on record that he is a habitual dacoit—He has been suffering the agony of death sentence for the last 3 years— Therefore, ends of justice would be met if the sentence is reduced and commuted to one of imprisonment for life. <em>State vs Rafiqul Islam 55 DLR 61.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376</strong>—Commutation of death sentence—Mere delay is not a legal ground for commutation of a sentence. <em>(Per Md Tafazzul Islam J). Major Bazlul Huda vs State 62 DLR (AD) 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376</strong>—Commutation of death sentence —There is no merit in the contention that uncontrolled and unguided discretion of the Judges to impose capital punishment or imprisonment for life is hit by Article 14 of the Constitution. If the Law has given to the Judge a wide discretion in the matter of sentence to be exercised by him after balancing all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the crime it will be impossible to say that there would be at all any discrimination since facts and circumstances one case can hardly be the same as the facts and circumstances of another. <em>Major Baziul Huda vs State 62 DLR (AD) 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376</strong>-According to our provision the Court has been left’ with the discretion on the facts of the given case whether or not a set sentence of death should be awarded, and in case of awarding a sentence of death the Court is required to assign reason. The Court is of course keeping in mind while awarding the extreme sentence whether there is mitigating circumstances to exercise such discretion. The mitigating circumstances in the exercise of Courts discretion as analysed in Jogmohan’s case (AIR 1971 SC 500) are undoubtedly relevant circumstance and might be given weight in the determination of sentence. <em>(Per SK Sinha J).Major Baziul Huda vs State 62 DLR (AD) 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376</strong>—Although there is no evidence against all the accused persons of directly participating in the carnage but it should be borne in mind that for the killing of the sitting President, all the accused persons with a view to attainment of the object played different roles. Without jointly operating in concert the criminal object could not have been executed. It was not possible to bring about the result of the criminal object without support of all. In view of the matter, all the conspirators who actually participated and acted the crime do not deserve any leniency in the matter of sentence. <em>(Per 5K Sinha J) Major Bazlul Huda vs State 62 DLR (AD) 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376</strong>—Communtation of death sentence—The accused is not a hardened criminal. The death of the deceased was caused by him in sequel of bitter matrimonial relationship. The caused the haematoma with any hard substance on the occipital region of the head of the deceased which resulted her instantaneous death. The accused has three minor children and an invalid first wife. Justice will be met if the sentence of death awarded to the accused is commuted to imprisonment for life. <em>State vs Azam Reza 62 DLR 399.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376(a)</strong>—The fact that the condemned-prisoner committed the murder under influence of some provocation should not be ignored while considering the question of sentence. <em>State vs Hamida Khatun 50 DLR 517.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376(a)</strong>—Since Hamida did not play the principal role in murdering her husband and there is no evidence to show that she along with Abu Taher planned in advance to kill her husband in furtherance of common intention, ends of justice would be met if the sentence of death is reduced to one of imprisonment for life. <em>State vs Hamida Khatun 50 DLR 517.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 378 &amp; 429</strong>—Hearing of the case by a Third Judge—The language used in sections 378 and 429 of the Code is almost identical. It is said that in hearing a reference or an appeal if the Judges are equally divided in opinion thereon, the case with their opinions shall be laid before a third Judge for hearing, and the third Judge after hearing ‘as he thinks fit’ would deliver his opinion, and the judgment and order would follow such opinion. The expressions “as he thinks fit” used in both the sections are significant. It is the third Judge to decide on what points or in respect of whom he shall hear arguments. This postulates that the third Judge is completely free in resolving the difference as he thinks fit. If he does not think to hear the arguments in respect of any accused of whom the Judges are not divided in their opinions, he may decline to do so. The use of the words “equally divided” in both the sections means the Judges differ in their opinions, in respect of complicity of an accused or on the charge framed against him or them or on any particular point it can be inferred that they are equally divided but in a case where the Judges concur each other in respect of a particular accused and in respect of the offence charged, it can not be said that Judges are equally divided in respect of the accused charged with. <em>Major Bazlul Huda vs State 62 DLR (AD) 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 386</strong>—Fine imposed upon an accused in a criminal proceeding is of the nature of a financial punishment as distinguished from physical punishment and it must be paid by him under all normal circumstances. <em>Ali Hossain vs State 52 DLR 282.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 386</strong>-Fine is a charge upon the assets of the convict as a public dues and it continues to be so even after his death and it is recoverable from his successor-in-interest under the provisions of section 386 of the Code. <em>Ali Hossain vs State 52 DLR 282.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 386</strong>-Fine imposed by the Criminal Court upon an accused is of the nature of a financial punishment as distinguished from physical punishment and it must be realised from him under all normal circumstances. The accused has no option in the matter.<em> Rowshan Ali vs State 52 DLR 510.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 392</strong>—Changing of sections without putting the same before him prevented the appellant from cross-examining the witnesses and giving any counter-defence. Such sort of changes without giving the accused any opportunity for expressing his views is against natural justice and contrary to the established principles of justice delivery system. <em>Abdul Kader vs State 60 DLR 457.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 401</strong>—Empowers the Government to remit and suspend a sentence passed by a Court but for such remission and suspension of sentence the order of conviction is not reversed. It remains in force, but the convict due to an order of rem ission and suspension passed under section 401 CrPC is not to serve out the period of sentence so suspended and is not to pay the fine so remitted. <em>Nasiruddin Miah vs State 40 DLR 244.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 401 and 423</strong>—In ease of an appeal from an order of acquittal, the Court may refuse the prayer of withdrawal of the appeal as it may find on hearing the appeal on merit that the order appealed is illegal and calls for an order of conviction. <em>Nasiruddin Miah vs State 40 DLR 244.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 403</strong>—Double Jeopardy—The accused is going to be prosecuted in respect of an offence which did not occur during the earlier transaction nor the present case arose out of the same fact and for the present offence he was not tried previously. In such a position the doctrine of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict or of the Code as to double jeopardy is not applicable in the present case. <em>HM Ershad vs State 45 DLR 534.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 403</strong>—The statutory provisions recognise the Rule against double jeopardy and the principle of res judicata should apply to criminal proceedings in the same way as to civil proceedings but there being no conviction in the cases under reference, the principle of double jeopardy does not apply. <em>Parveen vs State 51 DLR 473.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 403(1)</strong>—The whole basis of section 403(1) of the Code as well as Article 35(2) is that the first trial should have been before a Court competent to hear and determine the case and to record a verdict of conviction or acquittal—if the court is not so competent, the whole trial is null and void and it cannot be said that there was any conviction or acquittal in force such a trial does not bar a subsequent trial of the accused. <em>Muhammadullah vs Sessions Judge 52 DLR 374.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 403(2)</strong>—Trial of an accused for one distinct offence will not stand in the way of his subsequent trial for the other distinct offence as specifically provided by sub-section (2) of section 403.<br/>The former trial for unauthorised possession of the firearms will not be a bar to the subsequent trial for the offence of robbery, even if the same firearms have been used while committing the robbery. The trial of the petitioners in this case is perfectly lawful. <em>Arfan Ali vs State 42 DLR (AD) 22.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 404, 410, 417, 418, 422 &amp; 423</strong>— The Code drew no distinction between an appeal against an acquittal and an appeal against a conviction, as regards the powers of the High Court. <em>Dilruba Aktar vs AHM Mohsin 55 DLR 568.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 408</strong>—Appeal will lie to the Court of Sessions if the Assistant Sessions Judge deemed to be an Additional Sessions Judge passes a sentence of imprisonment for a term of five years or less. Section 408 has full force and application. <em>Nurul Huda vs Baharuddin 41 DLR 395.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 408, 417A &amp; 423</strong>—Except under the provisions of section 41 7A of the Code there is no other provision for filing appeal for enhancement of sentence. In an appeal from a conviction, sentence may be reduced by an appellate Court but sentence can be enhanced only in an appeal for enhancement of sentence and that can be done after giving the accused an opportunity of showing cause against enhancement. <em>Moktar Ali Bepari vs State 51 DLR 439.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 409</strong>—An Assistant Sessions iu1e deemed to be appointed as Additional Sessions Judge has the limited power of passing higher sentences except a Death Sentence in those sessions cases which are now triable by him by deeming and treating him to be an Additional Sessions Judge, consequent upon the changes brought. He shall not be deemed to be an Additional Sessions Judge for all the purposes under the Code, eg for hearing appeals, revisions, references and reviews if they are made over or transferred to him by the Sessions Judge. Under section 409 the Sessions Judge can transfer the hearing of an appeal only to an Additional Sessions Judge and not to an Assistant Sessions Judge deemed to have been appointed as an Additional Sessions Judge. The dismissal in the instant appeal by the Assistant Sessions Judge and refusal of interference by the High Court Division in revision are therefore illegal. The appeal against conviction is therefore allowed and it is directed that the Sessions Judge may himself dispose of the appeal or transfer it to an Additional Sessions Judge for disposal. <em>Abdul Kashem vs State 43 DLR (AD) 77.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 409, 410, 435, 436, 438 and 439A</strong>—Under section 409 the Sessions Judge can transfer the hearing of an appeal only to an Additional Sessions Judge and not to an Assistant Sessions Judge. Section 410 has also full force and any person convicted on a trial held by a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge may appeal to the High Court Division. This section has no reference to an Assistant Sessions Judge deemed to have been appointed as an Additional Sessions Judge. The same applies to sections 435, 436, 438 and 439A. <em>Nurul Huda vs Baharuddin 41 DLR 395.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 410</strong>—Non-appealing—accused— Benefit of acquittal—In the face of clear illegality committed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge in convicting all the 3 accused of the offence under section 396 of the Penal Code, if we do not record an order of acquittal in favour of accused Fazlul Huq, the non-appealing accused, it means that we are allowing an illegal order to perpetuate. In that view of the matter, we hold the entire order of conviction and sentence be set aside and the absenting accused Faziul Huq is also entitled to get the benefit of this order. <em>Arzan Iman Ali vs State 48 DLR 287.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 410</strong>—The High Court Division sitting in appeal was bound to give due weight to the opinion of the trial Court with regard to the credibility and demeanour of the witnesses. <em>State vs Abdus Sattar 43 DLR (AD) 44.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 410</strong>—423 read with—Employment of Labour (Standing Orders) Act (VIII of 1965)— Section 26.<br/>Order of sentence passed by the Labour Court under the provisions of Employment of Labour (Standing Orders) Act is not appealable to the appellate authority under the Code of Criminal Procedure as there is no provision for such appeal under the Employment of Labour (Standing Orders) Act. <em>Jagodish Chandra Dutta vs MH Azad 41DLR 257.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 410</strong>—Accused Ali Mia, though did not prefer any appeal against his conviction and sentence, there is no reason to keep him is custody on the basis of illegal evidence. <em>Shah Alam and others vs State 52 DLR 567.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 410</strong>—The date of conviction and sentence pronounced by the trial Court should not be taken to be the starting point for the disqualification against the convict sitting Member on account of such conviction in a criminal case involving moral turpitude. <em>HM Ershad vs Abdul Muqtadir Chowdhury 53 DLR 569.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 410</strong>-It is surprising to find the peculiar way of disposal of criminal appeal by the High Court Division that shirked responsibility misdirecting themselves and shouldered the same on Allah. This sort of disposal of criminal appeal is unknown to our criminal jurisprudence, this unwarranted method of administration of justice is disapproved. <em>State vs Kh Zillul Bari 57 DLR (AD) 129.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 412</strong>—The right of appeal of a convicted accused is taken away if the court accepted the plea of guilty and convicted him on such plea. <em>Ayar @ Ayaruddin vs State 56 DLR 494.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417</strong>—Review of evidence—The reason given by the Judges of the High Court Division to disregard the evidence of PWs 2, 3 &amp; 4 relying only upon the evidence of PW 7 is rather artificial. In an appeal by the State against acquittal it is quite open to the Court to review the evidence in order to see whether finding on which acquittal is based is perverse being in wanton disregard of good and unblemished evidence given by other witnesses. <em>State vs Ashraf Ali 43 DLR (AD) 83.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417</strong>—As a matter of practice the High Court Division normally grants bail to the  persons who are acquitted after a full-fledged trial when the State prefers an appeal against the order of acquittal. <em>Abdul Hafez Howlader alias Habibur Rahman vs State 51 DLR (AD) 67.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 417, 418 and 423</strong>—Provisions under these sections give to the High Court Division full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal was founded—No limitation should be placed upon that power. <em>Shah Alam vs State 42 DLR (AD) 31.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 417 and 439(4)(5)</strong>—Petitioner acquitted of the charge of dacoity by the trial Judge—Government had not preferred any appeal under section 417 CrPC—Section 439 CrPC does not authorise High Court Division to convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction. Held— the Rule issued suo motu by the High Court Division was without jurisdiction. <em>Jalal Uddin vs Bilkis Rahman &amp; State 42 DLR 107.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417</strong>—On an appeal for acquittal the appellate Court is not entitled to interfere with the decision of the trial Court on facts unless it has acted perversely or otherwise improperly. <em>Dilruba Aktar vs AHM Mohsin 55 DLR 568.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417</strong>—The Code drew no distinction between an appeal from an acquittal and an appeal from a conviction and no such distinction could be imposed by judicial decision. <em>Dilruba Aktar vs AHM Mohsin 55 DLR 568.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417</strong>—Before an order of acquittal is reversed it must be shown that the judgment is not only unreasonable or manifestly wrong but it is also manifestly perverse and unless such a finding can be made on the basis of materials on record the order of acquittal should not be interfered. <em>State vs Wasikur Rahman 58 DLR (AD) 60.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 417 &amp; 423</strong>—In an appeal from acquittal, the appellate Court in exercise of its appellate authority is not entitled to interfere with the decisions unless those suffer from manifest illegality, legal infirmity and perversity rendering a positive miscarriage of justice. <em>Dilruba Aktar vs AHM Mohsin 55 DLR 568.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417(1)</strong>—Finding of acquittal cannot be said to be perverse if it is not absolutely against the evidence. <em>State vs Shamima Arshad 52 DLR 617.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417(1)(a)</strong>—Maintainability of appeal by witness against order of acquittal—The State under section 417(1)(a) of the Code is authorised to present an appeal against an order of acquittal passed by the Court of Sessions. But in the present case, the appeal was not preferred by the State. The appeal was filed before the High Court Division by a witness who is also the petitioner in the present petition for leave to appeal. Hence this leave petition is not maintainable in law. <em>Fazar Ali Manik Chan vs Fazar Ali 43 DLR (AD) 129.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 417(1)(b) &amp; 439A</strong>—Where the State has not filed any appeal against the order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in a police case the informant is competent under section 439A of the Code to prefer revision before the Sessions Judge who can look into the legality or propriety of the order of acquittal. <em>Abu Taher vs Hasina Begum 50 DLR 19.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417(3)</strong>—The special limitation provided in sub-section (3) of section 417 CrPC is applicable in a case where a complainant intends to file an appeal before the High Court Division against order of acquittal passed in a case upon a petition of complaint. <em>Dr MA Mazed vs Bangladesh 56 DLR (AD) 198.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417(3)</strong>—A case registered upon lodging of an Ejaher and culminating in charge- sheet and thereupon person(s) recommended by the police for prosecution was put on trial and the trial ends in acquittal and thereupon if Government files an appeal the ‘special limitation’ provided by section 417(3) of CrPC shall have no manner of application. <em>Dr MA Mazed vs Bangladesh 56 DLR (AD) 198.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417A</strong>—Appeal by informant— Competency—The contention that an appeal at the instance of an informant from an inadequate sentence lies under section 417A has no substance. <em>Abdul Aziz vs State 44 DLR 594.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417A</strong>—That all judgment, whether conviction or acquittal are appealable under section 30(1) of the Special Powers Act. Under sub-section (1) of section 27, criminal cases coming within the ambit of the Special Powers Act can only be initiated on a report in writing made by a police officer not below the rank of Sub-Inspector So no private party has any right to initiate such cases. Section 30 seems to cover appeals by a the State. Therefore, this appeal is not maintainable under section 417(1) of CrPC. <em>State vs Wanur Rahman 40 DLR 346.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417A(2)</strong>—Section 417A(2) of the Code appeal lies to the appellate Court against the sentence on the ground of inadequacy. The appellate Court was the Court of Sessions but no appeal was filed before the Court of Sessions rather it was filed, long after the limitation, before the High Court Division. The very appeal was incompetent and the High Court Division acted illegally in entertaining the appeal and therefore, the judgment of the High Court Division is liable to be set aside.<br/>In an appeal a sentence may not be enhanced whereas this may be done in revision and secondly that in revision and acquittal shall not be converted into a conviction, whereas this may be done in an appeal against an acquittal. Every other power, whether procedural or final, is equally exercisable in appeal as it may be exercised in revision by the High Court Division. <em>GMM Rahman vs State 62 DLR (AD) 410.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 420</strong>—The proviso to sub-section (1) of section 421 does not apply to appeals presented under section 420 of the Code. In the case of jail appeals the court can summarily dismiss the appeal on perusal of the papers without calling upon the appellant to appear. <em>Ayar @ Ayaruddin vs State 56 DLR 494.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 420</strong>—The Inspector-General of Prisons is to circulate and get notified this judgment to every superintendent of jails all over the country within seven days for compliance so that the jail appeals of less privileged prisoners are communicated to the appropriate appellate Courts in the light of directions given. <em>Ayar @ Ayaruddin vs State 56 DLR 44.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 420</strong>-When a prisoner in jail applies through the Superintendent of Jail for a copy of the judgment in order to prefer an appeal, it is superintendent’s business to procure and forward a copy applied for and to arrange that this is done. <em>Ayar @ Ayaruddin vs State 56 DLR 494.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 421</strong>—In a case of absentia trial, limitation shall run from the date of knowledge of the judgment and not from the date of judgment. <em>Jamal Ahmed alias Jamal vs State 58 DLR 419.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 422</strong>—Once the complaint has ended in conviction it was the State that came into picture and the State had to be given notice to sustain the conviction and complainant had no right to be given notice. <em>Kamal Miah vs State 50 DLR 224.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 422</strong>—A criminal appeal cannot be dismissed on technical grounds once it is admitted for hearing by the court. After admission, a criminal appeal can be disposed of only on merit. <em>Kamal Miah vs State 50 DLR 224.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 423</strong>—In view of the fact that the two foreigner-appellants have made a clean breast of their offence and never tried to beat the law by any smart manoeuvre and they have begged mercy of the court from the very beginning the sentence of the two foreigner appellants be reduced from life imprisonment to rigorous imprisonment for 7 years. <em>Major (Retd) Ashrafuddin Sekander vs State 50 DLR (AD) 108.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 423</strong>—When it is found after a full trial that there was a mis-trial or trial without jurisdiction, the Court of appeal before directing a fresh trial by an appropriate Court should also see whether such direction should at all be given in the facts and circumstances of a particular case.<br/>If it is found that there was no legal evidence to support the conviction then in that case it would be wholly wrong to direct a retrial because it would then be an useless exercise. Further, the prosecution should not be given a chance to fill up its lacuna by bringing new evidence which it did not or could not produce in the first trial. <em>Asiman Begum vs State, represented by the Depuly Commissioner 51 DLR (AD) 18.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 423</strong>—If it is found that the accused had suffered a substantial part of the sentence imposed upon him or her in the mis-trial, the Court may not for ends of justice direct a retrial.<br/>There is no question that the Court has undoubted right to direct a retrial where there has not been a trial in accordance with law. We are of the view that having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and particularly in view of the fact that in the meantime (during pendency of appeal in this Court) the appellant has continued to suffer imprisonment, it is a fit and proper case in which the High Court Division should consider the case on merit also and then pass whatever order or orders it thinks appropriate in the interest of justice. <em>Asiman Begum vs State, represented by the Deputy Commissioner 51 DLR (AD) 18.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 423</strong>—Though a lawyer was appointed to defend the absconding accused, the appointment did not serve the purpose—The accused should be given an opportunity to defend himself properly by cross-examining the PWs and for that purpose the case is liable to be sent back to the trial Court. <em>Ismail vs State 51 DLR 497.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 423</strong>—In view of long detention of the appellants from the date of their arrest the prayer for commutation of sentence in respect of fine may be allowed. <em>Rafiqul Islam @.Rafiq vs State 51 DLR 488.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 423</strong>—The appellants had to undergo the rituals of a protracted trial and the agonies arising out of the order of conviction and sentence passed and by now much of their sins has been expiated by way of burning of the heart during this long period. Court in therefore, inclined to take a lenient view in awarding sentence to them. <em>Ali Hossain vs State 52 DLR 282.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 423</strong>—If a person is intended to be tried and punished with enhanced punishment or with punishment of a different kind as being a previous offender, the particulars of the previous conviction should be stated in the charge. The prosecution did not lead any evidence that the appellants were previously convicted persons. In that view, the Assistant Sessions Judge has awarded a harsh sentence to them. <em>Bura Yunus vs State 59 DLR 549.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 423</strong>—The appellant had already undergone the ordeal of trial and after the conviction during pendency of the appeal before this Court continued to suffer imprisonment which was imposed on him in the mistrial, so in the interest of justice a retrial should not be directed. <em>Goutam Chandra Das alias Goutam Kumar Das vs State 55 DLR 527.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 423 &amp; 424</strong>—There has not been an elaborate discussion of the evidence on record. It is needless to say that a duty is cast upon the lower appellate Court to write out a proper judgment on facts while disposing of an appeal. <em>Abdul Khaleque Master vs State 52 DLR (AD) 54.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section, 423(1)(a)(b)</strong>—A finding of acquittal can be converted into one of conviction only under clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 423 CrPC. The suo motu Rule is without jurisdiction. <em>Jalaluddin vs Bilkis Rahman and State 42 DLR 107.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 423(i)(b)</strong>—Since the prosecution has totally failed to prove its case against any of the accused persons, non-appealing co-accused is also acquitted of the charge under section 382 Penal Code. <em>Mofizul Islam vs State 54 DLR 221.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 423(1)(b)</strong>—When sentence of fine is imposed in addition to sentence of imprisonment, this will amount to enhancement of sentence. The appellate Court may enhance the sentence but such enhancement cannot be made unless the accused is given an opportunity of showing cause against such enhancement. <em>Mizanur Rahman vs Surma Khatun 50 DLR 559.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 423(1)(b)(2)</strong>—Acquittal converted into conviction under section 423 CrPC—No interference in the absence of appeal against acquittal. <em>Mofizuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 286.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 423(1)(b)(2)</strong>—The Appellate Court has jurisdiction under section 423(1)(b)(2) of Code of the Criminal Procedure to reverse an order of acquittal purporting to “alter the finding” of conviction. <em>Mofizuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 286.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 424 &amp; 367</strong>—The Additional Sessions Judge sitting on appeal did not apply his mind at all in order to come to an independent decision. He came to the conclusion “found nothing illegal in the impugned order” just after quoting in his judgment some portions of the judgment of the trial Court. In such a position, no Rule need be issued—the case is sent back for delivering a proper judgment. <em>Ekram Ali Fakir vs Abdus Samad Biswas 47 DLR 53.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 426</strong>—Bail after conviction—The accused could obtain bail from the Appellate Court or from the High Court Division and not from the trial Court which became functus officio after the filing and disposal of appeal against conviction. <em>Dulal vs State 43 DLR 321.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 426</strong>—Bail—Suspension of sentence pending appeal—Release of appellants on bail— Sentence being in excess of one year Sessions Judge was not competent to grant such bail. <em>Saidur Rahman vs State 40 DLR (AD) 281.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 426</strong>—Bail—Condition for the bail is quite reasonable and can be complied with by the person seeking bail without any difficulty but payment of fine involving huge amount of money as a condition for bail may not be possible— Impugned order of payment of fine as a condition for the bail is not supportable either in law or on the principle of reasonableness.<em> Iqbal vs State 41 DLR (AD) 111.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 426</strong>—In cases of short term imprisonment, the judge should better dispose of the appeal very expeditiously failing which he may consider the question of bail (if raised again). <em>Mahbub vs State 46 DLR (AD) 143.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 426</strong>—Bail in a pending appeal— The matter of granting bail by the High Court Division, during the period of emergency, in a pending appeal filed by the convict who has been convicted and sentenced under the provision of Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 in case of short sentence not exceeding 3 years, when the appeal could not be disposed of within 90 working days for no fault of the appellant and/or in the case of serious illness endangering life to be certified by duly constituted Medical Board, may consider the matter of granting bail in an appropriate case in an appeal. <em>Government of Bangladesh vs Sabera Aman 62 DLR (AD) 246.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 426</strong>–Bail in a pending appeal—The convict-appellant has been suffering from multifarious illness endangering life “at his advanced age of 58 years and he needs specialized, continuous and supervised treatment in a stress less condition”. Accordingly, on the ground of serious illness endangering life the convict- appellant may enlarged on bail. <em>Iqbal Hasan Mahmood vs State 63 DLR 286.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 426 &amp; 497</strong>—Though the appellate Court including this court may enlarge a convict on bail for reasons to be recorded by it such a convict is not entitled to be released on bail if he is sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life.<br/>Appellate Division in some cases opined that a convict may be enlarged on bail if there is no chance of disposal of the appeal within the period of his sentence. A convict who is sentenced to imprisonment for life does not fall within the pronouncement of the Appellate Division. Bail granted to appellant-opposite-party Abdul Momin Sarder on 11-1-96 is cancelled and he is directed to surrender to his bail bond forthwith. <em>State vs Abdul Momin Sardar 50 DLR 588.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 428</strong>—Additional evidence—Section 428 may be resorted to when such evidence either was not available at the trial or the party concerned was prevented from producing it, either by circumstances beyond its control or by reason of misunderstanding or mistake. <em>Rajab Ali Zulfiqar vs State 45 DLR 705.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 428</strong>—The purpose of this section is to allow additional evidence at the appellate stage only and not to give an opportunity to the prosecution to fill up the lacuna in its case. <em>Bakul vs State 47 DLR 486.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 428 &amp; 561A</strong>—As the present application is an application under section 561A, there is no scope of taking further evidence under section 428 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. <em>Shuinya @ Suruj Ali vs State 53 DLR 527.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 431</strong>—The power of the Court of law to reconsider fine which the deceased appeallant was entitled and if the right is taken away that will be denial of the principle of natural justice of the heirs and legal representative which their predecessor had. <em>S Taibur Rahman vs State 55 DLR 709.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 432, 424 and 367(1)</strong>—It is well- settled principle of law that for disposal of Criminal Appeal presence of an Advocate is not essential and the Appellate Court can dispose of the appeal on mere writing a judgment according to provisions of section 667(1) of CrPC. <em>Abdul Basher vs State 40 DLR 248.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 435</strong>—A Court is undoubtedly inferior to another Court when an appeal lies from the former to the latter, <em>State vs Auranga @ KM Hemayatuddin 46 DLR 524.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 435</strong>—Right of heirs of deceased complainant to proceed with the complainant’s case—The complainant in the criminal case under section 447 claimed ownership and possession of the land in question. On his death during the pendency of the revision case arising out of the matter his wife having stepped into his shoes so far as it relates to his properties, she is required to be brought on record to protect her interest in the land. <em>Dr Md Abdul Baten vs State 43 DLR 60.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435 and 436</strong>—Sessions Judge called for records of the case triable under the provisions of the Special Powers Act from the Court of the Magistrate in exercise of his power, under sections 435 and 436 CrPC and took cognizance of the offence after converting himself into a Special Tribunal—This is not contemplated by law. <em>Satya Ranjan Sarda vs State 42 DLR 142.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435/439</strong>—A second revisional application by the self-same party is not barred to challenge an illegal order after dismissal of his earlier revisional application for default and not on merit. Learned Advocate for the petitioners did not argue on the question of merit of the impugned order. So his contention as to limitation in the facts and circumstances of the case does not appeal to us. In the above facts and circumstances were are of the view that revisional application filed beyond the period of limitation though should not be encouraged, cannot debar the Court from setting aside an illegal order of the subordinate Court in the interest of justice. <em>Anower Hossain vs Md Idrish Miah 48 DLR 295</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435 and 439</strong>—Interpretation of Statute—The expression “if the accused is in confinement” in section 439 CrPC is used as a condition precedent to bail. <em>Abdus Samad vs State 41 DLR 291.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435/439</strong>—An application under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by an informant in a Sessions Case against order of discharging an accused is maintainable in spite of the position that the State has not filed such application<em>. Abdur Rahman Kha vs State 56 DLR 213.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435, 438 and 439A</strong>—The legislature has consciously kept section 438 alive although the Sessions Judges have been invested with the powers under section 439A to make final orders enabling the litigants to choose the forum as to whether he would resort to the forum under section 438 or under section 439A with the risk of finality of the order that may be passed. <em>Abdul Ahad@ Md Abdul Ahadvs State 52 DLR 379.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435 &amp; 439</strong>—Revisional Power, scope of—Question whether the law laid own in I section 5(1)(e) of the Act, 1947 and section 4 of the Anti-Corruption Act, 1957 is discriminatory and violative of the provisions of the Constitution is not within the scope of the present Rule to be determined. <em>HM Ershad vs State 45 DLR 533.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435 and 439</strong>—To be released on bail a person must be in custody or in some sort of confinement. <em>Abdus Samad vs State 41 DLR 291.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435/439 and 561A</strong>—The High Court Division exercising power under section 561A of the Code is not supposed to embark upon an inquiry to ascertain sufficiency, reliability and admissibility of evidence—However, if a conviction order is passed absolutely without any legal evidence, it can be looked into in the present forum to secure ends of justice. <em>Rezia Khatun vs State 56 DLR 208.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435, 439 &amp; 561A</strong>—Power under sections 439 and 561A is different in nature— Section 439 read with section 435 refers to inferior Court under High Court Division— Exercise of power under section 561A is not limited to the inferior Court only.<em> Jagodish Chandra Dutta vs MH Azad 41 DLR 257.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435 &amp; 439A</strong>—The law should not be stretched too far so that big companies against whom serious allegation of foul play concerning national economy is being made can themselves overtake the law by ingenious contentions. It is true that in criminal matters the accused should get all protection under the law but it is also important that the law should not be stretched too far so that big companies against whom serious allegation of foul play concerning national economy is being made before the Court by a statutory authority can themselves overtake the law by resourceful enterprise in raising ingenious contentions in order to frustrate the prosecution on the threshold. The Court must strike a balance. We are of the view that the learned Sessions Judge failed to maintain that balance which has been restored by the High Court Division. <em>Shinepukur Holdings Ltd vs Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd 50 DLR (AD) 189.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435, 438 &amp; 439A</strong>—The Sessions Judge would have been well-advised to reject the revision petitions upon the view that the objection as to alleged lack of authority should be raised before the Court taking cognizance. <em>Shinepukur Holdings Ltd vs Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd 50 DLR (AD) 189.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435, 438 &amp; 439A</strong>—When the SEC was making a complaint of fraudulent acts against certain companies and their directors on the basis of an enquiry undertaken by an expert committee, a Court would be well-advised not to try to be more expert at the complaint stage because otherwise it will be an example of nipping the prosecution in the bud. <em>Shinepukur Holdings Ltd vs Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd 50 DLR (AD) 189.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 436</strong>—Sessions Judge’s power to order enquiry—The Sessions Judge commits no illegality in setting aside the order of discharge of the accused passed by the Magistrate and in directing the latter to send the case record to the Court of the Sessions Judge along with statements recorded by the police. The order is within the scope of section 436 CrPC. But the Sessions Judge’s further order giving direction to send the accused for trial being in excess of his jurisdiction cannot be sustained. The Magistrate is left with his absolute discretion in the matter of taking cognizance of the offence and sending the accused-petitioners to the Court of Sessions for trial after holding further enquiry according to law. <em>Motaleb vs State 43 DLR 519.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 436</strong>—When the order of discharge has been made without entering into the merit of the case, a fresh complaint or a fresh first information report against the same accused person can be maintainable, when fresh materials come forward which were not available at the time of previous investigation or enquiry. <em>Rasharaj Sarker vs State 52 DLR 598.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 436</strong>-Sessions Judge’s power to order inquiry—The jurisdiction of the Sessions Judge is wide enough to direct further inquiry by a Magistrate. If the Sessions Judge directs to make further inquiry by the Magistrate by holding a judicial inquiry it is fully within the express power given to the Sessions Judge under section 436 CrPC. <em>Farid Ahmed vs State 44 DLR 30.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 436</strong>-The Magistrate seemed to have acted within his jurisdiction to decide, on assessment of evidence on record, whether all or some of the accused are to be sent for trial. The order of the Sessions Judge having the effect of directing the Magistrate to tale cognizance octhe 8 accused against whom the latter found no prima facie case is not within the scope of further inquiry contemplated under section 436 CrPC. <em>Mohibar Rahman vs Kuti Miah 44 DLR 112.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 436</strong>-Sessions Judge re-assessed the evidence recorded by the Magistrate under section 202(2A) of the CrPC and apparently took cognizance of the case himself against the petitioners directing further enquiry into the matter by way of securing their attendance and ordering them to be sent up under section 205 CrPC before his court to stand trial.<br/>Held—Order of the learned Sessions Judge is not contemplated in section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and, as such, he acted illegally in interfering with the order of the learned Magistrate as such. <em>Syed Ahmed vs Habibur Rahman 42 DLR 240.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 436</strong>-There is also no force in the contention that once the accused has been made party in the revisional application he acquires a right to be heard.<br/>As provision under section 436 only directs notice in a case where a person has been discharged and not in the case of an accused to whom no process has been issued under section 204 and when the complaint has been dismissed without a notice to him. <em>Sirajudullah vs State 48 DLR 76.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 436, 439A and 561A</strong>—If any one is aggrieved by an order of discharge passed by a Magistrate, he can move the Superior Court under section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for further enquiry but the Superior Court cannot direct the Magistrate to take cognisance of a case irrespective of the fact whether it is triable by a Magistrate or exclusively by the Court of Sessions. The Superior Coufl can merely order for further enquiry but cannot direct for taking cognisance of the offence. <em>Jalaluddin vs State 60 DLR 581.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 436, 204(3) &amp; 203</strong>—The order of dismissal of the complaint passed under sections 203 and 204(3) CrPC does not amount to discharge. So for a further enquiry in such a case no notice to the accused is necessary. The principle, that an order prejudicial to an accused should not be made, without giving him - an opportunity to be heard, has no application where the accused is not discharged. A revisional application before the learned Sessions Judge at the instance of an aggrieved complainant against an order of dismissal of a complaint by the Magistrate can be gone into without notice to the accused. <em>Sirajudullah vs State 48 DLR 76.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 436, 205(1) &amp; 203</strong>—Neither the Sessions Judge nor the High Court Division is invested with any power to direct any Magistrate to take cognizance of a case.<br/>Their power is strictly limited to directing a further enquiry into the petition of complaint. It will be for the Magistrate concerned to take or not to take cognizance after the result of further enquiry. After the dismissal of the petition of complaint under section 203 CrPC the informant- respondents remedy was to approach the higher Court under section 436 CrPC for further enquiry into his petition of complaint. The penultimate order of the High Court Division in directing the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence and to issue process in accordance with section 205(1) CrPC is not sustainable. <em>Yusuf A Hossain vs KM Rezaul Ferdous 48 DLR (AD) 53.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 436, 439 and 439A</strong>—Sessions Judge’s power to direct further, enquiry under section 436 CrPC on dismissal of complaint on an erroneous view of law. <em>Bangladesh vs Yakub Sardar 40 DLR (AD) 246.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 437 &amp; 439</strong>—Right of heirs of deceased complainant to proceed with the complainant’s case—The complainant in the criminal case under section 447 claimed ownership and possession of the land in question. On his death during the pendency of the revision case arising out of the matter his wife having stepped into his shoes so far as it relates to his properties, she is required to be brought on record to protect her interest in the land. <em>Dr Md Abdul Baten vs State 43 DLR 60.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 436, 439A &amp; 561A</strong>—Question raised in this Rule could very well be raised before the Sessions Judge and the Sessions Judge could set aside the order of the Magistrate framing charge against the petitioner if there was mont in the contention raised by the petitioner and after such discharge there was no scope for directing further enquiry under section 436 of the Code. Since this question was not noticed at the time of issuance of the Rule discharge of the same without considering merit of the same may cause undue hardship and unnecessary harassment to the petitioner. So this Court decided merit of the Rule which is otherwise not maintainable. <em>Abdul Hai vs State 50 DLR 551.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 438</strong>—When the Magistrate has only called for the case diary for his perusal upon allegations made in the naraji petition that the same will show a prima facie case against the accused, the reference prayed for against the step is premature. <em>Nurul Hoque vs Bazal Ahmed 48 DLR 327.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 438</strong>—Sessions Judges have been given revisional powers to make final orders but simultaneously their powers to make recommendation to the High Court Division for orders under section 438 have also been kept intact. <em>Abdul Ahad vs State 52 DLR 379.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 438 &amp; 439A</strong>—Though Sessions Judge has got power to make a reference to the High Court Division, it is not necessary now to make such a reference if the revisional application before him is to set aside any order of the Magistrate as he is competent enough to set aside such order. <em>Farhad Hossain vs Mainuddin Hossain Chowdhury 46 DLR 127.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 438, 439A &amp; 561A</strong>—Reference— Since the petitioner could not make out a case of quashing of the proceedings and since no such power is vested in the Sessions Judge the impugned order refusing to make a reference to the High Court Division suffers from no illegality. <em>Farhad Hossain vs Mainuddin Hossain Chowdhury 46 DLR 127.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—The jurisdiction of a Single Judge to hear a revisional application against an order of acquittal passed in a case involving an offence punishable with sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year is barred. <em>Ahsan Sarfun Nur vs Nurul Islam 42 DLR (AD) 90.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—Refusal of prayer for ad-interim stay while issuing Rule in criminal revision. When appellant clearly stated before the High Court Division while obtaining the Rule that she gave birth to a child just five months ago and it would be injurious to her health as also to the baby if both were to be placed under any type of custody at that critical stage it was not a judicious and sound exercise of discretion to refuse the said stay. <em>Azima Begum vs Yusuf Khan 43 DLR (AD) 53.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—Revision against order of acquittal—When the appellate Court and the High Court Division upon evidence and circumstances which is not unreasonable or perverse refused to believe the prosecution case, this court merely because a different view is possible of the evidence does not interfere with an order of acquittal. <em>Abdul Hamid Mollah vs Ali Mollah 44 DLR (AD) 223.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—Leave order was granted to examine the powers under section 439 CrPC as interpreted by the High Court Division. <em>Kashem Ali vs State 40 DLR (AD) 294.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—High Court Division made three propositions in defining the area for exercise of its power and authority. <em>Kashem Ali vs State 40 DLR (AD) 294.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—Administration of Criminal Justice with the change of time and circumstances attending the same—High Court Division to be a little more scrutinising even in a case of acquittal —whether misappreciation of evidence is never a sufficient ground for interfering with an acquittal. <em>Kashem Ali vs State 40 DLR (AD) 294.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—Direction for filing a separate application for bail while moving a revisional application whether proper—When the appellants were already on bail granted by the lower Appellate Court, the direction that has been given after rejecting the prayer for bail is not proper and is not in keeping with the normal practice and; procedure that is traditionally followed in the High Court Division in revision. In that view o the matter, the appellants will remain on bail already granted, till disposal of the revision case. <em>Baneanzuddin Ahmed vs State 43 DLR (AD) 12</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—Application for condonation delay in filing an appeal under the Special Powers Act is not maintainable. And such an appeal when time-barred cannot be treated as a revisional application under CrPC. <em>Shamsul Haque vs State 43 DLR 247.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—The remand order amounts to a double jeopardy for the petitioners and offers a chance to the prosecution to remedy its lacuna. Such a remand should not be made. <em>Fazal vs State 43 DLR 40.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—Application for condonation of delay in filing an appeal under the Special Powers Act is not maintainable. And such an appeal when time-barred cannot be treated as a revisional application under CrPC. <em>Shamsul Haque vs State 43 DLR 247.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—The remand order amounts to a double jeopardy for the petitioners and offers a chance to the prosecution to remedy its lacuna. Such a remand should not be made. <em>Fazal vs State 43 DLR 40.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—High Court Division in exercise of its power under section 439 CrPC has no jurisdiction to review any order of the Labour Court passed under section 26 of the Employment of Labour (Standing Orders) Act.<br/>The application on which the instant Rule was issued and was filed under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. We, therefore, find that this Court has no jurisdiction to review any order of the Labour Court passed under section 26 of the Employment of Labour (Standing Orders) Act, 1965. <em>Jagodish Chandra Dutta vs MH Azad 41 DLR 257.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—This Court for rectification of injustice may also go into facts, if in the determination of any question of facts, onus is wrongly placed upon any party or an incorrect principle has been applied in determining the question of fact or any material piece of evidence has been ignored or due to misconception of law, a wrong view has been taken by the court below.<br/>This court having paternal and supervisory jurisdiction can certainly, in the interest of justice, scrutinise and go into facts and examine the propriety of the impugned order or finding in question. In this view of ours, we are supported by a number of decisions of this court reported in 35 DLR (AD) 127 (Shafiqur Rahman vs Nurul Islam Chowdhury), 18 DLR (SC) 289 (Feroze Khan vs Captain Ghulam Nabi Khan), 15 DLR (SC) 150 (Muhammad Sami Ullah Khan vs State).<em> Khandakar Md Moniruzzaman vs State 47 DLR 341.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—The acquittal of co-accused whose case stands on the same footing as that of the appellants’ cannot be a ground for their acquittal when there is sufficient evidence on record justifying their conviction. A suo motu Rule is issued against acquitted accused to show cause why the order of their acquittal shall not be set aside and be not convicted like the appellants as they too appear to be involved in the offences proved against the appellants. <em>Abdul Ali vs State 46 DLR 338.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—In exercise of revisional jurisdiction High Court Division can in appropriate cases disturb findings of fact. <em>Moslem All Mollah alias Moslem Molla vs State 48 DLR 427</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—নিম্ন আদালত সাক্ষ্য প্রমাণ বিবেচনা করে যে সিদ্ধান্তে উপনীত হয়েছেন তার সাথে দ্বিমত পোষণ করলেই রিভিসন মামলার আসামীদের খালাসের আদেশ বাতিল করে দিয়ে মামলা পুনঃ বিচারে পাঠান সঠিক নয় । শুধুমাত্র নিম্ন আদালতের সিদ্ধান্ত স্পষ্টতঃ ভ্রমাত্বক বা নায়ভ্রস্ট হলে বা নথি অস্পস্ট হলে বা আদালতের এখতিয়ার ত্রুটি পূর্ণ হলেই খালাসের আদেশ বাতিল করে দিয়ে মামলা পুনঃবিচারে পাঠান উচিত । <em>Abdul Aziz vs Sekendar Ali 50 DLR 111.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—The High Court Division may also suo motu call for the record of the courts subordinate to it and set aside any order passed by such courts in any legal proceeding which has caused miscarriage of justice. <em>Reazuddin Ahmed vs State 49 DLR (AD) 64.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—It is to be borne in mind that the High Court Division does not function as a court of revision for permitting the guilty person to escape the just reward of their misdoing on the ground of an unsubstantial technicality. Whether or not the High Court Division will exercise its Revisional jurisdiction in a given case must depend upon the facts and circumstances of that case only. <em>Syed Ahmed vs Abdul Khaleque 51 DLR 43.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—Merely because the court deciding a revision may arrive at a different conclusion would be justifiable in reversing the decision of the trial Court unless it is possible to demonstrate with certainty that none of the grounds upon which trial Court acquitted the accused is at all supportable. <em>Ali Akbar vs State 51 DLR 268.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—The judgment of the trial Court lacks in certain essential findings in respect of the offence but this by itself cannot be a sufficient ground for acquittal of the accused persons on appeal of in the face of evidence on record proving their guilt. <em>Jahiruddin Ahmed vs Yasinuddin 52 DLR 97.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—As a rule of practice Court regards 60 days as the period of limitation for filing a criminal revision. In spite of this, nothing prevents the Court from entertaining a revisional application filed beyond 60 days when the applicant can satisfy the Court that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from filing the revision earlier. <em>Khadem Ali vs State 52 DLR 281.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—A Court may cancel the bail granted either by itself or by a Court subordinate to it when allegations for cancellation are made by giving substantive proof of overt act on the part of the accused against the prosecution witness and not merely on vague, wild and general allegations. <em>Mainuddin Chowdhury &amp; others vs State 53 DLR 416.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—Any person could bring to the notice of Court an illegality or material irregularity in the conduct of judicial proceedings by invoking revisional powers of the High Court Division under section 439 of the Code. <em>Abdur Rahman Kha vs State 56 DLR 213.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—In the instant case, there is no cogent reason to send the case back on remand on the flimsy ground that the prosecution has failed to file Kabinnama properly. Hence, retrial be allowed for ends of justice. <em>Ashraful Alam State 57 DLR 718.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—The revisional court does not interfere with the concurrent findings of fact save in exceptional circumstances as when a question of law of general public importance arises or a decision shocks the conscience of the Court. <em>Montu vs State 57 DLR 504.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—The revisional court is to look into the question whether there has been gross negligence on the part of the petitioner or inordinate delay in moving the revision application. <em>Khaled Ahmed Chowdhury vs State 57 DLR 694.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—Court can take suo motu cognisance of the matter under section 439, CrPC and set aside the conviction and sentence of other accused persons even though they were tried and convicted and sentenced in absentia and could not prefer any appeal. <em>Abdus Sattar @ A. Sattar @ Sottar vs State 58 DLR 415.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439</strong>—In view of the fact that the petitioner was aged only 17 at the time of occurrence and there is no specific act of violence attributed to him, the maximum sentence awardable under the section is felt to be inappropriate and unwarranted. <em>Rafiqul Islam vs State 58 DLR 362.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439 &amp; 439A</strong>—Revisional power of the High Court Division—It is true that the party in a revision case under section 439A is debarred from agitating his point before the High Court Division under section 439 of the Code, but the power has not been restricted by any clause of section 439 or by any law if it is considered necessary to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court. The order of the Sessions Judge being not in accordance with law requires interference and the aid of section 561A of the Code can be appropriately invoked there being no scope for a second revision. <em>Dr Md Abdul Baten vs State 43 DLR 60.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439 &amp; 435</strong>—The Additional Sessions Judge did not point out any illegality or irregularity in recording the evidence of witnesses examined by the prosecution or in the trial Court’s refusal to examine any witness produced. In such circumstances there was no justification for the Judge to make order permitting to examine witnesses at the time of fresh trial on remand that was ordered. <em>Shamsul Haque Bhuiyan vs State 49 DLR 37.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439 &amp; 561A</strong>—Session 561A has been put under Chapter XLVI of the Code as “Miscellaneous;” so an application under this section must be registered as a miscellaneous case and not as a revision case under section 439(1) or under both sections. <em>Sher Ali vs State 46 DLR (AD) 67.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439, 439A &amp; 561A</strong>—Propriety of exercising jurisdiction under section 561A CrPC to quash Magistrate’s order drawing up proceeding under section 145 CrPC—As the High Court Division’s revisional jurisdiction is concurrent with that of the Sessions Judge and although the High Court Division could decline to interfere for not moving the Sessions Judge, the interference that has been made cannot be said to be without jurisdiction. Jurisdiction under section 561A CrPC is not ousted in the presence of the revisional jurisdiction of the Sessions Judge under section 439A of the Code. The only question will be, has any case been made out either under section 439 or 561A of the Code? The answer will vary from case to case. <em>Samirun Nessa vs Kamaluddin 43 DLR (AD) 175.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439 &amp; 497</strong>—Since the petitioner did not get any opportunity to resist the application for cancellation of his bail and to present his case for maintaining the order granting him bail, the impugned order cancelling bail is set aside and the court in seisin of the case is directed to consider the matter afresh. <em>Harun vs State 51 DLR 33.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439, 497(5) &amp; 498</strong>—Section 497(5) gives power to High Court Division to cancel bail to accused admitted on bail. Section 498 of the code does not empower High Court Division or Court of Sessions again to admit an accused on bail after his cancellation of bail. In the event of cancellation of bail by a Court of Session the accused again cannot invoke jurisdiction under section 498 of the Code and the remedy that lay for him is invoking Revisional Power under section 439 of the Code. <em>Mohashin Ali Pramanik vs State 55 DLR 259.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439 &amp; 498</strong>—Whenever a matter is brought to the notice of High Court Division and High Court Division is satisfied that a case is made out for exercising Revisional power suo moto, it can always do so in the interest of justice and can treat an incompetent proceeding to be a proceeding under section 439 of the Code. <em>Mohashin Ali Pramanik vs State 55 DLR 259.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439(4) and 439A(2)</strong>—No Second revision lies in view of the law in Sections 439(4) and 439(A)(2) of the CrPC. The purported distinction sought to be drawn by the learned Judge of the High Court Division was mis-conceived and the obiter was unwarranted. <em>Hazi Golam Hossain vs Abdur Rahman Munshi 40 DLR (AD) 196.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439(4) &amp; 561A</strong>—Under section 561A the exercise of inherent power is not restricted by any clause like section 439—The Court can exercise this power.<br/>So we think it proper to exercise the inherent power under section 561A the exercise of which is not restricted by any clause like section 439. In section 439 of the Code there is a bar, as subsection (4) of the section provides to the effect that in an appealable case the party who has right to appeal cannot invoke section 439. But there is no such restriction in section 561A. <em>Khalilur Rahman vs State 41 DLR 385.</em><br/><strong>Sections 439(4) &amp; 439A</strong>—The idea of the High Court Division that both the courts—one under section 439(4), the other under section 439A—are equal in power and the judgment of one is the judgment of another, appears to be grotesque displaying perversity of thought. <em>Sher Ali (Md) vs State 46 DLR (AD) 67.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439(4) &amp; 561A</strong>—As there is nothing in the impugned order requiring to prevent abuse of the process of the Court or to secure the ends of justice, the revisional application is barred under the amended provision of section 439(4) of the CrPC.<em> Anower Hossain vs Md Idrish Miah 48 DLR 295.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439(4)</strong>—Scope of a revision against an order of acquittal is very limited in view of the provision of sub-section (4) of section 439 of the Code and decisions of the higher courts.<br/>If the informant could prefer an appeal on the failure of the state to do so then the result could have been otherwise. Moreover, complainant has been given a limited right of appeal against an order of acquittal under the amended sub-section (2) of section 417 of the Code only on the ground of error of law. In such circumstances informant should also be given right to prefer appeal like the complainant and both of them right of appeal on the grounds of error of fact as well. <em>Ali Akbar State 51 DLR 268.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439(4), 439A &amp; 561A</strong>—No Court can claim inherent jurisdiction to exercise power expressly taken away by legislation.<br/>Where there is an express provision in the Code barring the exercise of a particular jurisdiction (as under section 439) of this Court the jurisdiction may not be exercised under a general provision of the Code as under section 561A of the Code. In this connection reference may be made to the case of Kumar Singh Chhayor vs Emperor reported in AIR 1946 (Privy Council) 169 (172) wherein the Privy Council held that “no court can claim inherent jurisdiction to exercise powers expressly taken away by legislation” The instant application is hit by both sections 439A(2) and 439A of the Code<em>. Abdul Jalil vs State 47 DLR 167.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439(4), 439A &amp; 561A</strong>—The Sessions Judge’s decision is not final in relation to a person who has not filed the revisional application to the Sessions Judge but has been impleaded therein as opposite party. He is free to go to any appropriate forum to challenge the Sessions Judge’s decision. But he cannot go to the High Court Division with another revisional application, as such, an application—better known as second revision—is expressly barred by section 439.<br/>Though the High Court Division cannot entertain any application under section 439(1) from a decision of the Sessions Judge under section 439A, still it can interfere with the Sessions Judge’s order by invoking its inherent for the limited purposes as set out in that, section namely, ‘to give effect to any order under Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure ends of justice’. <em>Sher Ali vs State 46 DLR (AD) 67.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439A</strong>—Jurisdiction of the Sessions Judge under section 439A is co-extensive with the revisional jurisdiction of this Court in all matters except quashing a proceeding.<br/>After the insertion of section 439A Sessions Judge in exercise of revisional power can set aside any order of the subordinate Criminal Court in addition to directing further enquiry under section 436 of the Code but cannot quash a proceeding. <em>Abdul Hai vs State 50 DLR 551.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439A</strong>—Where the State does not file any appeal against the order of acquittal in a police case the informant is competent to prefer revision before the Sessions Judge who can look into the legality or propriety of the order of acquittal. But the Court of revision cannot convert a finding of acquittal into a finding of conviction. <em>Amjad Hossain vs State 49 DLR 64.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439A &amp; 173</strong>—So far as the direction by the Sessions Judge to hold further investigation into the case is concerned, it is quite lawful; but his direction to submit charge-sheet is clearly without jurisdiction.<br/><em>Per Mustafa Kamal J (agreeing)</em>: By making absurd comments, uninformed criticisms and vituperative innuendos on the judgments of the Appellate Division the learned Judges have placed themselves well inside the perimeter of contempt of this court. By openly, blatantly and consciously flouting Article. 111 they have also put themselves within the Ain bit of steps to refer the matter to the Supreme Judicial Council. Yet we decide to follow the course to caution the learned Judges not to repeat the performance in future.<br/>It will be useful for all to remember that as human beings are not infallible, the judgments of the Appellate Division are too not infallible. Yet in all disciplined and constitutional societies and governments, the pronouncements of the highest Court are given a finality and a binding effect for the simple reason that there must be a finality to litigation at some point and that there must be judicial discipline, the lower judicial hierarchy being bound by the decision of the higher judicial hierarchy. To allow or even to tolerate a breach of this time-honoured and constitutionally fixed duty is to invite judicial anarchy and judicial indiscipline. This will create confusion in the administration of is justice and erode people’s confidence in the orderly and disciplined dispensation of justice under the Constitution. We hope that the learned Judges will appreciate the merit of judicial restraint and will desist in future from the temptation of treading on a beaten path.<br/><em>Per Latfur Rahman J (agreeing)</em>: The pronouncement in respect of the power and jurisdiction of the High Court Division with regard to 561A of Code having been clearly stated in several decisions of this Division, it does not lie in the mouth of the High Court Division to take a contrary view of the same. The judgments of this Division as per the mandate of Article 111 of our Constitution is binding on the High Court Division. It is a clear violation of the Constitutional mandate by the learned Judges of the High Court Division. Is it not a violation of the oath of Office of a Judge to protect and preserve the Constitution of Bangladesh?<em> Sher All vs State 46 DLR (AD) 67.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439 &amp; 439A</strong>—A second revision does not lie under section 439 of the Code against the judgment and order of the Sessions Judge passed under section 439A of the Code as the same has been made an absolute bar under sub-section (4) of section 439 of the Code. <em>Mariam Begum vs State 53 DLR 226.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439A &amp; 561A</strong>—lnherent jurisdiction whether available to one losing in revision— The inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Division will be available even to a party who has lost in revision before the Sessions Judge. But it must be clearly borne in mind that the powers under section 561A being extraordinary in nature, should be exercised sparingly and where such exercise is essential and justified by the tests specially laid down in the provision itself. <em>Aminul Islam vs Mujibur Rahman 45 DLR (AD) 9.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439A &amp; 561A</strong>—Sessions Judge acted illegally and without jurisdiction in quashing the proceeding of the case pending in the Court of Sadar Upazila Magistrate in exercise of his power under section 439A of the Code of Criminal Procedure because the power of quashing a proceeding is available only under section 561A CrPC.<em> Zahurullah vs Nurul Islam 48 DLR 386.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439A &amp; 561A</strong>—Revisional jurisdiction of the High Court Division—Revision in a case arising out of section 145 CrPC. A party who has been unsuccessful in revision under section 439A CrPC is not totally debarred from invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court Division under section 561A. The opening words of this latter section—”Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent power of the High Court Division” repels any contention of such debarment<em>. Aminul Islam vs Mujibur Rahman 44 DLR (AD) 56.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 440</strong>—Under section 440 of the Code a party or his Advocate has no right to be heard by a court exercising revisional power and it is the discretion of the court to hear such a party or his advocate.<br/>If an Advocate fails to appear at the time of hearing of a criminal revision for whatever reason, this court cannot allow him to be heard by reopening the matter setting aside a judgment already pronounced and signed. <em>Serajul Islam vs Faziul Hoque 47 DLR 480.</em><br/> </div></div></div>

High Court Division issued a suo motu Rule in Criminal Revision No. 43 of 1986, upon the appellants and two Advocates to show cause as to why a complaint should not be lodged against them under section 476 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as they appeared to have practised fraud upon the Court by filing a false petition of compromise. The Rule against the appellants was made absolute, but it was discharged against the two Advocates. Hence this appeal. <em>Abdul Gafur vs State 41 DLR (AD) 127.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 476</strong>-A Tribunal constituted under section 26 of the Special Powers Act is also required to follow the provisions of section 476 of the Code of Criminal Procedure if it likes to proceed against any witness of a case for commission of offence under section 193 of the Penal Code. <em>Idris Miah (Md) vs State 50 DLR 629.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 476</strong>-A Tribunal constituted under section 26 of the Special Powers Act is also required to follow the provisions of section 476 of the Code of Criminal Procedure if it likes to proceed against any witness of a case for commission of offence under section 193 of the Penal Code. Idris Miah vs State 50 DLR 629.<br/><br/><strong>Section 476-</strong>The Court has enough power to lodge complaint without holding any enquiry when from the proved facts he is prima fade satisfied that an offence has been committed before him in a proceeding or in relation thereto even without hearing the party complained against. <em>Naogaon Rice Mills Ltd vs Pubali Bank Ltd 56 DLR 543.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 476</strong>—It appears that under the provision of section 476 of the Code of Criminal Procedure any court is empowered to send for appropriate steps against a person who is alleged to have created a forged document and submitted the same in a proceeding as an evidence in order to obtain a legal benefit out of the said forged document. But before embarking upon the provision of section 476 of the Code of Criminal Procedure it is the precondition of the provision that the proceeding in which the forged document has been filed must have been ended and any application under section 476, Code of Criminal Procedure filed by any party before that court cannot be considered unless the proceeding in which the said forged document has been filed has ended. <em>Noor Alam Hossain vs State 59 DLR 322.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 476</strong>—The provision laid down in section 476 of the Code does not make the preliminary inquiry an obligatory one, rather it is left to the court making it discretionary which should be judicially exercised. <em>Abu Yousuf vs State 62 DLR 421.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 480 and 482</strong>—The Tribunal shall have the same powers as vested in a Civil Court for the purpose of inquiry and every enquiry as such shall be-deemed to be judicial proceeding within the meaning of sections 193 and 228 of the Penal Code—A Tribunal shall be deemed to be a Civil Court for the purposes of sections 480 and 482 CrPC. <em>Muhammad Raushan Ali vs Bangladesh Bar Council 42 DLR 201.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 488</strong>—Provision of the Family Courts Ordinance 1985 have not taken away the power of a Magistrate to order for maintenance under section 488 CrPC. The Sessions Judge committed error of law in setting aside the order of maintenance passed by the Magistrate.<br/><br/>It can safely be presumed that our law makers while promulgating Ordinance No. XVIII of 1985 had in view the provisions of the Family Court Act of Pakistan and in spite of that the word ‘suit’ was specifically and unambiguously used in section 5 instead of the word ‘matters’ which has been used in the Pakistan law. The term ‘matters’ has wider meaning than the term ‘suit’ and the former term definitely includes civil suits as well as criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings. And in spite of that, section 20 as quoted above appearing in the Pakistan law made specific provision for vesting the judges of the family Courts which the power under section 488 CrPC. <em>Meher Negar vs Mojibur Rahman 47 DLR 18.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 488</strong>—Family Courts can entertain, try and dispose of any suit relating to or arising out of maintenance but as section 488 CrPC does not empower the Magistrate to entertain, try and dispose of any suit i.e. any matter of civil nature, power of Magistrate under section 488 CrPC has not been ousted consequent to the establishment of the Family Courts, <em>Rezaul Karim vs Rashida Begum 48 DLR 416.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 488</strong>—Plaintiffs suit for enhanced maintenance for her daughter under the Ordinance upon fresh cause of action is maintainable notwithstanding the earlier order of the Magistrate in exercise of jurisdiction under section 488 CrPC. <em>Kowsar Chowdhury vs Latifa Sultana 54 DLR175.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 488</strong>—Order of maintenance of wife and son—the purpose of the Family Courts Ordinance is to provide for speedy disposal of family matters by the same forum. There will be anomaly and multiplicity of proceedings if, in spite of the establishment of Family Courts, the Magistrate continues to entertain cases for maintenance. Provisions made in the Family Courts Ordinance have ousted the jurisdiction of the Magistrates to entertain application for maintenance which is a family court matter. <em>Md Abdul Khaleque vs Selina Begum 42 DLR 450.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—High Court may pass an order under section 491 CrPC at any time. The phrases “illegally” or “improperly” used in the sub-section (b) of section 491 of the Code mean that when a person is not detained within the provisions of any law, the detention becomes an illegal detention. The scope of section 491 CrPC is wider than the scope of constitutional provision. (Article 102 of the Constitution). <em>Syeda Rezia Begum vs Bangladesh 40 DLR 210.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—And Constitution of Bangladesh (as amended upto date) Article 102—Court’s duty to hear the matter and pronounce its decision at the earliest without waiting for Advisory Board’s report regarding the legality or otherwise of the detenu’s detention beyond the scope of the Special Powers Act.<br/><br/>In view of the clear provisions of section 491 CrPC (as well as under Article 102 of the Constitution) it is the duty of this Court to hear the matter giving opportunity to both the parties to make their written and oral submissions and pronounce its decision as early as possible without waiting for the Advisory Board to report its opinion to the Government regarding the question whether the detenu is being illegally detained beyond the scope of the Special Powers Act, 1974. <em>Dr Md Habibullah vs Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 41 DLR 160.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—Production of victim girl before the Upazila Court for determination of age and also in the matter of her custody.<br/>In the matter of guardianship and custody of the person of a minor the court may put the minor in the custody of an appropriate person for the minor’s welfare or may keep the minor in neutral custody. <em>Sukhendra Chandra Das vs Secretary Ministry of Home Affairs 42 DLR 79.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—Habeas Corpus—Extension of detention after expiry of initial period of detention —Order dated 22-5-1989 by the Ministry of Home Affairs was made after the expiry of 30 days from the date of first order of detention by the Additional District Magistrate. The Government have not been authorised to extend the period of detention with retrospective effect. The detenu is therefore detained under an illegal order of detention and is directed to be released forthwith. <em>Momtaz Sultana vs Secretary Ministry of Home Affairs 42 DLR 457.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—Determination of age of a person in custody for the purpose of her guardianship—Isolated statement of her father in such a case in respect of her age cannot be accepted as true unless it is supported by “corroborative evidence. If a girl is found below 16 and taken away without the consent of the guardian then it will be an offence and the guardian will be entitled to her custody. Even if it is presumed that at time of occurrence of her kidnapping the detenu was minor but now when she is found major the Court has no jurisdiction to, compel her to go with her father<em>. Manindra Kumar Malakar vs Ministry of Home Affairs 43 DLR 71.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—Directions of the nature of a Habeas Corpus, scope of—The argument that the scope of section 491 CrPC is narrower than that of Article 102 of the Constitution has no force. Its scope is not hedged by constitutional limitation. In constitutional provision it is to be seen whether the detenu is being held without any lawful authority and in a matter under section 491 it is only required to be seen whether the detention order is illegal and/or improper. <em>Pearu Md Ferdous Alam Khan for Serajul Alam Khan (Detenu) vs State 44 DLR 603.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—The High Court Division can exercise its jurisdiction not only in declaring the detention of the detenu illegal but also declaring the proceedings upon which the detenu was held in detention to be illegal and void. <em>State vs Deputy Commissioner Satkhira. 45 DLR 643.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—Judicial custody—Dispute over custody of alleged victim girl—Why father is refused to have her custody—A girl has been kept now in judicial custody though she is neither an accused or a witness in the relevant case. The custody or detention of a victim girl is different from that of a criminal or a political detenu. Judicial custody has the complexion of the custody of a guardian. This custody is necessary for giving the girl a chance to make up her mind and develop her independent opinion free from external influence. The facts and circumstances of each case will determine as to how and when the inherent discretion of the court for judicial is to be exercised. <em>Dr Kazi Mozammel Haque vs State 45 DLR 197.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—The girl’s age at the time of occurrence may be relevant for the alleged offence committed but for the purpose of custody the girl’s present age is more pertinent. <em>Nurunnahar Khatun vs State 46 DLR 112.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>— When there has been a judgment and conviction passed by a Court, the High Court cannot interfere under section 491 on the ground of discovery of irregularities.<br/><br/>Section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure could come into play only when there was an illegal detention by an Executive Order by private individuals or even by a Court if the Court had no jurisdiction to try the case. A court having jurisdiction to try a case has a jurisdiction also to arrive at its own conclusion however wrong. <em>Bakul Miah vs Government of Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Bangladesh Secretariat, Dhaka 46 DLR 530.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—Judicial custody of victim girl —As soon as the girl attains the age of 18 years from 1-12-1978 she must be released from thea judicial custody on her own bond even if the criminal case in which she is kept in custody remains pending. <em>Hasina Begum vs State 48 DLR 300.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—When it is found fro4 materials on record that the alleged victim girl is aged above 16 and not an accused in the case, the order of her judicial custody is set aside and the Deputy Commissioner is directed to set her at liberty. <em>Tarapada Sarker vs State 49 DLR 360.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—In the appeal against the order of bail the matter of custody of the victim girl was not to be decided. The Court should have considered the Miscellaneous Case filed by the appellant under section 491 CrPC on merit. <em>Bashu Dev Chatterjee vs Umme Salma 51 DLR (AD) 238.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—The Judges were not sitting in appeal or revision as would entitle them to proceed with the matter even in the absence of the parties. The only course open was to dismiss the Miscellaneous Case for default of the petitioner. <em>Bashu Dev Chatterjee vs Umme Salma 51 DLR (AD) 238.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—Having considered all aspects of the matter it will be in the best interest of the girl if she is released from custody and given to the care of her father. it is also necessary to see that the accused does not feel prejudiced at the trial because of the girl remaining under the care of the informant. The accused will be at liberty to pray before the trial Court for her production in Court if it is found necessary. <em>Bashu Dev Chatterjee vs Umme Salma 51 DLR (AD) 238.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—Primary evidence being there that the girl is minor and that she is the victim of an offence it is right and proper that the girl should stay with her parents rather than be given to the family of the accused. The girl cannot be allowed to make her own choice because, prima facie, it appears that she is a minor. <em>Jharna Rani Saha vs Khondaker Zayedul Hoque alias Jahangir 52 DLR (AD) 66.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—When a person was put into judicial custody by an order of a competent court of law unless that order is set aside detention cannot be considered as illegal. <em>Tarun Karmaker vs State 53 DLR 135.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—In view of the provisions of section 491(1)(b) the present application under section 491 is not maintainable as the detenu was put into custody by an order of the Sessions Judge and as the same order is still in force. <em>Tarun Karmaker vs State and ors 53 DLR 135.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—There are five clauses under sub-section(1) and there are 3 sub-sections in this section but none empower the Court to determine the question of custody of any minor. <em>Tarun Karmaker vs State 53 DLR 135.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—When there is only an ad interim bail and that too for a limited period this Court is not inclined to interfere in the matter. <em>Bangladesh vs Md Naziur Rahman 54 DLR (AD) 157.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—An order of detention passed on fictitious vague and indefinite grounds and founded on colourable satisfaction affecting the right of a citizen, and not in the larger interest of the society and public at large, must be quashed. <em>Aftab Hossain (Md) vs Bangladesh 54 DLR 266.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—The detenu Rahat having been detained to abstain himself from perpetrating torture/repression in the locality of Kamrangirchar under Nadim Group terrorists, of the detention order is well-grounded in the fact and circumstances of the case. <em>Abul Member and Abul Hassain vs Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 54 DLR 392.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—An application under this section cannot be rejected on the ground that no statement has been made as to the locus standi of the petitioner to challenge the order of detention or as to how the petitioner is aggrieved by the order of detention, if full particulars of the detenu and the detention are there. <em>Zilaluddin (Md) vs Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 54 DLR 625.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—An application under section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is maintainable for custody of a minor to see that the minor is not held illegally and in an improper manner. <em>Abdul Majid Sarker vs State 55 DLR (AD) 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—A preventive detention is the deprivation of the liberty of a citizen, which right should not be taken away in an arbitrary manner. So this Court enjoys power to review the actions of the detaining authority under Articles 102(2)(b)(i) of the Constitution and under section 491 of the Code. <em>Anwar Hossain vs State 55 DLR 643.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—The right to obtain a direction under section 491 of the Code in the nature of a habeas corpus is a statutory right on the grounds recognised in the section and a part of the statutory right has become a part of the fundamental right guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution. <em>Anwar Hossain vs State 55 DLR 643.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—Whenever any authority is invested with a legal authority to make an order of detention to the prejudice of another person, such authority has the concomitant duty of acting judicially in making such an order on the basis of decision of consideration of some materials by observing the rule of natural justice. <em>Anwar Hossain vs State 55 DLR 643.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491</strong>—Detenu Nazma Akhter now aged 20 having been detained in the safe custody of “Nirapad Abason” since against her will prayer for her release from safe custody is allowed., her detention being improper and illegal. <em>Jatio Mahila Ainjibi Samity vs Bangladesh 59 DLR 447.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 491(3)</strong>—If after examining the material on the basis of which executive authority detained a person under the provisions of any law this court finds that there is no justification for detention, sub-section (3) of section 491 of the Code will not stand as a bar to declare the detention of the detenu as illegal. <em>Pranajit Barua vs State 50 DLR 399.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 492</strong>—The terms of appointment of the writ petitioner was solely based on confidence and satisfaction of the Government as to service he was rendering. The moment there is absence of confidence and satisfaction, it was within the domain of the Government to terminate the appointment. <em>Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice &amp; Parliamentary Affairs vs Md Borhan Uddin 56 DLR (AD) 131.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 492</strong>—When Government feels necessity of terminating appointment of a Public Prosecutor, questioning legality of termination of such appointment by a person claiming to be the informant of or the witness in the case can hardly; be considered legally well conceived. <em>SM Jillur Rahman vs Bangladesh 56 DLR (AD) 127.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 492 and 493</strong>—Interpretation of Statute—Public Prosecutor occupies a solemn and unique position in the Code of Criminal Procedure. <em>Dr SM Abu Taher vs State 42 DLR 138. </em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 492 and 493</strong>—Appointment of Public Prosecutor and authority of the PubIic.

Such mechanical order of withdrawal is contrary to the provision of section 494 of the Code. The Magistrate is directed to proceed with the case in accordance with law. <em>Altaf Hossain vs Kobed Ali 49 DLR 589.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 494</strong>-The trial Court having not accorded sanction for withdrawal of the case it cannot be said that the petitioners have acquired a vested right. Further, section 494 of the Code gives the authority only to a public prosecutor to file an application for withdrawal and, as such, the accused have no right to file an application for withdrawal. Apart from this the Tribunal after recording proper reasons have refused to accord consent for withdrawal of the case and, as such, no lawful grievance can be made on the merit as well. <em>Abdul Khaleque vs Md Hanf 49 DLR (AD) 134</em>.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 494</strong>—The offence under section 376 is not-compoundable and, as such, there is no question of withdrawal. <em>Sorbesh Ali vs Jarina Begum 49 DLR (AD) 143.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 494</strong>—Withdrawal from the prosecution is subject to consent by the trial Judge and when the accused persons are still absconding the discretion ought not to have been exercised<em>. Sreemall Prativa Rani Dey (Tirtha) vs Dr Mohammad Yousuf Chittagong Medical College 52 DLR (AD) 8.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 494</strong>-The consent mentioned in section 494 of the Code is not to be given mechanically. The Court is to exercise its function judicially before giving such consent which implies that the Court will have to examine the materials on which the Government decides withdrawal of a case. <em>Sreemati Prativa Rani Dey (tirtha) vs Dr Mohammad Yousuf Chittagong Medical College 52 DLR (AD) 8.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 494</strong>-The court is required to exercise judicially the function of according consent for withdrawal of any accused from prosecution—The consent should not be given mechanically. <em>Loskor Md Mostan Billah vs State 56 DLR 199.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 494</strong>-Withdrawal from prosecution —The judgment and order of the Tribunal Judge refusing to give consent to withdraw of the accused from prosecution cannot be found fault with nor there is any error in the judgment of the High Court Division. <em>State vs Md Amir Hamza 57 DLR (AD) 26.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 494</strong>-Though section 494 confers on the Public Prosecutor a wide power to withdraw from the prosecution, and the Court has j to exercise its power in relation to the facts and circumstances of the case in furtherance of cause of justice rather than as a hindrance to the object of the law. <em>Moezuddin (Md) vs State 59 DLR 222.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 494</strong>-The Additional Sessions Judge consented to the withdrawal from the prosecution of the accused opposite party No. 1 merely on the ground that the Ministry of Home Affairs decided to withdraw from the prosecution. The order cannot be said to be a legal one and the samei s liable to be interfered with. <em>Moezuddin vs State 59 DLR 222.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 494</strong>-Judicial exercise of the discretion means consideration of all the facts and circumstances of the case available to the Court and also of the grounds on which the withdrawal is sought. The very word “consent” occurring in section 494 of the Code clearly indicates that it is not to be considered lightly on the application of the Public Prosecutor without a careful and proper scrutiny of the grounds on which the application is based. <em>Shamsun Nahar vs State 60 DLR 1.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 494 &amp; 439</strong>—Consent mention in section 494 of the Code is not to be given mechanically. The court is to exercise its function judicially before giving such consent which implies that the court will have to examine the materials on which the Government decides on withdrawal of a case. ‘Consent’, as used in the section, means a consent freely given by a Court. Since the act of giving consent by the Court is a judicial act, the court is entitled to ask the Public Prosecutor the reasons for his withdrawal in order to judicially come to a decision. <em>Badar Biswas vs State 57 DLR 770.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 497</strong>— Bail—This section enjoins upon the Court to exercise judicial discretion in the matter of granting bail for ascertaining whether the materials placed before the court by the prosecution are of such a tangible nature that if left unrebutted, they may lead to the inference of guilt of the accused. In the present case there is no other materials on record other than the FIR and mere allegations thereof. The court thus committed an error in refusing bail in this case. <em>AKM Mosharraf Hossain vs State 44 DLR (AD) 246.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 497</strong>—As soon as the accused appears or brought before the Court and prays for bail the Sessions Judge should dispose of his application. If the Sessions Judge fails to dispose of the same there is no scope for allowing the accused to continue on the bail granted by the Magistrate, he is to be sent to jail custody.<br/>We have noticed in many cases that such orders allowing the accused to continue as before were written by the bench clerks and merely intialled by the Sessions Judges and allowing the accused to remain at large for long time delaying commencement of the trials. The sooner these practices of issuing notices and/or allowing the accused to continue as before are discontinued it is better for speedy trial of the Sessions cases. Sessions Judges should stop the practice of putting initials on such important orders written by the bench clerks. <em>Sohail Thakur vs State 51 DLR 199.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 497</strong>—Additional Sessions Judge is not bound by the bail granted by the Sessions Judge. If he refuses bail to an accused who was earlier granted bail by the Sessions Judge that cannot be construed as cancellation of bail granted by the Sessions Judge.<em> Sohail Thakur vs State 51 DLR 199.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 497</strong>—”Save in accordance with law” as mentioned in Article 32 not only refers to criminal law but also civil law which provides for arrest and detention, namely, for recovery of decretal dues and public dues. <em>State vs Faisal Alam Ansari 53 DLR (AD) 43.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 497</strong>—Section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is a procedural law and the accused having alleged to have committed a substantive offence of murder his liberty is curtailed. <em>State vs Faisal Alam Ansari 53 DLR (AD) 43.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 497 &amp; 498</strong>—Vires of the law has not been challenged in this case and therefore, we are not called upon to decide the Constitutionality of the law. Every law has a presumption of its Constitutionality. <em>State vs Moyezuddin Sikder 60 DLR (AD) 82.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 497 and 498</strong>—Bail—A person is not automatically debarred from getting bail merely because his name was mentioned in the charge-sheet. <em>Liaqat Sharif vs State 40 DLR 506.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Order for conditional bail is illegal and not proper. <em>AHM Siddique vs State 45 DLR (AD) 8.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Considering the statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure wherein no specific overt act involving the appellants with the killing of the victim is found the appellants are granted bail and if the trial starts the Sessions Judge will be free to take them into custody during trial. <em>Abdul Matin vs State 44 DLR (AD) 8.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>— Bail—It is not the prima facie case against the accused but reasonable grounds’ for believing that he has been guilty which prohibits granting of bail. The onus is on the prosecution to disclose those reasonable grounds. Court has to examine the data available in the case to find out whether reasonable grounds exist to connect the accused with the crime alleged. <em>Shaikh Shahidul Islam vs State 44 DLR (AD) 192.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>— Bail—Refusal of bail in a case of murder in which the accused was earlier exempted from trial—In view of Sessions Judge’s findings that non-submission of charge-sheet against the petitioner earlier was without valid reason, that he is a powerful man in the locality and there is a possibility of his influencing the witnesses has substance—there is no compelling reason to enlarge the petitioner on bail. <em>ASM Abdur Rob vs State 44 DLR 205.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Sentence for one year—The Court ought to have exercised discretion in granting bail to the appellants in view of the short sentence of imprisonment. <em>Saimuddin vs State 43 DLR (AD) 151.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Bail in a case where the sentence is of short duration—In the present case the - sentence is of two years and the disposal of the appeal in question normally takes time. In that circumstances the High Court Division ought to have exercised judicial discretion in the matter of granting bail to the appellants. The judicial discretion having not been properly exercised in the facts of the case the order is set aside and the appeal allowed. <em>Dhanu Mia vs State 43 DLR (AD) 119.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—High Court Division criminal revision cancelled the appellant’s when there was no new material before it and no allegation of tampering with the evidence. Co-accused against whom cognizance of a murder case has already been taken is already on bail. High Court Division did not exercise its judicial discretion properly in cancelling the appellant’s bail—Appellants to remain on bail already granted by Upazila Magistrate. <em>Bakul Howlader vs State 43 DLR (AD) 14.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>— Bail—Incriminating facts disclosed in the FIR after due inquiry by the inspecting team are reasonable grounds for believing that the petitioner is guilty of criminal breach of trust. The Session Judge has rightly rejected the petition for bail. <em>Mustafizur Rahman vs State 45 DLR 227.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Bail—When there is hardly any chance of abscondance of the appellant in the peculiar circumstances, the Court has found that he is entitled to bail—Appeal allowed. We need not consider the appellant’s contentions with regard to the order of conviction. In the peculiar circumstances of the case we think the appeallant is entitled to bail particularly where there is hardly any chance of abscondance. The respondent found it difficult to oppose the appellant’s prayer. <em>SM Shajahan Ali Tara vs State 41 DLR (AD) 112.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Anticipatory bail- Circumstances when such bail was granted by the High Court Division. The police went to the residence of the petitioner to arrest him on the basis of a case started upon a newspaper report. He was a candidate for the National Assembly election. His political rivals and enemies were bent upon defeating him by putting him in confinement through the help of the police. In such circumstances, the prayer for anticipatory bail was granted. <em>Zulfiqur Ali Bhutto vs State 43 DLR 312.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>-Bail—there was a free fight between the parties; the accused are in jail for 9 months, the case has not been sent to proper court for trial as yet and both sides have case against each other on the self-same matter—Hence it will not be unreasonable to enlarge the petitioners on bail till the trial starts when the trial Court will see whether they should continue on the same bail. <em>Shahidullah vs State 42 DLR 394.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>-There is no evidentiary value of confessional statement of the co-accused if not corroborated by the evidence. Serious view is also taken for violation of the direction not to arrest or harass the petitioner by a Division Bench of this Court in Writ Petition No. 3073 of 2006 for two months but the petitioner has been arrested before expiry of that period. The opposite party must explain it. Considering the above facts, the petitioner is enlarged on bail. <em>Badrud Doza vs State 58 DLR 529.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 498 and 517</strong>—An application for disposal of seized articles can be filed under section 517 of the Code before the proper Court after conclusion of trial. The High Court Division acted illegally and without jurisdiction in releasing the seized goods at the time of issuance of Rule in an application under section 498 of the Code. <em>State vs Abdur Rahim 58 DLR (AD) 65.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Successive bail petition, propriety of—The Judges were not right in taking the view that once a petition for bail is rejected no further application can be made and the remedy lies only in an appeal. It is also not right to say than an application for bail could not be filed before the Vacation Judge and that he had no jurisdiction to grant interim bail (when he was himself a party to the rejection of bail for the same accused earlier by the Division Bench). At the most, it may be said that it was indiscreet on the part of the Vacation Judge to grant bail in the facts of the case.<br/>In the application for bail before the Vacation Bench, it was not mentioned that prayers for bail had been refused earlier. For this suppression of fact alone the ad interim bail could have been cancelled. <em>MA Wahab vs State 42 DLR (AD) 223.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Bail matter—High Court Division admitted a criminal appeal but rejected the prayer for bail pending disposal of the appeal—Ad interim bail granted by tle Appellate Division at leave stage for two months cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely—ad-interim bail extended for six months more and meanwhile parties are directed to make sincere effoils for disposal of the appeals—on expiry of the extended period, prayer for bail is to be moved before the High Court Division. <em>Azizul Hoq vs State 42 DLR (AD) 284.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—The law permits granting of bail even in a case where there are such reasonable ground for refusing bail, in the case of any woman or any sick or infirm person.<br/>However, the respondent has not been granted bail upon these considerations but upon the view that there are no reasonable grounds for believing that she has been guilty of the offence alleged. The learned Attorney-General could not refer to any principle which has been allegedly violated by the High Court Division nor to any fact which has either been ignored or wrongly relied upon. <em>State vs Jobaida Rashid 49 DLR (AD) 119.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>-An earlier application for bail having been rejected on merits discarding the ground taken therein similar application subsequently filed without any new ground cannot be considered. Subsequent application must contain the information clearly about the earlier application(s) together with prominent heading such as second application or other application and so on and further that such application must be filed before the Bench which had rejected the earlier prayer(s), if of course that Bench is not in the meantime dissolved. <em>MA Malik vs State 48 DLR 18.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—The accused-petitioner is enlarged on anticipatory bail as it appears that the informant’s father is an influential man having easy access to the local executive authorities and in the facts of the case the apprehension of harassment cannot be ruled out. <em>MA Malik vs State 48 DLR 18.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Anticipatory bail—As the petitioner is not named in the FIR and the police were after him, they are directed not to arrest him, and if arrested, he should be enlarged on bail immediately. He is directed to surrender then to the Magistrate and pray for regular bail. <em>Abdul Wadud vs State 48 DLR 599.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Bail in pending trial—The Magistrate ordered for further investigation and the investigation is still pending. It is not certain j when the police will submit report after further investigation and when the case may be sent for trial. Considering the facts and circumstances the petitioner may be enlarged on bail. <em>Shahed Reza Shamim vs State 49 DLR 116.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>-Restrictive order imposed by the District Magistrate upon liberty of movement of the petitioner enlarged by the High Court Division on anticipatory bail is stayed and the Magistrate’s conduct is deprecated. <em>Ahad Miah vs State 49 DLR 200.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>-The petitioner, being a lady in custody for a considerable period of time and there being absence of materials that her husband holding illegal fire-arms in their residence, has absconded, she is enlarged on bail. <em>Jobaida Rashid, wife of Khandaker Abdur Rashid vs State 49 DLR 189.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>-Mere naming the accused in the charge-sheet without any prima facie material and the mere fact that in the occurrence the Head of the State with his family has been murdered and that this is a sensational case cannot be a ground for refusal of bail. <em>Jobaida Rashid, wife of Khandaker Abdur Rashid vs State 49 DLR 229.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>— Ordinarily when the petition is not pressed by the Advocate for the petitioner the same is rejected without expressing opinion. Since a Division Bench has already expressed opinion on the application and the judges differed in their opinion the difference should be resolved. There is no scope for not pressing the petition after it had been pressed and opinion expressed by the Division Bench. <em>Belayet Hossain Sharif vs State 50 DLR 242.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Merely because a person is respectable, influential or highly placed in the society by reason of his being rich or educated or politically connected or otherwise holding important post or office he cannot avoid the due course of the law to appear before the courts below and use High Court Division as a substitute of the subordinate courts. <em>Belayet Hossain Sharif vs State 50 DLR 242.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Power of granting anticipatory bail is very sparingly used by this Court to save a citizen from unnecessary harassment and humiliation in the hands of police on flimsy ground or with ulterior motive or out of political design. This power cannot be exercised in each and every case as a substitute to the exercise of such power by the court below. A person cannot be enlarged on anticipatory bail how high so ever he may be unless conditions for granting such bail are satisfied. <em>Belayet Hossain Sharif vs State 50 DLR 242.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>-Since the petitioner has meanwhile been enlarged on bail by the trial Court, the merit of the case is not touched while deciding the question of entitlement to anticipatory bail. <em>Belayet Hossain Sharif vs State 50 DLR 242.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>-In view of long detention of the accused petitioner for about two years without knowing when the trial of the case can be concluded and in view of the fact that some of the accused persons standing on the same footing have already been granted bail, the accused- petitioner should be granted bail.<em> MA Sattar vs State 50 DLR 258.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>-Anticipatory Bail—the offence with which the petitioner has been accused of being punishable with death or imprisonment for life anticipatory bail cannot be granted though he is an elected Chairman. <em>Abdur Rahman Molla vs State 50 DLR 401.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>— The petitioners of the respective Rule could not satisfy with cogent reason and materials the cause for not surrendering before the Court below. Orders of ad interim anticipatory bail granted by this Court are recalled and the petitioners are directed to surrender to their respective bail bond. <em>Dr Mominur Rahman alias Zinna vs State 50 DLR 577.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Anticipatory bail—The spouses are at loggerheads both having taken recourse to court. There is possibility of the respondent husband being harassed. It is, therefore, difficult to hold that the High Court Division has granted him bail unreasonably or unfairly. <em>State vs MA Malik 47 DLR (AD) 33.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Anticipatory bail—by the High Court Division directly is not granted as a matter of course except in exceptional cases such as physical inability to appear before the court of first instance, fear and lack of personal safety, lack of confidence and like circumstances (ref. Sadeq Ali’s case, 18 DLR (SC) 393.<br/><br/>In the instant case we find the proceeding to be at an initial stage. No charge has yet been framed and two of the petitioners are ladies and most of the accused are quite elderly citizens of the country and some of them are suffering from heart trouble. These facts along with the order attending facts and circumstances of his peculiar case, unique in nature in our history, would call for an exercise of the power of this Court granting bail and more so when the matter of bail on merits has been examined by this Court in extension before the lawyers of both sides. <em>Jahanara Imam vs State 46 DLR 315.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—If the trial is not concluded within a reasonable time, the petitioner can pray for bail in the appropriate court. <em>Emran Hossain vs State 1 DLR (AD) 137.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—ln an appeal against a short sentence bail should be ordinarily granted in exercise of a proper discretion because usually it takes time to hear the appeal.<br/>The learned Judge would be justified in refusing bail if he could ensure the disposal of the appeal within a reasonable time, i.e., within 3-6 months, otherwise the refusal of bail will be manifestly unjust. It is difficult to appreciate why not even stay of realisation of fine was granted which is usually allowed. It seems that there has not been a sufficient realization of the purpose of appeal, nor of the guidance given by this Division in the cited case. <em>Alaluddin vs State 51 DLR (AD) 162.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—The basic conception of the word “bail” is release of a person from the custody of police and delivery into the hands of sureties, who undertake to produce him in Court whenever required to do so.<br/>An accused person is said, at common law, to be admitted to bail, when he is released from the, custody of the officers of the Court and is entrusted to the custody of persons known as his sureties who are bound to produce him to answer at a specified time and place, the charge against him and who in default of so doing are liable to forfeit such sum as is specified when bail is granted.<br/><br/><strong>Per Latfur Rahman J (agreeing)</strong>: By anticipatory bail we mean bail in anticipation of arrest. The distinction is that bail is granted after arrest and anticipatory bail is granted in anticipation of arrest, and therefore, effective at the very moment of arrest. In other words, unlike a post-arrest order of bail, it is a pre-arrest order of release.<em> State vs Abdul Wahab Shah Chowdhury 51 DLR (AD) 242.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—On principle it is true that in case of concurrent jurisdiction the lower Court  should be moved first but it is not a hidebound rule.<br/><br/><strong>Per Latfur Rahman J (agreeing)</strong>: Section 498 of the Code speaks of the High Court Division or Court of Sessions and, as such, I hold that an accused person may seek bail in either of the Courts at his option. I do not find any justification in curtailing the power of the superior Court, keeping the same to the Court subordinate to it. <em>State vs Abdul Wahab Shah Chowdhury 51 DLR (AD) 242.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—If the power under section 498 is held to be subject to section 497 then the High Court Division will be precluded from considering the malafide nature of a proceeding in a particular case merely because there is a prima facie allegation of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life.<br/>A prayer for pre-arrest bail should be considered without any feeling of fetter of section 497 at the first instance but the general principle as laid down in that section should always be there at the back of the mind of the Court, particularly the nature of allegation made against the accused in a particular case involving him with the offence. <em>State vs Abdul Wahab Shah Chowdhury 51 DLR (AD) 242.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Pre-arrest bail is an exception to the general law and the Court will always bear in mind the caution of SA Rahman J in the case of Muhammad Ayub reported in 19 DLR (SC) 38.<br/>Generally speaking the main circumstances as would entitle an order for extraordinary remedy of pre-arrest bail is the perception of the Court upon the facts and materials disclosed by the petitioner before it that the criminal proceeding which is being or has been launched against him is being or has been taken with an ulterior motive, political or otherwise, for harassing the accused and not for securing justice, in a particular case. <em>State vs Abdul Wahab Shah Chowdhury 51 DLR (AD) 242.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Prayer for anticipatory bail may also be considered may occur if it is proved that on account of public commotion or other circumstances it is not possible for the petitioner to appear before the lower Court. <em>State vs Abdul Wahab Shah Chowdhuty 51 DLR (AD) 242.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—It may even be possible to successfully make a prayer for bail on merit in the facts of a particular case but that alone can never be a ground for granting a prayer for pre-arrest bail.<br/>This prayer, extraordinary as it is, can only be considered, as already stated, when it appears to the Court that the purpose of the alleged proceeding as far as the accused is concerned, is not what it purports to be, but to achieve a collateral purpose by abusing the process of law, such as, harassment, humiliation, etc. of the accused which cannot be permitted. <em>State vs Abdul Wahab Shah Chowdhury 51 DLR (AD) 242.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—It is the duty of the accused to surrender before the Court in which his case is pending. He cannot continue on anticipatory bail even after submission of the charge-sheet and taking of cognizance of offence by the Court. <em>Probir Kumar Chowdhury vs State 51 DLR 42.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—It is for the trial Court to piece together all the fragments of the evidence. Reading the statements under sections 164 and 161 CrPC there appears now reasonable grounds that the petitioner may be parties to a criminal conspiracy for killing the 4 leaders in jail. So the prayer for bail is rejected. <em>KM Obaidur Rahman vs State 51 DLR 51.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Ordinarily when warrant of arrest is issued against a person or a person is wanted in connection with a non-bailable offence of serious nature he is not entitled to get anticipatory bail. In this view, the ad interim anticipatory bail is recalled and the petitioners are directed to surrender to the Court below. <em>Mir Shahidul Islam vs State 51 DLR 506.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—When on the face of it prosecution case appears to be absurd and preposterous it would be unjust to refuse bail however serious and grave the allegation may be, because in a free and civil society liberty of a citizen can neither be circumscribed nor made subservient to of capricious enforcers of law, more so, when incarceration without trial stretches over a year and a half, without any date for hearing in sight. <em>Kawsar Alam Khan vs State 52 DLR 298.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—A Member of Parliament being enlarged on bail cannot avoid appearance before the trial Court simply on the plea that the Parliament is in session. <em>KM Obaidur Rahman vs State 55 DLR (AD) 6.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—The question of granting or refusing bail depends upon the particular circumstances of each case and the mere fact that an offence is punishable with death or life imprisonment is not by itself sufficient to refuse bail.<em> Captain (Retd) Nurul Huda vs State 55 DLR (AD) 33.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—The grant of bail is the discretion of the court and the Court could consider the exercise of discretion if it is satisfied in the facts and circumstances of the case that the trial cannot be concluded within the specified time. <em>Captain (Retd) Nurul Huda vs State 55 DLR (AD) 33.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong><strong>―</strong>The petitioner has been made an accused for alleged acts of forgery in creating affidavit and kabinnama and the subject matter of Criminal Proceeding has become, also, a subject matter of a suit in the Second Court of Assistant Judge, Chittagong and the petitioner and informant are a loggerheads. Exceptional and special circumstances appear to have existed for granting anticipatory bail to the petitioner. <em>Patwary Rafiquddin Haider vs State 55 DLR 241.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong><strong>―</strong>Non-compliance of direction of High Court Division by the Court below as to conclusion of trial of the case within 4 months will not create any right to the accused Harun to be entitled to get bail disregarding the allegation of overt act against him. Court of law must act upon materials on record to decide the question of granting or non granting of bail. <em>Harun-or-Rashid vs State 56 DLR 318.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>―The apprehension that there is possibility on the part of the petitioner to interfere with the process of investigation and of tampering with the evidence, has got no basis at all. The attending circumstances shown the petitioner deserve bail. <em>Dr Qazi Faruque Ahmed vs State represented by the Deputy Commissioner 56 DLR 600.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>―The deceased was killed in her husband’s house and naturally he was then her best custodian and he is supposed to know the cause of her death, but the story narrated in the UD Case which was ended in the final report creates presumption about the implication of the husband in the occurrence. Moreover, there is no cause to consider the prayer for his bail in the light of the decision referred which was given in an appeal. Azam Reza vs State 57 DLR 36.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>―As the petitioner has no f to surrender at this stage and police is aftei the accused-petitioner is enlarged on a bail for limited period till submission of police report. Shakawat Hassan vs State 57 DLR 244.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—When accused, is in custody he is not entitled to anticipatory bail. A Wadud Member vs State 59 DLR 586.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Since the accused-petitioners did not appear before the Magistrate nor took any step for recalling the warrant of his arrest, it is apparent that they are fugitives from justice having no protection of law. AKM Iflekhar Ahmed vs State 59 DLR 646.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—In view of the inordinate delay in holding trial and the law laid down by the Appellate Division in granting bail to an accused of non bailable offence if the trial is not concluded in the specified time the co-accused has been enlarged on bail, this Court is inclined to enlarge the appellant on bail. Abul Kalam vs State 60 DLR 254.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>―From the foregoing discussions and in view of the facts and circumstances of the case, we are led to hold that at this stage, the accused-petitioner cannot make any application for bail, far less anticipatory bail, under section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. Accordingly, the instant application for anticipatory bail is summarily turned down. Ali Ahsan Mujahid vs State 60 DLR 359.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—It appears that although charge-sheet has been submitted but charge has not yet been framed and, as such, completion of the trial is not likely to be soon. Furthermore, considering all the above matters we are inclined to grant bail to the accused-appellant. Ziad Ali Gazi vs State 61 DLR 807.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—On reference to the record of Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 13454 of 2008 we find that ad interim bail was granted to the victim petitioner treating her as accused-petitioner. This may be due to mistaken submission of her learned Advocate or due to inadvertence of the Court. Indeed, the victim was not an accused in the case. Question of her release or custody was not a matter for determination under section 498 of the Code. Not being an accused charged with commission of any offence she had no scope to seek bail under the provision of sections 496, 497 and 498. We have reason to find that application preferred by the victim under section 498 of the Code seeking bail was quite incompetent. It is difficult to maintain the order of ad interim bail in her favour either through inadvertence of the Court or mistaken submission of her Advocate. Aysha Begum vs State 61 DLR 493.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>—Anticipatory bail —Not to harass/arrest. If a fugitive surrenders before the High Court Division and prays for bail, it may either grant bail under section 498 of the Code, on the principle discussed or is obliged to hand him over to the police, to be dealt with in accordance with law. But directing the police not to arrest a fugitive, which the police is duty bound to do under the law, is an order beyond the ambit of the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law, known to us. This kind of order may impede the investigation and ultimately frustrate the administration of criminal justice. State vs Zakaria Pintu 62 DLR (AD) 420.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 498</strong>―The Court below has seen the CD and became sure about the transaction. The matter is still under investigation and if the mighty accused is granted bail the investigation of the case will be hampered as he holds very powerful position in the Anti-Corruption Commission. SM Sabbir Hasan vs State 63 DLR 368.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 498 and 499</strong>—The Tribunal has no power to impose a condition at all when it grants bail to an accused—Even the Tribunal is not competent to accept any offer of a condition by the accused in grantingbail beyond the pr-ovision of law. Rafiqul Islam vs State 58 DLR 244.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 500</strong>—When an accused is discharged pursuant to a final report that means that the accused has been discharged from custody under section 500 of the Code and not discharged from the case. Nurul Hoque vs Bazal Ahmed 48 DLR 327.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A</strong>—Post-mortem report although excluded from consideration while dealing with the prosecution ease due to its having been brought on record without compliance of the provision of section 509A, the defence could very well use and refer to any portion of the report for its own purpose and for assisting the Court in reaching its decision. Tariq Habibullah vs State 43 DLR 440.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A</strong>—Post-mortem report—For bringing such report in evidence strict compliance of section 509A of the Code is necessary. The report of the post-mortem examination was neither produced by the doctor who had held the post-mortem examination nor the doctor was examined as a witness in the trial. While producing the report PW 7, an Investigating Officer, had shown no cause explaining the circumstances under which the doctor could not be produced in court. Tariq Habibullah vs State 43 DLR 440.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A</strong>—Post-mortem report—The trial Court committed error of law in considering and relying upon the post-mortem report when it was produced in court without fulfilling the requirements of section 509A. Khelu Mia vs State 43 DLR 573.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A</strong>—Report of post-mortem examination—As the doctor concerned who held the post-mortem examination was not examined although he was available in the country at the relevant time, the report was not legally admitted into evidence and as such the conviction based thereon is illegal. Abdul Quddus vs State 44 DLR 441.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A—</strong>Post-mortem report is an admissible evidence when three requirements laid down in the section are satisfied. Ezahar Sepai vs State 40 DLR 177.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A</strong>—The post-mortem report was not a substantive evidence before insertion of section 509A in the Code of Criminal Procedure by Ordinance No. 24 of 1982. Ezahar Sepai vs State 40 DLR 177.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A</strong>—Non-examination of the doctor was not fatal for the prosecution case. Conviction can be based on the evidence of a solitary witness if the testimony is not tainted with suspicion. Ezahar Sepai vs State 40 DLR 177.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A</strong>—Ext. 13, post-mortem report of the deceased, has been admitted into evidencei in utter violation of the mandatory provisions of section 509A. The doctor who held the post-mortem on each of the dead bodies was not examined during the trial. Md Ali Haider vs State 40 DLR 97.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A</strong>—This section is an exception to the requirement of law that the evidence of the doctor who prepared the post-mortem report is material. Its condition therefore must be strictly fulfilled by the prosecution. The prosecution filed an application for issuing warrant against Dr M Billah Azad for his appearing in Court, and it was allowed by the order dated 29-2-88. It does not appear from the record that after the application filed by Dr M Billah Azad, any summons was issued and served on him or the said warrant of arrest was executed. Nevertheless, the prosecution filed an application on 1-3-88 vaguely stating that his present address was not known, although his address was available in the record. The learned Sessions Judge, it seems, without noticing the conditions of section 509A of the Code of Criminal Procedure accepted the post-mortem report as Ext.10 Learned Sessions Judge illegally admitted into evidence the said post-mortem report without noticing that the prosecution did not care to fulfil the conditions of section 509A Ext. 10 is thus inadmissible in evidence and so there remains no positive proof as to the cause of Amiruddin’s death. State vs Fulu Mohammad 46 DLR 160.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A</strong>—The doctor who examined the victim girl was not available and therefore another doctor PW 9 was examined to prove the handwriting of the examining doctor. His report was admissible in law. Sobesh Ali vs Jarina Begum 49 DLR (AD) 143.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A</strong>—This section is an exception to the requirement of law that the evidence of the doctor who prepared the post-mortem report is material. Its condition therefore must be strictly fulfilled by the prosecution. State vs Fulu Mohammad 46 DLR 160.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A</strong>—The case is the outcome off admitted enmity between the parties—The failure to examine the doctor who held post-mortem examination on the body of the deceased to together with absence of any alamat justify the defence case. Jalal Uddin vs State 56 DLR 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A</strong>—The post mortem report admitted into evidence without complying with the requirements of section 509A of the Code must be left out of consideration. There is therefore, no medical evidence as to the cause of death of the deceased. State vs Al Hasib Bin Jamal alias Hasib 59 DLR 653.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 512 &amp; 339B(2)—</strong>Since section 339B(2) provides for absentia trial, section 512 has no application in the case of an accused who appeared before the court but thereafter absconded. Baharuddin vs State 47 DLR 61.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 516A</strong>—Section 516A empowers a criminal Court to pass an order for custody and disposal of property during any enquiry or trial and it does not empower an Investigating Officer to give any property in the custody of any person. Siddique Ahmed Sowdagar vs State 40 DLR 268.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 516A</strong>—Where the offence is not committed regarding particular property the Court has no authority to pass order directing sale of such property and deposit the sale price in Court’s account. Shahabuddin vs Abdul Gani Bhuiyan 45 DLR 217.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 516A</strong>—Custody of property pending trial for theft and cheating—Jurisdiction of civil Court over such property—Order passed by the criminal Court giving custody of a vessel, the subject-matter of the criminal case, to the local Upazila Chairman was subject to revision and the application under section 151 CPC made before the civil Court by the complainant as the plaintiff in his suit for injunction is misconceived. Mitali Shipping Lines vs Bhuiyan Navigation Agency 44 DLR 230.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 516A</strong>—The Court is entitled to release the property in the Jimma of the claimant to save the same from gradual damage being exposed to sun and rain. The petitioner claiming to take the same in his jimma is bound by the bond to produce the same in Court on and when directed by the Court. Shahnewaz Karim vs State 62DLR 67.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 516A &amp; 517</strong>—About disposal of property, there is no provision in the Act and therefore the Special Tribunal shall dispose of the property under section 51 6A or 517 of the being empowered to do so by section 29 of the Act which provides that the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, so far only as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act, shall apply to the proceedings of Special Tribunals, and Special Tribunals shall have all the powers conferred by the Code Criminal Procedure on a Court of Sessions exercising original jurisdiction. Mahbub Alam vs Commissioner, Customs, Excise and VAT 62 DLR 395.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 517—</strong>Disposal of seized goods—It is for the trial Court to consider all the relevant facts and hear all the necessary parties before making an order for disposal of goods under section 517 CrPC, if called upon. Sompong vs State 45 DLR (AD) 110.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 517, 520 and 561A</strong>—Stolen necklace—Whether the possession of the same should be restored to the petitioner who was acquitted of charge of retention of stolen property due to incomplete evidence and also upon benefit of doubt—Stolen necklace cannot be restored to the petitioner under such circumstances. Hajera Khatoon vs State 40 DLR 280.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 517(1)</strong>—The Court has a very wide discretion as to the mode of disposal of the property produced before it or in its custody. Monaranjan Das vs State 40 DLR 485.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 522</strong>—Power to restore possession of immovable property—Provision of section 522 of the Code cannot be made applicable to the j’ accused persons by filing a separate application to the trial Court after disposal of the appeal and revisional application arising out of the case against him under section 447 Penal Code. Dr Md Abdul Baten vs State 43 DLR 60.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 522</strong>—Restoration of possession of immovable property—The order of the Court restoring possession must be passed within one month from the date of conviction. The Magistrate having passed the order of restoration beyond 30 days of the order of conviction acted without jurisdiction. The provision of section 522 cannot be availed of if the dispossession is not by means of criminal force or show of force or criminal intimidation. In the instant case the accused petitioner wrongfully entered into the shop at 10-30 PM but at that time the complainant opposi party or his wife, who was the tenant, was not upon the scene. There was neither assault nor any resistance or use of criminal force in the act of dispossession by the accused-petitioner. The Magistrate’s order is bad on this count also. Sheikh MA Jabbar vs AKM Obaidul Huq 43 DLR 233.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 523(1)</strong>—The act of the Investigating Officer to give custody of the property on the basis of the practice in vogue in the Police Department without any support of the statutory provisions of law to that effect in violation of section 523 CrPC is without any lawful authority and is illegal. Siddique Ahmed Sawdagar vs State 40 DLR 268.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 526</strong>—Transfer of case—Plea of bias—The question of admissibility or non-admissibility of evidence should be left to be agitated when the case is argued. Merely because a Court acted illegally in allowing some evidence to go into the record or disallowing some evidence as irrelevant or took a wrong view of the law in passing an order would not by itself be a ground for bias (Per Anwarul Huq Chowdhury)<br/><em>Per Habibur Rahman Khan J (agreeing)</em>: In the present case the order refusing to grant adjournment having been passed by the Special Tribunal not in violation of any mandatory provisions of law but in exercise of his discretionary power, could not itself give rise to a ground for transfer as no prejudice could be shown to have been caused to the accused Hussain Mohammad Ershad vs State 43 DLR 347.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 526</strong>—Transfer of a criminal case— Conditions for transfer—The High Court Division may withdraw a case to itself without issuing any notice upon either party when some question of law or unusual difficulty is involved therein. Neither of these situations is present here. There is no justification for the impugned transfer. Sirajul Islam (Md) vs Keramat Ali Bhuiyan 47 DLR (AD) 64.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 526</strong>―The order of transfer of the case is set aside as the Court below unwillingly transgressed a basic principle of adjudication— ‘hear the other side’—for an opportunity to meet allegations. Khalequzzaman vs Md Illias 48 DLR (AD) 52.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 526</strong>―The High Court Division can suo motu transfer a sessions case. The informant and his victim brother by preferring the application has merely informed the High Court Division about the state of the circumstances surrounding the sessions case. Jahir Gazi vs Belal Hossain, Advocate 51 DLR (AD) 88.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 526</strong>―Order of transfer of a case passed ex parte without any notice either to the accused or to the State and without calling for any report from the Court concerned by merely saying that without accepting or rejecting the grounds for the transfer the Court thinks justice will be met if the case is disposed of by the Court of Sessions Judge cannot be legally sustained. Moslem Uddin (Md) vs State 52 DLR (AD) 50.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 526</strong>―For transfer of a criminal case from one Court to another or from one District to another, there must exist a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the applicant that he will not get a fair and impartial trial in the Court concerned. Allegation of bias in the Court may provide a good ground for transfer, provided there is some factual basis to substantiate it. Shahjahan Faraji vs State 54 DLR 457.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 526</strong>―The contention that the transfer of the case from Munshiganj to Dhaka for trial will tend to the general convenience of the parties as most of the witnesses hail from Dh has substance. Roquib Mohammad Fakrul alias Rocky vs Md Abdul Kashem 56 DLR (AD) 191.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 526</strong>—unless the truth or basis of the apprehension is shown the High Court Division cannot accept prayer for transfer. Abdul Halim Ukil vs State 56 DLR 481<br/> <br/><strong>Section 526</strong>―When any party to any proceeding informs the court that he will move an application for transfer of the case from the Court, presiding officer of the court must then and there stop his pen in order to offer scope to the party to move such petition and wait for instruction. He can, in no way, move forward with the trial of the case. Abdul Halim Ukil vs State 56 DLR 481.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 526</strong>―Forum for trial of the case should not be decided at the whim of the parties— Grounds alleged by the petitioners being not consonant with section 526 of the Code, the petition for transfer of the case is rejected. Abdul Mataleb Howlader vs State 56 DLR 607.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 526</strong>―Transfer of case—the complainant, a local leader of the ruling party, is trying to put pressure on the local administration and magistracy —As such, fair and impartial trial may be hampered. The accused being prominent personalities in the field of Journalism, are residing in Dhaka—When their security of life is apprehended if they are to go to Magura frequently in connection with the trial, their inconvenience and apprehension of insecurity of life may be taken into consideration. Mahfuz Anam vs State 58 DLR 60.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 526(1)—</strong>When the Additional Sessions Judge has already observed that he entertains doubt as to whether the State will succeed in proving the case against the accused, the State has every reason to think there will be no fair trial in his court and the case needs be transferred to some other Court of competent jurisdiction. State vs Auranga @ KM Hemayatuddin 46 DLR 524.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 526B</strong>—Counter cases, trial of—It is desirable that counter case be tried by the same judge simultaneously—by such trial the court will get opportunity for looking to all the aspects of both the cases which is necessary for arriving at a correct decision and to avoid conflicting findings. Lutfar Rahman vs Aleya Begum 45 DLR 57.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 533</strong>—Any irregularity in recording the confession is curable under section 533 CrPC. Ratan Kha vs State 40 DLR 186.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 533</strong>—Credibility of confessional statement—No substantial compliance i cure the defect of non-compliance with the provisions of section 164 CrPC on material points. Confessional statement in a plain paper without the narration of questions and answers would not, by itself, make it inadmissible in evidence. Certificate given by the Magistrate, who had recorded the confessional statement, as to what had happened, how he warned and gave time for refection to the person confessing, how yet he insisted on making confession and his admitting the same to be correct and the Magistrate’s believing the same to be voluntary ought to be treated as conclusive evidence of facts stated therein unless shown to be otherwise. Abdul Hakim vs State 43 DLR 389.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 533 &amp; 164</strong>—The recording of the statement on a foolscap paper and mere omission of endorsement cannot be considered as fatal defect. The breach of the provision of law, if any, is a technical one and by that the evidentiary value of the confessional statement cannot be blown away. The defect is very much curable under section 533 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Syed Ahmed vs Abdul Khaleque 51 DLR 43.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 537—</strong>When sanction for prosecuting government servant is invalid, the trial Court would not be a court of competent jurisdiction and a defect in the jurisdiction of the court can never be cured under sections 5 &amp; 7 CrPC. Abdul Hakim vs State 45 DLR 352.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong>The remand order amounts to double jeopardy for the petitioners and offers chance to the prosecution to remedy its lacuna. Such a remand ‘should not be made. Fazal vs State 43 DLR 40.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong>Cognizance—Scheduled and non-scheduled offence—When the very taking of cognizance of an offence, the framing of accusation and the trial upon charges of both scheduled and non-scheduled offences together suffered from complete lack of jurisdiction, this could not at all be considered to be a mere defect in the framing of charges which by aid of section 537 of the CrPC can be cured if prejudice is not caused to the accused. A mere defect in framing of charge by the Court having jurisdiction is one thing while framing of charge without having any jurisdiction is a completely different thing. Mozammel Huq vs State 43 DLR 614.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong>Adoption of a procedure prohibited by Code of Criminal Procedure is not curable by section 537 CrPC. Lal Miah vs State 40 DLR 377.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong>Defect in framing of charge when not curable—a mere defect in framing of charge by a court having jurisdiction is one thing while the framing of charge without having any jurisdiction is a completely different thing. The contention that section 537 of the Code could be invoked to cure defect due to lack of jurisdiction cannot be accepted. Joinder of scheduled and nonscheduled offences and the trial of both these offences were illegal. Mozammel Hoq vs State 42 DLR 527.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong>This provision of law will also apply to the Criminal Procedure Code including section 155. The prevailing opinion is that section 537 may be taken to cover the error, omission or irregularity in the widest sense of these terms provided there has been no failure of justice and there is no restriction in the section itself. Golam Moula Master vs State 46 DLR 140.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong>Sentence passed in lump is only an irregularity not affecting the Court’s competence to pass order of conviction and sentence. Haider Ali Khan vs State 47 DLR (AD) 47.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong>A Special Tribunal is not competent to try a case under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 read with the provision of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. The Assistant Sessions Judge either out of ignorance or due to his callousness signed the judgment as Special Tribunal. But the accused-appellant has not been prejudiced in any manner whatsoever. So on this ground alone there cannot be any question of the trial to be vitiated for want of competence. Nizamuddin Dhali (Md) vs State 48 DLR 507.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong>Defect in framing the charge is curable and that for improper examination of the accused under section 342 the case should be sent back on remand for curing the defect. Nizamuddin Dhali vs State 48 DLR 507.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 537—</strong>Though the words “finding, sentence” in this section relate to concluded trial or hearing the word “order” does not relate to only concluded trial or hearing but also to order passed in a pending proceeding. Shinepukur Holding Ltd vs Security Exchange Commission 50 DLR 291.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong>While framing charge against the accused under sections 2 and 4 of the Anti- Terrorism Act, 1992 the missing of words ‘পরিকল্পিতভাবে বা আকস্মিকভাবে’ is a simple omission which is curable under section 537 CrPC. Abdul Kader @ Manju vs Stale 46 DLR 605.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong>The sanction order seems to be too mechanical and is no sanction in the eye of law. Absence of sanction cuts at the very root of the prosecution affecting jurisdiction of the court and this defect is not curable. Syed Mustafizur Rahman vs State 53 DLR 125.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong>Although the charge framed under section 399 of the Code is patently defective, there are sufficient materials on record to justi1,’ the conviction of accused the under section 399, he being a member of the assembly consisting of 8/9 persons. Karam Ali vs State 54 DLR 378.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong>The omission of the expression ‘যৌতুকের জন্য’ which is a vital ingredient of the offence under the aforesaid sub-section (2) being a major omission makes the charge materially defective and the defect is not curable under section 537 of the Code because this omission deprived the accused from taking proper defence and thereby caused prejudice to him. Goutam Chandra Das alias Goutam Kumar Das vs State 55 DLR 527.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 537, 155 &amp; 190</strong>—Non cognizable offence—Mere irregularity like investigation by an officer not authorized to investigate a no cognizable offence does not affect the legality of a proceeding of a Court below. Investigation by a police officer in the instant case is an antecedent proceeding. It is neither the foundation stone nor a prerequisite of the proceeding nor a sine qua non of a valid trial in the Court. It is difficult for us to see why such an irregularity, i.e. investigation by an officer not authorised, should affect the proceeding in a Court or prevent the Court from taking cognizance of a noncognizable offence under clause (a) or (b) of section 190(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the absence of a clear enactment, expressed or implied preventing the Court from doing so. Golam Moula Master vs State 46 DLR 140.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 537 &amp; 243—</strong>The alleged admission of guilt was not recorded as nearly as possible in the words used by the accused. Section 243 CrPC is mandatory, the violation of which causes prejudice to the accused and is not curable under section 537 CrPC. The order of conviction and sentence as against the appellant on the basis of such so-called admission of guilt cannot therefore be sustained in law and the same should therefore be set aside in the interest of justice and the case should be sent back on remand to the trial Court to hold that trial afresh from the stage of framing the accusation or charge again after hearing the parties and considering the materials on record in accordance with the law in the light of the observations made above. Saheb Ali Miah vs State 46 DLR 238.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sections 537 &amp; 342—</strong>When confessional statement is found to be true and voluntary and it gets corroboration from some other evidence, the appellant had not been prejudiced for non- mentioning of his confession in his examination under section 342 CrPC. This irregularity or omission is curable under section 537 CPC in the facts of the case and the same has not vitiated the trial. Abdul Khayer vs State 46 DLR 212.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 537 &amp; 342—</strong>When confessional statement is found to be true and voluntary and it gets corroboration from some other evidence, the appellant had not been prejudiced for non- mentioning of his confession in his examination under section 342 CrPC. This irregularity or omission is curable under section 537 CPC in the facts of the case and the same has not vitiated the trial. Abul Khayer vs State 46 DLR 212.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 537, 342 &amp; 164—</strong>Since the attention of the accused was not drawn to his confessional statement when he was examined under section 342, he is obviously prejudiced. Such defect is not curable under section 537 of the Code. Abu Jamal vs State 51 DLR 57.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong>Examining prosecution witnesses as Court witnesses—Magistrate has power to summon material witness whose relevance is disclosed in evidence, but he cannot examine them as Court witness—Magistrate’s order has been modified accordingly. Helaluddin vs State 40 DLR 352.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 540</strong><strong>―</strong>Scope of section 540 consists of two parts—the first part is discretionary and the second part is obligatory. Md Jalaluddin Ahmed vs State 40 DLR 564.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong>It is obligatory for the Court to allow the examination of witness if he thinks it is essential for the just decision of the case. The accused will not be prejudiced if the witness is examined in the Court. Md Jalaluddin Ahmed vs State 40 DLR 564.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 540</strong><strong>―</strong>The ends of justice have been negatived by the trial Court by refusing to recall certain witnesses for cross-examination by the appellant. The trial Court is not meant for only convicting or acquitting the accused persons but their duty is to administer justice. In the present case before us by refusing to recall certain witnesses for cross-examination by the appellant the ends ofjustice have been negatived by the trial Court. In such circumstances for ends of justice we are inclined to set aside the order dated 1-Il- 88 passed by the learned Tribunal and direct him for affording opportunity to the appellant to cross- examine the witnesses already examined by the prosecution. This is very much necessary for ends of justice. Jamil Siddique vs State 41 DLR 30.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong>Court’s power to examine witness not named in the FIR—The scope of the provision in CrPC in this connection appears to be wide. It gives a discretion to the court to examine such witness at any stage. It is imperative for the Court to examine such a witness if his evidence appears to be essential for a just decision. Akhtar Jahan vs State 42 DLR 413.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong>Power to summon material witness—Any party to a proceeding during the trial may point out the desirability of relevant evidence being taken and there is no limitation with regard to the state or the manner in which it is to be used. The only criterion is that the power to examine additional witness is to be used before the pronouncement of judgment and it is to be found necessary by the Court for doing justice. It appears that due to certain circumstances beyond the control of the prosecution the witnesses could not be produced and examined earlier but evidence is vitally important for the just and proper adjudication of the case. The learned Additional Sessions Judge having passed the order for the examination of the additional witness after due consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case invoking the aid of the provision of law being herself convinced that examination of the witness is necessary for proper adjudication of the case we do not find any illegality or impropriety in the order calling for interference in this revisional jurisdiction. Hemayatuddin vs State 46 DLR 1.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>Section 540—</strong>The section is expressed in the widest possible term— It cannot be said that the intention of the section is to limit its application to Court witnesses only. Hemayatuddin @ Auranga vs State 46 DLR (AD) 186.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong>There is absolutely no material to show that accused Ramizuddin had any knowledge about the proceeding ever since it was started against him, as at all material times he was abroad. In that view the discretion exercised by the Additional Sessions Judge allowing the accuser’s application for cross-examination of PWs affirmed by the High Court Division calls for no interference. Nimar Ali vs Ramizuddin 50 DLR (AD) 162.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 540</strong><strong>―</strong>Section 540 of the Code is expressed in the widest possible terms—It cannot be said that the intention of this section is to limit its application to the witnesses only before examination of the accused under section 342 of the Code. Chutta Miah vs State 56 DLR 610.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 540</strong><strong>―</strong>It is only for the purpose of just decision of a case that the Court can have resort to section 540. Shahinur Alam @ Shahin vs State 56 DLR 10.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 540</strong><strong>―</strong>This section is expressed in the widest possible term and it cannot be said that the intention of this section is to limit its application to the witnesses only before examination of the accused under section 342 of the Code. Kazi Ali Zahir alias Elin vs State 56 DLR 244.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 540</strong><strong>―</strong>The Court shall summon and examine witness under this section only if it appears to it essential for a just decision in the case. Tofail Ahmed vs State 56 DLR 250.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong>Question of further investigation of the case for including names of two witnesses as charge-sheet witnesses does not arise, for, the court has power to examine any person as a witness. The name of any person is included as witness in the charge-sheet or not is immaterial. Ayub Ali vs State 57 DLR 230.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong>Court is entitled to call for as many witnesses as required for bringing out the truth. The Sessions Judge is the arbiter and the Judge. He is not party nor an investigator. He is not expected to fill up the gaps left by the prosecution. The overriding consideration for him while exercising power under section 540 CrPC is the interest of justice. Mahatab vs State 63 DLR 223.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>Section 540—</strong>Since the accused-petitioners prayed for recalling PW 2, PW 3 and PW 4 as they omitted to cross-examine them on some vital points which are essential to find out the truth, the trial Court ought to have allowed the application. Shariful Bhuiyan vs State 63 DLR 524.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 540A—</strong>Complaint case and police case over the same incident—How their trial will proceed—A fair procedure to be adopted in the disposal of the two cases would be for the Trial Judge to take up the complaint case first for trial. The Trial Judge may call the witnesses mentioned in the police case, if they are not already examined on behalf of the complainant, as court witnesses so that they can be cross-examined by both the parties. If the trial ended in conviction in the Complaint Case the Public Prosecutor would consider whether prosecution of police case should be withdrawn with permission of the court or not. If the police case is taken up first for trial the complainant would be under handicap insofar as to cross-examining the witnesses- for the prosecution. Normally, the Public Prosecutor is to be in charge of the case even if the trial is based on a private complaint. Motleb Mondal vs State 58 DLR 282.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 549—</strong>Since the appellants were not on active service within the meaning of section 8(1) of the Army Act, 1952 the appellants cannot be tried under the Army Act and, as such, there was no offence of mutiny leading to murder in the facts of the instant case. Even if one were to accept for the sake of argument that offences committed were civil offences within the meaning of section 8(2) read with section 59(2) of the Army Act, there is no legal bar in trying those accused persons in the Sessions Court in compliance with the provisions of section 94 of the Army Act read with section 549 of the CrPC. There is no legal bar for trial of the appellants in the Criminal Court in the relevant case, inasmuch as, the offences committed are in the nature of murder simpler. (Per Md Muzammel Hossain J) Major Bazlul Huda vs State 62 DLR (AD) 1.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 552 &amp; 100—</strong>A Magistrate cannot detain a person unless he or she is an accused in a criminal case. The petitioner being above 16 cannot be a minor within the meaning of section 361 Penal Code and as such the Magistrate has no jurisdiction to keep her in custody or to deliver her to the custody of her father.

Abdul Bari vs Abul Hashem Mazumder 40 DLR 301.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Whether a proceeding under section 561A of the Criminal Procedure Code is to be quashed depends upon the facts of the case itself.

The proceedings are quashed. Md Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Mere delay in lodging a complaint is not a ground for quashing a proceeding. There may be circumstances in which lodging of FIR as to commission of an offence may be delayed. Md Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Explanation for delay in lodging FIR was given, i.e. fear of life from very influential persons. Md Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Delay raises doubt about the truth of allegation. Md Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Principles upon which exercise of extraordinary powers under section 561A CrPC is made have been stated. Md Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Facts of the instant case do not bring it within the ambit of exceptional circumstances in which the extraordinary power of the Court may be exercised. Md. Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—A timely GD entry of course strengthens the allegation made in the complaint and its absence may create doubt about it; but doubt in the allegation is a matter to be considered at the trial only. Md Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Despite earlier order of rejection of the prayer for quashment of the proceeding, the subsequent application will not operate as a bar for exercising the inherent jurisdiction under section 561A CrPC. AKMM Saleh vs State 45 DLR 386.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—On the death of principal offender possibility of proving the guilt of the abettor becomes bleak. AKMM Saleh vs State 45 DLR 386.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 561A</strong>—If the trial Court fails to perform its duly in respect of framing of charge and the charge is framed on insufficient materials High Court Division can investigate whether the charge is groundless. AKMM Saleh vs State 45 DLR 386.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Cognizance taken and trial held in this case being without jurisdiction, the court may exercise its inherent jurisdiction under section 561A CrPC to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court. Khalilur Rahman vs State 41 DLR 385.<br/><br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—View of the Additional judge not so perverse as to merit interference. Moslemuddin Dhali vs Helaluddin Dhali 41 DLR 120.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The fact that the accused were tried and found guilty and then unsuccessfully filed an appeal and a revisional application cannot be a ground, in the facts of the present case (i.e. absence of any legal evidence), for refusing to exercise the Court’s inherent power to secure the ends of justice by way of setting aside their conviction. Mofuzzal Hossain Mollah vs State 45 DLR (AD) 175.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Quashing of criminal proceeding—The sword of prosecution hanging over the head of accused -petitioners for nearly 10 years without any fault on their part and they are suffering economically, mentally and socially—It is a sheer abuse of the process of the Court and for that reason the proceeding is to be quashed in respect of them. Md Mosharraf Hossain vs State 42 DLR 213.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—In a proceeding under this provision the court should not be drawn in an enquiry as to the truth or otherwise of the facts which are not in the prosecution case. HM Ershad vs State 45 DLR (AD) 48.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Mere plea of right of private defence cannot be a ground for quashing the criminal proceeding, for such plea is to be established by the accused who takes it. A criminal proceeding is liable to be quashed only if the facts alleged in the First Information Report of complaint petition, even if admitted, do not constitute any criminal offence or the proceeding is barred by any provision of law. Where disputed facts are involved, evidence will be necessary to determine the issue. The appellants have produced an order of temporary injunction against the complainant’s party. This must be considered along with other evidence during the trial. Their application for quashing the proceedings is found to have been rightly refused by the High Court Division. SM Khalilur Rahman vs State 42 DLR (AD) 62.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Quashing of proceedings for alleged breach of trust and cheating: Money claims, not the outcome of a particular transaction but arose after year-end accounting following regular business between the parties. If on settlement of accounts at the end of a period some money falls due to one party from the other party and the other party fails to pay the dues, such liability cannot be termed criminal liability. Allegation that dues were allowed to accrue dishonestly, neither attract an offence under section 420 nor under section 406 or under any other section. The whole allegation in complaint petition, even if true, cannot form basis of any criminal proceeding. The proceedings are quashed. Syed Ali Mir vs Syed 0mar Ali 42 DLR (AD) 240.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The accused cannot challenge the entire criminal proceeding at a stage when the case is ripe for trial following framing of charge. When he has taken a specific defence against the charge on the basis of a GD entry he has to establish the same. The charge under section 420 Penal Code is upheld. Shafiuddin Khan vs State 45 DLR 102.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Questions whether the occurrence was accidental and whether the petitioner had intention to commit mischief to the complainant needs evaluation of evidence to be led by the prosecution which cannot be stifled by exercising power for quashment. When allegations create both civil and criminal liabilities it is for the complainant to choose any or both of the forums for redress of grievance. Tofazzal Hossain Chowdhury vs Mir Amanullah 45 DLR 263.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Stay of proceeding—In the facts of the case as in point of time the civil suit was instituted before the filing of the FIR and the questioned documents in their originals are yet to be produced and examined by the civil Court. The criminal proceeding where the documents are claimed as forged, may, in the interest of justice, be stayed till the disposal of the civil suit. Zakir Hossain vs State 43 DLR (AD) 102.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>lt has been asserted that the FIR itself was lodged by the complainant after receiving an order from the Home Ministry and not on his own. A prosecution cannot be quashed just because it was initiated at the instance of the Home Ministry. The question of possession can only be decided on evidence and not on submission on law as to what constitutes possession. The question whether the proceeding should be quashed or not should be decided on facts alleged in the FIR and charge-sheet. The accused’s general denial that the facts disclosed in the FIR are not true will not do. To succeed, the accused must show that the facts alleged by the prosecution do not constitute any offence or that the prosecution is otherwise barred by law. Hussain Mohammad Ershad vs State 43 DLR (AD) 50.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Quashing of proceeding— Court will be loath to stifle a prosecution at the initial stage unless facts are such as would attract inference that even upon admitted facts no case can be made out and continuation of the proceeding would be an abuse of the process of the Court. Al-haj Md Serajuddowlah vs State 43 DLR (AD) 198.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Quashing of proceedings — Whether the untrue statement of the accused regarding his imported goods on which he has been prosecuted under the Customs Act is intentional or unintentional, bonafide mistake or a case of absence of knowledge is for the trial Court to decide on the basis of evidence that would be adduced—if the pending proceeding is stopped at this stage it would amount to stifling the proceeding in Limine. Atiqur Rahman vs AKM Fazlul Haque 43 DLR 49.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Indictment proceeding against a detenu—Question of its legality or otherwise at the time when it was initiated and at a subsequent time—An order of detention would be deemed to be warrant of arrest from the Court of Magistrate; if the detenu would violate the warrant he would be a fugitive from justice. His failure to comply with direction to surrender, would immediately attract the mischief of prosecution and consequent punishment. The offence would be complete on failure to surrender, subject however, to the defence of impossibility of performance which is a matter of fact to be decided on evidence. Section 7(1)(b) is a punitive provision to come into play immediately after the lapse of time for surrender. The contention that the detention order being illegal the detenu had not rightly surrendered has little substance. It is not the order of detention but it is the fact of detention itself that matters. At the time it was initiated the proceeding was not prohibited by any law nor was it taken in violation of any law. It need not therefore be quashed at the present stage. Anwar Hossain Monju vs State 43 DLR 447.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Petition of complaint contains allegations under sections 295A/298/109</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Penal Code out of which, to initiate and continue with the proceeding, compliance of the provision of section 196 CrPC in respect of offence under section 295A Penal Code is necessary but no compliance is necessary in respect of offences under sections 258/109 Penal Code. Interference by way of quashing the entire proceeding is not called for. Name of the petitioner finds mention in he petition of complaint but on a reading of he same his complicity with commission of offence could not be traced out. The proceedings as against him is liable to be quashed in terms of the principles enunciated in 28 DLR (AD) 38. Jamir Sheikh vs Md Fakir 43 DLR 417.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Right of heirs of deceased complainant to proceed with the complainant’s case—The complainant in the criminal case under section 447 claimed ownership and possession of the land in question. On his death chning the pendency of the revision case arising out of the matter his wife having stepped into his shoes so far as it relates to his properties, she is required to be brought on record to protect her interest in the land. Dr Md Abdul Baten vs Stare 43 DLR 60.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Inherent power under this section though unlimited should be exercised only in 3 cases when no other alternative remedy is generally available under the Code to make such order as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure he ends of justice. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, any interference with the impugned order of the learned Magistrate at this belated stage will<br/>not serve any of the purposes of this section, rather such interference may cause undue harassment to the opposite party and defeat the ends of justice. State vs Satya Narayan Sarada 43 DLR 529.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The decision in this case having depended on findings of facts as to whether the seized arms were recovered from the possession of the petitioner, whether the same came within the exception provided for and covered by amnesty, if any, declared by the Government, the extraordinary power to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court is not required to be exercised. HM Ershad vs State 43 DLR 150.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Allegation made in the FIR having not disclosed any offence of extortion as deemed under section 383 Penal Code, the impugned proceeding against the accused for his punishment under section 387 Penal Code is quashed. Abul Bashar vs State 44 DLR 391.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Default in delivery of share certificate—Quashing of proceeding for such default—It is not the complainant’s case that his share certificates were not made ready within time. Once the share certificates are completed and made ready within time, the liability of the accused persons ends. The law does not provide that the certificates are to be made ready for delivery to the complainant. Non-delivery of the share certificates is not an offence and the proceeding is liable to be quashed. Muhammadullah vs Makbul Ahmed 44 DLR 107.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Writ Jurisdiction and inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Division, applicability of—If there was any statutory provision of appeal and revision for setting aside the proceedings in question against the petitioner, then the question whether any equally efficacious adequate alternative remedy is available to him would act as a bar to move the High Court Division under the writ jurisdiction. Inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Division under section 56 1A CrPC cannot be said to be an alternative remedy to the Court’s writ jurisdiction. Anisul Islam Mahmood vs Bangladesh 44 DLR 1.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Inherent jurisdiction—It is not an alternative jurisdiction—Inherent jurisdiction for quashing of criminal proceedings should not be invoked where some other remedy is available. This is not an alternative jurisdiction nor an additional jurisdiction but it is a jurisdiction preserved in the interest of justice to redress grievances for which no other procedure is available or provided by the Code itself. This power cannot be so utilized as to interrupt or divert the ordinary course of criminal procedure. MM Rahmatullah vs State 44 DLR 576.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Quashing of criminal proceeding whether can be allowed under writ jurisdiction—Labour Court being a court subordinate to the High Court Division quashing of criminal case can appropriately be prayed before the criminal bench of the Court which is the efficacious remedy under the Code of Criminal Procedure. SM Shafiul Azam vs Director of Labour 44 DLR 582.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Though the inherent power of the High Court Division is undefined and unlimited but this inherent jurisdiction should not be generally and indiscriminately invoked particularly when some other remedy is available. The jurisdiction is not alternative or an additional one but it is I jurisdiction preserved in the interest of justice to redress grievances for which no other procedure is available nor has been provided in the Code itself. Engineer Afsaruddin Ahmed vs State 46 DLR 496.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Inherent jurisdiction of Court—Whether such jurisdiction is applicable in cases from which appeals are barred by limitation—Section 561A CrPC cannot be conceived to give the High Court Division jurisdiction to retrieve the cases from the moratorium after they have been barred by limitation. Then, in the memo of the appeal taken or in the submission no ground has been taken that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to try the case or that it arrived at absurd or preposterous conclusion from the evidence on record. The section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure has not given any new jurisdiction to the High Court to override other laws. It is easy to see that this Court cannot have any inherent jurisdiction to strike down the law of limitation. The law of limitation is so inexorable that a person loses his good title on account of law of limitation. It may be desirable that something is done for the redress of the accused who lost their right of appeal and has very good case in their defence, but it is for the legislature to do. Mohammad Ali vs State 46 DLR 175.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—There is nothing in precluding a criminal case on account of a ci suit pending against the petitioners on the facts. The criminal case stands for the offend while the civil suit is for realisation of money both can stand together. Khondaker Mahatab uddin Ahmed vs State 49 DLR (AD) 132.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The complainant has the option to activate prosecution of the petitioners under the Immigration Act, 1982 as well, but if the allegations contain ingredients under the Penal Code, the complainant’s case before the Magistrate cannot be stifled by quashing. Noor Jahan Begum vs State, being represented by the Deputy Commissioner 49 DLR (AD) 106.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>The Drug Control Ordinance is an additional forum for trying drug offences. Taking of cognizance and framing of charge by the Tribunal under the Special Powers Act in respect of offences relating to possession of spurious medicine, are not illegal and the prosecuting thereof are liable to be quashed. Ordinance No. VIII of 1982 has been promulgated not with a view to excluding all other trials on the same offence but as an additional forum for trying drug offences. If the same offence can be tried by a Special Tribunal under the Special Powers Act it cannot be said that the accused- petitioner has an exclusive right to be tried by a Drug Court only. As on the petitioner’s own showing he has been charged only under section 25C(d) of the Special Powers Act by the Senior Special Tribunal, we do not find any illegality in the proceedings. Ashraf Ali @ Asraf Ali vs Slate 49 DLR (AD) 107.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>It cannot be said that the Court was wrong in holding and acting on the premises that the dispute between the parties arising out of a joint stock should be settled in the civil Court and the criminal proceeding be quashed. Ansarul Haque vs Abdur Rahim 49 DLR (AD) 145.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The Sessions Judge having passed an order under section 439A CrPC setting aside finding of the Magistrate under section 145 CrPC and all remedies for the first party being exhausted, the party is competent to invoke section 561A [1984 BLD (AD) 165 ref] Soleman (Md) vs Ahbarek Khalifa 46 DLR 298.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561 A</strong>—Quashing of a proceeding can be made even at the initial stage of a case, and when facts, and circumstances demand, even at the stage when cognizance is taken by the, Magistrate in a case under the Penal Code. Mubashwir Alli vs State 46 DLR 535.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The exercise of power under this section is not totally barred against an order passed by the Sessions Judge under section 439A CrPC. It is to be seen whether the petitioner invokes this Court’s revisional jurisdiction under the garb of an , application under section 561A CrPC. If the condition of this section is fulfilled the High Court Division may exercise its power thereunder. Fatema Begum vs Gageswar Nath and State 46 DLR 651.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—When exercising jurisdiction under this section, the High Court Division will not embark upon an enquiry whether the evidence in question is reliable or not which is a function of the trial Court. Quashment of criminal proceeding before commencement of trial may amount to stifling the prosecution. Abu Bakar vs State 46 DLR 684.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 561A, 438 &amp; 439A</strong>—Reference—Since the petitioner could not make out a case of quashing of the proceedings and since no such power is vested in the Sessions Judge the impugned order refusing to make a reference to the High Court Division suffers from no illegality. Farhad Hossain vs Mainuddin Hossain Chowdhury 46 DLR 127.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—In view of the complainant’s case that he delivered goods in good faith on the accuser’s inducement of part payment and promise to pay the balance price within 3 days but subsequently betrayed, it cannot be said there is no prima facie case against him—the High Court Division rightly refused to quash the proceeding. Arifur Rahman alias Bablu vs Shantosh Kumar Sadhu 46 DLR (AD) 180.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Division would be available even to a party who had lost in revision before the Sessions Judge. In this connection this Court, however, referred to the limited scope of section 56 1A and observed that this inherent power is neither an additional power nor an alternative power of the Court, that this power is to be exercised very sparingly keeping itself within the bounds of this provision and that a revision petition cannot be brought in the camouflage of a petition under section 561A. Sher Ali vs State 46 DLR (AD) 67.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The inherent power under section 561A can be invoked at any state of the proceeding, even after conclusion of trial, if it is necessary to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. Appellant was convicted solely on the statement of a co accused who, however, did not implicate himself in the crime but shifted the blame upon others including the appellant. This Court found that there was no “confession” at all as its maker did not implicate himself in the crime and further that this statement was not corroborated by any other evidence and consequently the conviction was based on ‘no evidence’ which could be quashed by the High Court Division in exercise of its inherent power under section 561A. Sher Ali vs State 46 DLR (AD) 67.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The inherent power may be invoked independent of powers conferred by any other provisions of the Code. This power is neither appellate power, nor revisional power, nor power of review and it is to be invoked for the limited purposes.<br/>This power may be exercised to quash a proceeding or even a conviction on conclusion of a trial if the Court concerned got no jurisdiction to hold the said trial or the facts alleged against the accused do not constitute any criminal offence, or the conviction has been based on ‘no evidence’ or otherwise to secure ends of justice. Sher Ali vs State 46 DLR (AD) 67.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The decision of the judges that the application under section 561A is liable to be rejected for lack of jurisdiction is totally erroneous and it is held that the High Court Division has jurisdiction to entertain such an application but whether interference will be made in a particular case is altogether a different matter.The general principle is that the power being extraordinary its exercise also will be rarity. The “total bar” in section 43 9(4) of the Code, as spoken of by the learned Judges, is only against further revision—that is, revision under section. 439(1) of the Code and not against the Court’s inherent jurisdiction which is altogether different from any other jurisdiction under the Code. The High Court Division, on the one hand, willfully disregarded this Court’s decisions, and, on the other hand, flouted Article 111 of the Constitution. This cannot be countenanced and must be disapproved strongly. Sher Ali vs State 46 DLR (AD) 67.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Section 561A</strong>—A litigant should not be allowed to move this Court under section 561A of the Code when other remedy is available to him under the Code. Section 561A of the Code is to be taken resort to only to prevent abuse of the process of Court or to secure the ends of justice and not to allow abusing the process of the Court to stop trial of the cases for about a decade and then to get acquittal in the trial Court afterwards for want of evidence occasioned by lapse of long time. Maksudur Rahman Hilaly vs State 47 DLR 314.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—An appeal filed under section 30 of the Special Powers Act but not admitted for hearing as it was found barred by limitation can be allowed to be converted to a miscellaneous case under section 561A of the CrPC for securing the ends ofjustice. Sohail Ahmed Chowdhury vs State 47 DLR 348.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—After conversion of an appeal to an application under section 561A CrPC the application can be disposed of by the same Bench without issuing a Rule afresh—technicalities of procedure may be avoided with a view to securing the ends of justice. Sohail Ahmed Chowdhury vs State 47 DLR 348.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—This Court has inherent jurisdiction to set aside its own judgment to secure ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court under section 56lA of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Serajul Islam vs Fazlul Hoque 47 DLR 480.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—This Court in exercise of its extraordinary power of quashing cannot usurp the jurisdiction of the trial Court to receive and examine evidence adduced by the accused in his defence to exonerate him from the charge brought against him. Shyamal Chandra Das vs State 47 DLR 474.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—This section corresponds to section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure with almost similar principle. Sohail Ahmed Chowdhury vs State 47 DLR 482.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 56 lA</strong>—Inherent jurisdiction— Extent of applicability—Inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Division which is generally exercised for preventing the abuse of the process of the Court in respect of the pending proceedings can also be invoked in appropriate cases for securing the ends of justice in respect of a proceeding which has reached its finality. Sohail Ahmed Chowdhwy vs State 47 DLR 482.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Finding of guilt of accused person cannot be based merely on high probabilities but should be rested surely and firmly on the evidence and mere conjecture and hypothesis cannot take the place of proof.In the present case the non production of seized gold for which no explanation has been furnished by the prosecution, failure of the prosecution to test the seized gold by an expert are sufficient to show that the judgment and order of conviction is based on surmises and not on evidence and hence liable to be quashed. Sohail Ahmed Chowdhury vs State 47 DLR 482.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Interference of this Court in exercise of its inherent power under section 561A of the Code at the initial stage of investigation or before taking cognizance or framing of charge will be justified only when this Court finds that the allegations made in the First Information Report or petition of complaint do not constitute the offence alleged against the accused or that on the admitted facts no case can stand against the accused. Santosh Bhusan Das vs State 47 DLR<br/>519.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—That a Minister is personally interested in the case against the accused, though found to be true, by itself is not sufficient to conclude that the allegation against the accused is false. The High Court Division observed rightly that the proceeding cannot be quashed as it remains for the prosecution to establish the allegation by adducing evidence in trial. Engineer Afsaruddin Ahmed vs State 47 DLR (AD) 10.<br/><br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—In view of the unusual facts and circumstances of the case i.e. reinvestigation by the Criminal Investigation Department to be a malafide act to create cleverly a plea of alibi for a particular accused the order of the High Court Division allowing quashment need not be interfered with. Afia Khatoon vs Mobassawir Ali 47 DLR(AD) 62.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—In a rule for quashing the proceeding the Court cannot enter into the merits of the allegations. Khorshed Alam vs Azizur Rahman 48 DLR 36.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Even if accounts of the company were audited and approved by the shareholders the same cannot exonerate the persons in charge of the management of the company from facing trial on the allegation of misappropriation of the fund. Khorshed Alam vs Azizur Rahman 48 DLR 36.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Fresh trial of the petitioner for the negligence of the presiding officer concerned would be an unnecessary harassment to him and an abuse of the process of the Court. Question is whether for such negligence of the presiding officer concerned petitioner should suffer a fresh trial for no fault of his own and procedural technicalities should be allowed to prevail over the ends of justice. In this connection we like to mention that no complaint was made by the Public Prosecutor before the said Tribunal before passing of the said order that no trial was held culminating in pronouncement of judgment on 25-1-89 in open Court acquitting the accused petitioner. In the above facts and circumstances we are of the view that the petitioner should not face any fresh trial for the negligence of the presiding officer. Adhir Kumar Shaha vs State 48 DLR 87.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—In view of existing legal position owing to the enactment of sections 265C &amp; 241A CrPC an accused can prefer an application under section 56lA if he became unsuccessful in his application either under section 265C or section 241A. Otherwise his application under section 561A would be premature. Liton vs State 48 DLR 102.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Even when the seized documents placed before the Court were seized illegally the Court cannot but consider those as relevant to the matter in issue and no inherent jurisdiction of the Court could be exercised for a discussion on evidence. Moudud Ahmed vs State 48 DLR 108.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Submission of charge-sheet beyond the specified time of 30 days under the Anti-Terrorism Act is illegal and, as such, the proceeding cannot proceed in the Anti-Terrorism Tribunal. Shahidullah Kazi, Amjad Hossain vs State, Abul Kasem 48 DLR 178.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Since the jurisdiction of the criminal Court to draw up proceedings under section 145 of the Code is ousted as the civil Court is in seisin of the subject matter of the dispute the entire proceeding in question appears to be without jurisdiction. Jasimuddin vs Md Humayun Kabir 48 DLR 578.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Examination of the existing materials on record taking into account the defenses that the petitioner might offer at the trial, whatever be the merit of such an exercise, is certainly rot the method of disposal of an application under section 561A moved after framing of charge in the case.<br/>After framing a charge, an application under section 561A CrPC to quash the proceedings is still available to the accused-petitioner on the ground that the allegation of facts even if true do not support the accusation or any other offence against him. The charge itself may be impugned but it is not the function of the trial Court while framing charge or the Court exercising jurisdiction under section 561A CrPC to examine the admissibility, relevance, propriety or sufficiency of materials. For, all these questions, especially in a criminal trial, are mixed questions of fact and law which cannot be resolved in an abstract manner without the facts surfacing at the trial. Moudud Ahmed vs State 48 DLR (AD) 42.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—A wide conclusion that after framing of charge no application under sections 561A CrPC lies should be read in the observation of the High Court Division—”I do not agree with the learned Counsel of the petitioner that at this stage, after framing of charge, the proceedings cannot be proceeded with”. Moudud Ahmed vs State 48 DLR (AD) 42.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—There may be cases where allegations in the First Information Report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not constitute the offence alleged, and in such cases it would be legitimate for the High Court Division to hold that it would be manifestly unjust to allow process of the criminal Court to be issued against an accused person. The High Court Division may interfere under section 561A even during Police investigation cognizable offence is disclosed and still more if no offence of any kind is disclosed because in that case the Police would have no authority to undertake an investigation. But the usual and well settled practice is that a criminal proceeding can only be quashed after cognizance has been taken and process issued thereupon subject to the fundamental principle that the power of quashing is and should be very sparingly exercised and only to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court.

Ayub Ali alias Mukul vs State 61 DLR 52.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561 A</strong>—Civil Liability—Since according to the petition of complaint the accused petitioner totally denied the receipt of trucks by agreement and refused to pay the outstanding installments, the question of civil liability does not arise. Defence plea—the proposition of law is now well settled that on the basis of the defence plea or materials, the criminal proceedings should not be if1ed before trial, when there is a prima-facie case for going to the trial. When trial of the case has already commenced and the complainant was examined as a witness quashing of the proceedings is not permissible. Shahida Khatun vs Zafrul Hasan 61 DLR 270.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Nor these sections put any embargo on the power of a Police Officer to make search, seizure or to arrest any person or to investigate into a case and there is also nothing in the said Ain requiring a Police Officer to obtain prior permission of the Director General of Madak Drabya Niantron Adhidaptor to investigate into a case or to search, seize and to arrest any person who has committed or is committing or is likely to commit an offence under the said Ain. Liton Bhuiyan vs State 61 DLR 277.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Out of a contract of service between the employer and employee, whatever its kind may be, if a sum of money as salary, allowance, emolument etc is due to the employee to be paid by the employer, the former has a right to get it from the latter, who owes it to the former, but this right is always a civil or statutory right to be enforceable in a Civil Court or a Labor Court or the like. In such a case, question of criminal liability does not arise at all. The facts depicted in the petition of complaint do not disclose the offence under sections 406/420/ 109 of the Penal Code or any other offence against the accused- petitioners and therefore, allowing continuation of the proceedings in the above CR case will be a sheer abuse of process of court which should be prevented for the ends of justice. Veena Khaleque vs State 61 DLR 762.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Inherent power of the High Court Division is generally exercised where no other remedy is available for obtaining justice in the cause—it should not be invoked where another remedy is available. This power has not been vested upon the High Court Division where another remedy is available. This is an extraordinary power and is exercised in extraordinary circumstances in the interest of justice. Habibur Rahman Mollah vs State 62 DLR (AD) 233.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Whether the appellant has disproportionate wealth, he has concealed his known source of income, there is mis-joinder of charges and the trial of the appellant on facts allegedly committed prior to the promulgation of Dumity Daman Commission Ain, 2004 constitute an offence under the Dumity Daman Commission Ain are disputed facts can only be decided on evidence at the trial. Habibur Rahman Mollah vs State 62 DLR (AD) 233.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The inherent power of the Court is undefined and indefinite and, as such, it must be exercised very sparingly and with great caution. Habibur Rahman Mollah vs State 62 DLR (AD) 233.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The provisions of the Code provide that the administration of criminal justice should be allowed to proceed in the usual manner without interruption. If the High Court Division interferes with the case in the midst of the trial it will have to set up a wrong precedent by which instead of the cause of justice being advanced had really been stifled. Habibur Rahman Mollah vs State 62 DLR (AD) 233.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Since the prosecution case is almost over and the appellant put his defence by cross-examining the witnesses, in view of the consistent views of the superior Courts of this sub-continent that the High Court Division which exercising its power under section 561A of the Code should not usurp the jurisdiction of the trial Court. Habibur Rahman Mollah vs State 62 DLR (AD) 233.<br/><br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—No prima face case was made out against the respondent in the first information report and the District Anti-Corruption Officer, Gazipur without examining the necessary papers of the authority (IPSA) specially bill No.4 dated 29-10-1994 lodged the first information report.<br/>During investigation by police usually the Court does not interfere under section 561 A of the Code but in the instant case is a fit case to interfere at the stage of police investigation to prevent the abuse of the process of the court and to secure the ends of justice. State vs Lailun Nahar Ekram 62 DLR (AD) 283.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Whether the notice as required to be served under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act is essentially a question of fact to be proved by adducing evidence at the time of trial, inasmuch as, there is specific assertion in the complaint petition that such a notice was, served. Sheikh Mashuk vs State 62 DLR 28.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Mere presence of an arbitration clause in the agreement does bar launching of a criminal case, if the complaint discloses a prima facie case as evident from the case reported in 2002 SCC (Cri) 129, SW Palanitkar vs State of Bihar. Sheikh Mashuk Rahman vs State 62 DLR 28.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Defence plea—Defence plea, which, as per well settled principle, is to be decided by evidence before the trial Court and not at all a ground for quashment. Barrister Mainul Hosein vs Md Ali Hossain 62 DLR 38.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Quashing of proceeding, not before cognizance is taken—A criminal case actually starts from the date of taking cognizance and issuance of the process. Before cognizance is taken, there is virtually no pending criminal proceeding in the eye of law. So a non-existent criminal proceeding cannot be subject matter of quashment. In this respect, decision of our apex Court in the case of Abdul Huque vs State reported in 60 DLR (AD) 1 may profitably be quoted. Salahuddin Ahmed vs State 62 DLR 351.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure can exercise its inherent jurisdiction for quashing a proceeding of a criminal case firstly to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order of the Code, secondly to prevent abuse of the process of the Court and lastly otherwise to secure ends of justice. M Fransis P Rojario alias Babu vs State DLR 355.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Initiation of the criminal case at the instance of the present complainant/informant without taking recourse of the res provided in Samabaya Samity Ain, is not maintainable in law. Since initiation of the case is barred by law, this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under section 561A of the Code Criminal Procedure can quash the proceeding at its initial stage before taking cognizance thereof. M Fransis P Rojario alias Babu vs State DLR 355.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Quashing of Proceeding— From a reading of the FIR, it appears that the informant in writing made the statement that “আমি ব্যবসা করার জন্য চুক্তি মোতাবেক মাহমুদুর রহমান ব্যবস্থাপনা পরিচালক মেসার্স রহমান এন্ড কোং”। From this statement it appears that the said transaction was made under an agreement and the narration of fact in the FIR indicates also breach of terms of the agreement had crept up from business transaction. It also appears from the FIR that considerable amount, that is about Taka 16,50,000, has already been paid by the accused-petitioner We are of the view that no criminal intention to cheat or to deceive the informant by the petitioner has been made out by the informant. The learned Advocate for the petitioner cited the decisions reported in 1999 BLD (AD) 128 = 4 BLC (AD) 167,26 DLR (SC) 17, 37 DLR 185 207, 39 DLR 214, 1992 BLD 284 = 45 DLR 660 wherein it has been decided that if from a reading of the FIR it comes up the allegations disclose civil liability then the proceeding can be quashed. The proceeding of GR Case No. 3735 of 2002 pending in the Court of learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka is quashed. Mahamudur Rahman vs Md Matiur Rahman 62 DLR 367.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Neither the Senior Special Judge, nor the Divisional Special Judge considered the facts and materials available on record. Just the case has been proceeded on the basis of the police report which cannot be taken as basis unless it is supported by any materials on record which can be scrutinized at the time of taking of cognizance. Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury vs State 62 DLR 441.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—A Court of law cannot proceed judicially on a mere statement made by police officer to the effect that a prima facie case under certain penal provision has been proved against the accused persons, without disclosing the allegation of fact constituting the offence. Such a statement, unaccompanied by the facts constituting the said offence, which is nothing but a mere opinion of police officer concerned, cannot be in any event, the basis of any judicial action by the Court. Sajeda Chowdhury vs State 62 DLR 441.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—There is no legal impediment to file a criminal case even if a civil suit is pending on the selfsame allegations provided the ingredients of the offence are present Khandaker Abul Bashar vs State 63 DLR (AD) 79.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—During investigation, a proceeding should not be stifled without allowing proper investigation into the allegation, save and except in a very rare type of cases which are found to be so preposterous that the allegations if accepted to be true in its entirety, does not constitute any offence. Habibur Rahman vs State 63 DLR 23.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The exercise of jurisdiction will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Interference even at an initial stage may be justified where the facts are so preposterous that even on the admitted facts no case can stand against the accused and that a further prolongation of the prosecution would amount to harassment to an innocent party and abuse of the process of the Court. Sheikh Hasina vs State 63 DLR 40.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Since there is no legal bar against the initiation, framing of charge, and continuation of the proceedings and, as such, the proceedings do not amount to an abuse of the process of the Court. Abeda Chowdhury vs State 63 DLR 118.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—In the four corners of this case there is not an iota of allegation that the petitioner received any gratification from anybody , in connection with the awarding of the work to the concerned company or there is no ingredients of Section 5(1) of the aforesaid act being punishable under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. The concerned Officer of the Anti-Corruption Commission most hurriedly and at the behest of the then Government lodged this FIR without any sanction from the Anti- Corruption Commission violating the mandatory provisions of Section 32 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004. Sheikh Hasina vs State 63 DLR 162.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Information——Written or oral information—Whenever any written or oral information is placed before any Officer-in-Charge of any Police Station it is his bounden duty to reduce the information into writing, in other words to record the FIR and set the information in motion forthwith and to initiate investigation. Hasura Begum vs Bangladesh DLR 195.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Police has acted with malafide intention at the behest of the then Four Parties alliance backed Government and did not hesitate to victimize eminent jurists of the country at the instance of the persons who is nothing but a busy body. We must expect specially from the higher police officers, who at least go through the laws and relevant decisions of the Apex Court of the country and must work for the interest of their real master, the people of the country. But it is unfortunate that no change has been achieved by<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Criminal proceeding can be preceded independently of the civil suit. Ka Bi Ma Iftekhar Anam vs State 63 DLR 338.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Even non-disclosure of the cause of action cannot be a ground for quashing the proceeding to the great prejudice of the complainant who is entitle to prove his case on evidence. Sarwar Hossain Moni vs State 63 DLR 510.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Non disclosure of the date of receipt of notice under section 138(1)(b) of the Negotiable Instruments Act is a question of fact which will be decided at the time of trial. Noor Jamal vs State 63 DLR 531.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Since it is apparent that at a very initial stage i.e. right after the lodging of the FIR the petitioner obtained the Rule and stay before taking cognizance by a competent Court and, as such, an application under section 561A of the Code should be considered to be a premature one. The truth or otherwise of the allegation as against the accused-petitioner in the FIR could only be decided in the trial on evidence. Bahauddin Haider vs State 63 DLR 561.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>— The cheque was issued to discharge, either in whole or in part, a legally aiforceable debt or liability. The accused petitioner had never any debt or liability to discharge. It is the husband of the accused-petitioner who had the debt or liability to discharge. The liability or debt of the husband of the accused-petitioner cannot be thrust on to the shoulder of the accused-petitioner.’ Given this scenario, if the accused-petitioner is made liable for the debt or liability of her husband, that will go against the spirit of the mandate of section 138(1) of the Act. Shahnaj Begurn vs State 63 DLR 279.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 561A &amp; 145</strong>—Though two civil suits, instituted before the drawing up of the proceeding under section 145 CrPC, are pending, the civil Court has not passed any order regulating possession of the case land, nor a decree for possession or permanent injunction has been granted. In this view of the matter, the jurisdiction of the Magistrate to act under section 145 CrPC is not ousted. Mozaffar Ahmed vs State 49 DLR 485.<br/><br/><strong>Sections 561A &amp; 145</strong>—When the Civil Court is already seized with the question of regulating possession of the land between the same parties, the Magistrate acted without jurisdiction in initiating the impugned proceeding under section 145 CrPC. Abul Bashar vs Hasanuddin Ahmed 51 DLR (AD) 14.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 561A&amp; 145</strong>-When the Civil Court is already seized with the question of regulating possession of the land between the same parties the Magistrate acted without jurisdiction in initiating the proceeding under section 145 CrPC. Abdul Majid Mondal vs State 51 DLR 287.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 561A &amp; 195</strong>—In a proceeding where a forged document has been used the Court concerned should make the complaint.. The criminal Court should not take cognizance on a private complaint. The want of complaint under section 195 is incurable and the lack of it vitiates the whole trial. Wahida Khan vs Shahar Banoo Ziwar Sultan and State 48 DLR 286.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 561A&amp; 265C</strong>—We do not find any reason to  quash the instant criminal case by involving our inherent jurisdiction under section 561A CrPC as the Code under section 265C provides for an alternative remedy. Salahuddin vs State 51 DLR 299.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/> <strong>Sections 561A, 439A &amp; 439(4)—</strong>The Sessions Judge’s decision is not final in relation to a person who has not filed the revisional application to the Sessions Judge but has been impleaded therein as opposite party. He is free to go to any appropriate forum to challenge the Sessions Judge’s decision. But he cannot go to the High Court Division with another revisional application, as such an application—better known as second revision—is expressly barred by section 439. Though the High Court Division cannot entertain any application under section 439(1) from a decision of the Sessions Judge under section 439A, still it can interfere with the Sessions Judge’s order by invoking its inherent power for the limited purposes as set out in that, section namely, ‘to give effect to any order under the Code, orto prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure ends of justice’. Sher Ali vs State 46 DLR (AD) 67.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 561A &amp; 439(4)-</strong>As there is nothing in the impugned order requiring to prevent abuse of the process of the Court or to secure the ends of justice, the revisional application is barred under the amended provision of section 439(4) of the CrPC. Anower Hossain vs Md Idrish Miah 48 DLR 295.<br/><br/><strong>Section 561A, 498—</strong>It appears the petitioner was a Judge of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh this having a respectable status in the society. He has also acted as an Adviser of the then Caretaker Government headed by Professor lajuddin Ahmed. Complying the notice of the Anti- Corruption Commission the petitioner submitted his wealth statement before the Anti-Corruption Commission wherefrom the commission has invented a discrepancy in his wealth statement and also other corruption committed by him during his tenure as Adviser of the Caretaker Government. He has retired from the Appellate Division at the age of 65 years and now running 70 with ailing health as appears even from his gestures. His application for bail is allowed considering the fact that he may be harassed by the vested quarters before his surrender in the trial Court. Fazlul Haque vs State, ACC 60 DLR 648.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A &amp; 439(A)—</strong>A party aggrieved by the order of discharge passed by the Magistrate can move to the superior Court against such order in which case the Superior Court may pass order to consider the materials for the prosecution but cannot direct the Magistrate to frame charge. Abul Kalam Azad vs State 60 DLR 470.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 561A, 195(C), 344(1)—</strong>The proceeding of CR Case No. 2969 of 2004 under sections 468, 34 of the Penal Code, now pending in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, be postponed or stayed for a period of 1 year from the date of receipt of this judgment by the Court below.

This duty was conferred upon the members of the Bar to safeguard, protect and defend the Constitution and to maintain its supremacy as the embodiment of the will of the people. State vs Chief Editor, Manabjamin 57 DLR 359.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 7</strong>—Like the lawyers, equally the citizens also have their Constitutional responsibility to ensure the maintenance of the Constitutional norms in the matter of appointment of judges of this Court. State vs Chief Editor, Manabjamin 57 DLR 359.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 28(4</strong>)—Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain would not override the provisions of the Children Act, 1974, so far as it relates to the prosecution of youthful offenders, since it encompasses the spirit of Article 28(4) of the Constitution. State vs Md Roushan Mondal Hashem 59 DLR 72.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 28(4)—</strong>When an accused claims to be below 16 years of age, a duty is cast upon the court to .direct an enquiry to satisfy itself as to whether the accused is a child below 16 years of age on the day of framing charges against him. Rahamatullah (Md) vs State 59 DLR 520.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 32</strong>—”Save in accordance with law” as mentioned in Article 32 not only refers to criminal law but also civil law which provides for arrest and detention, namely, for recovery of decretal dues and public dues. State vs Faisal Alam Ansari 53 DLR (AD) 43.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 32</strong>—Keeping of any prisoner in jail after he served out the sentence amounts to violation of Human Rights and Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Faustina Pereira, Advocate Supreme Court vs State 53 DLR 414.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 33(1)—</strong>Any person accused of an offence before a Criminal Court, or against whom proceedings are instituted under this Code in any such Court, may of right be defended by a pleader.<br/>The law has not given any authority to the learned Sessions Judge to limit the appointment of lawyer by each accused. The order limiting the appointment of lawyer by each accused is absolutely without jurisdiction. Section 352 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the learned Judge of the Court will consider the accommodation of the general public in the Court room. If one accused engages for himself one hundred lawyers, the lawyers are entitled to defend the accused and as regards sitting arrangement the Judge will control, but he cannot pass any order limiting the appointment of lawyer. Hossain Mohammad Ershad [former President Lieutenant General (Retd)] vs State 48 DLR 95.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 33(4)</strong><strong>―</strong>This decision deals with the implication of sections 10, 11 and 12 of the Special Powers Act read with Article 33(4) of the Constitution regarding the placing of the case of the detenu within the statutory period of 120 days (as per section 10) before the Advisory Board, sending of the report of the Advisory Board containing its opinion to the Government within 170 days as per section II and the legal necessity of the Government to confirm or revoke the order of detention (and in case of confirmation pass further order for continuation of detention serving the same on the detenu) which in effect means that continuation of an order of detention for indefinite period, even if initially otherwise valid, becomes illegal either on 120th day due to contravention of section 10, or, on 170th day due to the contravention of the provisions of sections 11 and 12 of tbe Special Powers Act or. on 180th day if the provision of section 12 of the said Act read with Art 33(4) of the Constitution is not complied with. Md Mansur vs Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 42 DLR 272.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Article 33(4)—</strong>Government cannot detain a person beyond &amp; months as the Advisory Board did not submit its opinion within that period. Detention is illegal, being also in contravention of Article 33(4) of the Constitution. It is clear from the provision of Article 33(4) of the Constitution that if the Advisory Board does not report within six months that there is, in its opinion, sufficient cause for such detention of the detenu concerned the Government cannot detain the detenu beyond six months. Undoubtedly the detenu was never placed before the Advisory Board within six months from his first detention on 8-1-88. Therefore, the order of detention Annexure-F dated 23-5-88 is illegal. We are of the view that the detention of the detenu is illegal, without any lawful authority and does not come within the scope of the Special Powers Act and is in contravention of Article 33(4) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. Mono-wara Begum vs Secretary Ministry of Home Affairs 41 DLR 35<br/> <br/><strong>Article 33(5)—</strong>Preventive detention— Detaining authority must keep in view Article 33(5) of the Constitution—Grounds to be communicated at the earliest to the detenu regarding the order of detention. The detaining authority must always keep in view Article 33(5) of the Constitution which provides that the authority making the order for preventive detention shall, as soon as may be, communicate to the detained person the grounds on which the order of detention has been made and the Legislature in section 8(2) of Special Powers Act has taken pains to specifically direct the detaining authority to cause service of the order containing the detailed grounds of detention at the time of detention, that is, at the very moment he is detained under the order of preventive detention. Dr Md Habibullah vs Secretary Ministry, of HomeAffairs 41 DLR 160.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 33(5)—</strong>Grounds in the initial order of detention cannot be substituted for separate grounds to be communicated to the detenu. Chunnu Chowdhury vs District Magistrate 41<br/>DLR 156.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 35</strong>—Double Jeopardy—The accused is going to be prosecuted in respect of an offence which did not occur during the earlier transaction nor the present case arose out of the same fact and for the present offence he was not tried previously. In such a position the doctrine of the Constitution or of the Code as to double jeopardy is not applicable in the present case. HM Ershad vs State 45 DLR 534.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 35(1)—</strong>Article 35(1) of the Constitution envisages the prohibition on conviction or sentence under an “ex post facto law” not trial of the offence alleged to have been committed or the procedure to be followed in the investigation, inquiry in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed. Tarique Rahman vs Government of Bangladesh 65 DLR (AD) 18.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Article 35(1)—</strong>The principle of ‘ex post facto’ laws as embodied in Article 35(1) of the Constitution is not applicable in the instant case since the alleged offences were committed during the operation of the Ain of 2002, the punishment for the said offence as provided under Chapter IV of the Ain be applicable. There is no bar to hold trial of the petitioner under provisions of the ACC Act, 2004 for the commission of the offence alleged to have been committed under the Ain of 2002. The case be treated as one instituted under the Ain of 2002. Tarique Rahman vs Government of Bangladesh 63 DLR (AD) 18.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 35(1)—</strong>There is a prohibition on conviction or sentence under an “ex post facto law” not trial of the offence alleged to have been committed or the procedure to be followed in the investigation, inquiry in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed. A person accused of the commission of an offence has no fundamental right to a trial by a particular Court or by a particular procedure except insofar as any Constitutional objection by way of discrimination or violation of any other fundamental right may be involved. The prohibition under this clause does not extend to merely procedural laws and procedural law would not contravene Article 35(1) merely because retrospective effect is given to it. Tarique Rahman vs Government of Bangladesh 63 DLR (AD) 162.<br/> <br/><strong>Articles 35(1) &amp; 102(2)—</strong>The writ petition is misconceived one and not maintainable since vires of no law has been challenged. The provision of sub-article (1) of Article 35 of the nstitution will not be attracted since the offence as well as its punishment, if any, would be dealt with under the Ain of 2002. From a clear reading of the FIR, Investigation Report and other materials on record, a prima-facie case under Sections 2 (ট) (আ) (ই)  and Section 13 of the Ain of 2002 has been disclosed. Tarique Rahman vs Government of Bangladesh 18.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 35(4)—</strong>In the enquiry the petitioners can very well controvert the allegations against them. It cannot be suggested that by mere issuance of notices the petitioners are compelled to give evidence against themselves. Article 35(4) therefore is of no avail to the petitioners. Abdul Hafiz vs Director General, Bureau of Anti-Corruption, Government of Bangladesh 51 DLR 72.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 35(5)—</strong>In case of malafide the matter of non-disclosure will be justifiable one. But for the clear constitutional sanction a non-disclosure of fact that was considered to the prejudice of the detenu ought to be regarded as a violation of basic principle of natural justice.<br/><br/>The detenu cannot also ask as a matter of right to the detaining authority the facts not disclosed on the plea of public interest. This is the privilege of the State and this privilege the State can always claim against the detenu. Further, when the liberty of a citizen is at stake and when constitutional protection is sought for, it is the Court alone which can very well look into all the materials including the materials to which privilege is claimed by the detaining authority. If, in fact, a privilege is claimed in respect of any material, it is the High Court Division alone that would finally decide as to whether the document is really a privileged one or not. Under proviso to Article 33(5) of the Constitution, the authority has got a constitutional protection not to disclose anything in public interest and it is the constitutional Court alone which can look into the materials pertaining to the detention of the detenu as contemplated in the Constitution for its satisfaction alone. The privilege given to the State in the interest of the State, people or community cannot be asked for as a matter of right. Habiba Mahmud vs Bangladesh 45 DLR (AD) 89.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 39</strong>—Contempt—Limits of the press —Freedom of the press is recognized in our Constitution—a Court is to suffer criticism made against it. Only in exceptional cases of bad faith or ill motive it will resort to law of contempt. Saleem Ullah vs State 44 DLR (AD) 309.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 39</strong>—Freedom of speech and expression is tolerated so long as it is not malicious or libelous. If speech or expression was untrue and reckless, the speaker or the author does not get protection of the constitutional right. State vs Chief Editor, Manabjamin 57 DLR 359.<br/> <br/><strong>Articles 39 &amp; 108</strong>—Article 108 of the Constitution has conferred upon both the Divisions of the Supreme Court, as the Court of record, the power of contempt of Court. In Bangladesh this field is governed thus by Articles 108 and 39 read with the Contempt of Courts Act. State vs Chief Editor Manabjamin 57 DLR 359.<br/> <br/><strong>Articles 39(1) &amp; 141(1)—</strong>The intention of the publication was to make the real Muslims aware about the false interpretation given by the so-called half-educated and preachers of Islam. The allegation does not come within the ambit of the offence of section 295A of Penal Code against the petitioners. Shamsuddin Ahmed vs State and another 52 DLR 497.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 40</strong>—Right to profession—The impugned restriction on the petitioner’s right to be enlisted as a contractor may be bonafide and in the  interest of the Board, but when it interferes with his fundamental right to profession, the restriction cannot be allowed to exist unless authorized by law. Abdul Jalil vs Chairman, REB. 45 DLR 24.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 41</strong>—Right to profess religion—The right of the Ahmadiyya community to preach their religious beliefs is subject to law, public order and morality. The book having contained matters which are deliberately and maliciously intended to outrage the religious beliefs of the bulk of the Muslims, the Government was justified in forfeiting the book. Bangladesh Anjuman-e-Ahmadiyya vs Bangladesh 45 DLR 185.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 56(3)—</strong>For a detention order made by the District Magistrate on being satisfied about the prejudicial act by any person and the extension of such order by the Government under section 3 of the Special Powers Act, there is no requirement of law to place it before the President for his approval, and consequently there is no obligation nor scope to pass order by noting it as “by order of the President” and this being a purely executive order the provision of Article 56(3) of the Constitution is not applicable to this case. Sekandar Ali vs Bangladesh 42 DLR 346.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 58(2) (now repealed)—</strong>The nature of the document of which the petitioner pleads protection and the related matters being in the facts of the case a mixed question of fact and law, it is not yet time to consider this constitutional question while the document is still not ready for observation with all its factual clothing’s. The Indian cases relied upon by the petitioner are constitutional cases in which Article 74(1)) of the Indian Constitution came up for repeated interpretation. Any interpretation of Article 58(now repealed) of the Constitution by us while disposing of an application of this nature will not be on a par with the Indian decisions on the subject because our decision too will be tentative in nature and will not be binding on the trial Court. We, therefore, see no reason to grant leave to consider a question of constitutional importance when the occasion for such consideration has not arisen. Moudud Ahmed vs State 48 DLR (AD) 42.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Article 58(2)—</strong>Criminal trial—constitutional protection—where the State does not take shelter of article 58(2) rather it produces through its machinery for procuring the documents by submitting the charge sheet statement under section 161 CrPC and he police record, the protection of Article 58(2) is of no avail to the petitioner. Moudud Ahmed vs State 48 DLR 108.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 58(2)—</strong>Unless it can be shown by a party that his claims of protection under Article 58(2) is on the basis of “Public interest” Article 58(2) hardly has any role to play. Moudud Ahmed vs State 48 DLR 108.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 58(2)</strong>—The order made by the petitioner as a Minister being something more than his advice to the President, the Court’s jurisdiction is not ousted from enquiry into the same reason of Article 58(2). On the first contention of constitutional embargo upon the Court to enquire into any advice given by the Ministers as contended under Aiticle 58(2) to the President is concerned I am of the opinion that which constitute the advice can not be inquired into by any Court but the materials upon which that advice is given does not disentitle a Court from examining the same. Moudud Ahmed vs State 48DLR 108.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 65</strong>—Parliament being the Supreme Legislative authority subject to the constitutional limitations under Article 65 has the plenary power to pass any law on any subject both prospectively and retrospectively. But the parliament cannot pass a law to create a new offence which is not in existence at the time of commission of the act charged as an offence nor can it increase penal liability with retrospective effect. Tarique Rahman vs Government of Bangladesh 63 DLR (AD) 18.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 78(3)</strong><strong>―</strong>No member of the Legislature should be questioned or penalised by any Court for anything said within its four walls. Cyril Sikdar vs Nazmul Huda 46 DLR 555.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 94(4)—</strong>Independence of judiciary is the sine qua non of modem democracy. So long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from the Legislature and the Executive, the general power of the people will never be endangered. State vs Chief Editor Manabjamin 57 DLR 359.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 95</strong>—The majority party in parliament forms government and therefore a heavy duty is cast upon the parliament to see and monitor as the controlling authority of the Government that no person unworthy of the post is ever appointed as a judge of this Court. State vs Chief Editor, Manabjamin 57 DLR 359.<br/><br/><strong>Articles 95 &amp; 98</strong>—In the matter of appointment of judges of the High Court Division of this Court a prior consultation with the Full Court is a must and their opinion must have a primacy and be binding on the Executive. Otherwise not only the independence of the judiciary which is one of the basic features of the Constitution will be destroyed but spineless, pliant and submissive persons would be appointed by the Executive on extraneous grounds which would not be conducive to justice. State vs Chief Editor, Manabjamin 57 DLR 359.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Article 96</strong>—If anybody believes that a Judge has committed misconduct, it becomes his obligation to bring it to the notice of the Supreme Judicial Council or the President and place the materials before them. It would then be the constitutional obligation of the Supreme Judicial Council and of the President to proceed against the delinquent Judge. State vs Chief Editor, Manabjamin 57 DLR 359.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 99(1)—</strong>In our Constitution there is no bar in reappointing a judge on contract basis on retirement in a judicial or quasi-judicial office. Men are by nature selfish and judges are also human beings with all the failings. To keep them above board the relevant provision as contained in Article 99 of the Constitution should be abolished. State vs Chief Editor Manabjamin 57 DLR 359.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102</strong>—A litigant has no inherent right in procedural remedy. Since the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court has observed in 35 DLR (AD) 127 that there is no scope for second revision the matter ends there. That does not mean, that of necessity a writ-jurisdiction may be invoked. Haji Golam Hossain vs Abdur Rahman Munshi 40 DLR (AD) 196.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102</strong>—In certiorari the Court can declare that the conviction of the accused was recorded without lawful authority—if the accuser’s trial is vitiated by irregularities in procedure causing him prejudice, the proceedings can be quashed. State vs Zahir 45 DLR (AD) 163.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102</strong>—A writ petition does not lie against the decision of the Sessions Judge under section 439A CrPC. A litigant has no inherent right in procedural remedy. Appeal or revision must be given expressly by law. A writ jurisdiction cannot of necessity be invoked. Haji Golam Hossain vs Abdur Rahman Munshi 40 DLR (AD) 196.<br/> <br/><strong>Article I 02</strong>—Forfeiture of book—Defect in the order is no ground for exercise of writ jurisdiction—For enforcement of fundamental right and for cancellation of order, the Court should look to the equity and good conscience in passing the impugned order (forfeiting the book in question). When the book contains materials justifying the government’s action, the impugned order cannot be struck down on the ground that it does not mention the facts in support of the action. Bangladesh Anjuman-e-Ahmadiyya vs Bangladesh 45 DLR 185.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102</strong>—The right to hear is a personal right—the writ petitioner being not the author or publisher of the forfeited book is not entitled to prior notice asking him to show cause against the impugned order. Bangladesh Anjuman-e-Ahmadijya vs Bangladesh 45 DLR 185.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102</strong>—The Court is to hold the balance between the State’s need to prevent prejudicial activities and citizen’s right to enjoy his personal liberty. Habiba Mahmud vs Bangladesh 45 DLR (AD) 89.<br/><br/><strong>Article 102</strong>—When Court examines a confidential file relating to a detenu it should indicate, without disclosing the materials, that there are facts in the confidential file that are relatable to the ground of detention. Habiba Mahmud vs Bangladesh 45 DLR (AD) 89.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102</strong>—Inordinate delay renders Writ Petition liable to be rejected in that the remedy through such petition is to be sought without inordinate delay. Mizan Howlader vs Bangladesh 48 DLR 91.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102</strong>—The authority can never justify an order of preventive detention by merely saying that the action was taken in the interest of public safety and public order. It has to satisfy the High Court Division which is an obligation cast upon the Court by the Constitution, that there were materials on record as would satisfy a reasonable person to justify the order of detention. It must be made clear that the law which we have declared has never granted absolute power either to the Government or to the President to make an order of detention even in the circumstances mentioned in the judgment nor it is the law that the satisfaction upon which an order of detention is made is immune from challenge. The power of the Supreme Court in making scrutiny of executive acts never recedes to the background, as observed by the learned Judge, so long as the Constitution remains operative. The maintenance of law and order, public peace, public safety and security are undisputedly concerns of the State and the Government know best how to preserve them, but the Court’s concern in a case of pceventive detention is to see whether the person is being detained without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner. Mostafizur Rahman vs Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary Ministry of Home Affairs 51 DLR 1.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102</strong>—Safe custody is a judicial custody for definite purpose of ensuring the lfare of a victim girl devised by our courts. Kabir vs Government of Bangladesh through the Ministry of Home Affairs 52 DLR 234.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102</strong>—Custody—The detenu, we are inclined to direct that the detenu will stay with the father five days a week and two days a week, with his mother. The weekly two days will be from Thursday at 6-00 PM till 6-00 PM of Saturday, Respondent No. 3 will ensure handing over the detenu at the parent’s house of the petitioner and will collect the detenu from there according to the time. The petitioner shall stay with her son on those two days in her parent’s house. However, the parties will be at liberty to change the time and day by mutual agreements. Rayana Rahman vs Bangladesh 63 DLR 305.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102</strong>—195 Prisoners of War, the alleged perpetrators of the crime against humanity; were not under the custody of Bangla-desh at the time of the agreement, rather they were under the custody of India and they were handed over to Pakistan to protect the better interest of the country under a peace agreement and now after lapse of 36 years that cannot be declared illegal by invoking writ jurisdiction, which is absolutely unrealistic and absurd, rather it is clearly a product of ulterior motive. (Per Mohammad Anwarul Haque J). Wing Commander M Hamidullah Khan Bir Protik vs Bangladesh 63 DLR 488.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102</strong>—Let a Rule Nisi be issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the New Delhi agreement signed by the then Foreign Minister of Bangladesh on 9th April, 1974 and thereby releasing 195 Prisoners of War (PoWs) identified as perpetrators óferimes against humanity should not be declared to have been made without lawful authority and is of no legal effect and as to why these 195 PoWs released under New Delhi Agreement should not be brought to justice and prosecuted and punished by International Crimes Tribunal and why the respondent should not be directed to produce a list of 3 millions martyrs who made the highest sacrifice in the War of Liberation in 1971. (Per Syed Abu Kowser Md Dabirush-Shan J). Wing Commander M Hamidullah Khan Bir Protik vs Bangladesh 63 DLR 488.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Article 102</strong>—They are an utter distortion of historical facts and bring into question the ethos of the Liberation War and is a slur on Bangali nationalism. In the absence of the petitioner or his representative I refrain from passing any order in this regard. This being a Court of Record, the petitions are available to the learned Attorney- General to take any appropriate action against the petitioner, if he is so advised. (Per Md Imman Ali J, agreeing with Md Anwarul Haque). Wing Commander M Hamidullah Khan Bir Protik vs Bangladesh 63 DLR 488.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)—</strong>Fugitive from justice— where the prosecution has investigated the matter and submitted charge-sheet which prima-facie discloses a cognizable offence against the petitioner, the petitioner is bound under the law to appear before the appropriate Court. His failure to do so has made him a fugitive from justice and, as such, writ petition cannot be entertained. Safiat Sobhan vs Anti-Corruption Commission 62 DLR 511.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)—</strong>The writ petitioners without surrendering before any Court of law filed the writ petition and obtained Rule and stay. The principle of criminal jurisprudence is that a person concerned should submit to the process of justice before he can cIaim right of audience provided in law as well as the judicial convention, which is very much effective in the Court of law as the age-old maxim goes that a person who seeks justice from the Court of the law must come before the Court to agitate his grievance and must surrender first to the process ofjustice, otherwise, he remains to be fugitive from justice and cannot seek aid of assistance of the process of justice in order to claim right of audience against the process of the Court issued against him. Nur Hossain Miah vs Bangladesh 62 DLR 514.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)</strong><strong>―</strong>The petitioners were fugitive from justice when moved the writ petition and obtained the Rule and Stay. In view of the above, at the time of ‘motion’ hearing this Division wrongly entertained the writ petition and stayed the investigation against the writ petitioners. Nur Hossain Miah vs Bangladesh 62 DLR 514.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(a)(i)—</strong>The Sessions Judge having reversed the finding of possession made in favour of the appellant by the Magistrate, the appellant cannot file writ petition in the nature of mandamus under Article 102(a)(i) of the Constitution. Haji Golam Hossain vs Abdur Rahman Munshi 40 DLR (AD) 196.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(b)(i)</strong>—While detaining a person the Government must serve specific grounds for detention so as to enable him to know what are his faults and illegalities. Detention on grounds vague and indefinite without giving sufficient materials to enable the detenu to make effective representation is illegal. Md Sekandar Ali vs Bangladesh 42 DLR 346.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(b)(i)</strong>—A preventive detention is the deprivation of the liberty of a citizen, which right should not be taken away in an arbitrary manner. So this Court enjoys power to review the actions of the detaining authority under Articles 102(2)(b)(i) of the Constitution and under section 491 of the Code. Anwar Hossain vs State 55 DLR 643. <br/><br/><strong>Article 102(2)(i)—</strong>The High Court Division clearly proceeded on a misapprehension of the nature of an application under Article 102(2)(i) of the Constitution. Sajeda Parvin vs Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(i)—</strong>The Dhaka High Court and after 1972 the High Court of this country have consistently held that where the petitioner has challenged his detention as illegal and the detention is continued by successive orders and the detaining authority fails to show that any of the successive orders of detention is illegal, the rule does not become infructuous. Sajeda Parvin vs Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(i)—</strong>The fact of detention and not the date of order of the detention is the material point. Sajeda Parvin vs Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(b)(i)—</strong>High Court Division. which took the view “This rule therefore has become infructuous after revocation of the impugned (original) order and the detenu is in detention not under the said order but under the subsequent order which is not the subject-matter of the present rule” missed the tenor of Article 102(2)(b)(1) which confers jurisdiction on it to “satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner”. Sajeda Parvin vs Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(b)(i)—</strong>Writ of Habeas Corpus—Nature of enquiry—HC Division’s view erroneous—Considering the nature of enquiry as it is, there is no hesitation in saying that the High Court Division has erroneously taken the view that the Rule (issued by it) has become in fructuous as because fresh order had been passed which was not, speaking technically, a subject matter of the Rule To say the least, the view that was taken in the case of Abdul Latjf Mirza 31 DLR (AD) 1 was overlooked. Sajeda Parvin vs Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(b)(i)—</strong>In 31 DLR (AD) 1, it was held that the order of detention for its validity is to be tested on the basis whether the detaining authority had before it material which gave a rational probative value of the order and are not extraneous to the purpose of the Act and beyond which the order of detention is immune from challenge except on the ground of malafide. Sajeda Parvin vs Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(b)(i)—</strong>Malafide vitiates everything and the point is so settled that it needs no reiteration by referring to the decided case [Ref: 34 DLR (AD) 222] Sajeda Parvin vs Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(b)(i)—</strong>Order of detention was passed for collateral purposes. Hence the detention is illegal. Sajeda Parvin vs Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 103</strong>—Where serious defect in the finding of fact given by the High Court Division is discovered and the same are considered not tenable then it should be open to the Appellate Division to come to its own’, independent finding upon a re-examination of the evidence untram meled by the opinion of the Court appealed from. State vs Abdus Sattar 43 DLR (AD) 44.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 103—</strong>State filed a leave petition against the order of acquittal by the High Court Division which was dismissed after hearing— Subsequently the informant filed another leave petition. There is no scope for hearing the second petition at the instance of the informant. Mostoshir Ali vs Arman Ali 42 DLR (AD) 12.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 103</strong>—To suggest that a leave petition may be filed under Article 103 challenging the Sessions Judge’s decision is itself tantamount to legistation against which the learned judges have patronisingly cautioned. Sher Ali vs State 46 DLR (AD) 67.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 103</strong>—The accused was acquitted and state petitioner did not take any step for hearing of the petition in the last 5 years. In view of the above, the impugned judgment is not to be interfered with. State vs Shahjahan 53 DLR (AD) 58.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 103</strong>—Though the leave petition was filed in time, the State did not take any step during the period of about seven years to get it heard. On this very account the leave petition must be rejected. State vs Abu Musa @ Musaya @ Shapir Bap 53 DLR (AD) 81.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 103</strong>—This Division does not interfere on the ground that upon evidence on record a different conclusion might be arrived at from those upon which the High Court Division acquitted the accused persons State vs Abu Musa @ Musaya @ Shapir Bap 53 DLR (AD) 81.<br/> <br/><strong>Articles 103 &amp; 104—</strong>To meet the ends of juUce the conviction under section 4 of the Anti- Terrorism Act is maintained but the sentence of rigorous imprisonment for life is modified to 10 years rigorous imprisonment with fine as ordered. Jahangir Alam alias Zakir vs State 56 DLR (AD) 217.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 104</strong>—Reduction of sentence—The respondent suffered much during these long years and any direction to suffer further imprisonment will only add to his misery of which he has had enough. The order of the High Court Division acquitting him though set aside and that of the conviction by the Special Judge under section 409 Penal Code is restored, the sentence of his imprisonment is, therefore, reduced to the period already undergone by him. State vs Abdul Mutaleb Khan 45 DLR (AD) 131.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 105</strong>—Merely reversing the order basing on the evidence on record would render the order in review without jurisdiction. Similarly, an error which has to be established by a long process of reasoning on points where there may conceivably be two opinions can hardly be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record. Ershad Ali Sikder vs State 56 DLR (AD) 87.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 105</strong>—Review—The grounds taken for review of the impugned judgment are nothing but a device of rehearing of the whole petition for leave to appeal which is not permissible under Article 105 of the Constitution with Order XXVI of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh (Appellate Division) Rules,1988. Tarique Rahman vs Government of Bangladesh 63 DLR (AD) 162.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 105</strong>—In order to review a judgment there must be an error apparent on the face of the record and that this error is so apparent and manifest and clear that no court of law would permit such an error to remain on the record. The error must not only be apparent but must also have a material bearing on the face of the case, Tarique Rahman vs Government of Bangladesh 63 DLR (AD) 162.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>Article 111</strong>—Any decision passed by this Division is binding upon all Courts in Bangladesh and no judge can ignore it. If he does it may not only be contemptuous but also tantamount to violation of the Constitution. State vs Mukta Khan 63 DLR (AD) 57.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 112</strong>—Where specific criminal charge has been levelled and specific criminal case is pending, the executive authority should not take recourse to preventive detention—Executive authority is to act in aid of the Supreme Court as a solemn constitutional obligation. AKM Azizul Hoque vs Bangladesh 42 DLR 189.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 148</strong>—Secretaries of the Government are directed to submit reports as to the steps taken pursuant to directions of the Court as to enforcement of laws involving juvenile accused. State vs Deputy Commissioner Satkhira 45 DLR 643.<br/> <br/><strong>Article 226</strong>—The Indian judicial view is completely different from that of Bangladesh judicial view on the matter. It is the approach of subjective satisfaction that is being made in the preventive detention cases. It will be a dangerous slip to go into those decisions. Sajeda Parvin vs Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.</div></div></div>

Mainul Hosein &amp; others vs Sheikh Hasina Wazed53 DLR 138.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Per Md Abdur Rashid J (agreeing): Jurisdiction—This Division may suo moto or on the information received take cognizance of an offence of contempt. The jurisdiction is sui generis and consists of a special set of principles as stated in AIR 1954 (SC) 186 and PLD 1972 (SC) 39. Mainul Hosein vs Sheikh Hasina Wazed 53 DLR 138.<br/> <br/>Per Md Abdur Rashid J (agreeing) A contempt proceeding is quasi-criminal in nature. The contemner is entitled to benefit of doubt, and since the Court is both prosecutor and judge, rule as to proof of guilt of the contemner must be strictly observed. Mainul Hosein vs Sheikh Hasina Wazed 53 DLR 138.<br/> <br/>Per Md Abdur Rashid J (agreeing) : What could readily be read as contemptuous in 1900 or 1912 or 1936 is not so easily read now in the context of expanding rights guaranteed as fundamental to human existence under the Constitution. Mainul Hosein vs Sheikh Hasina Wazed 53 DLR 138.<br/> <br/>Per Md Abdur Rashid (agreeing) : Statements based on inaccurate assessments of situation, however grossly misreading those may be, cannot amount to contempt of court. Moreover, in the absence of mens rea, no contempt is established. Mainul Hosein vs Sheikh Hasina Wazed 53 DLR 138.<br/> <br/>Per Md Abdur Rashid J (agreeing) : It is not correct to think that the judges are above law or there is no accountability of the judges under the Constitution. The sooner it is understood the better for the whole nation. Mainul Hosein vs Sheikh Hasina Wazed 53 DLR 138.<br/> <br/>Per Md Abdur Rashid J (agreeing) : The Prime Minister of the Republic is the leader of the House of the Nation. The Parliament comprises of members, both of the ruling party as well as of the Opposition. The aggrieved members of the Parliament could have more opportunities and better scope to hold their leader to account in the Parliament for her statements. But they preferred to abdicate their constitutional privilege and submitted before the Court to punish their leader by this Division for infraction of the Constitution. Such novel step, unprecedented in the constitutional history, I am afraid, would not create any good precedent. Mainul Hosein vs Sheikh Hasina Wazed 53 DLR 138.<br/> <br/>Per Md Abdur Rashid J (agreeing) The people are equally and strongly divided like the lawyers. Such division demands serious circumspection from the judiciary. Then the reason for such division is nowhere found except in the politics. The judiciary must guard against all chances of the party politics creeping into the holy precincts of the citadel of justice lest it ultimately fell victim to politics.

The letter writer, namely MA Monir, Contemner No. 1, was a non-descript person venturing into the field of administration of justice—Contemner Nos. 2-4 offered unconditional apology to the Court which was considered adequate but were warned to be very careful in printing such offending materials written by ill-equipped, unqualified and nondescript people to interfere in matters which are not subject-matter of their concem—Contemner No. 1 is convicted.

State vs Shahidul Alam Chowdhury 51 DLR 380<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—The Magistrate having appeared to have violated the order of the Court through misreading of the order and there being no mens rea in the violation, he need not be asked to show cause as to why he should not be held guilty of contempt of the Court. Abdul Jabbar vs State 44 DLR 21.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—Contempt by judicial officer— Unqualified apology—After considering the background of the ease and the power to punish a person for contempt in extreme necessity, only to keep the flow of administration smooth and undisturbed, Court does not accept the apology but considers this as a mitigating factor and, instead of sentencing him to imprisonment, the Court is inclined to take a lenient view in the matter of sentence. The contemner Assistant Judge is accordingly let off with an admonition only.

State vs Joynal Abedin 43 DLR 261.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—The Sessions Judge or any other judicial officer shall not act merely as a post box to send each and every application to this Court even if he finds no ground to send the same for taking action under the Contempt of Courts Act.

Subbatara Begum vs Ansaruddin, Officer-in-Charge 50 DLR 339.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—Failure to obey any process of the Court, when other methods of enforcing the process are available, does not amount to a contempt of Court. In view of the decisions in the case of Bahawal Bhaloo, 14 DLR (SC) 273 and Dr MO Ohani vs Dr ANM Mahmood, 18 DLR (SC) 463 the present application filed by the plaintiff- petitioners under the Contempt of Court Act, 1926 (Act XII of 1926) has no substance.

Abdul Haque vs District Judgeship 51 DLR (AD) 15.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—This case should serve as a reminder to all concerned that the Court will not hesitate to deal with member of the subordinate judiciary if he is not cautious, restrained, respectful and deferential with regard to the highest judiciary.

These remarks certainly render the Judges contemptible in the eyes of the general public and undoubtedly casts aspersions on the courage and ability of the Judges and by no stretch of imagination can it be said that it is not written for scandalising the Judges or his authority and dOes not amount to contempt of Court. The atticle was written malafide in a tone to undermine ibe judiciary and it’tends to ‘breed conflict between the two organs of the state—the legislature and the judiciary. Judges of the High Court Division vs Ashok Kumar Karmaker 48 DLR 179.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—Where the writings published are proved to be that of the particular writer a lenient view may be taken in case of the ditor, the printer and the Publisher for such news item or the article.

In Bangladesh this field is governed thus by. Articles 108 and 39 read with the Contempt of Courts Act. State vs Chief Editor, Manabjamin 57 DLR 359.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—Mens rea is not a relevant ingredient for committing criminal contempt.

Shahudul Haque, IG Police vs State 58 DLR (AD) 15.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—They thoigb tendered unconditional apology but dd not, by themselves, promise never again to repeat the forbidden acts and it was devoid of remorse. The contemners, by questioning/casting doubt about the flag of the Supreme Court and the Judge concerned carrying the flag on his car undermined the authority of the Supreme Court. Shahudul Haque, IG Police vs State 58 DLR (AD) 150.<br/><br/><strong>Section 2—</strong>Counsel for the appellant submitted not for exonerating them o the charges but for censuring them for the offence.

Shahudul Haque, IG Police vs State 58 DLR (AD) 150.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—In view of the deliberate act of the appellants to disrespect the flag of the Supreme Court and deliberate commission/omission behaving in a manner undermining the authority, dignity and prestige of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, its flag and its Judge, Court does not find any mitigating circumstances to accept the unqualified apology. Shahudul Haque, IG Police vs State 58 DLR (AD) 150.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3—</strong>Adequate remedy having been provided against disobedience of an injunction order issued under Order XXXIX of the Code, as provided in Order XXXIX rule 2, a contempt petition is not maintainable on this score.

Sirajul Islam vs Wahidul Haque 55 DLR 272.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong><strong>―</strong>In the impugned statement there is nothing relating to any judgment or to a person acting as a judge—it is over the activity of the Chief Election Commissioner, not of a judge—it is with no motive to lower down the dignity of the Supreme Court and, as such, it constitutes no contempt. Dr Ahmed Hussain, Senior Advocate vs Shamsul Huq Chowdhury Senior Advocate 48 DLR 155.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>In the impugned statement there in nothing relating to any judgment or to a person acting as a judge—it is over the activity of the Chief Election Commissioner, not of a judge—It is with no motive to lower down the dignity of the Supreme Court and, as such, it constitutes no contempt.<br/><br/>Mr Shamsul Huq Chowdhury made statements in a zeal to protect the neutrality and independence ofjudiciary and it was not a criticism of any particular judge nor can it be termed as scandalisation of the Judges of the Superior Court or the Judiciary in any form. We feel that mentioning of the name of sitting Judge, Mr Abdur Rouf, in the statement is without any motive to lower down the honour, dignity, prestige and neutrality of the Supreme Court. Dr Ahmed Hussain, Senior Advocate vs Shamsul Huq Chowdhury Senior Advocate 48 DLR 155.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Contempt proceeding—There being no specific denial of the incident stated in the petition for Contempt of Court, High Court Division correctly found the appellants guilty of contempt of Court. Power of a High Court to institute a contempt proceeding is a special jurisdiction which is inherent in all Courts of record and the High Court Division can deal with it summarily and adopt its own procedure. Normally contempt proceedings are disposed of by affidavits and counter affidavits. Question of taking evidence would have arisen if the petitioners specifically denied the statements made in the petition for drawing up a proceeding for contempt. Badsha Mia vs Abdul Latif Majumder 43 DLR (AD) 10.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 4</strong>—Fugitive has no locus standi to file any petition—The petitioner is a fugitive from justice when he moved the petition and obtained the Rule Nisi.

Anti-Corruption Commission vs ATM Nazimullah Chowdhury 62 DLR (AD) 225.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>According to of section 6(5) of the Act the Government is to accord sanction within 60 days of the memo seeking sanction and after the lapse of 60 days it shall be deemed that sanction was duly accorded and accordingly, to proceed with the trial of the case. But in the instant case, after the expiry of 60 days period, the Government has decided not to accord sanction intimating that the Government has decided not to accord any sanction in order to proceed with the case; In view of the provision of section 6(5) of the Act meanwhile for failure of the authority to intimate within 60 days of the letter seeking for sanction it will be deemed that sanction was duly accorded after the expiry of the period of 60 days when the sanction was sought for and in view of the provision of law any subsequent letter refusing to accord sanction was of no legal consequence.<br/><br/>This determining clause shall prevail in respect of the proceeding with the trial of the case and that the subsequent letter of the Government replying to the letter refusiiig to accord sanction was of no legal consequence and consequently, the proceeding shall continue in accordance with law as if the sanction to prosecute has been obtained against the accused and the subsequent refusing to accord sanction and consequently not to proceed with the case against the accused was of no legal consequence. Malek Hussain Pir vs Begum Nurjahan Khanum 62 DLR (AD) 285.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 10</strong>—The High Court Division has correctly followed the observations made by this Division in Criminal Appeal No. 6 of 2008 in granting bail to the respondent No.1.

Hazi Md Mohsin vs State 40 DLR 431.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2(b)—</strong>Corporations other than the statutory Corporations are those associations or bodies constituted of private individuals incorporated or registered under provisions of the Companies Act or any other law.<br/>Body corporate includes both statutory Corporation and other corporation or company private or public. But in the above provision of section 2(b) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act “Body Corporate” has been used to mean corporation other than “Statutory Corporation”. So Master Industries Limited is a body corporate as mentioned in the aforesaid provision of section 2(b) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1958. Therefore, we are of the view that the petitioner as Managing Director of Master Industries Limited is a “public servant”. Khorshed Alam vs Azizur Rahman 48 DLR 36.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Power of Special Judge— Creation of new Districts or Sessions Divisions does not require fresh Notifications as to Senior Special Judges. When a public functionary is found to have been acting in a particular capacity in normal course the Court may presume that he has been duly empowered to act in that capacity. Mozahar Ali Howlader vs Lal Miah Talukder 44 DLR (AD) 250.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 4</strong>—The Special Judge has power to take cognizance of an offence even when the police submits final report. No direction for filing supplementary charge-sheet was necessary in the present case. Mahbubur Rahman vs State 44 DLR 342.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 4—</strong>There is no denial as to the issuance of the letter for sanction of trial. There is also no denial that the required sanction has neither been received nor refused within sixty days. In such view the sanction be deemed to have been accorded. Atiquzzaman Khan vs State 57 DLR (AD) 100.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 4</strong>—Court is to record the reasons for discharging the accused under section 241 A of the Code, but no such reasons are required to be recorded in farming charge against the accused as per provisions of section 242 of the Code. The Special Judge framed charge against the accused- petitioner after hearing both the parties and being satisfied that there was ground for framing of charge. No illegality in framing of charge against the accused-petitioner and there is no ground of setting aside the impugned order. Amanullah vs State 62 DLR 382</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sections 4-6</strong>—Under provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act a Special Judge can initiate a proceeding under two conditions namely, on a complaint or on a police report. Matiur Rahman vs State 40 DLR 385.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 4(1)—</strong>There are authorities which have found it improper for an enquiry to be held against a person by a person belonging to the same department. In the present case it cannot be said that the Special Judge has acted with sound discretion in asking the ASP to hold an enquiry when admittedly officers much above him have been made accused in the case. The Additional Attorney- General submitted that since the Deputy Commissioner and Superintendent of Police were already transferred there was no reason to apprehend that the ASP would not be able to hold an influence free enquiry. It is difficult to accept the submission of the learned Additional Attorney-General, for, it is not necessary to be personally present to influence an enquiry. Abdur Rahim vs State 49 DLR (AD) 51.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 4(1) and 6(5)—</strong>Clear intention of the law is that sanction will be required not for taking cognizance but for starting prosecution of the accused. Abdur Gafur vs State 48 DLR 90.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 4(3)—</strong>The wider territorial jurisdiction of the Divisional Special Judge has not conferred upon him any higher authority than that of the Senior Special Judge. In relation to the Senior Special Judge, the Divisional Special Judge is like any other Special Judge—power of taking cognizance of offence has not been given to him. State vs Divisional Special Judge Khulna Division 44 DLR (AD) 215.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 4(3) &amp; 10(3)</strong><strong>―</strong>High Court Division may transfer a case pending in the court of any Special Judge to the court of another Special Judge irrespective of the territorial limits of either of the two Special Judges. But the jurisdiction of transfer of a case by the Senior Special Judge is limited within his district. The two sections have therefore no conflict. State vs Divisional Special Judge, Khulna Division 44 DLR (AD) 215.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 5(1) and 6(5)—</strong>The case being exclusively triable by the Special Judge, any evidence taken by the Metropolitan Magistrate has no value in the eye of law. Such evidence should, therefore, be disregarded. Mohor Ranjan Pal vs State 50 DLR 163.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5(6)—</strong>The CID committed no error of law in holding further investigation as per provision of section 173 (3B) of the CrPC. Had further investigation been done after the case record was transmitted to the Senior Special Judge after taking cognizance of the offence or passing any order whatsoever then permission of the Special Judge would have been necessary. The police had the power to hold further investigation as per provision of section 173 (3B) of the Code as the provision of this section is in no way derogatory to the provision of sub-section 5(6) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958. Abdus Samad Khan vs State 50 DLR 143.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6</strong>—Withdrawal from the prosecution is subject to consent by the trial Judge and when the accused persons are still absconding the discretion ought not to have been exercised. Sreemati Prativa Rani Dey (Tirtha) vs Dr Mohammad Yousuf Chittagong Medical College 52 DLR (AD) 8.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>Section 6</strong>—Reference to High Court Division—Provi ns of the Criminal Procedure Code will apply to the occedings of the Court of Special Judge only f&amp; the purpose of hearing and disposal of a special case. Transfer of a case from one Special Judge to another Special Judge does not appear to MI within the ovision for hearing and disposal of a case. State vs Divisional Special Judge, Khulna Division 44 DLR (AD) 215.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6-—</strong>Provisious of section 339C and D shall apply to the roceeding before the Court of Special Judge. This legal position has also been accepted by the legislauwe by alacting Act No. XIII of 1987. AHM Kamaluddin vs State 43 DLR 294.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6</strong>—Accused is a public servant— Order of sanction to prosecute him submitted in court along with charge-sheet—Court of trial perused the sanction order and noted “seen” thereon, but omitted to mention it either in Order- sheet or in the Judgment—Witnesses including the Investigation Officer remained silent about it while deposing. The trial is not vitiated by illegality in spite of the omission on he part of the prosecution to refer to the evidence as to the order of sanction since the trial is found to have been held by the Court on perusal of the order of sanction. Liakat Ali vs State 42 DLR (AD) 30.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6</strong>—Section 339C and 339D(b) of the Code are inconsistent with the provision of section 8 of the Ordinance and due to this inconsistency these two provisions 339C and 339D(b) are not applicable in the cases revived under the Ordinance. “Working days” of the Court as provided in section 339D(b) cannot be brought into the ambit of section 8 of the Ordinance. The provisions of section 8 provided that trial of such cases must be concluded within two years from the date of commencement of the Ordinance. In the present case it appears that the case was revived on 17-2- 87 and in view of the provision of section 8 the trial ought to have been concluded within 20-1- 87. But the trial Court failed to conclude the trial within that period and when the petitioner approached the Court for stopping the proceeding his prayer was rejected applying the section 339D(b). But in view of the above the provision of section 339D(b) has no manner of application. Abdul Nur Mehedi vs State 46 DLR 303.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(1B)—</strong>The period of one year is available in section 234 of the Code of Criminal Procedure but it is absent in section 6(IB) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act and thereby in view of the provision laid down in section 6(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 section 6(1 B) excludes the application of section 234 which relates to the period of the commission of the alleged offence. Habibur Rahman Molla vs State 61 DLR 1.<br/><br/><strong>Section 6(5</strong>)—The imperative language of the provision, “the Special Judge shall, immediately on receipt of the complaint”, leaves no manner of doubt that before any step is taken the Special Judge has to address the Government in case of sanction not being accompanied with a petition of complaint.<br/>It is true that in a case under the Act a Special Judge may, where he deems if necessary, order an investigation by any officer in whose jurisdiction, the offence was wholly or partly committed. This step also, however, cannot be taken without complying being that the Government may not give any sanction to prosecute at all. Abdur Rahim vs State 49 DLR (AD) 51.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>Special Judge is required to solicit required Government sanction on the basis of the complaint petition before passing any order on the complaint petition.<br/>Order dated 17-2-92 and all the subsequent orders passed by the learned Senior Special Judge and Sessions Judge Cox’s Bazar, in Special Case No.1 of 1992 are quashed. Learned Special Judge may solicit Government sanction as required under sub-section 5 of section 6 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, if he is satisfied with the allegations made in the complaint petition. Tarani Mohan Gosh vs State 50 DLR 575.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>Public Servant—Sanction for Prosecution—Every public servant who committed an offence under the Criminal Law Amendment Act enjoys a protection by way of sanction for prosecution. Since the Government in this case withheld sanction the Senior Special Judge rightly passed order refusing to take cognizance against the accused. Fakir Tariqul Islam vs State 49 DLR 419.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)</strong>―No sanction for prosecution would be necessary when the accused ceased to be a public servants Saheb All Miah vs State 46 DLR 238.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)</strong><strong>―</strong>If sanction as required under section 6(5) Criminal Law Amendment Act 1958 is not accorded by the government or is deemed not to have been so accorded as per proviso to sub-section 5 of section 6 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1958, the Court shall have no jurisdiction to hold a trial against a public servant. Niranjan Deb vs State 47 DLR 458.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)</strong><strong>―</strong>In the present case petitioner No.1 has not been accused of any offence committed in course of discharge of his duties as Government pleader but in respect of an offence in a different capacity as managing trustee of a public trust. So there is no question of obtaining sanction in respect of such an offence. Santosh Bhusan Das vs State 47 DLR 519.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)</strong><strong>―</strong>The question whether the public servant concerned should be prosecuted or not is entirely within the jurisdiction of the appropriate Government. The Special Judge has no say in the matter. It is not for him to decide whether a prima facie case has been made out against the public servant or not. For the present we find no contrary opinion to the requirement of complying with the proviso to section 6(5) if any petition of complaint is not accompanied by sanction as required. The imperative language of the proviso, “the Special Judge shall, immediately on receipt of the complaint” leaves no manner of doubt that before any step is taken the Special Judge has to address the Government in case of sanction not being accompanied with a petition of complaint. Abdur Rahim vs State 48 DLR (AD) 167.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>It is not necessary to personally represent to influence an enquiry by a subordinate Junior Officer. There are authorities which have found it improper to hold an enquiry against a person by a person belonging to the same department (29 CrLJ 1928, 1958). Abdur Rahim vs State 48 DLR (AD) 167.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)-</strong>The Special Judge has no power to try the accused under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 without obtaining proper sanction for prosecution of the accused persons from the appropriate authority. Eman Ali Mallik vs State 52 DLR 335.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>The sanction order seems to be too mechanical and is no sanction in the eye of law. Absence of sanction cuts at the very root of the prosecution affecting jurisdiction of the court and this defect is not curable. Syed Mustafizur Rahman vs State 53 DLR 125.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(IA)—</strong>ln view of this amended section there was no necessity of further publication of the notification in any daily. Atiquzzaman Khan vs State 57 DLR (AL)) 100.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>The minimum requirement of this section appears to be that the authority while according sanction must have the facts of the case in order to take a decision as to whether it should accord any sanction for the prosecution. M Mojibul Haque vs DG. Bangladesh Bureau of Anti-Corruption 55 DLR 24<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>4f the accused has ceased to be a public servant at the time when the court took cognisance, no sanction of the Government is necessary to proceed against him. Fokrul Alam Chowdhury vs State 57 DLR 727.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>Respondent Nos. 5 and 6 committed the offence under section 409 of the Penal Code in their personal capacity and not in their official capacity as a police officer and, as such, the sanction in the present case was not at all necessary under section 6(5) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act. Salauddin Ahmed vs Principal Secretary, Office of the Hon’ble Prime Minister 57 DLR 730.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)</strong><strong>―</strong>Taking of cognizance by the Special Judge against the accused amounted to prosecuting him and this prosecution of a public servant cannot be done without the previous sanction of the Government. The Special Judge was directed to comply with the provision for sanction and then pass appropriate order in respect of prosecuting the petitioner. Md Arab Ali vs State 42 DLR 524.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)</strong><strong>―</strong>Meaning of taking cognizance of offence—Stage of determination of guilt when reaches under section 176 CrPC—difference between “prosecuted” without prior sanction under section 6(5) and “taking cognizance” without prior approval. Matiur Rahman vs State 40 DLR 385.<br/><br/><strong>Section 6(5)—</strong>Where facts are not referred to on the face of the sanction nor is it proved by extraneous evidence that they were placed before the sanctioning authority, the sanction is invalid and the trial Court would not be a court of competent jurisdiction. Abdul Hakim vs State 45 DLR 352.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6(5)-</strong>It is not necessary in the case as the accused ceased to be a public servant when the Court took cognizance of his offence and framed charge. HM Ershad vs State 45 DLR 533.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8—</strong>The High Court Division rightly acquitted the accused in view of the provision of section 8 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act as the trial having not been concluded within the period of 2 years it was without jurisdiction. State vs Md Minhazuddin Khan 51 DLR (AD) 142.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8(a)</strong><strong>―</strong>The proceeding before the Divisional Special Judge having not been concluded within the statutory period of 2 years from the date of commencement of the Act (20187) further proceeding of the case be stopped and the petitioner released. Sardar Abdul Haque vs State 46 DLR 515.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 8(a)—</strong>When trial of the case did not commence as no charge was framed against the accused persons. There was no question of concluding the trial within 270 working days by the Special Judge.<br/>Proceedings of a Special case cannot be stopped under the provisions of section 8(a) of the Criminal Law Amendment (Amendment) Act 1987 after the expiry of two years from the date of coming into force of that Act on 20-1-87 in a case in which trial did not commence by framing charge against the accused or 270 working days did not expire after framing of the charge and before coming into force of the said Act. Mozibul Haque vs State 48 DLR 146.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8(a)</strong><strong>―</strong>As the language of he section speaks, not about conclusion of trial but about conclusion of the proceeding, the Special Judge had no option but to conclude the proceedings within 2 years. Yunus Molla vs State 48 DLR 273.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8(a)—</strong>Where the charge has been framed under section 409 of the Penal Code and section 5(2) of Act II of 1947, and in the absence of any provision for revival of the case on the expiry of the period of 2 years provided in section 8(a) of the Criminal Law Amendment (Amendment) Act there was no legal authority to revive the case under the provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Nur Israil Talukder vs State 52 DLR (AD) 51.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 9—</strong>In imposing fine of Taka 300 the Trying Court violated the mandatory provision of section 9 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 by imposing a token fine which is much less than the amount misappropriated. Nizamuddin Dhali vs State 48 DLR 507.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 9—</strong>In case of criminal breach of trust by public servant the sentence of fine is not only compulsory but it should not be less than the amount misappropriated. AMA Wajedul Islam vs State 45 DLR 243.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 10—</strong>The accused-petitioner who remained absent due to non-service of processes upon him cannot be legally treated as an absconder. Eklimur Reza Khan vs State 59 DLR 7.<br/><br/><strong>Section 10—</strong>The expression ‘এই বিধিমালার অধীন’refers to the Emergency Powers Rules as a whole. It cannot mean and refer to Rule 10 only; otherwise the expression would have been ‘উক্ত বিধির অধীন’i.e. under the aforesaid Rule. Anti-Corruption Commission vs Barrister Nazmul Huda 60 DLR (AD) 57.<br/> <br/><strong>Secton 10</strong>―The language of Rule 11(3) admits of no ambiguity and therefore, there is hardly any scope for interpretation. The intention of the law makers is manifested in the express words used in sub-rule 3 leaving no scope to doubt that such power of granting bail by the appellate Court has been taken away by express provisions.

Siddik Ali vs State 41 DLR 26.<br/><br/> —In the absence of examination of the blood stained articles by the chemical examiner, the prosecution has utterly failed to connect the blood in the articles with the human blood to connect it with the murder of the victim. Siddik Ali vs State 41 DLR 26.<br/> <br/>—The possibility of the victim’s death by some of his enemies elsewhere as suggested by the defence cannot be ruled out. Siddik Ali vs State 41 DLR 26.<br/> <br/>—Joinder of scheduled and non-scheduled offences—In view of the trend of the decisions of this court as mentioned above we are of the view that the joinder of scheduled and non-scheduled offences in present case vitiated the entire proceedings. The learned Tribunal committed illegality in taking cognizance of the case and framing the charge and convicting and sentencing the appellant and it requires interference. MM Rafiqul Hyder vs State 41 DLR 274.<br/> <br/>—Malafide—Coram Non Judice—Detenu leased by the High Court by an order dated 27-101988 but the detenu was served with an other order on detention on the self-same ground which has been passed with a malafide motive. The order of detention is not sustainable in law. Nabila Chowdhury vs Bangladesh 41 DLR 345.<br/> <br/>—Extra-judicial confession—If at all made-appears to be wholly untrue—No reliable evidence of corroboration of the alleged extra- judicial confession and it is not at safe to rely and act upon such extra-judicial confession. The alleged extra-judicial confession if at all made by the said accused also appears to be wholly untrue. So, in the whole analysis of the facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence on record and the alleged extra-judicial confession of the condemned-prisoner, we find that there is no reliable evidence of corroboration of the so-called alleged extra-judicial confession and it is not at all safe to rely and act upon such extra-judicial confession and convict the accused on that basis. Hence the conviction of the condemned-prisoner Badsha Mollah on the basis of alleged extra-judicial confession cannot be sustained in law. State vs Badsha Mollah 41 DLR 11.<br/> <br/>—Mere absconding cannot always be a circumstance to lead to an inference of guilt of the accused.<br/>Mere abscondance cannot always be a circumstance which should lead to an inference of guilt of the accused. Sometimes out of fear and self-respect and to avoid unnecessary harassment even an innocent person remains absconding for some time. State vs Badsha Mollah 41 DLR 11.<br/> <br/>—Abscondance was not with any guilty mind. Existence of enmity is not disputed. Accused has been falsely implicated in this case out of grudge and enmity.<br/>In this case the condemned-prisoner Badsha remained absent or absconding for some time but subsequently he surrendered himself in court before the commencement of the trial. It appears this abscondance was not with any guilty mind. So, this circumstance cannot be treated as an ncrminating one. State vs Badsha Mollah 41 DLR 11.<br/> <br/>—“Working days” to be counted in determining the time of disposal a criminal case— “Working days” mean the days on which a judge works as such. So, the days when the learned Sessions Judge was on leave and outside the station should not be regarded as “Working days” of the learned Sessions fudge. Akbar Ali vs State 40 DLR 29.<br/> <br/>—No finding on a charge of capital offence can be safely based on the statements of an untruthful witness, even though corroborated by other witnesses. Moniruddin Sana vs State 40 DLR 402.<br/> <br/>—Principle of identification of an accused by witness in dock when there was a previous TI parade—Circumstances when a witness cannot possibly identify the accused in dock stated. Ratio decidendi reported in AIR 1925 (All) 223. It is well-settled that the evidence hat a witness gives in the witness box is the substantive evidence and it is always desirable hat the witness should be able to identify the accused persons in dock when there was a previous TI Parade, but owing to lapse of time and other compelling reasons it may not be possible for the witness to identify the accused persons in dock. Failure of witnesses to identify accused persons who are strangers to the witnesses— Identification if made without naming them Court’s duty to shift evidence in that circumstance—Any statement, express or implied, made by a witness identifying the accuseds but without naming them, if qualifies as substantive evidence —Test of Ratan Kha vs State 40 DLR 186.<br/> <br/>—If a statement made in cross-examination contradicts the statement made in examination— in-chief, the entire evidence cannot be left out of consideration. Nurul Islam vs State 40 DLR 122.<br/> <br/>—Relying on the reason ings given in the case reported in 29 DLR (AD) 221 the established principle of law is that if part of the evidence of certain witnesses is disbelieved, the entire evidence is not liable to be discarded. Nurul Islam vs State 40 DLR 122.<br/> <br/>—A newspaper is admissible in evidence without formal proof yet the paper ipso facto is not a proof of its contents. The learned Judge was absolutely wrong in taking into consideration, Ext. X, which is the Daily Sangbad, which published the story of the commission of murder by the accused persons. Nurul Islam vs State 40 DLR 122.<br/> <br/>—There is no rule of law that once a witness has been discredited on one point, no credit is to be given to another. If a natural witness is declared hostile, his evidence may be accepted if corroborated. The evidence of boatman PW 2 cannot be discarded. Md Ali Haider vs State 40 DLR 97.<br/> <br/>—Appeal is a creature of Statute—An appeal preferred by a convicted person can be withdrawn and dismissed for non-prosecution. Sayed Nurul Islam vs State 40 DLR 472.<br/> <br/>—“Trial”—Whether it includes judgment— Trial as appearing in various sections of the CrPC had not been specifically defined but considering the scheme of the law, it is found to be a ‘drama’ played in three successive acts i.e. investigation, inquiry and trial. Judgment is a separate scene where the judge is the only player writing down his judgment on the basis of the last scene of the drama already played. Thus, trial does not include judgment. HM Ershad vs State 44 DLR 116.<br/> <br/>—Trial of child along with adult is forbidden by law—Trial vitiated as being hit by want of jurisdiction. Md Nasir Ahmed vs State 42 DLR 89.<br/> <br/>—In a criminal trial the prosecution is obliged to prove by evidence that the crime charged has been committed before seeking to prove that the accused on trial committed the crime. Akhtar Hossain vs State 44 DLR 83.<br/> <br/>—Trial of cross-cases—The usual practice of trial of cross-cases is that both should be tried by the same judge simultaneously or one after another and judgments therein should be delivered after concluding the hearing of both. Siddique Munshi vs State 44 DLR (AD) 169.<br/> <br/>—Joint Trial—Joint trial of appellant Sunil a child, along with the appellants being adults was illegal. Kadu vs State 43 DLR 163.<br/> <br/>—Motive—If the prosecution assigns a particular motive in proof of its case, then the motive has to be established by the prosecution, failing which the prosecution must suffer on that account, not the defence. Khelu Mia vs State 43 DLR 573.<br/> <br/>—The prosecution is not bound to prove motive of the accused for committing the crime, for motive is not an ingredient of the offence— The accused may be held guilty even without proof of his motive if the evidence connecting the accused with the crime is unimpeachable in character. Shah Alam vs State 42 DLR (AD) 31.<br/> <br/><strong>Double Jeopardy—</strong>The remand order amounts to a double jeopardy for the petitioners and offers a chance to the prosecution to remedy its lacuna. Such a remand should not be made. Fazal vs State 43 DLR 40.<br/> <br/><strong>Alibi—</strong>Burden of proof—Burden of proving alibi in a wife-killing—It is true that the burden of proving a plea of alibi or any other plea specifically set up by an accused-husband for absolving him of criminal liability lies on him. But this burden is somewhat lighter than that of the prosecution. The accused could be considered to have discharged his burden if he succeeds in creating a reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances that would absolve him of criminal liability, but the prosecution is to discharge its burden by establishing the guilt of the accused. An accused’s burden is lighter, because the court is to consider his plea only after, and not before, the prosecution leads evidence for sustaining a conviction. When the prosecution failed to prove that the husband was in his house where his wife was murdered, he cannot be saddled with any onus to prove his innocence. State vs Mofazzal Hossain Pramanik 43 DLR (AD) 64A.<br/> <br/>Alibi—Magistrate cannot discharge accused persons on the plea of alibi that they were at different places at the time of commission of offences alleged by the prosecution—Magistrate’s “finding” in this regard is based on no evidence. Mere submission of some papers supporting alibi is either sufficient nor admissible as the stage of adducing defence evidence was not yet come. Magistrate’s order of discharge was no.t sustainable as it was based on gross misconception of law. Nannu Gazi vs Awlad Hossain 43 DLR (AD) 63.<br/> <br/>Last Seen—This is a case in which a minor boy, the victim of murder, was called away by and seen in the company of the two young accused for the last time before disappearance and then some time thereafter the body ofthe victim was found out. The fact of calling away of victim Khairul by accused Khasru was satisfactorily established as the first circumstance in support of the prosecution and witnesses have also satisfactorily proved that the victim travelled with the two accused from their village Noapara to a distant place called Takerhat by bus and got down there at 4-00/4-30 PM on 4-1-79. This is the second circumstance proved against the accused. From this point onward upto the time of recovery of the body of Khairul at about 3-00/3-30 PM on the following day the accused were alleged to have been seen along with the deceased, the third circumstance in the absence of ocular evidence of murder, by PWs 11 and 12. The High Court Division rejected their evidence due to apparent contradiction between their evidence and the statement made by them before the police and also for the reason that their identification of the accused in the TI Parade had lost all significance in view of the fact that they had chance to sec the accused. There has been no violation of any norm or procedure in assessing the evidence of the said two witnesses for which the finding of fact made by the High Court Division could be disturbed. The position, therefore, comes to this that the third circumstance, that of seeing the three boys together near the bank of the river where the victim’s body was found was not satisfactorily established. The circumstances of the case can never be said to be conclusive as to the guilt of accused Khasru and his brother Nowab. The High Court Division has correctly applied the rule as to circumstantial evidence in the facts of the present case. State vs Khasru @ Syed Mostafa Hossain 43 DLR (AD) 182.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">—Defence plea, when not acceptable—Plea of inadvertence, liable to be rejected if not taken during the trial but argued subsequently. Accused Fishery Officer did not take the plea of inadvertence during his trial on the charge of manipulation of lease deed which was argued on his behalf subsequently—no suggestion was made to any of the witnesses that on the date of executing the lease deed on government’s behalf, he was very busy as many other lease deeds were executed by him and by inadvertence, he executed the lease deed in question by putting his signature thereon<br/><br/>—During examination under the section 342 CrPC all the incriminating facts in evidence were put to him in details by the Court, but he did not take the plea and just pleaded not guilty—plea of inadvertence due to pressure of work rightly rejected. Atiqur Rahman vs State 42 DLR (AD) 176.<br/><br/>—In case of direct evidence the question of motive is not of much importance. Shah Alam vs State 42 DLR (AD) 31.<br/> <br/>—There cannot be any bar for a person to witness an occurrence and give evidence merely because the accused has brought the case against that person—His evidence is to be tested, scrutinized and assessed along with all other evidence and circumstances. Shah Alam vs State 42 DLR (AD) 31.<br/> <br/>—Inference from the facts of the case—The two expressions “common intention” and “similar intention” are not coterminous or co-extensive in range—Each case is to be considered in its own background. Chand Mia vs State 42 DLR (AD) 3.<br/> <br/>—Circumstantial evidence and extra-judicial confession not corroborated by any reliable evidence. State vs Badsha Mollah 41 DLR 11.<br/> <br/>—Circumstantial evidence—Chains of circumstantial evidence missing—Facts proved must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused. In respect of charge of abduction with murder, even if the chains of circumstances are broken and a strong and dominant inference takes the place of evidence, such substitute by inference may often fill up the gap provided the inference stands on a very high degree excluding all other hypothesis save and except the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused: Soleman vs State 42 DLR 118.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>—The process of trial of cross cases is that both should be tried by the same judge simultaneously or one after another and judgment therein should be delivered after concluding the hearing of both the cases and in such trial, record of cases should be kept distinct and separate and evidence of one case cannot be used in another case and each case must be decided on its own evidence and record. State vs Matiur Rahman 60 DLR (AD) 4.<br/> <br/>Place of occurrence—The High Court Division confused the pathway and the vacant land as two distinct and different places whereas the pathway has been shown in the sketch map adjacent to the place of occurrence and the place of occurrence is on the pathway and the vacant land by the side of the pathway. Therefore, there was no shifting of the place of occurrence as misunderstood by the High Court Division only because pathway has been depicted in the sketch map as ‘K’ and the place of occurrence as ‘A’. State vs Anowar Hossain Pinto 61 DLR (AD) 108.<br/> <br/>—Suspicion—Cannot be basis for conviction—Probability however strong, and suspicion however grave, can never take place of proof as because in a criminal trial presumption of innocence is a principle of cardinal importance and so guilt of the accused must be proved beyond reasonable doubt by legal, reliable and unimpeachable evidence. Suspicion and probability, however strong and grave, can never take place of proof. Niranjan Malaker vs State 62 DLR 387.<br/> <br/>—Principle of criminal jurisprudence that an accused should be dealt in accordance with law and before awarding any punishment a judge should have considered the legal evidence and proposition of law and he will not act as a social activist, rather he should have guided by law giving up emotion.

In section 156(8) the word ‘Smuggle’ has not been defined. Therefore, it is necessary for us to see what is meant by smuggle. According to section 2(s) of the Customs Act the word “Smuggle’ means to bring into or take out of Bangladesh, in breach of any prohibition of restriction of customs-duties or taxes leviable thereon.

Mere getting of something more favourable to defence case in the cross-examination in addition to what the defence got during the examination-in-chief cannot be a ground to disbelieve the evidence of a witness who was not declared hostile by the prosecution. The evidence of PW 1 regarding the recovery of 31 pieces of gold bars from the bag of the accused appellant, in the facts and circumstances of the case, is very much doubtful. MM Rafiqul Hyder vs State 41 DLR 274.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 156(8)—</strong>Offence punishable under section 156(8) of the Customs Act being a nonscheduled offence under section 26 of the Special Powers Act (XIV of 1974) is not triable under the Special Powers Act—Trial for both the schedule &amp; non-scheduled offences by the Special Tribunal constituted under the Special Powers Act is illegal. MM Rafiqul Hyder vs State 41 DLR 274.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 156(8) clause 89</strong>—Onus—In a criminal case the onus is always on the prosecution to prove that the offence was committed by the accused. But clause (89) of sub-section (8) of section 156 is an exception to the rule. Clause 89 casts a duty on the accused to offer a lawful excuse with regard to the indictment brought against them. Amir Ali vs State 43 DLR 564.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 156(1)(8)—</strong>Cognizance—Scheduled and non-scheduled offences—When the very taking of cognizance of an offence, the framing of accusation and the trial upon charges of both scheduled and non-scheduled offences together suffered from complete lack of jurisdiction, this could not at all be considered to be a mere defect in the framing of charges which by aid of section 537 of the CrPC can be cured if prejudice is not caused to the accused. A mere defect in framing of charge by the Court having jurisdiction is one thing while framing of charge without having any jurisdiction is a completely different thing.

Self-exculpatory confession of an accused cannot be legally used in finding co-accused guilty as it is no evidence as defmed in section 3 of Evidence Act. Moniruddin Sana vs State 40 DLR 402.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—PWs though relations they are natural and competent witnesses. Their evidence cannot be discarded only because they are relations. Shadat Ali vs State 44 DLR 217.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>―The fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence is that circumstantial evidence should inevitably be to the conclusion that the accuseds and the accused only were the perpetrators of the offence and such evidence should be incompatible with the Innocence of the accused. Taslimuddin vs State 44 DLR 136.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>―Murder of wife—explanation of the accused ordinarily an accused has no obligation to account for the death for which he is placed on trial. The murder having taken place while the condemned prisoner was living with his wife in the same house he was under an obligation to explain how his wife had met with her death. In the absence of any explanation coming from his side it seems none other than the husband was responsible for causing death in question. State vs Kalu Bepari 43 DLR 249.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>―Mere relationship cannot be a ground for discarding the evidence of a witness unless he is found to be biased and resorting to any falsehood. Siraj Mal vs State 45 DLR 688.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Circumstantial evidence—The rule as regards sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to be the basis for conviction is that the facts proved must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation by any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt. State vs Ali Kibria 43 DLR 512.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—The evidence by trap party is tainted in nature and as such corroboration from independent and neutral witnesses is very much necessary. AKM Mukhlesur Rahman vs State 45 DLR 626.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Material consistent with innocence—When some material is brought on record consistent with innocence of the accused, which may reasonably be true, even though it is not positively proved to be true, the accused is entitled to acquittal. State vs All Kibria 43 DLR 512.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Circumstantial evidence—Its sufficiency to prove guilt—In the instant case circumstantial evidence on which trial Court relied do not conclusively point to guilt of the accused—Mere movement of the accused near the place of occurrence may raise a suspicion against the accused but this cannot be the basis for their conviction. All Ahmed Malaker vs State 43 DLR 401.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 3</strong>—’Document’ occurring in section 3(16) of the General Clauses Act and section 3 of the Evidence Act—Meaning of—Whether kabalas are documents as referred to in those Acts. Abdus Sattar Bhuiyan vs Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka 42DLR 151.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Circumstantial evidence— circumstances forming evidence in proof of the crime must be conclusively established—They must form such a complete chain that it was not only inconsistent with the guilt of the accused but was inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence. State vs Ranjit Kumar Pramanik 45 DLR 660.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—As the wife was murdered while in custody of her husband the natural presumption is that he is responsible for her death. Ordinarily, an accused has no obligation to account for the death for which he is placed on trial. But the murder having taken place while this appellant was living with his deceased wife in the same house he was under an obligation to explain how his wife had met with her death and in the present case the appellant tried to explain that she committed suicide which was found to be a travesty of truth. In the absence of any satisfactory explanation and the explanation given found to be false we are of the view that none other than this appellant is responsible. Shamsuddin vs State 45 DLR 587.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Conviction on circumstantial evidence—if it is proved beyond doubt that the deceased is seen last alive in the company of the accused, he is liable to offer satisfactory explanation as to the cause of death of the deceased or at least as to his company with the deceased. If circumstantial evidence leading to the irresistible conclusion that the accused alone caused the death of the victim is not considered sufficient for his conviction then there can never be any conviction on circumstantial evidence. In other words, the prosecution cannot prove its case by circumstantial evidence. Such a concept is contrary to time honoured principle of law regarding circumstantial evidence. Rezaul Huq vs State 42 DLR 440.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>―A statement under section 342 CrPC is not evidence within the meaning of section 3 of the Evidence Act. Shah Alam vs State 42 DLR (AD) 31.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>―Relationship of the witnesses with a party cannot be the sole ground of disbelieving their evidence unless contradiction and inherent infirmity are found in their evidence. Bachu Miah vs Samad Miah 50 DLR 564.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Partisan evidence is no doubt suspect, but cannot be discarded without finding any inherent infirmity and/or contradictions therein making the same unworthy of credence. In the context of prevailing deteriorating law and order situation in the society where open threat is given to the witnesses not to depose in support of the prosecution case the difficulty of the prosecution to bring independent witnesses, and the rising tendency of witnesses giving testimony in the Court to favour the accused giving different versions of the occurrence from the one made to the investigation officer at the time of investigation, for the above reasons should be considered before finding fault with the prosecution for non-production of independent witnesses and relying on the evidence of the witnesses declared hostile by the prosecution without properly evaluating whatever evi4ence i available on record with a critical eye in the context of the respective cases of the parties. Dulal Miah vs Ruhul Amin 50 DLR 618.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 3</strong>—Recognition by torch and hurricane at dead of night is doubtful. Abu Bakker vs State 49 DLR 480.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3—</strong>A witness has a tendency to exaggerate, embroider and also to implicate falsely some other person in addition to the real offender. The Court is to scan the evidence so as to come to a decision as to which part is acceptable and only in case of impossibility to separate the truth from falsehood, the Court will be justified in rejecting the evidence in to to. Masum vs State 49 DLR 349.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Evidence adduced by the prosecution being of a circumstantial nature and there being a missing link in the chain of circumstances, the prosecution failed to prove the guilt of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt. Nuru Miah vs State 49 DLR 97.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—In the absence of the practice of registration of birth in the official register kept by any public authority, one cannot really be sure of the date of birth of any particular person. Ultimately, it falls on the Court to determine the age of the victim girl based on the impression received, by her behaviour and appearance when brought before this Court. Nurunnahar Khatun vs State 46 DLR 112.<br/>Section 3—Long delay in examining the material witnesses casts a doubt on the whole prosecution case. Syed Nazakat Hossain vs State 48 DLR 139.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3—</strong>Circumstantial evidence—If the circumstances are not proved beyond all reasonable doubt by reliable and sufficient evidence and if at all proved but the same cumulatively do not lead to the inevitable conclusion or hypothesis of guilt of the accuseds alone but to any other reasonable hypothesis compatible with the innocence of the accused then it will be a case of no evidence and the accused should be given benefit of doubt. Bakul vs State 47 DLR 486.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Circumstantial evidence must be so strong as to eliminate the possibility of innocence of the accused-person. State vs Balai Chandra Sarker 47 DLR 467.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Tle statements under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure recorded before an authority other than the Judge who tried the case was not the statement of the witnesses produced before him, and, as such, this could not be treated as oral evidence. Such statements could not be used as substantive evidence for arriving at any finding as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. Babloo vs State 47 DLR 337.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—A witness for the prosecution does not become partisan per se nor an eyewitness can be disregarded merely because he has come to support the prosecution party. It was necessary to consider the whole evidence and then to assess the worth of the witnesses as a whole, State vs Abdul Khaleque alias Abdul Khaleq Howlader 49 DLR (AD) 154.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>-Benefit of doubt to the accused would be available provided there is supportive evidence on record. For creating doubt or granting benefit of doubt, the evidence is to be such which may lead to such doubt. The law would fail to protect the community, if fanciful possibilities are admitted, thus, deflecting the course of justice. Al Amin vs State 51 DLR 154.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 3—</strong>পুলিশ সাক্ষীর সাক্ষ্য বিচার বিশ্লেষণ করে যদি তা বিশ্বাস যোগ্য মনে করেন তবে স্থানীয় সাক্ষী অভিযোগকারী পক্ষের সমর্থনে সাক্ষ্য না দিলেও বা সাক্ষ্য দিলে তা সত্য না হলে পুলিশ সাক্ষীর সাক্ষের উপর নির্ভর করে আসামীকে দোষী সাব্যস্ত করতে আইনতঃ কোন বাধা নেই। Abdul Razzak Talukder vs State, represented by the Deputy Commissioner, Barisal 51 DLR 83.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—There is no bar to find an accused guilty on the basis of testimonies of police personnels if their testimonies appear to be reliable. Nizam Hazari vs State 53 DLR 475.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—There is no authority of law to suggest that if a part of the evidence of a case is disbelieved, the remaining part cannot be believed without independent corroboration, particularly when it supported by the attending circumstances of the case. Hazrat Khan @ Hazrat Ali Khan vs State 54 DLR 636.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3—</strong>If it is proved that the deceased was last seen alive in the company of the accused in the absence of any other reasonable explanation as to the safe departure of the deceased from the company of the appellant no conclusion other than the guilt of the accused can be drawn. Bhola vs State 55 DLR 36.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—The confession of co-accused can be considered to lend support to the other evidence, if any, but in this case there is no other evidence so far appellant Idris is concerned other than the confessional statement of the co-accused. Therefore the conviction Idris is based on no evidence and is liable to be set aside. State vs Rafiqul Islam 55 DLR 61.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Circumstantial evidence may be and frequently is more cogent than the evidence of eye-witnesses. It is not difficult to produce false evidence of eye-witnesses. It is, on the other hand, extremely difficult to produce circumstantial evidence of a convincing character and therefore, circumstantial evidence, if convincing, is more cogent than the evidences of eye-witnesses. State vs Moslem 55 DLR 116.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>-There should not be exaggerated devotion to the rule of benefit of doubt at the expense of social defence and course of justice cannot be allowed to be deflected on the concept of the rule of benefit of doubt. It is true to say with Viscount Simons that “miscarriage of justice” may arise from the acquittal of the guilty no less than the conviction of the innocent. State vs Md Awal Fakir 56 DLR 647.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>-The only fact that the girl was found Tying dead while in custody of her husband, in absence of some other incriminating conduct of the appellant, is not sufficient to convict him. Emdadul Hoque vs State 57 DLR 21.<br/> <br/><strong>Secton 3</strong>-Because PW 2 had been declared hostile by prosecution, his testimony did not stand effaced and evidence remains admissible in trial and there is no legal bar to accept his testimony. Babul vs State 57 DLR 158.<br/><br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—The murder having taken place while the appellant was living with his deceased wife in the same house he was under an obligation to explain how his wife had met with her death. Shahjahan Mizi vs State 57 DLR 224.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—”Interestedness”—This has been defined by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Nazir vs State PLD 1962 SC 269 = 14 DLR (SC) 159 in the terms that interested witness is one who has a motive for falsely implicating an accused person. State vs Anjuara Khatun 57 DLR 277.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Credibility of a witness is accepted if it is corroborated by the evidence of other witnesses but credibility should be tested in the touchstone of the broad probabilities of the case. Montu vs State 57 DLR 504.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Only because of relationship witnesses evidence cannot be thrown away unless the evidence is found to be untrue or tainted with motive. Yogeshwar Gope vs State 58 DLR (AD) 73.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Conviction could be based solely on unimpeachable evidence of the police witnesses even if not corroborated by independent public witnesses. Hiru Mia vs State 58 DLR 607.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Prosecution case rested on circumstantial evidence which require that prosecution is to prove each of the circumstances having a definite tendency pointing towards the guilt of the accused person and, though each of the circumstances by itself may not be conclusive but the cumulative effect of proved circumstances must be so complete that it would exclude every other hypothesis and unequivocally point to the guilt of the accused. State vs Md Kaloo 58 DLR 638.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>-Conviction can be well based on the testimony of the Police personnel if it is supported by other evidence on record or if it inspires confidence. Faruq (Md) vs State 59 DLR 104.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>— In order to judge credibility of a witness, the Trial Judge must look into the surrounding circumstances as well as probability of the contentions, so that he may form correct idea of truth or worthiness of a witness. If the evidence is inherently weak, basically suffers from absurdity, opposed to reason, logic, human conduct, natural course of events and no man of ordinary prudence can accept it, such witness must not be relied. State vs Kajal Ahmed Jalali 59 DLR 345.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Long delay in recording statement of witness by the Investigating Officer renders his evidence unworthy of credit. State vs Kajal Ahmed Jalali 59 DLR 345.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Circumstantial Evidence— Where the case depends upon the conclusion drawn from circumstances the cumulative effect of the circumstances must be such as to negative the innocence of the accused and bring the offences home beyond any reasonable doubt. Helal vs State 60 DLR 24.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Written statement submitted by the appellant when he was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not evidence within the meaning of section 3 of the Evidence Act. Such statement is to be considered along with the evidence and the circumstances and if the statement gets support from the evidence on record due weight may be given on it. [Vide 42 DLR (AD) 31]. Thus such statement cannot be the sole basis of conviction. Hasan Md vs State 60 DLR 56.<br/><br/><strong>Section 3</strong>-Circumstantial Evidence—It is well settled law that last seen together is a weak type of circumstantial evidence on which to have a conviction, a link between the accused and the murder has to be proved. Bablu vs State 60 DLR 583.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Circumstantial Evidence— Circumstances in respect of which an accused was not examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be used against him. Bablu vs State 60 DLR 583.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—There is no reason why the evidence of police personnel should be discarded simply because they belonged to the police force. They came before the Court and testified to the occurrence. They were fully cross examined. Their evidence is also evidence within the meaning of section 3 of the Evidence Act. Mohin Uddin vs State 61 DLR 35.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—If the evidence of the hostile witness fits in with the attending circumstances, then it may be accepted and considered along with other evidence. We received support of the above view in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh vs Chat Ram AIR 1985 (SC) 1543. Sahabuddin vs State 61 DLR 54.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—When there is neither any eyewitness nor any corroboration of the evidence adduced by the prosecution and the deposition of the prosecution witnesses runs counter to the confessional statement, it is unsafe to sustain any conviction.. moreso, when such conviction is based primarily on the confessional statement of a co-accused. State vs Hamidul 61 DLR 614.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Abscondence—Absconsion of the accused in certain cases can be vital circumstantial evidence, but it does not necessarily justify drawing an inference of guilt of the accused in each and every case. Ayub Ali Sheikh vs State 63 DLR 55.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 3 and 5</strong>—Circumstantial evidence—Its conclusiveness—assessment of evidence— This is a case in which a minor boy, the victim of murder, was called away by and seen in the company of the two young accused for the last time before disappearance and then some time thereafter the body of the victim was found out. The fact of calling away of victim Khairul by accused Khasru was satisfactorily established as the first circumstance in support of the prosecution and witnesses have also satisfactorily proved that the victim travelled with the two accused from their village Noapara to a distant place called Takerhat by bus and got down there at 4-00/4-30 PM on 4-1-79. This is the second circumstance proved against the accused. From this point onward upto the time of recovery of the body of Khairul at about 3-00/3-30 PM on the following day the accused were alleged to have been seen along with the deceased, the third circumstance in the absence of ocular evidence of murder, by PWs 11 and 12. The High Court Division rejected their evidence due to apparent contradiction between their evidence and the statement made by them before the police and also for the reason that their identification of the accused in the TI Parade had lost all significance in view of the fact that they had chance to see the accused. There has been no violation of any norm or procedure in assessing the evidence of the said two witnesses for which the finding of fact made by the High Court Division could be disturbed. The position, therefore, comes to this that the third circumstance, that of, seeing the three boys together near the bank of the river where the victim’s body was found was not satisfctoriIy established. The circumstances of the case can never be said to be conclusive as to the guilt of accused Khasru and his brother Nowab. The High Court Division has correctly applied the rule as to circumstantial evidence in the facts of the present case. State vs Khasru @ Syed Mostafa Hossain 43 DLR (AD) 182.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sections 3 and 5</strong>—Glaring inconsistencies between the existence of injuries on the body of the deceased as found by the post-mortem doctor and the evidence of prosecution witnesses about injuries caused by the appellants lead to the conclusion that the occurrence did not take place in the manner as alleged by the prosecution. Kadu vs State 43 DLR 163.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 3, 5 &amp; 8</strong>—Ordinarily an accused has no obligation to account for the death for which he was placed on trial, but the murder having taken place while the accused was living with his deceased wife in the same house, he was under an obligation to explain how his wife had met with her death. Abul Kalam Mollah vs State 51 DLR 544.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 3 &amp; 30</strong>—Confession of coaccused—The confession of an accused is no evidence against the coaccused. Such confession cannot be taken into consideration against his coaccused and it can only be used to lend assurance to other legal evidence. But in the absence of any substantive evidence the confession of a coaccused is of no consequence against other accused persons. State vs Tajul Islam 48 DLR 306.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 3 &amp; 30</strong>—Confessional statement of coaccused by itself is not an evidence within the meaning of section 3 of the Act unless it is supported in material particulars by other evidence, at best it can be used against the maker. Abdus Sattar @ A. Sattar @ Sottar vs State 58 DLR 415.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 3 &amp; 30</strong>—It is true confession of an accused may be used as against other coaccused in the same trial. But this is for a limited purpose. Confession of a coaccused itself is not evidence but it may be used as such if it is found to be true and voluntary as against other coaccused not as a solitary basis but for the purpose of lending assurance to any other evidence found against him. Abul Hossain vs State 46 DLR 77.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 3 &amp; 30</strong>—Since the confessional’ statement is not required to be taken on oath and taken in presence of a coaccused and not tested by cross-examination it cannot be considered as substantive evidence against the co-accused. Mojibar vs State 51 DLR 507.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 3 and 30</strong>—Confession-—Question of credibility when part of the occurrence is omitted or suppressed—It cannot be found nor it could be suggested by either the prosecution or the defence why throttling part of the occurrence was omitted or suppressed. Even if it be taken that accused Rina had deliberately suppressed the throttling part of the occurrence in her judicial confession that cannot mean that the confession was not true. Shahjahan Manik vs State 42 DLR 465,<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 3 &amp; 32</strong>—Allegation made by the deceased prior to the occurrence cannot be treated relevant for the trial as it is not a substantive evidence like dying declaration related to the act of the murder. State vs Kajal Ahmed Jalali 59 DLR 345.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 3 &amp; 106</strong>—Death of wife—Special onus upon husband —In the case of death of wife in the house of the husband when the husband had been with wife the husband is under an obligation to account for the cause of death of his wife and special onus lies upon the husband. Kazi Mahbubuddin Ahmed alias Mahbub vs State, represented by the DC, Dhaka 57 DLR 513.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 5</strong>—The Court ought not to have rejected the evidence of witnesses merely on the ground that they were not disinterested witnesses when their examination-in-chief could not be shaken in cross-examination by the defence. Samad Sikdar vs State 50 DLR (AD) 24.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—In the instant case where bitter enmity between the parties is admitted, some sort of corroboration of the evidence of interested witnesses is required as a rule of prudence. Abdul Kader alias Kadu vs State 49 DLR 577.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Where bitter enmity between the parties is admitted some sort of corroboration of the evidence of interested witnesses is required as a rule of prudence. Serajul Islam vs State 48 DLR 165.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Courts must seek corroboration before acting upon interested witnesses in a criminal trial. It is the Court’s solemn duty to assess the evidence legally not only to secure conviction but also to record acquittal. State vs Khalilur Rahman 48 DLR 184.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>-Police witnesses are partisan or interested witnesses in the sense that they are concerned in the success of the raid. Their evidence must be tested in the same way as the evidence of the other interested witnesses by the application of diverse considerations which must vaty from case to case. In view of the attitude as aforesaid of the earned Tribunal Judge regarding the police witnesses, we are at the outset required to settle the point. There cannot be any rigid consideration in this respect. In assessing oral evidence Judges may call in aid their experience in life and test the evidence on the basis of probabilities. Thus in a proper case, the Court may look for independent corroboration when it is found not safe to dispense with. Sirajul Islam vs State 48 DLR 301.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>―An unreasonable delay in lodging the FIR inevitably gives rise to suspicion as to the trustworthiness or otherwise of the prosecution version of the case. State vs Tajul Islam 48 DLR 305.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5—</strong>When the alleged eye-witnesses recognised the miscreants and disclosed their names to the informant before lodging the FIR and still then the informant does not mention their names in the FIR, the evidence of such witnesses must be kept out of consideration. State vs Tajul Islam 48 DLR 305.<br/><br/><strong>Section 5—</strong>If there are admixture of falsehood so that it becomes impossible for the Courts to separate the grains of truth from mass of chaff, then such evidence of a witness must be rejected as a whole. Bazlu Talukder vs Deputy Commissioner Madaripur 48 DLR 509.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>―When the witness has animus against the accused her evidence cannot be relied on except with strong corroborative evidence. State vs Raisuddin 48 DLR 517.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>―Mere placing no reliance upon confessional statement of the accused and non- examination of the Magistrate who held TI Parade are no grounds for acquittal where the order of conviction and sentence is based on other sufficient and reliable legal evidence on record. Abdul Hashem vs State 52 DLR (AD) 117.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 5</strong>—Calling and taking away of the victim by the appellant Billal and co-convict Saiful from his residence half an hour before his murder, recovery of the body of the victim, Billal’s offer of love and threat to the PW 2 Mokseda, and abscondence of Billal immediately after the occurrence are circumstances to lead to the conclusion that he abetted the murder. Billal vs State 52 DLR (AD) 143.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5—</strong>Even in case of non-examination of the seizure list witness or if the seizure list witnesses do not speak in terms of the prosecution case, the conviction cannot be set aside only for this reason. Moshfiqul Islam alias Bilu vs State 52 DLR 593.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—It is unfortunate that for not seizing the lungi of PW I the positive testimony of this witness and other witnesses who spoke about the presence of PW 1 in the occurrence have been discarded.<br/>‘Evidence false in part is false in entirety”— As a matter of fact this maxim is not supported by any authority and has got no relevance in the present time. Mahmudul Islam alias Ratan vs State 53 DLR (AD) 1.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—When a wife met with an unnatural death while in custody of the husband and also while in his house the husband is to explain under what circumstance the wife met with her death. Ilias Hussain vs State 54 DLR (AD) 78.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Mere relationship by itself cannot be a ground for rejecting testimony of a witness unless it is shown that the witness was biased and resorted to falsehood. Nure Alam vs State 54 DLR 242<br/><br/><strong>Section 5—</strong>There is no reason to hold that the defence has been prejudiced for non-examination of the investigation officer, although non- examination of the investigation officer in a criminal case is usually viewed with disapproval. Karam Ali vs State 54 DLR 378.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Non-examination of independent witnesses, particularly some of the neighbours, raised a presumption against the prosecution to the effect that had they been examined, they would not have supported the prosecution case. Nepoleon Khondker alias Lepu vs State 54 DLR 386.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—In the context of the existing enmity between the parties, it is wholly unsafe to rely on the uncorroborated testimony of informant. Altaf Hossain vs State 54 DLR 464.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—A close relative who is a material witness cannot be regarded as an interested witness. The term “interestedness” postulates that the witness must have some direct interest in having the accused somehow or the other connected for some animus or some other reasons. State vs Moslem 55 DLR 116.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5-</strong>The murder having taken place where the accused person was living with his wife in the same house he was under an obligation to explain how his wife had met with her death. In the absence of any explanation coming from his side it seems none other than the husband was responsible for causing death in question. Dulal Mia vs State 56 DLR 65.<br/><br/><strong>Section 5</strong>-If on consideration of the entire evidence and materials on record it appears to the Court that the prosecution case is doubtful, the benefit of doubt must be given to the accused and he should be acquitted of the offence charged. Shahidul Islam vs State 56 DLR 35.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 5</strong>—Discrepancy has to be distinguished from contradiction. Whereas contradiction in the statement of the witness is fatal for the case, minor discrepancy or variance in evidence will not make the prosecution case doubtful. Shibu Pada Acharjee vs State 56 DLR 285.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—The evidence of an injured person carries much weight since the injured person does not usually allow the real culprit to escape and falsely implicate an innocent person. Ataur Rahman vs State 43 DLR 87.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Defence version—Manner of occurrence—prosecution having failed to prove their version of the manner of occurrence, the defence version became probable and the appellants were acquitted of he charges. Gopal Rajgor vs State 42 DLR 446.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Assessment of evidence by the Appellate Division—In the matter of assessment of evidence trial Court’s view is given great weight and when its finding is accepted as correct on reassessment by the Appellate Court, then the Appellate Division does not like to interfere. But when in accepting the evidence it is found that established principles of assessment of evidence have not been followed, then the Appellate Court’s finding cannot claim sanctity (per Shahabuddin Ahmed CJ concurred by MH Rahman and ATM Afzal JJ). Abu Taher Chowdhury vs State 42 DLR (AD) 253.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5-</strong>Appreciation of evidence—if there is contradiction of a substantial kind or a big difference as to time as given by witness and proved by other circumstances, then the time as to the occurrence may become doubtful and the Court can disbelieve the prosecution case. The opinion of the doctor has been so narrowly construed as would betray even ordinary common sense. Considering all aspects of the matter, there has been a manifest disregard of the accepted principles of appreciation of evidence and consequently a miscarriage of justice. State vs Abdus Sattar 43 DLR (AD) 44.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>-In the matter of observation, perception and memorisation, different witnesses, differ from each other. So weight is to be given to those which are of consensus as to the substance of their evidence. The standard of rural witness should not be comparable to that of urban witness in the matter of exactitude and consistency. Consideration in narration can not militate against the veracity of the core of testimony provided that there is an impression of truth and conformity in substantial fabric of the testimony so delivered. Ataur Rahman vs State 43 DLR 87.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>-It is settled principle that when injured witness marked assailants it cannot be said that he would give up real assailant and falsely implicate person with whom there was no enmity. Ataur Rahman vs State 43 DLR 87.<br/><br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Chance witness—He is found to be at the place of occurrence by chance or coincidence at the time the offence was committed. His evidence need not be rejected outright, but it is to be weighed with caution and may be viewed With suspicion if witnesses are partisan or inimically disposed towards the accused. State vs Md Shafiqul Islam 43 DLR (AD) 92.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>-Wife-killing case—In such a case, there could be no eye-witness of the occurrence, apart from inmates of the house who may refuse to tell the truth. The neighbours may not also come forward to depose. The prosecution is, therefore, necessarily to rely on circumstantial evidence. State vs Md Shafiqul Islam 43 DLR (AD) 92.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 5</strong>—Evidence of persons falling in the category of interested witnesses must be closely scrutinized. They should not be accepted on their face value. Their evidence cannot be rejected outright simply because they are interested witnesses. Nowabul Alam vs State 45 DLR (AD) 140.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5—</strong>It is well-settled that the prosecution case is never proved by suggestions made by the defence to prosecution witnesses. The Court cannot accept what is favourable to the prosecution and ignore the true purpose of suggesstion: Per Mustafa Kamal J writing the majority Judgment. Nowabul Alam vs State 45 DLR (AD) 140.<br/><br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—When discrepancies in testimony were mere discrepancies, and not contradictions, they did not affect the truth of what was stated in Court. State vs Ranjit Kumar Pramanik 45 DLR 660.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Demeanour of witnesses—The observation of the demeanour of witness by the trial Court is not dismissed lightly by the Appellate Court, unless there are intrinsic weaknesses and blatant contradictions in his evidence. Abdul Hal Sikder vs State 43 DLR (AD) 95.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Credibility of witness—Judges of the High Court Division have not considered the material discrepancies, contradictions and omissions of eye-witnesses for which an error has crept in the judgment resulting in the conviction of the appellants. On consideration of the evidence particularly of the eye-witnesses, the appellants are held to be entitled to the benefit of doubt and acquitted. Nurul Islam vs State 43 DLR (AD) 6.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Interested witness—Conviction cannot be based on the uncorroborated testimony of the informant who is a police officer and is vitally interested in the result of the case. Mati Miah vs State 44 DLR 554.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Demeanour of witness, appreciation of—when a finding of fact is based upon the credibility of evidence involving appreciation of the demeanour of witnesses, the view of the trial Court is entitled to great weight. State vs MM Rafiqul Hyder 45 DLR (AD) 13.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—PWs 8 and 9 categorically stated that they heard of the occurrence from the victims who disclosed the names of accused Habib and Ripon but they did not disclose the names to investigation officer—Their belated disclosure of the names of accused is nothing but subsequent embellishment and, as such, the same cannot be relied. Shaheen (Md) vs State 59 DLR 23.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—When PWs do not give the whole truth—We find no corroboration in the evidence of the PWs by any reliable and independent source. As a result, an element of doubt looms large and leads to the inevitable impression that the prosecution did not give out the whole truth for unknown reasons. In the face of the clear and definite evidence on record it is impossible to conclude with any amount of certainty that the death of Abdur Rahman was caused by appellant Abdul Hannan. Abdul Hannan vs State 60 DLR 590.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 6</strong>—Statement made by the victim of an offence, when it can have evidentiary value— In the absence of examination of the alleged victim, her statements allegedly made to the police or to the Magistrate cannot be treated as evidence against the accused. As neither the victim girl nor the Magistrate was examined, the statements recorded by the latter is not even a secondary evidence and in that view it is no legal evidence to prove the prosecution case. Abul Kashem vs State 43 DLR 420.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Sections 7 and 8</strong>—Conduct—The accused husband was not a docile person but a very arrogant and assertive person. This part of his character and conduct is relevant to be considered as to who is capable of doing what. The husband of the victim girl had complete dominion and control over the wife. This fact of having an unfettered opportunity in causing an occurrence by the accused only, would also be a corroborative and relevant fact under the law (Ref AIR 1977 (SC) 1116) and also the fact that after the commission of the alleged crime, the accused had absconded without any explanation or reasonable cause eRef 126 IC 689, 62 IC 545,) All these are relevant corroborative facts leading to the inference of guilt of the accused. 172 IC 374 and. 39 CrLJ 129 relied. State vs Nurul Hoque 45 DLR 306.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>-No motive of causing death of the deceased by the accused husband was attributed and proved through in a case based on circumstantial evidence proof of motive is of great importance. There is no evidence that the relationship between the appellant and his deceased wife was strained and on any occasion before the occurrence the appellant beat his deceased wife. Abu Taher vs State<br/>58 DLR 34.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—Motive—If the prosecution assigns a particular motive in proof of its case, then the motive has to be established by the prosecution failing which the prosecution must suffer on that account, not the defence. Khelu Mia vs State 43 DLR 573.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8—</strong>Motive—Prosecution is not obliged to suggest any motive where there is direct evidence but in a case which depends on circumstantial evidence motive is an important factor. if motive is suggested in any case by the prosecution, it accepts the burden to discharge for making the suggested motive plausible one. Farid Karim vs State 45 DLR 171.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8-</strong>Motive is not always necessary to prove murder, but if it was established, it would be a corroborative circumstance leading to complicity of the accused in the offence. State vs Nurul Hoque 45 DLR 306.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8—</strong>Murder charge resting on circumstantial evidence—Accused’s motive in calling out and accompanying the victim boy— There is absolutely no material on record to show that anybody had at any stage expressed any suspicion that the accused might have had any evil motive in calling out the victim. All that the father said at the trial was that the motive for murder was to give him pain. This is no motive. He did not say why the young accused would cause him pain. There is also no material to suggest even that there might have been some immediate and on-the-spot reason for the accused to cause violence to the victim or that they were acting at some others’ behest—Per ATM Afzal 3 with whom Shahabuddin Ahmed CJ and MH Rahman J concurred. State vs Khasru @ Syed Mostafa Hossain 43 DLR (AD) 182.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—Abscondance—guilty mind— it is true mere abscondance is not sufficient to hold the accused guilty. But in this case his wife was in his house and her body was recovered from the nearby jute field. He neither informed her parents nor brought the matter to the notice of the police—he simply vanished from his house and remained absconding for months. From these circumstances there can be no other hypothesis except that of his guilt. Abdul Khaleque vs State 45 DLR 75.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 8</strong>—Motive—Failure to prove motive does not always affect prosecution case.

State vs Ranjit Kumar Pramanik 45 DLR 660.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—Abscondance—Corroboration of evidence—Abscondance of an accused though can be treated as corroboration of the direct evidence of eye-witnesses connecting the accused with the crime but the abscondance cannot be treated to be corroboration of the confessional statement of another accused so as to base thereon the conviction of the absconding accused. Sanwar Hossain vs State 45 DLR 489.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—Prosecution is not generally required to prove any motive behind a crime. But if some motive is assigned, the prosecution needs to prove it. Gadu Mia vs State 44 DLR 246.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—Motive for murder—Though motive is one of the important factors for a murder, prosecution is not always bound to allege motive, and if alleged, need not prove it and for the absence of motive or proof thereof the prosecution will not fail, if the guilt of the “accused is otherwise proved by reliable and cogent evidence. Taslimuddin vs State 44 DLR 136.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>-Motive (by majority): Evidence of motive, when necessary—there is no reference at all in the dying declaration to any fact or circumstances for which it can be even remotely inferred that there was any reason whatever for which the appellant was likely to make an attempt on the life of the deceased nor is there any reason for the deceased to suspect the appellant as his possible killer. In a case of this nature based only upon the dying declaration there should have been some evidence of motive although motive may not be proved in case of direct evidence or as an ingredient of the offence. Sk Shamsur Rahman vs State 42 DLR (AD) 200.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>-Mere abscondance for some time without any guilty mind cannot be an incriminating circumstance against the accused to be relied upon for basing his conviction. Shahjahan vs State 46 DLR 575.<br/><br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—In a case where bitter enmity is admitted between the parties, it is required as a rule of prudence that there should be some corroboration of the evidence of the interested witness. Amir Hossain Dhali vs State 49 DLR 163.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—As the condemned accused absconded from the very beginning of the case, it appears that the learned Sessions Judge has been influenced for the same in awarding the capital sentence against him which is against the decided principle of law. From the conduct of a person for absconding after commission of the offence may sometimes be evidence to show that he was concerned with the offence. But it is usually a very small item in the evidence on which a conviction can be based. State vs Balai Chandra Sarker 47 DLR 467.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 8</strong>—Motive is not imperative in every case of murder and even if motive is not established that does not throw the prosecution case overboard. Ashraf Ali Munshi vs State 48 DLR 590.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8—</strong>Abscondance—Though the fact that the accused absconded soon after the crime is not an evidence itself but it may lend weight to other evidence. Ashraf All Munshi vs State 48 DLR 590.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—The deceptive conduct of accused petitioner to turn into a fugitive by jumping the bail is a clear indication of his guilty conscience. Babar Hossain vs State 52 DLR 326.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—In view of the evidence as to motive of the condemned prisoner, his previous attempt to assault the victim, comes within the purview of section 8 of the Evidence Act and this said conduct is relevant for determination of the issue of the case.

Abul Khair vs State 55 DLR 437.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—Accused remained absconding with clear guilty knowledge about his overt act in the occurrence resulting in the murder and, as such, his absconsion will create adverse opinion against him. Zakir Hossain vs State 55 DLR 137.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—Abscondence by itself does not prove any offence against any person unless such abscondence is substantiated by evidence in favour of his guilt incompatible with his plea of innocence. Zahid Hossain Paltu vs State 55 DLR 160.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—Abscondence of the condemned prisoner furnished strong corroboration to prosecution case that he is the culprit. State vs Moslem 55 DLR 116.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—Absconsion itself is not an incriminating matter inasmuch as even an innocent person implicated in a serious crime sometimes absconds during the investigation to avoid repression by the police. Abul Kashem vs State 56 DLR 132.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—Abscondence sometimes may not be an incriminating circumstance for drawing inference of the guilt of an accused person but, in the case in hand, long abscondence of the accused-appellant is an important circumstance to fasten him. Babul Sikder vs State represented by the DC 56 DLR 174.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>-Motive—Motive, if proved, affords a key to scan the evidences of the case in its proper perspective and motive proved indicates the high degree of probability and provides a link in the chain to connect the accused with the offence. State vs Abdul Hatem 56 DLR 431.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8-</strong>For lack of motive, the ocular evidence of injured witnesses and other eyewitnesses should not be discarded, specially in view of the fact that their evidence has not at all been shaken in the cross-examination. Ershad Ali Sikder vs State 57 DLR (AD) 75.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8-</strong>The Court does not, subscribe to the view of the learned Counsel that for every offence the prosecution must prove the motive if otherwise there is reason to believe as to the guilt of the accused.

Kazi Mahbubuddin Ahmed alias Mahbub vs State 57 DLR 513.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—The failure to discover the motive of an offence does not signify its nonexistence. The failure to prove motive is not fatal as a matter of law, proof of motive is never indispensable for conviction when facts are clear, it is immaterial that no motive has been proved. Khalilur Rahman vs State 59 DLR 227.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8</strong>—Abscondence——This itself cannot be the sole criteria to reach a finality of guilt. It is only corroborative in nature—Something more together may merit conviction—It is a fit case where the appellants are entitled to have benefit of doubt.

Abdul Majid vs State 55 DLR 486.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 8(j)—</strong>Prosecution for rape—Question of corroboration. It has long been a rule of practice for insisting on corroboration of the statement of the prosecutrix. If the Judge feels that without corroboration in a particular case the conviction can be sustained then he should give indication that he had the rule of caution in his mind and then should proceed to give reasons for considering it unnecessary to require corroboration and for considering that it was safe to convict the accused without corroboration. Saidur Rahman Neuton vs State 45 DLR (AD) 66.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 8 &amp; 9</strong>—Nowhere the accused mentioned anything why he avoided trial and remained in abscondance in spite of execution of Proclamation and Attachment and Warrant of Arrest for securing his attendance.

Though an act or action of one accused cannot be used as evidence against other accused but an exception has been carved out in section 10 of the Evidence Act in case of criminal conspiracy. If there is reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have conspired together in the light of the language used in 120A of the Penal Code, the evidence of acts done by one of the accused. can be used against the other.

The criterion for excluding the confession under this section is the answer to the question, to whom was the confession made? If the answer is that it was made to a police officer, the confession is inadmissible; and cannot be proved either by the evidence of the police officer, or by any other evidence, as the medium by which it is sought to prove an inadmissible confession does not alter its inadmissibility. A confession made to a police officer must be ruled out of evidence even if it was made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate as the terms of section 25 are not qualified or controlled by section 26. Bura Yunus vs State 59 DLR 549.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 25 and 27</strong>—An information even by way of confession made in police custody which relates to the fact discovered is admissible in evidence against the accused.<br/>Police Officer may be allowed to say that he went to the place and found the knife, but any statement as to confession of murder is inadmissible. Secondly, a fact already known to the police cannot be re-discovered on the state-ment of an accused so as to make the accused’s conduct of pointing out a place admissible in evidence. Thirdly, when a discovery is made in consequence of information received from more than one person, but it cannot be determined who first made the crucial statement, it is no discovery and the joint information or joint production is not admissible against any one.

State vs Mokammel Hyeath Khan 58 DLR 373.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30-</strong>A confession, judicial or extra- judicial, whether retracted or not, can in law validly form the sole basis of conviction, if the Court is satisfied and believes that it was true and voluntary and was not obtained by torture, coercion or inducement. State vs Mokammel Hyeath Khan 58 DLR 373.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>-The confession of an accused is not a substantive piece of evidence against the coaccused who did not confess and such evidence alone, without any substantive corroborative evidence, cannot form basis of conviction of coaccused. Mofazzal Hossain alias Mofa vs State 58 DLR 524.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—Consideration of confession— Confession affecting person making it and others—When confessional statement of an accused is found to be voluntary and partly exculpatory and partly inculpatory, the exculpatory part being improbable, contrary to reason and ordinary human conduct is liable to be rejected and the inculpatory part can be relied on even if the confession is subsequently retracted. Inculpatory part of the confession can also be used against the other accused. Abdul Kashem vs State 42 DLR 378.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30—</strong>The confession is sufficient to find accused Rina guilty of the charge under sections 302/34 Penal Code inasmuch as she participated in the murder starting from hatching of conspiracy for killing her husband in order to marry accused Manik to allowing the latter to bring in poison and mix it with the drinking water of her husband’s jug and then to see the husband drinking that water, then after his death to hang the body and raising a feigned cry. Besides, the circumstances showed there was no scope for anyone to enter the room to kill her husband without her co-operation. Shahjahan Manik vs State 42 DLR 465.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>-Confession of a co-accused cannot be the sole basis for conviction. State vs Nurul Haque 45 DLR 306.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—Confession—retraction—an order of conviction can be passed solely on the basis of a confession, whether retracted or not, if it is considered and found to be true and voluntary. Though there is no compulsion that a confession need be materially corroborated yet it is prudent that a Court should look for it. We are to examine the confessional statement in the light of the circumstances under which it is made and the other evidences on record corroborating the chain of circumstances as narrated by the accused before the Magistrate in his confessional statement and this corroborating need not always be in material particular as even a general corroboration or corroboration by medical evidence would be considered to be enough. Abdur Rahman Syed vs State 44 DLR 556.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—Confession—When not voluntary and true—The condemned prisoner was in police custody for 2 days with no explanation. This coupled with allegation of police torture shows the confession to be not voluntary, Confession containing exculpatory materials outweigh the inculpatory materials and then the statements having not been corroborated, the confession cannot be said to be true as well. Farid Karim vs State 45 DLR 171.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>-In a joint trial of several persons the Court may take into consideration confessional statement of an accused against himself and other accused. Md Azad Sheik vs State 41 DLR 62.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>-The extra judicial confession made in Police Station in presence of constables who had arrested the confessing accused and the police officer who had investigated the ease is inadmissible in evidence. Mofazzal Hossain Mollah vs State 45 DLR (AD) 175.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>-Extra-judicial confession—If at all made appears to be wholly untrue—No reliable evidence of corroboration of the alleged extrajudicial confession and it is not at all safe to rely and act upon such extra judicial confession. The alleged extra-judicial confession if at all made by the said accused also appears to be wholly untrue. So, in the whole analysis of the facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence on record and the alleged extra-judicial confession of the condemned prisoner, we find that there is no reliable evidence of corroboration of the so-called alleged extra-judicial confession and it is not at all safe to rely and act upon such extra-judicial confession and convict the accused on that basis. Hence the conviction of the condemned prisoner Badsha Mollab on the basis of alleged extra- judicial confession cannot be sustained in law. State vs Badshah Mollah 41 DLR 11.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30—</strong>Mere absconding cannot always be a circumstance to lead to an inference of guilt of the accused. Mere abscondance cannot always be a circumstance which should lead to an inference of guilt of the accused. Sometimes out of fear and self-respect and to avoid unnecessary harassment even an innocent person remains absconding for some time. State vs Badshah Mollah 41 DLR 11.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—Abscondance was not with any guilty mind. Existence of enmity is not disputed. Accused has been falsely implicated in this case out of grudge and enmity. State vs Badshah Mollah 41 DLR 11.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—In this case the condemned prisoner Badsha remained absent or absconding for some time but subsequently he surrendered himself in Court before the commencement of the trial. It appears, this abscondance was not with any guilty mind. So, this circumstance cannot be treated as a discriminating one. State vs Badshah Mollah 41 DLR 11.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—There being no independent evidence except the confessional statement of appellant Farook Mahajan against the other accused appellants. The trial Court was wrong in finding all the appellants guilty. A retracted confession, like the onewhich is not retracted, may form the sole basis of conviction of the maker if the Court believes it to be voluntary and true. But as against the coaccused, the evidentiary value of a retracted is practically nil and in the absence of strong independent evidence, it is totally useless. Faruque Mahajan vs State 49 DLR 47.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—Confessional statement of one accused cannot be used as evidence against another coaccused unless there is any independent corroboration. Sohel Monir, son of MA Monir of Dhaka vs State 49 DLR 407.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—The evidentiary value of a retracted confession is practically nil in the absence of strong independent evidence. Sohel Monir son of MA Monir of Dhaka vs State 49 DLR 407.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30-</strong>The confession of a co-accused may be used only to lend assurance to other evidence on recorded in support of the guilt of the accused but the same cannot be used as a substantive evidence. Moslemuddin vs State 48 DLR 588.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—No statement that contains selfexculpatory matter can amount to confessional statement if the exculpatory statement is of some fact which if proved would negative the offence confessed. The statement of accused Bachchu in his confessional statement as quoted are the admission and not confession as confession involved a voluntary acknowledgment of guilt. From the admission of accused Bachchu it cannot be said that he was aware that Khairul would be murdered by the other accused. He, therefore, cannot be said to have abetted that offence of murder. State vs Md Bachchu Miah @ Abdul Mannan and 5 others 51 DLR 355.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—If confession falls short of plenary acknowledgment of guilt it would not be a confession even though the statement contained some incriminating fact. Jabed Ali (Md) alias Jabed All vs State 51 DLR 397.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—It is very risky to rely on the statements of the two confessing accused so as to convict accused Mohammad Au as there is absence of any corroborative evidence to identify Mohammad as Mohammad Ali. Mohammad Ali vs State 52 DLR 245.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—The confessional statement of an accused can very well be the basis of conviction provided the same is true and voluntary. Hasmat Ali vs State 53 DLR 169.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—Prolonged police custody immediately before recording of the confessional statement is sufficient, if not otherwise properly explained, to render it as involuntary. Hasmat Ali vs State 53 DLR 169.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—The conviction cannot be based solely on the basis of confessional statement of a co-accused unless it is corroborated by some other independent evidence. State vs Lieutenant Colonel Syed Farook Rahman 53 DLR 287.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—The alleged solitary confinement was after the recording of the confessional statement and does not affect the confession as involuntary. State vs Lieutenant Colonel Syed Farook Rahman 53 DLR 287.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—Confession of a co-accused cannot by itself be the basis of conviction of another co-accused nor even against himself if the same is not substantiated by satisfactory evidence proving the guilt of its maker. Zahid Hossain Paltu vs State 55 DLR 160.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30-</strong>Conviction can be based on judicial confession if it is established that it is true and voluntary and is substantiated by other evidences, whether direct or circumstantial and materials on record. State vs Moslem 55 DLR 116.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—Conviction can be based on the sole confession of the accused although retracted subsequently if it is found to be true and voluntary. Zakir Hossainvs State 55 DLR 137.<br/>Section 30-Conviction of the confessing accused based on a retracted confession even if uncorroborated caunot be said to be illegal if the court believes that it is true and voluntary. State vs Rafiqul Islam 55 DLR 61.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—The trial Court first has to find the confessional statement to be true and voluntary and then only may place reliance on it. State vs Rafiqul Islam 55 DLR 61.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—The confession of one coaccused cannot be used for corroborating the confession of another co-accused as both are tainted evidence, much more so when they are retracted, for, then the maker himself repudiates the correctness of his earlier statements—the confession of a co-accused could not be sustained and further the confession of one co-accused could not be said to be corroborated by the confession of another co-accused. Rezaul Karim (Md) alias Rezaul Alam Rickshawa vs State 55 DLR 382.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 30</strong>—Confession of an accused is not a substantive piece of evidence against the coaccused, so such evidence alone without substantive corroborative evidence cannot form the basis of conviction of a co-accused. Rezaul Karim (Md) alias Rezaul Alam Rickshawa vs State 55 DLR 382.<br/><br/><strong>Section 30—</strong>Confession of a co-accused can be taken into consideration and on the strength of that confession another co-accused can be convicted provided the said confession is corroborated by any other evidence, either direct and circumstantial. State vs Mir Hossain alias Mira and others 56 DLR<br/>124.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—Conviction on the basis of a confessional statement upon the maker can be very much based even if the confessional statement had been retracted at a later stage. State vs Anjuara Khatun 57 DLR 277.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—Very brevity of dying declaration in the circumstances of the case far from being a suspicious circumstances was an index of its being true and free from the taint of tutoring. Tenseness of statement itself can be characterised as the guarantee of truth. State vs Anjuara Khatun 57 DLR 277.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—A Judicial confession not furnished voluntarily and out of free will is quite unreliable, more so, when such a confession is retracted. Kazi Mahbubuddin Ahmed alias Mahbub vs State, represented by the DC, Dhaka 57 DLR 513.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—A retracted confession can constitute sufficient basis for conviction of its maker provided the same is found true and voluntary. Khalilur Rahman vs State 59 DLR 227.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—The confessions being:out and out exculpatory are not confessions in the eye of law and, as such, completely inadmissible and those cannot be considered under section 30 of the Evidence Act as against the co-accuseds. State vs Al Hasib Bin Jamal alias Hasib 59 DLR 653.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—It appears from the evidence on record that the accused Kader in collusion with Kamran and Imran took Sahad from his house with a preplan to take revenge of the previous enmity. Subsequently, the conduct of the accused Kader i.e. leaving his house immediately after occurrence and his spontaneous surrender before the police also clearly corroborates the confessional statement. As regard the extra-judicial confession, the witnesses in whose presence he confessed his guilt, they deposed in the Court. Furthermore, the recovery of dead body and the recovery of ‘Bothi’ and other materials at the pointing out of Kader also clearly indicate the corroboration of confessional statement. Moreover, the Magistrate who recorded the confessional statement has come before the Court and deposed that the accused Kader made the confessional statement voluntarily and he certified the confessional statement as true and voluntary. State vs Abdul Kader 60 DLR 420.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—A confessional statement must not only be voluntary, but it must be true at the same time. The veracity of the confessional statement must not be tested in a vague and hypothetical manner, but in a concrete and logical manner in light of the evidence adduced by the prosecution. State vs Hamidul 61 DLR 614.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—The confessional statement neither fits with the prosecution version of the event nor does it corroborate the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and on this score, the confessional statement cannot be taken to be true. In the absence of any other credible evidence by which the complicity of the appellant in the case can be established, his conviction becomes equally unsustainable. State vs Hamidul 61 DLR 614.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 30</strong>—It appears from the order No. 141 dated 12-4-1997 that the accused Aktaruzzaman Chowdhury Babu was granted bail by the Court of Sessions, and thereafter the High Court Division cancelled his bail on 27-5-1993 and directed him to surrender before the Court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate by 12-6-1993, but the accused flouted the order and absconded and remained in abscondence for over 3 years till his surrender before the trial Court. This conduct of Babu appears to be culpable in nature and is a circumstance that goes against him. State vs Md Faziur Rahman Tonmoy 61 DLR 169.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>-The general principle is that the evidence of an approver should be accepted or rejected as a whole. By making a departure from established legal principle, the Court below acquitted Babu on some untenable and unsustainable grounds. State vs Md Fazlur Rahman Tonmoy 61 DLR 169.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—The confession of an accused person against a co-accused is not evidence in the ordinary sense of the term. Such a confession can only be used to lend assurance to other evidence against a co-accused. The judge may call in aid the confession and use it to lend assurance to the other evidence. Khalil vs State 62 DLR 309.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—Confession of a co-accused can-not be the sole basis to convict the other of the co-accused, in absence of other corroborative evidence. Nuru Miah vs State 63 DLR 242.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30</strong>—Confession of a co-accused cannot be resorted to under any guise as substantial evidence to convict another but may be used as a relevant fact only to lend assurance to any other evidence. State vs Moksed Ali 63 DLR 346.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 30 &amp; 3—</strong>Confession of co-accused —The confession of an accused is no evidence against the coaccused. Such confession cannot be taken into consideration against his coaccused and it can only be used to lend assurance to other legal evidence. But in the absence of any substantive evidence the confession of a coaccused is of no consequence against other accused persons. State vs Tajul Islam 48 DLR 306.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 30 &amp; 3</strong>—It is true confession of an accused may be used as against other co-accused in the same trial. But this is for a limited purpose. Confession of a coaccused itself is not evidence but it may be used, as such, if it is found to be true and voluntary as against other co-accused not as a solitary basis but for the purpose of lending assurance to any other evidence found against him. Abul Hossain vs State 46 DLR 77.<br/><br/><strong>Sections 30 &amp; 3—</strong>Since the confessional statement is not required to be taken on oath and taken in presence of a coaccused and not tested by cross-examination it cannot be considered as substantive evidence against the co-accused. Mojibar vs State 51 DLR 507.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 30 and 114(b)—</strong>Court may take into consideration the confessional statement of a co-accused under section 30 of the Act against the one who did not confess but an accomplice is unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in material particulars. Nazrul Islam vs State 45 DLR 142.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 32</strong>—There appears some vagueness in the alleged verbal dying declaration and that is why before relying upon such dying declaration it is the rule of prudence that necessitates the corroboration of the same by reliable evidence Gadu Miah vs State 44 DLR 246.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32</strong>—Expectation of imminent death is not a requirement for treating the declaration as a dying declaration. What is relevant is whether the declaration is voluntary or under pressure from any outside quarter. Conviction can be based on such declaration. Nurjahan Begum vs State 40 DLR 321.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong>Dying declaration—If it stands the normal test for judging its veracity it becomes a wholly reliable piece of evidence, but if it does not, it is far worse than an ordinary statement of a witness. The value of dying declaration depends in a case on its own facts and the circumstances in which it is made.<br/><br/>If a dying declaration is found to be false in material particulars it must re-act on its genuineness as a whole because in the case of dying declaration the veracity of the contents is presumed on the basis that it happens to be the words of a dying man, who on normal human behaviour would not at the close of his life like to tell a lie. Therefore, if a single matter is introduced in the dying statement which has a bearing on the result of the case and is found to be false, it will hit the whole dying declaration. It cannot then be said that it is the statement of a truthful person who has made the statement in realisation of his obligations to adhere to the truth while he is quitting his worldly existence to join his Creator, to Whom he is answerable for his deeds. Babu vs State 45 DLR 79.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32</strong>—Hearsay evidence—The witness stated that he had heard from the deceased that the accused hired his van and were taking him to Jessore. This part of the evidence, though hearsay, is admissible in evidence being circumstances of the transaction resulting in the death of the deceased. Abul Kashem vs State 42 DLR 378.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32</strong>—Dying declaration—Conditions to act upon such declaration—The court is to see whether the victim had the physical capability of making such a declaration, whether witnesses who had heard the deceased making such statement heard it correctly, whether they reproduced names of assailants correctly and whether the maker of the declaration had an opportunity to recognise the assailants. Hafizuddin vs State 42 DLR 397.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32</strong>—Dying declaration—A dying man incapable of making any statement may by some gesture, sign or symbol express something which may be interpreted as his statements admissible under the law. But it is to be seen whether his expressions intrinsically ring true or not.<br/>Dying declaration may be judged from several standpoints; whether the victim had physical capacity to recognise the assailant or whether he had the opportunity to recognize the assailant or whether there is any chance ofmistake as to the identity of the assailant or whether it was free from outside prompting and lastly, if the evidence could be relied upon under the given facts and circumstances of the case. A Alim vs State 45 DLR 43.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 32</strong>—It is not required for a dying declaration that the maker should be in expectation of his immediate death nor it is restricted to homicidal death. Humayun Matubbar vs State 51 DLR 433<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong>There is nothing in the evidence that after recording the dying declaration in English any person present at the time of recording of dying declaration translated the same in Bengali and that explained the statement to the maker and that the maker admitted the correctness of the same. This being the position the correctness of the dying declaration is very much doubtful. State vs Babul Hossain 52 DLR 400.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32</strong>—To make the Dying declaration the basis for sentencing an accused to death or any other sentence the same is required to be found reliable. State vs Babul Hossain 52 DLR 400.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32</strong>—An injured person under the impediment of death, while making oral or written dying declaration, will not falsely implicate even the persons inimical to him. Miloon @ Shahabuddin Ahmed vs State 53 DLR 464.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32</strong>—The first information report is a matter of special importance when its maker died shortly after he made it. The FIR is clearly admissible in evidence. This may also be treated as a dying declaration in view of the fact that victim himself dictated the ejahar at a time when his condition was really critical. State vs Rashid Ahmed 54 DLR 333.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32</strong>—If the Court can unhesitatingly accept it and act upon it, a dying declaration by itself can form the basis of conviction under given circumstances. State vs Rashid Ahmed 54 DLR 333.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32</strong>—Identification by torch light or hurricane light, at dead of night is not sufficient unless the distance is in close proximity and when there is a background of enmity and the witnesses are chance witnesses and not natural witnessess and natural and independent witnesses were not produced, it is unsafe to rely on the chance witnesses to connect the accused with the crime. Nepoleon Khondker alias Lepu vs State 54 DLR 386.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32</strong>—The dying declaration of victim has not been reduced to writing, yet when it has been proved by overwhelming ocular evidence to prove the guilt of accused appellant, the dying declaration of victim itself stands out as a strong piece of evidence proving the guilt of the appellant. Salim vs State 54 DLR 359.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32</strong>—When a dying declaration of the victim is stated by the witnesses and the declaration is not taken exactly in the own words of the deceased, but is merely a note of the substance of what had stated, it cannot be safely accepted as a sufficient basis for conviction. State vs Kabel Molla 55 DLR 108.<br/><br/><strong>Section 32</strong>—A dying declaration enjoins almost a sacrosanct status as a piece of evidence as it comes from the mouth of a person who is about to die and at that stage he is not likely to make a false statement.

Babul Sikder and others vs State represented by the DC 56 DLR 174.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32</strong>—Dying declaration—If the dying declaration is acceptable as true conviction can be based upon the dying declaration alone in the absence of corroborative evidence on record. State vs Abdul Hatem 56 DLR 431.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Section 32</strong>—A dying declaration may be recorded by any person who is available and it may be written or it may be verbal; it may also be indicated by signs and gestures, in answer to questions, if the person making it is not in a position to speak. There is no requirement of law that a dying declaration should be recorded by a Magistrate as in the case of the confessional statement of an accused under section 164(3) CrPC. Sahabuddin vs State 61 DLR 54.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32</strong>—Dying Declaration—In the absence of a medical certification that the injured was in a fit state of mind at the time of making the declaration, it would be very much risky to accept the subjective satisfaction of a Magistrate who opined that the injured was in a fit state of mind at the time of making declaration. Sahabuddin vs State 61 DLR 54.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32</strong>—Dying Declaration—Dr Kamrul Ahsan had not been produced in the Court by prosecution and he was withheld. In the event of his offering evidence in support of Dying Declaration, fitness of deceased Shah Alam Babul and his capability to make declaration could be tested by way of cross-examination. Sahabuddin vs State 61 DLR 54.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 32 and 157</strong>—The evidence of the doctors and the report of the postmortem examination cannot be substantive evidence, but can only be corroborative evidence. Uzzal alias Elias Hossain vs State 59 DLR 505.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 32 &amp; 157</strong>—A fundamental rule in the law of evidence is that in any given case the evidence must be direct and to that extent the rule against hearsay is an exclusionary rule. The hearsay rule excludes evidence because the evidence given in Court is not direct evidence. The main reason for excluding such evidence, inter alia, is that the person who is said to have made the statement is not before the Court and cannot be subjected to cross-examination and thus the veracity of that statement could not be tested. Uzzal alias Elias Hossain vs State 59 DLR 505.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32(1)—</strong>Unless the dying declaration as compared to other evidence appears to be true, it cannot by itself form the basis of conviction of the accused. State vs Tota Mia 51 DLR 244.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32(1)—</strong>Deceased Shajneen, on two occasions, reactd sharply against conduct of culprit Hasan. Her utterances made then unfold a bitter relationship between her and Hasan. Such reactions of Shajneen a few hours before the occurrence are admissible in evidence. These facts fall in the category of “statement” of the deceased “as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in her death”. The proximity of the reaction are relevant and therefore falls under the purview of section 32(1) Evidence Act. State vs Shahidul Islam alias Shahid 58 DLR 545.<br/><br/><strong>Section 32(1)—</strong>Conspiracy is a secretive activity and it can hardly be seen. It may be perceived and may also be inferred from the circumstances of a particular case. State vs Shahidul Islam alias Shahid 58 DLR 545.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32(1)—</strong>Dying declaration need not be identical and of the same but if substance of the same fulfils other conditions to act upon such declaration, then it is admissible in evidence. A detailed statement cannot necessarily lead to the inference that the statement is fabricated one. It is now well settled that a dying declaration, oral or written, when established as true can form the sole basis of conviction. State vs Moinul Hoque 60 DLR 298.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 32(1)—</strong>Dying declaration—Its probative value (by majority): A dying declaration although a piece of substantive evidence has always been viewed with some degree of caution as the matter is not liable to cross-examination. It stands on the same footing as any other piece of evidence and has to be judged in the light of surrounding circumstances and common human experience. When there is a record of such statement of the deceased the Court has to satisfy itself, in the first place, as to the genuineness of the same keeping in view all the evidence and circumstances in which the statement of the deceased was said to have been recorded. The alleged dying declaration, the only piece of evidence against the appellant, having not been free from reasonable doubt, the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt. Sk Shamsur Rahman vs State 42 DLR (AD) 200.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32(1)—</strong>Dying declaration— Statement of a person about the cause of his death or circumstances leading to his death is substantive evidence under section 32(1) of the Evidence Act—If found reliable, it may by itself be basis for conviction even without corroboration. Statement falling under section 32(1) of the Evidence Act is called a “dying declaration” in ordinary parlance—A dying declaration may be recorded by any person who is available and it may be written or it may be verbal or it may be indicated by signs and gestures in answer to questions even—There is no requirement of law that a dying declaration should be recorded by a Magistrate as in the case of the confessional statement of an accused under section 164(3) CrPC. Nurjahan Begum vs State 42 DLR (AD) 130.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 32(1)—</strong>Legislature in its wisdom has put a dying declaration at par with evidence on oath for the simple reason that a man under the apprehension of death is not likely to speak falsehood and involve innocent persons in preference to his assailant. When a Probationer Officer actually recorded the statement in presence of, and under the observation of the Superior Officer (PW 9), there was hardly any wrong in his Evidence that he recorded it in presence of the witnesses. Nurfahan Begum vs State 42 DLR (AD) 130.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 33</strong>—When the concerned witness could not be produced in the dock for further cross-examination for the fault of the accused it cannot be said that the evidence of the witness is inadmissible. Bakul vs State 47 DLR 486.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 33</strong>—A case of prejudice likely to be suffered by an accused must depend on the facts of the case and no universal straitjacket formula would be laid down that non-examination of investigating officer per se vitiates a criminal trial. Babul Sikder and others vs State represented by the DC 56 DLR 174.<br/><br/><strong>Section 33</strong>—Relevancy of evidence—Right and opportunity to cross-examine—It is the right to cross-examine and not the exercise of such right that is material for the purpose of application of the provision under section 33 Evidence Act. Shaikh Baharul Islam vs State 43 DLR 336.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 33</strong>—Evidence of the recording Magistrate was not placed before the trial Court under section 33 of the Evidence Act—Hence this cannot be used as evidence. But that statement of the Magistrate recorded in the earlier case cannot be taken into consideration in this case as it was not recorded in the presence of accused appellant and also because he did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the said Magistrate. This appellant was then a witness. So the evidence of the recording Magistrate cannot be considered in this case and the confessional statement cannot also be used against the appellant. Angur vs State 41 DLR 66.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 33</strong>—Burden of proof—Prosecution to discharge its burden by producing unimpeachable evidence of reliable witnesses—Benefit of doubt goes to the accused if doubt arises.

Osman Gani vs State 54 DLR (AD) 34.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 34</strong>—Circumstantial evidence— When such evidence can be relied upon—Circumstantial evidence relied upon by the prosecution must be cogent, succinct and reliable.

Abdul Khaleque vs State 41 DLR 349.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 102</strong>—In the instant case the defence has taken the alibi that the victim Jesmin loved Pashan Ali and she went to him and married him having registered kabinnama.

But this burden is somewhat lighter than that of the prosecution. The accused could be considered to have discharged his burden if he succeeds in creating a reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances that would absolve him of criminal liability, but the prosecution is to discharge its burden by establishing the guilt of the accused. An accused’s burden is lighter, because the court is to consider his plea only after, and not before, the proseciii leads evidence for sustaining a conviction. When the prosecution failed to prove that the husband was in his house where his wife was murdered, he cannot be saddled with any onus to prove his innocence. State vs Mafuzzal Hossain Pramanik 43 DLR (AD) 64A.<br/><br/><strong>Section 105—</strong>Where the testimony of witnesses are mere hearsay, the case becomes one of no evidence against the, appellant.

Shah Alam vs State 42 DLR (AD) 31.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 105</strong>—Section 105, Evidence Act casts a burden upon the accused to prove the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the Penal Code.

State vs Md Shahjahan 58 DLR 203.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 105</strong>—Defence plea—There is a basic rule of criminal jurisprudence that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in a case f circumstantial evidence, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the Court should adopt the view favourable to the accused. If we consider the entire evidence we can safely conclude that the prosecution has totally failed to prove its case, moreso, the version put forward by the defence has a reasonable possibility of being true. Hence the accused is entitled to get benefit of doubt, not as a matter of grace but as a matter of right. Atahar vs State 62 DLR 302.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 106</strong>—Alibi—Since the prosecution hopelessly failed to prove the minimum requirement of presence of the accused in his house at the time when his wife was killed there is no obligation on the part of the defence to prove the alibi.

The onus of proof that it was the condemned petitioner and none else who killed his wife and daughter was all along on the prosecution and it never shifted on the condemned petitioner in the absence of any proof beyond reasonable doubt that he was present in the occurrence house when the occurrence took place. Hasan Malik vs State 61 DLR 303.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 106</strong>—The definite and specific defence plea being within the special knowledge of the accused a burden was cast upon him to discharge it, more so, when the prosecution proved the guilt of the accused by convincing and overwhelming evidence.

Alamgir Hossain vs State 49 DLR 590.<br/><br/><strong>Section 114(g)</strong>—Nonexamination of independent witnesses, especially some of the close neighbours calls for a presumption against the prosecution.

Mokbul Hossain vs State 55 DLR 396.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 114(g)-</strong>Non-examination of the maids, driver and security guards of the house of the accused and the key maker is not fatal for the prosecution in the case. It cannot be expected that they will give evidence against the accused. Moreover, the accused in order to discharge his obligation could examine them. All of them are his men. But he did not do so. No adverse presumption against the prosecution should be drawn for their non-examination by the prosecution. State vs Azam Reza 62 DLR 399.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 114(g)—</strong>Benefit of doubt—High Court Division has committed fundamental error in giving the accused the benefit of doubt despite the fact that the prosecution has been able to prove the charge beyond shadow of doubt.

State vs Ershad Ali Sikder 56 DLR 305.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 133 and 114(b)—</strong>Though the conviction of an accomplice cannot be said to be illegal yet the courts will, as a matter of practice, not accept the evidence of such a witness without corroboration in material particulars. State vs Ershad Ali Sikder 56 DLR 185.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 133 and 114(3)—</strong>The combined effect of sections 133 and 114(b) is that though a conviction based upon accomplice’s evidence is legal, the Court will not accept such evidence unless it is corroborated in material particulars. The corroboration must connect the accused with the crime. State vs Ershad Ali Sikder 56 DLR 185.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 133 &amp; 144</strong>—Testimony of accomplice—It is dangerous to base a conviction on such evidence alone. The Court almost invariably starts with the presumption against the trustworthiness of the accomplice and unless circumstances are quite exceptional the Court refuses to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. Ator Ali vs State 44 DLR 478.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 134</strong>—In order to convict an accused solely on the basis of a solitary witness like the police officer or the person who made the search and seizure, the Judge must ensure that such witness is disinterested and the evidence is unimpeachable and the other witnesses to the search who are alleged to have resiled from their previous stand are unworthy of credit. Talebur Rahman vs State 49 DLR 167.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134—</strong>Even on the basis of a single witness a conviction can be maintained but such a witness must be fully reliable, above reproach and not shaken. Ashok Kumar Saha vs State 46 DLR 229.<br/><br/><strong>Section 134</strong>—Law does not require any particular number of witnesses to prove a case and conviction may be weilfounded even on the testimony of a solitary witness provided his credibility is not shaken. AlAmin vs State 51 DLR 154.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>-It is true that under section 134 of the evidence Act conviction can be based on the evidence of a single witness but the evidence of that witness must be of unimpeachable character. Bimal Chandra Das vs State 51 DLR 466.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>-Non-examination of nearby people not fatal to the prosecution case when there are eye-witnesses of the occurrence. Milon @ Shahabuddin Ahmed vs Stale 53 DLR 464.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>—Corroborative evidence is not an imperative component in every case of rape. The rule is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a conviction. Shibu Pada Acharjee vs State 56 DLR 285.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>-The well-known maxim which is a Golden Rule that “evidence has to be weighed and not counted” has been given statutory placement in section 134 of The Evidence Act which provides that no particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact. Shibu Pada Acharjee vs State 56 DLR 285.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>—Court as a rule of prudence and caution and in order to exclude every possibility of involvement of innocent person in a case by prosecution along with guilty person or persons always looks for corroboration by some reliable witness to create probable basis for basing conviction. Babul vs State 57 DLR 158.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>-It appears that the accused persons “are daredevils of the locality”. No one was willing to come forward to depose against them. In such circumstances, there should not be insistence that more witnesses should have been examined. Even the quality of the evidence of a single witness is sufficient to prove the case. Sheikh Abdul Quddus vs Akram Sheikh @ Akram 57DLR 650.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong> —From the record it is revealed that 13 other local witnesses did not turn up in the Court despite issuance of all the legal processes. The Additional Sessions Judge has taken the view that their non-appearance will not discredit the evidence of the two reliable eye-witnesses. This is agreeable in view of section 134, of the Evidence Act and the facts and circumstances of the case. Ismail Howlader vs State 58 DLR 335.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>—Conviction can be based on the testimony of even a single witness if his evidence is found reliable and trustworthy. In this case prosecution produced 22 out of the 74 witnesses cited in the charge-sheet and their evidence as discussed found to be reliable and credible for conviction of the accused. State vs Shahidul Islam alias Shahid 58 DLR 545.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>—The accused persons did not deny the occurrence but they denied their participation. Apart from PW 2 and PW 7 there are independent eye-witnesses like PW 6 who appeared at the scene immediately after the occurrence and PW 8 who deposed and corroborated the informant. In the case of Khoka vs State reported in 4 BLC (AD) 86 this Division held that believing only one eye witness conviction is legally permissible and conviction can be based on the sole evidence of only one witness. Zakir Hossain vs State 61 DLR (AD) 70.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>—Even if one prosecution witness is fully reliable then conviction of an accused can be based upon his evidence. Shadat Ali vs State 44 DLR 217.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>—Number of witnesses for proof of fact—It is true in view of section 134 conviction of an accused can be based even upon the evidence of a single witness. But that witness must be wholly reliable. PW 2, the only eyewitness in the present case, in the facts thereof, is not wholly reliable, if not wholly unreliable, and as such sufficient corroboration of her evidence is necessary to base conviction. Ashrafuddin vs State 42 DLR 511.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>—A Judge may convict an accused solely on the basis of the unimpeachable and unshaken evidence of the officer or person who made the search and seizure disbelieving the evidence, if any, of any witnesses of search and seizure holding it to be unworthy of credit. Yunus Ali vs State 61 DLR 793.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>—Number of witnesses— Conviction of the appellants can safely be based on the solitary evidence of the eye-witness PW 1. His evidence is full, complete and self-contained. It may not have received corroboration from other witnesses, but it stands fully corroborated by the circumstances of the case and the medical evidence on record. Its fullness and completeness are enough to justify the conviction. Abdul Hai Sikder vs State 43 DLR (AD) 95.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>-The testimony of the solitary eye-witness could not be shaken in any manner by the defence in cross-examination for which it is difficult to disbelieve her testimony as she narrated the prosecution case in details. Abdul Quddus vs State 43 DLR (AD) 234.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>-Solitary witness—True it is that conviction can be based on a solitary witness and it is not necessary to seek corroboration always from independent sources but in the instant case PWs 1-3 being close relations and their evidence being inconsistent, it is not safe to maintain the conviction. Bulu vs State 45 DLR 79.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>-Recovery of arms and ammunition after hot pursuit of the accused moving with the same—Whether evidence of a single witness without corroboration is sufficient to convict the accused—Victim PW 2 is a disinterested witness and can be relied upon and he has been corroborated in material particulars by the evidence of PWs 1 &amp; 4. Mahbubur Rahman Khan vs State 45 DLR 117.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>-It is not enjoined that the prosecution is to examine certain definite number of witness. Kazi Motiur Rahman vs Din Islam 43 DLR 128.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 134</strong>—In a case of sexual offence, when the victim girl is a minor, her evidence, if otherwise found to be reliable, may be sufficient for conviction of the accused even without independent corroboration. Siraj Mal vs State 45 DLR 688.<br/><br/><strong>Section 134</strong>—Quality and not quantity of evidence is acceptable. There is no impediment in law in conviction being based on the testimony of single witness if it is honest and trustworthy, veracity of eye-witness cannot be doubted unless reason for false implication is given. Ataur Rahman vs State 43 DLR 87.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 137</strong>—Statements elicited from a witness in cross-examination are a very important part of evidence before a Court Before drawing any inference from the testimony of a witness, the Court must consider the statements made in the examination-in-chief and those made in cross- examination by putting them in juxtaposition and see whether that witness has stood the test. Wajear Rahman Moral vs State 43 DLR (AD) 25.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 137</strong>—Contention as to facts—The defence cannot make an ingenuous argument that the prosecution story cannot be believed as they did not mention about the connecting doors in between the rooms as the defence did not put any suggestion as to non-existence of the same. Abdul Quddus vs State 43 DLR (AD) 234.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 137</strong>—Objection to the manner of cross-examination put to PWs 2 and 3 in a lump and similarly to the 10 PW 9—Objection rightly taken when there was no such statement in the examination-in-chief of the witness. Taleb Ali vs State 40 DLR (AD) 240.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 137</strong>—Court is to consider the evidence of witnesses in their examination-in- chief in juxtaposition with their cross-examination. Abut Khair vs State 55 DLR 437.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 137</strong>—The wife at the relevant time of occurrence was at her husband’s house and that she is subsequently found dead an obligation is cast upon the defense to account for the circumstances leading to the death of the deceased failing which the husband will be responsible for the death of the deceased. Giasuddin vs State 55 DLR 328.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 137</strong>—Cross-examination of witnesses is the greatest legal engine for discovery of truth. It is the most effective of all means for extracting truth or falsehood. It is both a sword of attack and a shield of defence. Kazi Mahbubuddin Ahmed alias Mahbub vs State, represented by the DC, Dhaka 57DLR 513.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 145</strong>—Statements made under section 161 CrPC are not substantive evidence. Such statements can only be utilized under section 162 CrPC to contradict the witness in the manner provided by section 145 of the Evidence Act. Abdus Subhan vs State 46 DLR 387.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 145—</strong>A statement of a witness recorded under section 161 CrPC couldn’t be used as substantive evidence. It can only be utilised under section 162 CrPC to contradict such witness in the manner provided by section 145 of the Act. State vs Nazrul Islam @ Nazrul 57 DLR 289.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145, 155 and 157</strong>—It appears that the learned Judge solely relying upon the statement of the PWs given before the Magistrate at the time of the judicial inquiry convicted the appellants. Those statements were taken as evidence and on the basis of that statement the convict appellants were awarded conviction. This is absolutely illegal and without jurisdiction, inasmuch as it is not permissible by law to award conviction and sentence on the basis of the statement made during judicial inquiry which is not evidence. Mahatab Gandari vs State 60 DLR 383.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 &amp; 155</strong>—The trial Court illegally referred to and considered the statements of witnesses recorded under section 161 Criminal procedure Code, which could only be used to contradict or corroborate the witness. Abu Bakker vs State 49 DLR 480.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 &amp; 155</strong>—Statement of a person recorded under section 164 CrPC is not a substantive piece of evidence of the fact stated therein. Such statements recorded by a Magistrate under section 164 CrPC can only be used for contradicting the maker of it under sections 145 and 155 of the Evidence Act or for the purpose of corroborating him under section 157 of the Act. Seraj Miah vs  State 49 DLR 192.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 &amp; 155</strong>-The Tribunal appears to have used 164 statement of PW 60 as a piece of evidence. This is a gross illegality. Such statement was recorded by the Magistrate behind the back of the accused persons, it can never be used as substantive evidence against them in any way. State vs Kajal Ahmed Jalali 59 DLR 345.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 and 157</strong>—Statement recorded behind the back of the accused the same cannot be treated as substantive evidence against him. Such statement can be used to corroborate or to contradict a statement made in the court in the manner provided in sections 145 and 157 of the Evidence Act. Hobi Sheikh vs State 56 DLR 383.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 146</strong>—Mere relationship of the witness should not be a ground for discarding his evidence unless he is found to be biased and lying. Sarwardy Kamal vs State 48 DLR 61.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>—Even if there is some discrepancy in the evidence of a witness with regard to some part of the case, for that his entire evidence on the remaining part should not be discarded. Abdus Sukur Mia vs State 48 DLR 228.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>—Evidence of the witness, who has been declared hostile, would ipso facto not be of any worth for the prosecution, rather if on consideration of the evidence of such kind of witness it is found that evidence on record either has established the case of the prosecution or that prosecution case does not stand scrutiny then whatever order in any respect is made by the Court the same is very much sustainable in law. Mobarak Hossain alias Mobarak vs State 56 DLR (AD) 26.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>—Hostile witness (by minority): The evidence of the two hostile witnesses cannot be rejected in whole or in part but the whole of the evidence so far as it affects both sides must be taken into consideration. Sk Shamsur Rahman vs State 42 DLR (AD) 200.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 154</strong>—Hostile witness—A witness is not necessarily hostile if he reveals the truth. Established practice, now forming a rule of law, regarding the evidence of a hostile witness is that the whole of his evidence so far as it affects both the parties, favourably or unfavourably, must be considered and the Court which gets the opportunity to observe his demeanour is at liberty to make assessment of the evidence. If corroboration from other sources is available to the evidence of hostile witness, there is no reason why his evidence shall be rejected outright. If the evidence of the hostile witness fits in with the attending circumstances, then it may be accepted and considered along with other evidence. Siddique Munshi vs State 44 DLR (AD) 169.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>Sections 154 &amp; 142</strong>—Court may in its discretion permit a party to put questions to its witness which are usually put in crossexamination by the adverse party. Babul vs State 50 DLR 490.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 154 &amp; 155</strong>—The evidence of a witness is not to be rejected either in whole or in part simply because of being cross-examined by the party calling him, but the whole of the evidence as far as it affects both parties, favourable or unfavourable, must be taken into account and assessed like any other evidence. Amir Hossain Dhali vs State 49 DLR 163.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 154 &amp; 155</strong>—Evidence by eyewitness—Vital omission in FIR and statement to the Investigation Officer make their substantive evidence unreliable. Babor Ali Molla vs State 44 DLR (AD) 10.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 155</strong>—Contradictory statement as to the presence of convict Captain Kismat Hashem at Road No. 32 in the house of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman casts a great doubt. State vs Lieutenant Colonel Syed Farook Rahman 53 DLR 287.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 155</strong>—The prosecution witnesses having not been declared hostile their evidence cannot be discarded only because they are favourable to the accused. State vs MM Rafiqul Hyder 45 DLR (AD) 13.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 156</strong>—The testimony of the victim of sexual assault is vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate looking for corroboration of her statement, the Court should find no difficulty in acting on the testimony of a victim of sex crime alone to convict an accused where her testimony inspires confidence and is found to be reliable.<br/>One must remain alive to the fact that in a case of rape no self respecting woman especially a college girl would come forward in a Court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour and dignity such as involved in the commission of rape upon her. The Court must not cling to fossil formula and insist a corroborative testimony, even if, taken as a whole the case spoken to by victims of sex crimes strikes a judicial mind as probable Judicial response to Human Rights cannot be blunted by legal bigotry. AlAmin vs State 51 DLR 154.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 157</strong>—Absence of corroborative evidence does not necessarily mean lack of legal evidence, Ayub Ali vs Abdul Khaleque 56 DLR 489.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 157—</strong>Previous statement, use of— The statement of a witness made under section 164 CrPC is meant for binding him down to the statement made during investigation. The defence may use it to contradict the witness, whereas the prosecution may use it to corroborate him when he gives evidence in Court (Per Shahabuddin Ahmed CJ concurred by MR Rahman &amp; ATM Afzal JJ).

The allegation which has been made as to the use of explosive substance only related to throwing of cocktail or petrol bomb, which is also lump allegation, which admittedly could not cause any fire or explosion of such a nature that endangered life or property. Even if it is taken that the convict/appellants threw cocktail or petrol bomb that does not come under the mischief of section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act 1908. <em>Zamir Alil (Md) vs State 59 DLR 433.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—To constitute offence under the aforesaid sections of law possession and control must mean conscious possession and actual control with necessary mens rea.

There will be anomaly and multiplicity of proceedings if, in spite of the establishment of Family Courts, the Magistrate continues to entertain cases for maintenance. Provisions made in the Family Courts Ordinance have ousted the jurisdiction of the Magistrates to entertain application for maintenance which is a Family Court matter. Md Abdul Khaleque vs Selina Begum, 42 DLR 450.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 3, 5 &amp; 4</strong>—Family Courts Ordinance applies to all citizens irrespective of religion. Pochon Rikssi Das vs Khuku Rani Dasi 50 DLR 47.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 4</strong>—The Family Courts Ordinance has not taken away any personal right of any litigant of any faith. It has just provided the forum for the enforcement of some of the rights as is evident from section 4 of the Ordinance.

Saleha Begum vs Kamal Hossain 50 DLR 180.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—If any agreement or assurance is reached between the parties that cannot debar the Court from deciding as to where the “welfare” and the “benefit” of the minors lie.

The High Court Division was therefore wrong in denying past maintenance to the appellant on the ground of lack of prior agreement. Jamila Khatun vs Rustom Ali 48 DLR (AD) 110.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Section 5 of the Ordinance of 1985 only means that if there are provisions in the Ordinance which are different from or are in conflict with the provisions of any other law then the provisions of the said Ordinance will prevail. Section 5 does not debar the application of Limitation Act to suit filed under the Ordinance of 1985. The fact that the Ordinance of 1985 speaks of “Suit”, “plaint”, “Written statement”, “decree” etc. clearly attracts the Limitation Act under section 29(2) thereof. Jamila Khatun vs Ruslom Ali 48 DLR (AD) 110.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Residuary Article 102 of the First Schedule, providing for a period of limitation of 6 years from the time when the right to sue accrues in respect of a suit for which no period of limitation is provided elsewhere in the First Schedule will be applicable to a suit for maintenance under Ordinance of 1985.

Jamila Khatun vs Rustom Ali 48 DLR (AD) 110.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Children in easy circumstances under Mohammadan Law are bound to maintain their poor parents, although the latter may be able to earn something for themselves. These poor parents may also file a suit in Family Court for maintenance from their opulent children. Similarly, poor or disabled relatives, even servants of the wife can maintain a suit for maintenance under the Ordinance of 1985 under circumstances enjoined by Mohammadan Law. Jam ha Khatun vs Rustom Ali 48 DLR (AD) 110.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Family Court has got every jurisdiction to decide as to whether the ‘kabinnama’ in question is a genuine and valid document or not and whether any marriage between the petitioner and opposite party was ever solemnized or not before it decides to grant any decree for dower and/or maintenance.

The Sessions Judge committed error of law in setting aside the order of maintenance passed by the Magistrate.<br/><br/>It can safely be presumed that our law makers while promulgating Ordinance No.XVIII of 1985 had in view the provisions of the Family Court Act of Pakistan and in spite of that the word ‘suit’ was specifically and unambiguously used in section 5 instead of the word ‘matters’ which has been used in the Pakistan law. The term ‘matters’ has wider meaning than the term suit’ and the former term definitely includes civil suits as well as criminal or quasi criminal proceedings. And in spite of that, section 20 as quoted above appearing in the Pakistan law made specific provision for vesting the judges of the family Courts which the power under section 488 CrPC. Meher Negar vs Mojibur Rahman 47 DLR 18.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 5 &amp; 24</strong>—Sections 5 and 24 of the Family Courts Ordinance are also applicable to the members of other than the Muslim community and they are entitled to avail settlement of disputes regarding maintenance, etc and the Family Court has got the exclusive jurisdiction to try those matters.

The term ‘matters’ has wider meaning than the term ‘suit’ and the former term definitely includes civil suits as well as criminal or quasi criminal proceedings. And in spite of that, section 20 as quoted above appearing in the Pakistan law made specific provision for vesting the judges of the Family Courts which the power under section 488 CrPC. <em>Meher Negar vs Mojibur Rahman 47 DLR 18.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 24</strong>—Since the procedure under Order XLI rule 27 is a bar under section 20 of the Family Courts Ordinance in a Family Court proceeding only recourse left to the lower Appellate Court is to fall upon section 24 of the Ordinance to follow the procedure laid down in Guardians and Wards Act while deciding the question of guardianship and custody of a minor. <em>Saleha Begum vs Dilruba Begum 53 DLR 346.</em></div></div></div>

Therefore the information asked for does not conform to section 94 of the Code. The impugned order purported under section 94 of the Code and Articles 31/50 of the Anti-Corruption Manual is unauthorised and illegal as they do not confer any power to direct a person to give information.<br/><br/>The information asked for the purpose of inquiry was of a roving nature and was merely fishing for information. If we are to believe that the inquiry was in response to the information received by the anonymous letter then the wholesale information of all cases handled by the petitioner from 1393 to 20394 cannot be said to be connected with the alleged remittance of the sale proceeds of the house at Motijheel and Guishan. The asking for such wholesale information of the cases handled by him for that period appears to us to be malafide, fishing for information only to harass the petitioner. <em>Imtiazur Rahman Farooqui (Ml Farooqui) vs Bureau of Anti-Corruption 51 DLR 421.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 6</strong>—This Court is of the view that said amendment dated 9-2-2006 will have prospective effect on all cases to be filed after the amendment came into force as in the amending enactment as above no intention was expressly stated about retrospective effect of the same. Accordingly, there was no need for deposit of 50% of the amount of dishonoured cheque before filing of the concerned appeal. Impugned order of rejection of the memo of appeal being against the spirit of section 6 of General Clauses Act the same cannot be sustainable. <em>Akhter Hossain Md vs Hasmat Ali and State 60 DLR 368.</em><br/><br/><strong>Section 6(e)—</strong>If a statute deals merely with the procedure in an action, and does not affect the rights of the parties, it will be held to apply, prima facie, to all actions pending as well as future. <em>Abdul Wadud vs State 48 DLR (AD) 6.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 9</strong>—Communication of grounds of detention within 15 days— there is no specific provision in the Special Powers Act for calculation of the period—In view of section 9 of the General Clauses Act the date of detention is to be excluded while computing the period of 15 days. <em>Samirannesa vs Bangladesh 46 DLR 276.</em><br/> <br/><strong>Section 26</strong>-The statutory provisions recognise the Rule against double jeopardy and the principle of res judicata should apply to criminal proceedings in the same way as to civil proceedings but there being no conviction in the cases under reference, the principle of double jeopardy does not apply. <em>Parveen vs State 51 DLR 473.</em></div></div></div>
