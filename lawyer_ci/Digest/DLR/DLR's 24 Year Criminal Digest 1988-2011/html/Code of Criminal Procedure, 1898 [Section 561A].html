Abdul Bari vs Abul Hashem Mazumder 40 DLR 301.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Whether a proceeding under section 561A of the Criminal Procedure Code is to be quashed depends upon the facts of the case itself. Md Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Delay is by itself no ground for quashing the criminal proceeding. But machinery of justice should not be allowed to harass any innocent person. Md Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong>When a prosecution arises out of ill-motive or improper motive the machinery of administration of justice need not be available to such person. Reason of delay in lodging FIR is unconvincing. Md Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>The informant’s plea that he could not lodge FIR due to alleged lawlessness even after 1975 although there was constitutional government for over 4 years except a Martial Law Government for a brief period is unacceptable. The proceedings are quashed. Md Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Mere delay in lodging a complaint is not a ground for quashing a proceeding. There may be circumstances in which lodging of FIR as to commission of an offence may be delayed. Md Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Explanation for delay in lodging FIR was given, i.e. fear of life from very influential persons. Md Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Delay raises doubt about the truth of allegation. Md Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Principles upon which exercise of extraordinary powers under section 561A CrPC is made have been stated. Md Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Facts of the instant case do not bring it within the ambit of exceptional circumstances in which the extraordinary power of the Court may be exercised. Md. Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—A timely GD entry of course strengthens the allegation made in the complaint and its absence may create doubt about it; but doubt in the allegation is a matter to be considered at the trial only. Md Shamsuddin vs State 40 DLR (AD) 69.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Despite earlier order of rejection of the prayer for quashment of the proceeding, the subsequent application will not operate as a bar for exercising the inherent jurisdiction under section 561A CrPC. AKMM Saleh vs State 45 DLR 386.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—On the death of principal offender possibility of proving the guilt of the abettor becomes bleak. AKMM Saleh vs State 45 DLR 386.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 561A</strong>—If the trial Court fails to perform its duly in respect of framing of charge and the charge is framed on insufficient materials High Court Division can investigate whether the charge is groundless. AKMM Saleh vs State 45 DLR 386.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Cognizance taken and trial held in this case being without jurisdiction, the court may exercise its inherent jurisdiction under section 561A CrPC to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court. Khalilur Rahman vs State 41 DLR 385.<br/><br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—View of the Additional judge not so perverse as to merit interference. Moslemuddin Dhali vs Helaluddin Dhali 41 DLR 120.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The fact that the accused were tried and found guilty and then unsuccessfully filed an appeal and a revisional application cannot be a ground, in the facts of the present case (i.e. absence of any legal evidence), for refusing to exercise the Court’s inherent power to secure the ends of justice by way of setting aside their conviction. Mofuzzal Hossain Mollah vs State 45 DLR (AD) 175.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Quashing of criminal proceeding—The sword of prosecution hanging over the head of accused -petitioners for nearly 10 years without any fault on their part and they are suffering economically, mentally and socially—It is a sheer abuse of the process of the Court and for that reason the proceeding is to be quashed in respect of them. Md Mosharraf Hossain vs State 42 DLR 213.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—In a proceeding under this provision the court should not be drawn in an enquiry as to the truth or otherwise of the facts which are not in the prosecution case. HM Ershad vs State 45 DLR (AD) 48.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Mere plea of right of private defence cannot be a ground for quashing the criminal proceeding, for such plea is to be established by the accused who takes it. A criminal proceeding is liable to be quashed only if the facts alleged in the First Information Report of complaint petition, even if admitted, do not constitute any criminal offence or the proceeding is barred by any provision of law. Where disputed facts are involved, evidence will be necessary to determine the issue. The appellants have produced an order of temporary injunction against the complainant’s party. This must be considered along with other evidence during the trial. Their application for quashing the proceedings is found to have been rightly refused by the High Court Division. SM Khalilur Rahman vs State 42 DLR (AD) 62.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Quashing of proceedings for alleged breach of trust and cheating: Money claims, not the outcome of a particular transaction but arose after year-end accounting following regular business between the parties. If on settlement of accounts at the end of a period some money falls due to one party from the other party and the other party fails to pay the dues, such liability cannot be termed criminal liability. Allegation that dues were allowed to accrue dishonestly, neither attract an offence under section 420 nor under section 406 or under any other section. The whole allegation in complaint petition, even if true, cannot form basis of any criminal proceeding. The proceedings are quashed. Syed Ali Mir vs Syed 0mar Ali 42 DLR (AD) 240.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The accused cannot challenge the entire criminal proceeding at a stage when the case is ripe for trial following framing of charge. When he has taken a specific defence against the charge on the basis of a GD entry he has to establish the same. The charge under section 420 Penal Code is upheld. Shafiuddin Khan vs State 45 DLR 102.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Questions whether the occurrence was accidental and whether the petitioner had intention to commit mischief to the complainant needs evaluation of evidence to be led by the prosecution which cannot be stifled by exercising power for quashment. When allegations create both civil and criminal liabilities it is for the complainant to choose any or both of the forums for redress of grievance. Tofazzal Hossain Chowdhury vs Mir Amanullah 45 DLR 263.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Stay of proceeding—In the facts of the case as in point of time the civil suit was instituted before the filing of the FIR and the questioned documents in their originals are yet to be produced and examined by the civil Court. The criminal proceeding where the documents are claimed as forged, may, in the interest of justice, be stayed till the disposal of the civil suit. Zakir Hossain vs State 43 DLR (AD) 102.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>lt has been asserted that the FIR itself was lodged by the complainant after receiving an order from the Home Ministry and not on his own. A prosecution cannot be quashed just because it was initiated at the instance of the Home Ministry. The question of possession can only be decided on evidence and not on submission on law as to what constitutes possession. The question whether the proceeding should be quashed or not should be decided on facts alleged in the FIR and charge-sheet. The accused’s general denial that the facts disclosed in the FIR are not true will not do. To succeed, the accused must show that the facts alleged by the prosecution do not constitute any offence or that the prosecution is otherwise barred by law. Hussain Mohammad Ershad vs State 43 DLR (AD) 50.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Quashing of proceeding— Court will be loath to stifle a prosecution at the initial stage unless facts are such as would attract inference that even upon admitted facts no case can be made out and continuation of the proceeding would be an abuse of the process of the Court. Al-haj Md Serajuddowlah vs State 43 DLR (AD) 198.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Quashing of proceedings — Whether the untrue statement of the accused regarding his imported goods on which he has been prosecuted under the Customs Act is intentional or unintentional, bonafide mistake or a case of absence of knowledge is for the trial Court to decide on the basis of evidence that would be adduced—if the pending proceeding is stopped at this stage it would amount to stifling the proceeding in Limine. Atiqur Rahman vs AKM Fazlul Haque 43 DLR 49.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Indictment proceeding against a detenu—Question of its legality or otherwise at the time when it was initiated and at a subsequent time—An order of detention would be deemed to be warrant of arrest from the Court of Magistrate; if the detenu would violate the warrant he would be a fugitive from justice. His failure to comply with direction to surrender, would immediately attract the mischief of prosecution and consequent punishment. The offence would be complete on failure to surrender, subject however, to the defence of impossibility of performance which is a matter of fact to be decided on evidence. Section 7(1)(b) is a punitive provision to come into play immediately after the lapse of time for surrender. The contention that the detention order being illegal the detenu had not rightly surrendered has little substance. It is not the order of detention but it is the fact of detention itself that matters. At the time it was initiated the proceeding was not prohibited by any law nor was it taken in violation of any law. It need not therefore be quashed at the present stage. Anwar Hossain Monju vs State 43 DLR 447.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Petition of complaint contains allegations under sections 295A/298/109</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Penal Code out of which, to initiate and continue with the proceeding, compliance of the provision of section 196 CrPC in respect of offence under section 295A Penal Code is necessary but no compliance is necessary in respect of offences under sections 258/109 Penal Code. Interference by way of quashing the entire proceeding is not called for. Name of the petitioner finds mention in he petition of complaint but on a reading of he same his complicity with commission of offence could not be traced out. The proceedings as against him is liable to be quashed in terms of the principles enunciated in 28 DLR (AD) 38. Jamir Sheikh vs Md Fakir 43 DLR 417.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Right of heirs of deceased complainant to proceed with the complainant’s case—The complainant in the criminal case under section 447 claimed ownership and possession of the land in question. On his death chning the pendency of the revision case arising out of the matter his wife having stepped into his shoes so far as it relates to his properties, she is required to be brought on record to protect her interest in the land. Dr Md Abdul Baten vs Stare 43 DLR 60.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Inherent power under this section though unlimited should be exercised only in 3 cases when no other alternative remedy is generally available under the Code to make such order as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure he ends of justice. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, any interference with the impugned order of the learned Magistrate at this belated stage will<br/>not serve any of the purposes of this section, rather such interference may cause undue harassment to the opposite party and defeat the ends of justice. State vs Satya Narayan Sarada 43 DLR 529.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The decision in this case having depended on findings of facts as to whether the seized arms were recovered from the possession of the petitioner, whether the same came within the exception provided for and covered by amnesty, if any, declared by the Government, the extraordinary power to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court is not required to be exercised. HM Ershad vs State 43 DLR 150.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Allegation made in the FIR having not disclosed any offence of extortion as deemed under section 383 Penal Code, the impugned proceeding against the accused for his punishment under section 387 Penal Code is quashed. Abul Bashar vs State 44 DLR 391.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Default in delivery of share certificate—Quashing of proceeding for such default—It is not the complainant’s case that his share certificates were not made ready within time. Once the share certificates are completed and made ready within time, the liability of the accused persons ends. The law does not provide that the certificates are to be made ready for delivery to the complainant. Non-delivery of the share certificates is not an offence and the proceeding is liable to be quashed. Muhammadullah vs Makbul Ahmed 44 DLR 107.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Writ Jurisdiction and inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Division, applicability of—If there was any statutory provision of appeal and revision for setting aside the proceedings in question against the petitioner, then the question whether any equally efficacious adequate alternative remedy is available to him would act as a bar to move the High Court Division under the writ jurisdiction. Inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Division under section 56 1A CrPC cannot be said to be an alternative remedy to the Court’s writ jurisdiction. Anisul Islam Mahmood vs Bangladesh 44 DLR 1.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Inherent jurisdiction—It is not an alternative jurisdiction—Inherent jurisdiction for quashing of criminal proceedings should not be invoked where some other remedy is available. This is not an alternative jurisdiction nor an additional jurisdiction but it is a jurisdiction preserved in the interest of justice to redress grievances for which no other procedure is available or provided by the Code itself. This power cannot be so utilized as to interrupt or divert the ordinary course of criminal procedure. MM Rahmatullah vs State 44 DLR 576.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Quashing of criminal proceeding whether can be allowed under writ jurisdiction—Labour Court being a court subordinate to the High Court Division quashing of criminal case can appropriately be prayed before the criminal bench of the Court which is the efficacious remedy under the Code of Criminal Procedure. SM Shafiul Azam vs Director of Labour 44 DLR 582.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Though the inherent power of the High Court Division is undefined and unlimited but this inherent jurisdiction should not be generally and indiscriminately invoked particularly when some other remedy is available. The jurisdiction is not alternative or an additional one but it is I jurisdiction preserved in the interest of justice to redress grievances for which no other procedure is available nor has been provided in the Code itself. Engineer Afsaruddin Ahmed vs State 46 DLR 496.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Inherent jurisdiction of Court—Whether such jurisdiction is applicable in cases from which appeals are barred by limitation—Section 561A CrPC cannot be conceived to give the High Court Division jurisdiction to retrieve the cases from the moratorium after they have been barred by limitation. Then, in the memo of the appeal taken or in the submission no ground has been taken that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to try the case or that it arrived at absurd or preposterous conclusion from the evidence on record. The section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure has not given any new jurisdiction to the High Court to override other laws. It is easy to see that this Court cannot have any inherent jurisdiction to strike down the law of limitation. The law of limitation is so inexorable that a person loses his good title on account of law of limitation. It may be desirable that something is done for the redress of the accused who lost their right of appeal and has very good case in their defence, but it is for the legislature to do. Mohammad Ali vs State 46 DLR 175.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—There is nothing in precluding a criminal case on account of a ci suit pending against the petitioners on the facts. The criminal case stands for the offend while the civil suit is for realisation of money both can stand together. Khondaker Mahatab uddin Ahmed vs State 49 DLR (AD) 132.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The complainant has the option to activate prosecution of the petitioners under the Immigration Act, 1982 as well, but if the allegations contain ingredients under the Penal Code, the complainant’s case before the Magistrate cannot be stifled by quashing. Noor Jahan Begum vs State, being represented by the Deputy Commissioner 49 DLR (AD) 106.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>The Drug Control Ordinance is an additional forum for trying drug offences. Taking of cognizance and framing of charge by the Tribunal under the Special Powers Act in respect of offences relating to possession of spurious medicine, are not illegal and the prosecuting thereof are liable to be quashed. Ordinance No. VIII of 1982 has been promulgated not with a view to excluding all other trials on the same offence but as an additional forum for trying drug offences. If the same offence can be tried by a Special Tribunal under the Special Powers Act it cannot be said that the accused- petitioner has an exclusive right to be tried by a Drug Court only. As on the petitioner’s own showing he has been charged only under section 25C(d) of the Special Powers Act by the Senior Special Tribunal, we do not find any illegality in the proceedings. Ashraf Ali @ Asraf Ali vs Slate 49 DLR (AD) 107.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>It cannot be said that the Court was wrong in holding and acting on the premises that the dispute between the parties arising out of a joint stock should be settled in the civil Court and the criminal proceeding be quashed. Ansarul Haque vs Abdur Rahim 49 DLR (AD) 145.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The Sessions Judge having passed an order under section 439A CrPC setting aside finding of the Magistrate under section 145 CrPC and all remedies for the first party being exhausted, the party is competent to invoke section 561A [1984 BLD (AD) 165 ref] Soleman (Md) vs Ahbarek Khalifa 46 DLR 298.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561 A</strong>—Quashing of a proceeding can be made even at the initial stage of a case, and when facts, and circumstances demand, even at the stage when cognizance is taken by the, Magistrate in a case under the Penal Code. Mubashwir Alli vs State 46 DLR 535.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The exercise of power under this section is not totally barred against an order passed by the Sessions Judge under section 439A CrPC. It is to be seen whether the petitioner invokes this Court’s revisional jurisdiction under the garb of an , application under section 561A CrPC. If the condition of this section is fulfilled the High Court Division may exercise its power thereunder. Fatema Begum vs Gageswar Nath and State 46 DLR 651.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—When exercising jurisdiction under this section, the High Court Division will not embark upon an enquiry whether the evidence in question is reliable or not which is a function of the trial Court. Quashment of criminal proceeding before commencement of trial may amount to stifling the prosecution. Abu Bakar vs State 46 DLR 684.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 561A, 438 &amp; 439A</strong>—Reference—Since the petitioner could not make out a case of quashing of the proceedings and since no such power is vested in the Sessions Judge the impugned order refusing to make a reference to the High Court Division suffers from no illegality. Farhad Hossain vs Mainuddin Hossain Chowdhury 46 DLR 127.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—In view of the complainant’s case that he delivered goods in good faith on the accuser’s inducement of part payment and promise to pay the balance price within 3 days but subsequently betrayed, it cannot be said there is no prima facie case against him—the High Court Division rightly refused to quash the proceeding. Arifur Rahman alias Bablu vs Shantosh Kumar Sadhu 46 DLR (AD) 180.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Division would be available even to a party who had lost in revision before the Sessions Judge. In this connection this Court, however, referred to the limited scope of section 56 1A and observed that this inherent power is neither an additional power nor an alternative power of the Court, that this power is to be exercised very sparingly keeping itself within the bounds of this provision and that a revision petition cannot be brought in the camouflage of a petition under section 561A. Sher Ali vs State 46 DLR (AD) 67.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The inherent power under section 561A can be invoked at any state of the proceeding, even after conclusion of trial, if it is necessary to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. Appellant was convicted solely on the statement of a co accused who, however, did not implicate himself in the crime but shifted the blame upon others including the appellant. This Court found that there was no “confession” at all as its maker did not implicate himself in the crime and further that this statement was not corroborated by any other evidence and consequently the conviction was based on ‘no evidence’ which could be quashed by the High Court Division in exercise of its inherent power under section 561A. Sher Ali vs State 46 DLR (AD) 67.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The inherent power may be invoked independent of powers conferred by any other provisions of the Code. This power is neither appellate power, nor revisional power, nor power of review and it is to be invoked for the limited purposes.<br/>This power may be exercised to quash a proceeding or even a conviction on conclusion of a trial if the Court concerned got no jurisdiction to hold the said trial or the facts alleged against the accused do not constitute any criminal offence, or the conviction has been based on ‘no evidence’ or otherwise to secure ends of justice. Sher Ali vs State 46 DLR (AD) 67.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The decision of the judges that the application under section 561A is liable to be rejected for lack of jurisdiction is totally erroneous and it is held that the High Court Division has jurisdiction to entertain such an application but whether interference will be made in a particular case is altogether a different matter.The general principle is that the power being extraordinary its exercise also will be rarity. The “total bar” in section 43 9(4) of the Code, as spoken of by the learned Judges, is only against further revision—that is, revision under section. 439(1) of the Code and not against the Court’s inherent jurisdiction which is altogether different from any other jurisdiction under the Code. The High Court Division, on the one hand, willfully disregarded this Court’s decisions, and, on the other hand, flouted Article 111 of the Constitution. This cannot be countenanced and must be disapproved strongly. Sher Ali vs State 46 DLR (AD) 67.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Section 561A</strong>—A litigant should not be allowed to move this Court under section 561A of the Code when other remedy is available to him under the Code. Section 561A of the Code is to be taken resort to only to prevent abuse of the process of Court or to secure the ends of justice and not to allow abusing the process of the Court to stop trial of the cases for about a decade and then to get acquittal in the trial Court afterwards for want of evidence occasioned by lapse of long time. Maksudur Rahman Hilaly vs State 47 DLR 314.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—An appeal filed under section 30 of the Special Powers Act but not admitted for hearing as it was found barred by limitation can be allowed to be converted to a miscellaneous case under section 561A of the CrPC for securing the ends ofjustice. Sohail Ahmed Chowdhury vs State 47 DLR 348.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—After conversion of an appeal to an application under section 561A CrPC the application can be disposed of by the same Bench without issuing a Rule afresh—technicalities of procedure may be avoided with a view to securing the ends of justice. Sohail Ahmed Chowdhury vs State 47 DLR 348.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—This Court has inherent jurisdiction to set aside its own judgment to secure ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court under section 56lA of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Serajul Islam vs Fazlul Hoque 47 DLR 480.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—This Court in exercise of its extraordinary power of quashing cannot usurp the jurisdiction of the trial Court to receive and examine evidence adduced by the accused in his defence to exonerate him from the charge brought against him. Shyamal Chandra Das vs State 47 DLR 474.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—This section corresponds to section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure with almost similar principle. Sohail Ahmed Chowdhury vs State 47 DLR 482.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 56 lA</strong>—Inherent jurisdiction— Extent of applicability—Inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Division which is generally exercised for preventing the abuse of the process of the Court in respect of the pending proceedings can also be invoked in appropriate cases for securing the ends of justice in respect of a proceeding which has reached its finality. Sohail Ahmed Chowdhwy vs State 47 DLR 482.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Finding of guilt of accused person cannot be based merely on high probabilities but should be rested surely and firmly on the evidence and mere conjecture and hypothesis cannot take the place of proof.In the present case the non production of seized gold for which no explanation has been furnished by the prosecution, failure of the prosecution to test the seized gold by an expert are sufficient to show that the judgment and order of conviction is based on surmises and not on evidence and hence liable to be quashed. Sohail Ahmed Chowdhury vs State 47 DLR 482.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Interference of this Court in exercise of its inherent power under section 561A of the Code at the initial stage of investigation or before taking cognizance or framing of charge will be justified only when this Court finds that the allegations made in the First Information Report or petition of complaint do not constitute the offence alleged against the accused or that on the admitted facts no case can stand against the accused. Santosh Bhusan Das vs State 47 DLR<br/>519.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—That a Minister is personally interested in the case against the accused, though found to be true, by itself is not sufficient to conclude that the allegation against the accused is false. The High Court Division observed rightly that the proceeding cannot be quashed as it remains for the prosecution to establish the allegation by adducing evidence in trial. Engineer Afsaruddin Ahmed vs State 47 DLR (AD) 10.<br/><br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—In view of the unusual facts and circumstances of the case i.e. reinvestigation by the Criminal Investigation Department to be a malafide act to create cleverly a plea of alibi for a particular accused the order of the High Court Division allowing quashment need not be interfered with. Afia Khatoon vs Mobassawir Ali 47 DLR(AD) 62.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—In a rule for quashing the proceeding the Court cannot enter into the merits of the allegations. Khorshed Alam vs Azizur Rahman 48 DLR 36.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Even if accounts of the company were audited and approved by the shareholders the same cannot exonerate the persons in charge of the management of the company from facing trial on the allegation of misappropriation of the fund. Khorshed Alam vs Azizur Rahman 48 DLR 36.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Fresh trial of the petitioner for the negligence of the presiding officer concerned would be an unnecessary harassment to him and an abuse of the process of the Court. Question is whether for such negligence of the presiding officer concerned petitioner should suffer a fresh trial for no fault of his own and procedural technicalities should be allowed to prevail over the ends of justice. In this connection we like to mention that no complaint was made by the Public Prosecutor before the said Tribunal before passing of the said order that no trial was held culminating in pronouncement of judgment on 25-1-89 in open Court acquitting the accused petitioner. In the above facts and circumstances we are of the view that the petitioner should not face any fresh trial for the negligence of the presiding officer. Adhir Kumar Shaha vs State 48 DLR 87.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—In view of existing legal position owing to the enactment of sections 265C &amp; 241A CrPC an accused can prefer an application under section 56lA if he became unsuccessful in his application either under section 265C or section 241A. Otherwise his application under section 561A would be premature. Liton vs State 48 DLR 102.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Even when the seized documents placed before the Court were seized illegally the Court cannot but consider those as relevant to the matter in issue and no inherent jurisdiction of the Court could be exercised for a discussion on evidence.

Jasimuddin vs Md Humayun Kabir 48 DLR 578.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Examination of the existing materials on record taking into account the defenses that the petitioner might offer at the trial, whatever be the merit of such an exercise, is certainly rot the method of disposal of an application under section 561A moved after framing of charge in the case.<br/>After framing a charge, an application under section 561A CrPC to quash the proceedings is still available to the accused-petitioner on the ground that the allegation of facts even if true do not support the accusation or any other offence against him. The charge itself may be impugned but it is not the function of the trial Court while framing charge or the Court exercising jurisdiction under section 561A CrPC to examine the admissibility, relevance, propriety or sufficiency of materials. For, all these questions, especially in a criminal trial, are mixed questions of fact and law which cannot be resolved in an abstract manner without the facts surfacing at the trial. Moudud Ahmed vs State 48 DLR (AD) 42.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—A wide conclusion that after framing of charge no application under sections 561A CrPC lies should be read in the observation of the High Court Division—”I do not agree with the learned Counsel of the petitioner that at this stage, after framing of charge, the proceedings cannot be proceeded with”. Moudud Ahmed vs State 48 DLR (AD) 42.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—There may be cases where allegations in the First Information Report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not constitute the offence alleged, and in such cases it would be legitimate for the High Court Division to hold that it would be manifestly unjust to allow process of the criminal Court to be issued against an accused person. The High Court Division may interfere under section 561A even during Police investigation cognizable offence is disclosed and still more if no offence of any kind is disclosed because in that case the Police would have no authority to undertake an investigation. But the usual and well settled practice is that a criminal proceeding can only be quashed after cognizance has been taken and process issued thereupon subject to the fundamental principle that the power of quashing is and should be very sparingly exercised and only to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court. Syed Mohammad Hashem vs State 48 DLR (AD) 87.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—A Criminal Proceeding cannot be quashed on the basis of defence materials which are still not part of the materials for prosecution The High CourtDivision deviated from a well known norm of disposal of an application for quashing criminal proceeding by taking into account the defence version of the case. Rehela Khatun vs Abul Hassan 48 DLR (AD) 213.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—A careful reading of sections 29,463 and 464 of the Penal Code together would clearly show that a false document must have been actually made and that mere taking of a signature on a blank paper without writing anything on that paper does not make it a document. Since the complainant petitioner did not disclose the nature of the document allegedly created the allegations made do not constitute the offence under section 465 of the Penal Code and as such, the impugned proceeding is liable to be quashed.

Slate 49 DLR 16.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Rejection of writ petitions against criminal proceedings on grounds of availability of alternative remedy by way of quashing of the proceeding cannot be a bar against further writ petitions against the same criminal proceedings when the very legality of the institution of the proceedings have been challenged.

Golam Abdul Awal Sarker vs State 49 DLR 95.<br/><br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—In the circumstances that the petitioner has all along flouted summons and  warrant and never asked for bail even in the High Court Division, it is difficult to entertain his application for quashing of proceeding before he surrenders to the Court. We have also seen from the affidavit and submission that the petitioner is an old man and professor of a University suffering from ailments and is not able to go to Gopalganj. Considering the nature of the case we direct that the case may be withdrawn from the Magistrate Court Gopalganj to the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka where the petitioner must surrender and obtain bail. Dr Ahmed Sharif vs State 49 DLR 100.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Where a prima facie case of criminal offence has been clearly made out, the High Court Division in a proceeding under section 561A CrPC has little scope to scrutinise the truth or otherwise of any document or other evidence, which may be used as a defence in a criminal proceeding.

AKM Rafiqul Alam vs State 50 DLR 265.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate has avoided passing of orders on flimsy grounds and, as such, the question of approval of the District Magistrate for such permission does not arise. In such a case, the under- trial prisoner could invoke the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for ends of justice. The under trial prisoner in this case is entitled to Class I status in the jail under the provisions of Paragraph 910 of the Jail Code and the authority is directed to allow the status due to him. Major (Retd) M Khairuzzaman vs State 50 DLR 283.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Taking the allegations and the complaint as they are, without adding or subtracting anything, if no offence is made out then the High Court will be justified in quashing the proceedings.<br/>On a reading of the petition of complaint it is difficult to hold that the allegations and the complaint do not disclose any offence and the continuance of the proceeding will be a flagrant abuse of the process of the Court and the same is to be buried before trial and the inherent power which are in the nature of extraordinary power has to be passed in aid.

Azad Hossain vs State 56 DLR 602.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Admittedly, in the present case the cheque was presented to the bank after expiry of 6 months from the date of drawing of the cheque.

Iqbal Hasan Mahmood vs Bangladesh 60 DLR 88.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—If any Bangladeshi National is found in possession of Bangladesh currency notes of any amount, he cannot be taken to have committed any offence under the law of the land and the proceedings at the stage of FIR can be quashed to secure ends of justice. Ram Krishna Nath (Ram Babu) vs State 60 DLR 266.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>After rejection of the prayer for further investigation by the Tribunal, the charge-sheet is then submitted by the police in the second case accusing the accused-petitioner on the self-same occurrence is malicious, calculated to victimize and harass the accused-petitioner and further proceeding in the case will be an abuse of the process of the Court. Ram Krishna Nath (Ram Babu) vs State 60 DLR 266.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Joinder of scheduled offence and non scheduled offence in framing charge is illegal and trial on such a charge is without jurisdiction. Abdul Kader vs State 60 DLR 457.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—In the petition of complaint it has not been alleged as how and in what manner the accused-petitioner committed the offence of tampering with the meter—As such, the proceeding against him is an abuse of the process of law and liable to be quashed. Ishaque vs State 60 DLR 650.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Jurisdiction to quash—This is not a case which is barred by any law nor this a case in which the contentions of the complaint even if admitted in its entirety, no offence is disclosed. The stage of considering the evidence has also not yet reached as the recording of evidence has not even started. Faridul Alam vs State 61 DLR (AD) 93.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The power conferred under section 561A of the Code cannot be lightly exercised in order to defeat and delay the normal procedure or to bid farewell to the alleged offender against whom specific allegation is available to commit a punitive offence only on ‘hyper technical’ ground. Specific time has been fixed by the statute to be followed by the authority at every stage in order to create pressure for expeditious disposal, not to bid farewell to the offender without trial on such technical ground. Habibur Rahman Molla vs State 61 DLR 1.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The petitioner took money from the informant as loan for business purpose and, as such, in the allegation we do not find any ingredient of entrustment or that the money was taken with any specific promise or inducement. In absence of definite allegation, it cannot be held that taking of money as loan and subsequent failure or refusal by itself shall constitute criminal offence. Ayub Ali alias Mukul vs State 61 DLR 52.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561 A</strong>—Civil Liability—Since according to the petition of complaint the accused petitioner totally denied the receipt of trucks by agreement and refused to pay the outstanding installments, the question of civil liability does not arise. Defence plea—the proposition of law is now well settled that on the basis of the defence plea or materials, the criminal proceedings should not be if1ed before trial, when there is a prima-facie case for going to the trial. When trial of the case has already commenced and the complainant was examined as a witness quashing of the proceedings is not permissible. Shahida Khatun vs Zafrul Hasan 61 DLR 270.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Nor these sections put any embargo on the power of a Police Officer to make search, seizure or to arrest any person or to investigate into a case and there is also nothing in the said Ain requiring a Police Officer to obtain prior permission of the Director General of Madak Drabya Niantron Adhidaptor to investigate into a case or to search, seize and to arrest any person who has committed or is committing or is likely to commit an offence under the said Ain. Liton Bhuiyan vs State 61 DLR 277.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Out of a contract of service between the employer and employee, whatever its kind may be, if a sum of money as salary, allowance, emolument etc is due to the employee to be paid by the employer, the former has a right to get it from the latter, who owes it to the former, but this right is always a civil or statutory right to be enforceable in a Civil Court or a Labor Court or the like. In such a case, question of criminal liability does not arise at all. The facts depicted in the petition of complaint do not disclose the offence under sections 406/420/ 109 of the Penal Code or any other offence against the accused- petitioners and therefore, allowing continuation of the proceedings in the above CR case will be a sheer abuse of process of court which should be prevented for the ends of justice. Veena Khaleque vs State 61 DLR 762.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Inherent power of the High Court Division is generally exercised where no other remedy is available for obtaining justice in the cause—it should not be invoked where another remedy is available. This power has not been vested upon the High Court Division where another remedy is available. This is an extraordinary power and is exercised in extraordinary circumstances in the interest of justice. Habibur Rahman Mollah vs State 62 DLR (AD) 233.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Whether the appellant has disproportionate wealth, he has concealed his known source of income, there is mis-joinder of charges and the trial of the appellant on facts allegedly committed prior to the promulgation of Dumity Daman Commission Ain, 2004 constitute an offence under the Dumity Daman Commission Ain are disputed facts can only be decided on evidence at the trial. Habibur Rahman Mollah vs State 62 DLR (AD) 233.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The inherent power of the Court is undefined and indefinite and, as such, it must be exercised very sparingly and with great caution. Habibur Rahman Mollah vs State 62 DLR (AD) 233.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The provisions of the Code provide that the administration of criminal justice should be allowed to proceed in the usual manner without interruption. If the High Court Division interferes with the case in the midst of the trial it will have to set up a wrong precedent by which instead of the cause of justice being advanced had really been stifled. Habibur Rahman Mollah vs State 62 DLR (AD) 233.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Since the prosecution case is almost over and the appellant put his defence by cross-examining the witnesses, in view of the consistent views of the superior Courts of this sub-continent that the High Court Division which exercising its power under section 561A of the Code should not usurp the jurisdiction of the trial Court. Habibur Rahman Mollah vs State 62 DLR (AD) 233.<br/><br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—No prima face case was made out against the respondent in the first information report and the District Anti-Corruption Officer, Gazipur without examining the necessary papers of the authority (IPSA) specially bill No.4 dated 29-10-1994 lodged the first information report.<br/>During investigation by police usually the Court does not interfere under section 561 A of the Code but in the instant case is a fit case to interfere at the stage of police investigation to prevent the abuse of the process of the court and to secure the ends of justice. State vs Lailun Nahar Ekram 62 DLR (AD) 283.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Whether the notice as required to be served under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act is essentially a question of fact to be proved by adducing evidence at the time of trial, inasmuch as, there is specific assertion in the complaint petition that such a notice was, served. Sheikh Mashuk vs State 62 DLR 28.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Mere presence of an arbitration clause in the agreement does bar launching of a criminal case, if the complaint discloses a prima facie case as evident from the case reported in 2002 SCC (Cri) 129, SW Palanitkar vs State of Bihar. Sheikh Mashuk Rahman vs State 62 DLR 28.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Defence plea—Defence plea, which, as per well settled principle, is to be decided by evidence before the trial Court and not at all a ground for quashment. Barrister Mainul Hosein vs Md Ali Hossain 62 DLR 38.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Quashing of proceeding, not before cognizance is taken—A criminal case actually starts from the date of taking cognizance and issuance of the process. Before cognizance is taken, there is virtually no pending criminal proceeding in the eye of law. So a non-existent criminal proceeding cannot be subject matter of quashment. In this respect, decision of our apex Court in the case of Abdul Huque vs State reported in 60 DLR (AD) 1 may profitably be quoted. Salahuddin Ahmed vs State 62 DLR 351.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure can exercise its inherent jurisdiction for quashing a proceeding of a criminal case firstly to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order of the Code, secondly to prevent abuse of the process of the Court and lastly otherwise to secure ends of justice. M Fransis P Rojario alias Babu vs State DLR 355.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Initiation of the criminal case at the instance of the present complainant/informant without taking recourse of the res provided in Samabaya Samity Ain, is not maintainable in law. Since initiation of the case is barred by law, this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under section 561A of the Code Criminal Procedure can quash the proceeding at its initial stage before taking cognizance thereof. M Fransis P Rojario alias Babu vs State DLR 355.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong>Quashing of Proceeding— From a reading of the FIR, it appears that the informant in writing made the statement that “আমি ব্যবসা করার জন্য চুক্তি মোতাবেক মাহমুদুর রহমান ব্যবস্থাপনা পরিচালক মেসার্স রহমান এন্ড কোং”। From this statement it appears that the said transaction was made under an agreement and the narration of fact in the FIR indicates also breach of terms of the agreement had crept up from business transaction. It also appears from the FIR that considerable amount, that is about Taka 16,50,000, has already been paid by the accused-petitioner We are of the view that no criminal intention to cheat or to deceive the informant by the petitioner has been made out by the informant. The learned Advocate for the petitioner cited the decisions reported in 1999 BLD (AD) 128 = 4 BLC (AD) 167,26 DLR (SC) 17, 37 DLR 185 207, 39 DLR 214, 1992 BLD 284 = 45 DLR 660 wherein it has been decided that if from a reading of the FIR it comes up the allegations disclose civil liability then the proceeding can be quashed. The proceeding of GR Case No. 3735 of 2002 pending in the Court of learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka is quashed. Mahamudur Rahman vs Md Matiur Rahman 62 DLR 367.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Neither the Senior Special Judge, nor the Divisional Special Judge considered the facts and materials available on record.

Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury vs State 62 DLR 441.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—A Court of law cannot proceed judicially on a mere statement made by police officer to the effect that a prima facie case under certain penal provision has been proved against the accused persons, without disclosing the allegation of fact constituting the offence. Such a statement, unaccompanied by the facts constituting the said offence, which is nothing but a mere opinion of police officer concerned, cannot be in any event, the basis of any judicial action by the Court. Sajeda Chowdhury vs State 62 DLR 441.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 561A</strong>—There is no legal impediment to file a criminal case even if a civil suit is pending on the selfsame allegations provided the ingredients of the offence are present Khandaker Abul Bashar vs State 63 DLR (AD) 79.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—During investigation, a proceeding should not be stifled without allowing proper investigation into the allegation, save and except in a very rare type of cases which are found to be so preposterous that the allegations if accepted to be true in its entirety, does not constitute any offence. Habibur Rahman vs State 63 DLR 23.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—The exercise of jurisdiction will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Interference even at an initial stage may be justified where the facts are so preposterous that even on the admitted facts no case can stand against the accused and that a further prolongation of the prosecution would amount to harassment to an innocent party and abuse of the process of the Court. Sheikh Hasina vs State 63 DLR 40.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Since there is no legal bar against the initiation, framing of charge, and continuation of the proceedings and, as such, the proceedings do not amount to an abuse of the process of the Court.

The concerned Officer of the Anti-Corruption Commission most hurriedly and at the behest of the then Government lodged this FIR without any sanction from the Anti- Corruption Commission violating the mandatory provisions of Section 32 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004. Sheikh Hasina vs State 63 DLR 162.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Information——Written or oral information—Whenever any written or oral information is placed before any Officer-in-Charge of any Police Station it is his bounden duty to reduce the information into writing, in other words to record the FIR and set the information in motion forthwith and to initiate investigation. Hasura Begum vs Bangladesh DLR 195.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Police has acted with malafide intention at the behest of the then Four Parties alliance backed Government and did not hesitate to victimize eminent jurists of the country at the instance of the persons who is nothing but a busy body. We must expect specially from the higher police officers, who at least go through the laws and relevant decisions of the Apex Court of the country and must work for the interest of their real master, the people of the country. But it is unfortunate that no change has been achieved by<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Criminal proceeding can be preceded independently of the civil suit. Ka Bi Ma Iftekhar Anam vs State 63 DLR 338.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>—Even non-disclosure of the cause of action cannot be a ground for quashing the proceeding to the great prejudice of the complainant who is entitle to prove his case on evidence.

The truth or otherwise of the allegation as against the accused-petitioner in the FIR could only be decided in the trial on evidence. Bahauddin Haider vs State 63 DLR 561.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A</strong>— The cheque was issued to discharge, either in whole or in part, a legally aiforceable debt or liability. The accused petitioner had never any debt or liability to discharge. It is the husband of the accused-petitioner who had the debt or liability to discharge. The liability or debt of the husband of the accused-petitioner cannot be thrust on to the shoulder of the accused-petitioner.’ Given this scenario, if the accused-petitioner is made liable for the debt or liability of her husband, that will go against the spirit of the mandate of section 138(1) of the Act. Shahnaj Begurn vs State 63 DLR 279.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 561A &amp; 145</strong>—Though two civil suits, instituted before the drawing up of the proceeding under section 145 CrPC, are pending, the civil Court has not passed any order regulating possession of the case land, nor a decree for possession or permanent injunction has been granted.

Salahuddin vs State 51 DLR 299.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/> <strong>Sections 561A, 439A &amp; 439(4)—</strong>The Sessions Judge’s decision is not final in relation to a person who has not filed the revisional application to the Sessions Judge but has been impleaded therein as opposite party. He is free to go to any appropriate forum to challenge the Sessions Judge’s decision. But he cannot go to the High Court Division with another revisional application, as such an application—better known as second revision—is expressly barred by section 439. Though the High Court Division cannot entertain any application under section 439(1) from a decision of the Sessions Judge under section 439A, still it can interfere with the Sessions Judge’s order by invoking its inherent power for the limited purposes as set out in that, section namely, ‘to give effect to any order under the Code, orto prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure ends of justice’. Sher Ali vs State 46 DLR (AD) 67.<br/> <br/><strong>Sections 561A &amp; 439(4)-</strong>As there is nothing in the impugned order requiring to prevent abuse of the process of the Court or to secure the ends of justice, the revisional application is barred under the amended provision of section 439(4) of the CrPC.

He has also acted as an Adviser of the then Caretaker Government headed by Professor lajuddin Ahmed. Complying the notice of the Anti- Corruption Commission the petitioner submitted his wealth statement before the Anti-Corruption Commission wherefrom the commission has invented a discrepancy in his wealth statement and also other corruption committed by him during his tenure as Adviser of the Caretaker Government. He has retired from the Appellate Division at the age of 65 years and now running 70 with ailing health as appears even from his gestures. His application for bail is allowed considering the fact that he may be harassed by the vested quarters before his surrender in the trial Court. Fazlul Haque vs State, ACC 60 DLR 648.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A &amp; 439(A)—</strong>A party aggrieved by the order of discharge passed by the Magistrate can move to the superior Court against such order in which case the Superior Court may pass order to consider the materials for the prosecution but cannot direct the Magistrate to frame charge.
