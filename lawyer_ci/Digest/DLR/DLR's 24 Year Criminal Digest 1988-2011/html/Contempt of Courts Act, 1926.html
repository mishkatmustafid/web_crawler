Mainul Hosein &amp; others vs Sheikh Hasina Wazed53 DLR 138.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Per Md Abdur Rashid J (agreeing): Jurisdiction—This Division may suo moto or on the information received take cognizance of an offence of contempt. The jurisdiction is sui generis and consists of a special set of principles as stated in AIR 1954 (SC) 186 and PLD 1972 (SC) 39. Mainul Hosein vs Sheikh Hasina Wazed 53 DLR 138.<br/> <br/>Per Md Abdur Rashid J (agreeing) A contempt proceeding is quasi-criminal in nature. The contemner is entitled to benefit of doubt, and since the Court is both prosecutor and judge, rule as to proof of guilt of the contemner must be strictly observed. Mainul Hosein vs Sheikh Hasina Wazed 53 DLR 138.<br/> <br/>Per Md Abdur Rashid J (agreeing) : What could readily be read as contemptuous in 1900 or 1912 or 1936 is not so easily read now in the context of expanding rights guaranteed as fundamental to human existence under the Constitution. Mainul Hosein vs Sheikh Hasina Wazed 53 DLR 138.<br/> <br/>Per Md Abdur Rashid (agreeing) : Statements based on inaccurate assessments of situation, however grossly misreading those may be, cannot amount to contempt of court. Moreover, in the absence of mens rea, no contempt is established. Mainul Hosein vs Sheikh Hasina Wazed 53 DLR 138.<br/> <br/>Per Md Abdur Rashid J (agreeing) : It is not correct to think that the judges are above law or there is no accountability of the judges under the Constitution. The sooner it is understood the better for the whole nation. Mainul Hosein vs Sheikh Hasina Wazed 53 DLR 138.<br/> <br/>Per Md Abdur Rashid J (agreeing) : The Prime Minister of the Republic is the leader of the House of the Nation. The Parliament comprises of members, both of the ruling party as well as of the Opposition. The aggrieved members of the Parliament could have more opportunities and better scope to hold their leader to account in the Parliament for her statements. But they preferred to abdicate their constitutional privilege and submitted before the Court to punish their leader by this Division for infraction of the Constitution. Such novel step, unprecedented in the constitutional history, I am afraid, would not create any good precedent. Mainul Hosein vs Sheikh Hasina Wazed 53 DLR 138.<br/> <br/>Per Md Abdur Rashid J (agreeing) The people are equally and strongly divided like the lawyers. Such division demands serious circumspection from the judiciary. Then the reason for such division is nowhere found except in the politics. The judiciary must guard against all chances of the party politics creeping into the holy precincts of the citadel of justice lest it ultimately fell victim to politics.

The letter writer, namely MA Monir, Contemner No. 1, was a non-descript person venturing into the field of administration of justice—Contemner Nos. 2-4 offered unconditional apology to the Court which was considered adequate but were warned to be very careful in printing such offending materials written by ill-equipped, unqualified and nondescript people to interfere in matters which are not subject-matter of their concem—Contemner No. 1 is convicted.

State vs Shahidul Alam Chowdhury 51 DLR 380<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—The Magistrate having appeared to have violated the order of the Court through misreading of the order and there being no mens rea in the violation, he need not be asked to show cause as to why he should not be held guilty of contempt of the Court. Abdul Jabbar vs State 44 DLR 21.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—Contempt by judicial officer— Unqualified apology—After considering the background of the ease and the power to punish a person for contempt in extreme necessity, only to keep the flow of administration smooth and undisturbed, Court does not accept the apology but considers this as a mitigating factor and, instead of sentencing him to imprisonment, the Court is inclined to take a lenient view in the matter of sentence. The contemner Assistant Judge is accordingly let off with an admonition only. Ayub Ali Mohaldar vs Md Shahjahan 44 DLR 101.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—Contempt—Limits of the press— Freedom of the press is recognised in our Constitution—a Court is to suffer criticism made against it. Only in exceptional cases of bad faith or ill motive it will resort to law of contempt. Saleem UlJah vs State 44 DLR (AD) 309.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—Nabbing of contemner—It is not possible for a Court to take note of all kinds of contemptuous utterances made in the press or in public gatherings. As an officer of the Court the counsel may bring any matter to the notice of the Court that may call for action. Saleem Ullah vs State 44 DLR (AD) 309.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>-Contempt by Court reporter— The responsibility of a reporter who is also a practising advocate will be a little more onerous than one who acts as a mere journalist.

State vs Joynal Abedin 43 DLR 261.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—The Sessions Judge or any other judicial officer shall not act merely as a post box to send each and every application to this Court even if he finds no ground to send the same for taking action under the Contempt of Courts Act. Anwarul Hoque vs Golam Mahmud and Md lvlohsin 5! DLR 242.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—The Sessions Judge had no authority to accept the apology tendered by the contemner. Anwarul Hoque vs Golam Mahmud and Md Mohsin 51 DLR 242.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—If editors, printers &amp; publishers publish news or comments even by anonymous author to malign and scandalise this Court hands of this Court are long enough to catch and punish them. Shahidul Islam vs Mahbubul Alam 51 DLR 485.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—If any presiding officer of any subordinate Court fails to comply with any order or direction of this Court made in any case then such officer is not only guilty of contempt of this Court but also of insubordination. State vs Farooq Ahmed, Subordinate Judge 51 DLR 515.<br/> <br/><strong> Section 2</strong>—No member of the Legislature should be questioned or penalised by any Court for anything said within its four walls.

Subbatara Begum vs Ansaruddin, Officer-in-Charge 50 DLR 339.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—The explanation that the contemner’s Advocate submitted that the Special Tribunal can dispose of the matter, since the contemner was tendering unconditional apology, cannot be accepted in view of the fact that he is a Divisional and Sessions Judge. Subbatara Begum vs Ansaruddin, Officer-in-Charge 50 DLR 339.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—Failure to obey any process of the Court, when other methods of enforcing the process are available, does not amount to a contempt of Court. In view of the decisions in the case of Bahawal Bhaloo, 14 DLR (SC) 273 and Dr MO Ohani vs Dr ANM Mahmood, 18 DLR (SC) 463 the present application filed by the plaintiff- petitioners under the Contempt of Court Act, 1926 (Act XII of 1926) has no substance. There is no reason for this Court to hold that the opposite parties deliberately flouted the order of the Court. Abu Taiyab Miah vs Nurun Nabi Miah 46 DLR 561.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—The later portion of his explanation shows that the contemner has realised his mistake and admitted his fault.

The sentence imposed upon him for contempt of Court is set aside. He is however censured for objectionable remarks and warned to be careful in future. Abdul Haque vs District Judgeship 51 DLR (AD) 15.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—This case should serve as a reminder to all concerned that the Court will not hesitate to deal with member of the subordinate judiciary if he is not cautious, restrained, respectful and deferential with regard to the highest judiciary. We highly disapprove of the manner and the language with which the offending Article was written and warn the author that any repetition of the same will be visited with punishment of even a greater scale, not to be condoned on any plea whatsoever. With these observations the appeal is allowed. The conviction of the appellant for Contempt of Court and the sentence passed thereunder by the High Court Division are set aside. Ashok Kumar Karmaker vs State 51 DLR (AD) 235.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—The contemner being the Managing Director of Bangladesh Shipping Corporation and now Comptroller General of Defence showed total disrespect to the judgment and decree of the Courts and did not offer any expression of sorrow, repentance, remorse or apology for his failure to act on the orders of the Court.

Raqibuddin Ahmed vs SAM Iqbal 50 DLR 209.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—In a case where no execution case is filed, the contempt petition avoiding such proceeding based on the ground of inaction on the part of the Government Officers and the defendant is misconceived. Rafiqul Alam vs Bangladesh 50 DLR 628.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—Where the writing’ cdntains scandalous’ language to bring the Court into disrespect and castigates its’‘dignity, its majesty and challenges its authority specially when the writer has knowledge about the contempt law and working of Courts of law he commits contempt of Court. We really do not need spineless men as Judges. These remarks certainly render the Judges contemptible in the eyes of the general public and undoubtedly casts aspersions on the courage and ability of the Judges and by no stretch of imagination can it be said that it is not written for scandalising the Judges or his authority and dOes not amount to contempt of Court. The atticle was written malafide in a tone to undermine ibe judiciary and it’tends to ‘breed conflict between the two organs of the state—the legislature and the judiciary. Judges of the High Court Division vs Ashok Kumar Karmaker 48 DLR 179.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—Where the writings published are proved to be that of the particular writer a lenient view may be taken in case of the ditor, the printer and the Publisher for such news item or the article.

State vs Chief Editor Manabjamin 57 DLR 359.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—’Apology’ is an act of contrition but the apology in the facts and circumstances of the instant case, not being a bonafide repentant one of a penitent heart and being devoid of remorse, Court finds no reason to differ with the finding of the High Court Division regarding acceptance of the unqualified apology either to exonerate the contemner or to modify the impugned sentence. Shahudul Haque, IG Police vs State 58 DLR (AD) 15.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 2</strong>—They thoigb tendered unconditional apology but dd not, by themselves, promise never again to repeat the forbidden acts and it was devoid of remorse. The contemners, by questioning/casting doubt about the flag of the Supreme Court and the Judge concerned carrying the flag on his car undermined the authority of the Supreme Court. Shahudul Haque, IG Police vs State 58 DLR (AD) 150.<br/><br/><strong>Section 2—</strong>Counsel for the appellant submitted not for exonerating them o the charges but for censuring them for the offence.

We feel that mentioning of the name of sitting Judge, Mr Abdur Rouf, in the statement is without any motive to lower down the honour, dignity, prestige and neutrality of the Supreme Court. Dr Ahmed Hussain, Senior Advocate vs Shamsul Huq Chowdhury Senior Advocate 48 DLR 155.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 3</strong>—Contempt proceeding—There being no specific denial of the incident stated in the petition for Contempt of Court, High Court Division correctly found the appellants guilty of contempt of Court. Power of a High Court to institute a contempt proceeding is a special jurisdiction which is inherent in all Courts of record and the High Court Division can deal with it summarily and adopt its own procedure. Normally contempt proceedings are disposed of by affidavits and counter affidavits. Question of taking evidence would have arisen if the petitioners specifically denied the statements made in the petition for drawing up a proceeding for contempt.

But in the instant case, after the expiry of 60 days period, the Government has decided not to accord sanction intimating that the Government has decided not to accord any sanction in order to proceed with the case; In view of the provision of section 6(5) of the Act meanwhile for failure of the authority to intimate within 60 days of the letter seeking for sanction it will be deemed that sanction was duly accorded after the expiry of the period of 60 days when the sanction was sought for and in view of the provision of law any subsequent letter refusing to accord sanction was of no legal consequence.<br/><br/>This determining clause shall prevail in respect of the proceeding with the trial of the case and that the subsequent letter of the Government replying to the letter refusiiig to accord sanction was of no legal consequence and consequently, the proceeding shall continue in accordance with law as if the sanction to prosecute has been obtained against the accused and the subsequent refusing to accord sanction and consequently not to proceed with the case against the accused was of no legal consequence. Malek Hussain Pir vs Begum Nurjahan Khanum 62 DLR (AD) 285.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 10</strong>—The High Court Division has correctly followed the observations made by this Division in Criminal Appeal No. 6 of 2008 in granting bail to the respondent No.1.
