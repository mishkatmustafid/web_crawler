Section 5 does not debar the application of Limitation Act to suit filed under the Ordinance of 1985. The fact that the Ordinance of 1985 speaks of “Suit”, “plaint”, “Written statement”, “decree” etc. clearly attracts the Limitation Act under section 29(2) thereof. Jamila Khatun vs Ruslom Ali 48 DLR (AD) 110.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 5</strong>—Residuary Article 102 of the First Schedule, providing for a period of limitation of 6 years from the time when the right to sue accrues in respect of a suit for which no period of limitation is provided elsewhere in the First Schedule will be applicable to a suit for maintenance under Ordinance of 1985.
