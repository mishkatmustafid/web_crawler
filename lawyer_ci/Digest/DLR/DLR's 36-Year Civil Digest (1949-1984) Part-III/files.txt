A mortgage executed by the judgment-debtor after the decree and before the sale is therefore affected by us pendens. The fact that in a suit for maintenance by a Hindu widow a charge is claimed over all the family properties which are specified in the plaint would not make any difference in the application of the doctrine, if the properties are sufficiently designated so as to make them directly and substantially the subject-matter of the litigation. <em>1935 M. 867—69 M.LJ. 447</em>.

It only provides for a procedure by which certain facts may be held to be conclusively proved as against the party which offers to be bound by the oath administered under the Act. But we cannot subscribe to the view that where a decree follows in respect of the whole or part of the subject—matter of a Suit on the basis of a statement made by a party, or a witness, on oath, in pursuance of the agreement of the parties to the suit, the decree should be regarded as a consent decree. But if the intention of the parties is not to obtain a decision of the whole or part of the subject—matter of the suit , but is only confined to finding a short cut for the proof of some or facts in controversy by means of a statement on oath, no decree can immediately follow such oath and the question of determining the nature of the decree in such a case does not really arise.</p><p><em>Lal Vs.

If a person deriving benefit under the deed stands towards her in fiduciary character or in some relation of personal confidence, then the Court is to act with greater caution and in ordinary circumstances must presume confidence put and influence exerted. It is for him to bring evidence on the record to show that the lady executing the document was free from all undue influence, and when she executed it, she understood the terms of it quite intelligently and nothing was concealed from her. Generally it is prudent, although the rule is not rigid or inelastic that a woman of the description mentioned above before she disposes of her property to her disadvantage, is given an opportunity to seek independent advice given by a person, who has no interest in the party acting or in the property proposed to be disposed of. It, however, all depends upon the circumstances of the individual case, whether such an advice was necessary or not, and what kind of advice was needed. In cases where the transfer is gratuitous and in favor of a person, who stands towards a woman in fiduciary character or in some relation of personal confidence, the presumption will be still strong against the validity of the deed.

Relief may be granted in the execution proceeding.</strong></p><p>Relief under section 4 of the Partition Act may be granted in the execution proceeding in a partition suit. Its provision shows that the time for granting relief is co-extensive with the partition proceeding which commences with institution of the Suit and terminates with the delivery of possession. PLR (Dac.) 844.</p><p> </p><p>There is no reason to limit the operation of the section up to the stage of the final decree nor is there anything to limit the word “Court” to the Thai court and the appellate court only and not to include the executing court.

Such order is deemed to be a decree under section 8 of the Partition Act. 1 PLR (Dac) 844.</p><p> </p><p>This section is equally applicable to a suit brought by a co-sharer and not only when a suit under the section is brought by a 3<sup>rd</sup> party purchaser.</p><p>Section 4 of the Partition Act will apply not only when a suit is brought by a stranger — purchaser for partition of a dwelling house but also in a case instituted by any other co-sharer, because in a suit for partition all the parties are in the capacity of plaintiffs.</p><p>When a partition suit is instituted every co sharer, will be entitled to have a share in the joint properties and will be in a position to proceed with the suit.</p><p>The criterion to decide whether section 4 of the Act will apply or not will be whether a stranger-purchaser is going to have a share in the dwelling house belonging to an undivided family.</p><p><em>Md.

This object would be frustrated if a stranger—purchaser forces himself into the dwelling house of an undivided family, drives the other co—owners to file a suit as plaintiffs, and then figuring as a defendant is allowed to defeat the claim for pre-emption under sec. 4 of the Act on a narrow and literal interpretation of the section. In a suit for partition, the parties to the suit arc in the position of the counter—claimants, and it can very well be predicated of a defendant in a suit for partition that he is suing for partition.</p><p>The language of section 4 does not militate against the view that the object of the Legislature being to prevent intrusion by strangers to the dwelling—house of an undivided family, the terms of section 4 should be liberally construed.</p><p><em>Bhaba Kanta Joddar Vs. Satish Ch. Mandal, (1960) 12 DLR 649.</em></p><p> </p><p>A stranger-purchaser of a dwelling-house of an undivided family is not entitled to get joint possession or other common or part enjoyment of the house.

Its simple object was to prevent intrusion into the dwelling house of an undivided family by strangers on the basis of purchase of some share in such dwelling house.</p><p><em>Md. Habibullah Vs. Mvi.

Partition is, therefore, necessary for giving possession to the plaintiff— mortgagee.</p><p>Suit for partition is maintainable at the instance of the usufructuary mortgagee whether he is in actual possession or out of possession of the mortgaged land, provided the mortgagor is a party to the Suit and the suit is necessary for giving effect to the mortgage.</p><p>In case the mortgagee be not in actual possession of the mortgaged land it would be necessary to pray not only for partition but also for khas possession of the share allotted to him on ejectmcnt of other co-sharers from that portion.</p><p><em>Md.

If it is a simple consolidation of two suits, i.e., there is no effect on jurisdictional value. If the view is taken that the defendant who has prayed for a partition of his share should also be regarded as plaintiff in the suit then the jurisdictional value would be the total of the values of the shares of the plaintiff and of those defendants who claim to have their shares separated.</p><p><em>Ajiruddin Mondal vs. Rahman Fakir (1961) 13 DLR (SC) 191.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Plaintiff out of possession—Claim amounts to asking for two reliefs.</strong></p><p>When the plaintiff is out of possession of joint property the grant to him of separate possession of his partitioned share amounts really to two reliefs.

True, but it does not follow that, of necessity, there must be another co-sharer in existence with regard to the aforesaid 2 decimals of land which appears to be a surplus on actual measurement of land as claimed by the parties.</p><p>In this view of the matter there is no substance in the argument that the prayer for partition is incompetent without impleading a co-sharer whose existence has not been proved and who may not exist at all.</p><p><em>Bazlur Rahman vs. Mahmudur Rahman Bhuiyan (1967)19 DLR 344.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Partition suit remained pending till the passing of the final decree.</strong></p><p>The judgment does not clearly lay down the shares of the respective parties and also about the allotment of saham.

But their dispossession will not disentitle them to recover possession on payment of ad—valorem court—fee. The suit is not barred by limitation as the suit has been filed within one year of attainment of majority by plaintiff no.1. He is entitled to file the suit within three years from attainment of his majority as laid down in section 6 of the Limitation Act.

That by itself cannot make this adventure as of partnership and will not make the relationship of the parties as that of partners. According to section 6 of the Partnership Act in determining whether a group of persons is or is not a firm, or whether a person is or is not a partner in a firm, regard shall be had to the real relation between the parties; as shown by all persons. Holding a joint or common interest in that property does not of itself make persons partners. Thus, in the absence of any allegation of the respondent that the lease was obtained by them as partners or that the land in dispute was to be cultivated in order to carry on a partnership business, and further in the absence of any case of the appellant that the lease was obtained in partnership and the parties were carrying on any partnership business, it is difficult to appreciate how the question of partnership can arise in the present case.

No limitation, however, is placed on the power conferred by section 32 of the Act, on a partner to retire from the partnership, by agreement with the other partners, but this does not mean that such an agreement between them can override any other provisions of the Partnership Act, specially those of section 44, which permit a Court to dissolve a firm under certain conditions. Sections 32 and 44 of the Act being both independent provisions of law, one cannot override the other and hence, the argument that an agreement entered into between the partners permitting one of them to retire, would take away the power of the Court to dissolve such a partnership under section 44 of the Act, has no force.</p><p><em>Muhammad Yaseen Vs.

In other words, Pakistani citizen has no legal right, much less Constitutional right, to be issued a passport.</p><p><em>Manzoor Khan vs. Government of Pakistan, PLD 1966 (W.P) Peshawar 29 (D.B.)

On a direction by the Appellate Court to Trial Court (which dismissed the applicant’s cast,) for giving opportunity to the applicant to get the abatement set aside, the applicant made an application on 26.8.61 for treating the application made on 9.8.58 as one under Order 22, r. 9, C.P.Code for setting aside the abatement consequent on the death of the opposite party No.1. The Court granted the prayer and set aside the abatement of the case but on appeal, the High Court held that the application filed on 9.8.58 could not be treated as one made under Order 22, r. 9, of the Code. On appeal by special leave to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, it has been held: It is true that there was no prayer for setting aside abatement in the application filed on 9.8.58 and there could not be any such prayer in the said petition since the death of opposite party No. I was shown as within time. But in the application filed on 26.8.61 the appellant stated:</p><p>“Before the date of 9.8.58, this petitioner was not aware of the death. Therefore, this petitioner is entitled to get extension under section 5 of the Limitation Act.”</p><p>And thereafter made the following prayer: “The application filed on 9.8.58 by this petitioner for the substitution of the heirs may be treated as an application under Order 22, r. 9 C.P.C.</p><p>Technically it can be said that the petition filed on 9.8.58 cannot be treated as an application for setting aside abatement since there was no such prayer in the said petition. But when the applicant for setting aside abatement filed a petition on 26.8.61 stating that he had no knowledge of the death earlier and is entitled to get extension under section 5 of the Limitation Act and the learned Munsif, for ends of justice, treated the petition as a proper one for disposal of the issue and disposed it accordingly.</p><p>The technicality of form, if adhered to, as the High Court took to be so, and then there would be no proper dispensation of justice in the facts and circumstances of the case. The substance of the prayer should be looked into taking an overall view of the facts and circumstances of the case, ignoring the mere technicality of form of the petition, and it is not desired that the technicality of form should prevail causing impediment of dispensation of justice.</p><p><em>Abdul Hamid Kazi Vs. Abdul Jabbar (1974) 26 DLR (SC) 68.</em></p><p>—When an order has taken effect and in pursuance of that order certain right has been created in favor of any person that order cannot be withdrawn or rescinded to the detriment of that person.</p><p>When a right has accrued to a person by virtue of an order that order cannot be rescinded by the person who made it. Again, when it is not incumbent upon the Government to punish a 3overnment servant merely because he has been convicted by a court a fresh order of punishment after the petitioner will be reinstated is wholly un-warrantal.</p><p><em>A.H.M.

In their anxiety they even forgot the law that the authority requisitioning or acquiring any property, under the compulsive power of the act, must indicate definitely what part of the land is required by them.</p><p><em>Chandi Kaibarta Das Vs.

If such rent cannot be ascertained, then he has to determine approximately the rent, at which in reasonable probability the premises were let out in December, 1941. In trying to arrive at a reasonably payable rent he should ascertain rent of similar premises in that locality in 1941.</p><p align="justify">The Municipal assessment by itself cannot be taken as a correct index for fixing basic rent.

In such a case, he may fix a standard rent at such amount as, having regard to the provisions of the Act and the circumstances of the case, he deems just. Bearing in mind the proviso to the definition of “standard rent”, the result might be that in a case of the present kind the “standard rent” is any rent which the Controller might think to be just in his uncontrolled discretion.

Mahim Chandra (1962) 14 DLR 213.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>S. 4:</strong> <strong>Certificate against dead person void and also the sale there under—</strong>A certificate was issued in the name of one Jagadish Chandra Ganguly by the Certificate Officer of Mymensingh and was transferred to the Certificate Officer of Dacca for execution. The Certificate debtor was in fact one Jagadish Chandra Banarjee. It is admitted that Jagadish Chandra Banarjee died in 1946 and the certificate was filed in 1956. After receipt of the peon’s report the Certificate Officer of Dacca substituted the heirs of Jagadish Chandra Binarjee and the sale was held.</p><p><strong>Held:</strong> The certificate issued is void having been issued against a dead person. The Certificate Officer of Dacca could only return the certificate to the Certificate Officer of Mymensingh for necessary correction. As this has not been done in the present case not only sale but also the certificate proceedings pursuant to which the sale is made is absolutely void.</p><p><em>Yar Ahmad Vs.

The holding was again sold in execution of a rent decree and was purchased by the plaintiff, the defendants not being made parties to the rent suit or the execution proceeding. An application by the defendants for setting aside the sale under sec. 174 of the Bengal Tenancy Act was dismissed on the ground that they had no interest and, therefore, no locus standi. The plaintiff then attempted to take possession of the land but was resisted by the defendants. Hence the present suit for declaration of title and possession.</p><p><strong>Held</strong>: The plaintiff not being made a party in the Certificate sale or suit sale, his title in the land remains intact and went to the benefit of the defendants under he compromise decree. Even if it be conceded that the plaintiff had no title at the time of the compromise decree, still, after subsequent acquisition of title under the rent sale, he would be estopped by the principle of ‘estoppel by the conduct” from taking such a plea and re-asserting his title to the land he previously gave to the defendants under the compromise decree.</p><p><strong>Also held</strong>: The applications under sec. 174 of the Bengal Tenancy Act was neither a suit nor a continuation of a suit, and did not operate as res judicata against the defendants and in favour of the plaintiff.

Provisions of section 7 explained: </strong>Service of notice and copy of certificate served on certificate debtor.</p><p>Section 7 says that when a certificate has been filed the Certificate Officer shall serve upon the certificate-debtor in the prescribed manner a. notice in the prescribed form. After service of the notice, when a period of 30 days has elapsed, and no objection has been taken in terms of the Act, the Certificate Officer under section 14 shall proceed with the attachment id sale, or sale without previous attachment of any property or attachment of the decree, or arrest and detention of the certificate-debtor as the case may require.</p><p>The prescribed manner is to be found in rules 2 to 9 contained in Schedule H of the Act. A reading of the rules shows that there must be an attempt to serve the notice directly on the certificate-debtor in. But there is also the alternative provisions for service, by way of substituted service, if the attempt personal service fails that is contained in Rules 6 (a) (b)</p><p><em>Golam Hafez Mia Vs. Khadem Ali Mia (1971) 23 DLR 9.</em></p><p> </p><p>—Decision in the case of Md. Muslim Ali Molla held to be wrong.</p><p>The decision in Mohammad Muslem Ali Molla’s (PLR 1957 Dac. 6) which says that rule 6(b) cannot be resorted to for service under section 7 of the Act is not correct. For substituted service of notice under section 7 of the Act, both the alternative clauses (a) and (b) of rule 6 can be resorted to, according to the facts of exact case. Ibid.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>—Consequences following from service of notice under section 7.</strong></p><p>On the service of notice under section 7 the consequences following from it are first: any private transfer of any immovable property in the district where certificate is filed is void, and secondly, the certificate dues become a charge upon the immovable property of certificate-debtor throughout the country. Ibid.</p><p>—Sections 7-10. Any variation from the prescribed form would not be fatal in a certificate issued under the Bengal Public Demands Recovery Act for realisation of certificate dues.</p><p><em>Shafiqur Rahman Vs. Certificate Officer (1977) 29 DLR (SC) 233.</em></p><p>—If no certificate is filed having the force of a decree no valid sale can be held under the certificate. Ibid.</p><p> </p><p><strong>—Requirements to comply with the provisions embodied in sections 7, 8, 9, &amp;10.</strong></p><p>It is necessary to refer to the sections mentioned above namely, 7.8, 9 and 10. By section 7 when certain public demands were in arrears, the Collector of the district was to make under his hand a certificate (in the Form 2 given in the said Act) for the amount of such arrears remaining unpaid and was to cause the same to be filed in his office. By section 8 such certificate should, as regards the remedies for enforcing the same, have the force and effect of a decree of a civil court. Under section 10 such certificate having been filed in the office of the Collector, he has to issue to the Judgment- debtors a copy of such certificate and a notice in form No. 4 as given in the Act, and such certificate from the time it was served would bind all the immovable properties of the debtor if it has been attached under section 274 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Old). Such certificate u/s 19 of the Act is to be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code as a demand for money.</p><p><em>Shafiqur Rahman Vs. Certificate Officer (1977) 29 DLR (SC) 234.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>—Ss. 7 and 36.</strong> Notice under section 7 is found as not a proper service on the certificate- debtor. What is the effect of this improper service of notice under section 7? Under section 36 it does not make the sale void but the defendant could have challenged it either in the certificate proceeding or by a suit. It appears that he did file a case to set aside the sale before the Revenue Authority but failed: But he did not pursue his remedy by a suit. Could he be allowed to challenge it collaterally in the present suit? On the plain language of section 36 of the Act he cannot.</p><p><em>Julfu Molla Vs. Noab Ali (1975)27 DLR 442 and 443.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p>—Suit to recover possession of or to set aside sale of, immovable property will lie where no notice as required by s. 7 has been served on certificate debtor.</p><p><em>Golam Hafez Vs.

But the power so vested in him is exercisable subject to the statutory exception embodied in section 9(2).

Held: No rights of ownership in the prop- city were transferred by the document to the plaintiff. It is also difficult to spell out of this agreement any exemption from accountability for the rents realised to the owner although it seems that, in consideration of the services to be rendered in recovering rents, the plaintiff was authorized to use the rent personally also. No express words were to indicate that the plaintiff would not be liable to account for everything that he had realised by way of rent to the owner.</p><p>In the circumstances it is clear that the document did not create any interest in immovable property and did not operate as an assignment of future rents.

An order in the nature of punishment is always required to be preceded by a properly constituted enquiry. The other kind of suspension is designed to facilitate the due prosecution of the enquiry. Such a temporary suspension is deemed to be an implied term in every contract of service.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;">Messrs East Exports Vs.

It must, however, be remembered that the Government servant, by reason of his suspension, does not lose his office or suffer degradation. He merely ceases to discharge the duties of his office during pendency o the departmental enquiry against him. Ho also draws a subsistence allowance during the period of suspension. In the event of his honor- able acquittal he is allowed to draw full salary for the period of suspension.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Clause 4(4)</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;"> On the other hand, if an Export or Import Registration Certificate is temporarily suspended, it may cause incalculable harm to the importer or exporter for which he cannot get any redress even if later on the order of suspension is withdrawn. If suspension continues longer it may even totally destroy his trade. It is, therefore, desirable that this summary power should be exercised very sparingly, and that too only when the urgency of the situation demands it. Even then the authority concerned should without the least possible delay inform the person concerned of the charges against him.

It has been said that enquiries revealed that identical goods were sold by the said supplier at the rate of 1.51 dollars per pound and therefore the statement of the petitioner in the declaration that he purchased the disputed consignment at the rate of 51 cents per pound was fraudulent and therefore attracted the provisions of section 167(9B) and 167(8).</p><p><strong>Held:</strong> The petitioner did not get any opportunity to controvert the materials on which reliance was placed for holding that he was guilty of untrue statement in regard to the value of the imported goods; in other words, he was denied a fair hearing.</p><p>The normal price ascertained on the basis of the prevailing price in this country at the relevant time, though sufficient for assessing the amount of customs duties, cannot furnish proof sufficient to bring home a charge of untrue statement under section 30 so as to justify conviction under section 167(9B)or prove that the invoice had been deliberately undervalued so as to bring the petitioner within the mischief of section 167(8) of the Sea Customs Act.

Rule 4 provides that the provision of Sales Tax Act, and the Sales Tax Rules will apply to the assessment and collection of rehabilitation tax in the same way as is applicable in the case of sales tax. Therefore if in the absence of a notification under section (5)(2) of the Sale Tax Act a Customs Officer could not resort to the proceedings for rectification of mistaken or escaped assessment for the levy of sales tax under section 39 of the Sea Customs Act, he could not do the same for the realization of the rehabilitation tax as well.</p><p><em>M/s.

Here obviously the claim is not admitted. And for the purpose of adjudication the owner of the goods must obtain a decree from a Court in England.

Even if the first part of section 177-A were applicable, yet the person from whose possession the goods were seized could not have been found guilty on the basis of that presumption alone. For there will be no presumption that it was he who committed an act to defraud the Government. So far as the second part of section 177- A is concerned, this too raises a presumption only as to the commission of the act to evade a prohibition or restriction and not with respect to the person who committed the act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Further the presumption under section 117-A even if it is raised with respect to a particular person is not sufficient for holding that person guilty inasmuch as an act may be committed in violation of a prohibition or restriction and yet it may not be committed “knowingly and with intent to evade” the prohibition or restriction and unless this element of “knowingly and with intent to evade” is found to exist no offence can be said to have been committed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Presumption under section 177-A which arises as to an act would not be sufficient proof of guilt as against the person in possession. And that being so the proper procedure for application of section 177-A would be that the officer who seizes the goods states the grounds of his belief in order that the reasonableness of the belief may be tested.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Pakistan Vs.

In equity jurisdiction, it has often been said that equity may treat land as money or money as land for the purpose of doing justice in the case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Joydeb Agarwala Vs.

But where (as in the present case) the agreement expressly says that the vendor undertakes to get the property duly and legally conveyed in favour of the vendee by his co-sharer the provisions of sec. 15 of the Specific Relief Act have no application.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">This circumstance makes it clear that the vendor (as in the present case) was not entering into an agreement by which he was obliging himself to convey the whole property to the plaintiff and consequently the provisions of sec Lion 15 cannot be called in aid (to the present case).</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Anwara Chowdhury Vs.

The section has no application where the defendant contracted on his behalf and on behalf of a minor and it is found that the contract is unenforceable against the minor. The object of enactment of section 15 is to provide for abatement of compensation when the title of the persons agreeing to sell or lease is defective.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The section applies only when “a party to the contract is unable to perform the whole of his part of it.” A defendant who holds himself out as the owner of the entire property and whose claim turns out not to be correct is the party to the contract who is unable to perform the whole of his part of it, because it was his duty to convey the whole property to the plaintiff. Section 15 applies to him. But when a defendant contracts on his behalf and on behalf of a minor and it is found that the contract is unenforceable against the minor then that defendant is not a party to the contract who is unable to perform the whole of his part of it.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Archana Prasad Nandi, Vs.

After Mr.’s death plaintiffs filed the present suit against the defendant to transfer the 4th share of the property on the basis of the contract with M.R.

If that be so, there is no reason why any of the several joint promises should not be entitled to obtain specific performance of a contract under clause (a) of section 23.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Part performance of contract enforceable in relation to cases under sections 15, 16 and 17 of the Specific Relief Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In view of the rigid provision of section 17 of the Specific Relief Act, specific performance of a part of contract can be obtained only in a case covered by any of the sections 14, 15 and 16 of the Specific Relief Act and not otherwise.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">All co-promises under a contract ought to be joined as plaintiffs in a suit where performance of the contract is claimed.

They are prayer for declaration only and nothing more.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The prayer (b) is nothing but the ground in support of prayer (a). As such the plaintiff is liable to pay fixed court-fee under Article 17(iii), Schedule II of Court-fees Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Court is not bound to give relief for cancellation of a document in every case under section 39 of the Specific Relief Act by canceling the document, whether there is a prayer for cancellation or not.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The language of section 39 does not make it obligatory on the Court to order the instrument to be delivered up or cancelled even if not so prayed for. A relief may be granted when it is prayed for and not otherwise.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Where illegality of the document appears on the face of it, its cancellation may not be necessary. Where a person not a party to the instrument, apprehending injury thereby sues to have it adjudged void or voidable, he is not in a position to pray for cancellation. In such cases plaintiff cannot be compelled to pray for advisories court-fee for it. Where illegality or nullity of the document is non-apparent, the danger of its use in defense is always there and in such cases cancellation and delivering up of the document is necessary and the Court may give such relief. But the relief shall have to be prayed for and unless prayed for, it cannot be granted nor can the plaintiff be forced to pray for it and pay advalorem court fee for it. A suiter has absolute authority to frame his suit as he likes; he may suffer or gain for so doing.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Daibakilal Basak Vs.

Plaintiff is to pay fixed court-fees for declarations separately in respect of several documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A document to which the plaintiff is not a party need not be cancelled and mere declaration that it is void is sufficient. Only a document which has vested efface a valid claim, needs to be challenged. A forged document does not come under this category.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">If, however, the plaintiff asks for cancellation of a forged document, though such cancellation is not needed, he must pay for it.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">If on consideration of the plaint as a whole, the Court finds that there are both prayers for declaration and cancellation is to be ordered having regard to the case made out in the plaint, fixed court-fee under Article 17(iii) Schedule If of the Court-fees Act is not sufficient.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Simply because section 39 of the Specific Relief Act contemplates that relief of cancellation can be granted by the Court, even when the plaintiff has not asked for it, it cannot be said that the plaintiff need not pay for ii. The plaintiff must pay for the relief if it is granted by the Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is not necessary to cancel a document in every case. It depends upon the facts of a case. Relief of cancellation under section 39 need not be specifically asked for in view of the language of the section. It may be granted by the Court. If such a relief has to be given, the plaintiff must pay for it and payment of fixed court-fee for mere declaration is not sufficient.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Daibakilal Basak Vs.

The discretion mentioned in the section cannot relate to adjudgment alone but also to the relief of cancellation. A discretion conferred on the Court cannot be exercised in favour of a party even though the party chooses not to ask for its exercise. It cannot be said that once an instrument is &amp; judged void the discretion of the Court for cancellation is to follow, just as the relief set out in the second paragraph is to follow an order of cancellation.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;">Daibakilal Basak Vs.

It does not expressly provide, as is done by the proviso to section 42, that an omission to pray for a further relief that might be asked for in the suit would entail its dismissal. If cancellation is not prayed for in such a suit, or having been prayed for has been refused, in a subsequent Suit for cancellation the plaintiff may be confronted with the bar under Order 2, rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or by a bar of limitation, or by some other bars. But that cannot be a reason for the Court to assume that every Suit brought under section 39 of the Specific Relief Act is to contain a prayer for cancellation, and to insist on payment of an enhanced court-fee. It I only after the trial that the Court is called upon to consider the question as to, if, in exercise of its retionary power under the section, a bare declaraurn should be granted. If the plaintiff is a party to instrument, the Court refuses as a rule to grant  a declaratory relief, on the ground that the imminent, in such a case, need be avoided by cancellation. The plaintiff in such a case is required to pray for cancellation, by way of a consequential relief. Where, however, the plaintiff is not a party to the instrument no such difficulty arises. There he is entitled to a simple declaratory relief.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Daibakilal Basak Vs.

But a person who is not a party to the deed is not bound to have it set aside or cancelled and a mere declaration that it will not affect the plaintiffs right would be quite enough. If the plaintiff is bound to have the document set aside or declared null and void the plaint must be treated as including a prayer for consequential relief; if it is not incumbent upon the plaintiff to get rid of the document the plaint must be treated as one for a declaration, pure and simple.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Abdul Hamid Vs.

In section 42 of the Specific Relief Act the expression “legal character” or “status” denotes a character or status conferred by law on an individual or a number of individuals, viewed, as a unit of society and not shared by the generality of the community but only by individuals, placed in the same category of character. The character itself must be conferred by law on person viewed from the stand point of membership of the community. It is a “status” or “character” conferred by law. It is not a creature of contract but of law. For example, a minor cannot contract into majority nor can one, who has attained majority, under law, contract himself into minority.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A declaration was sought that a personal contract subsisted between the plaintiff and the defendant. It was contended that a declaration about contractual rights could not be claimed or granted under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Held</strong> : The contention must be upheld to this extent namely, that section 42 of the Specific Relief Act does not contemplate a suit like the present. A man’s “legal character” is the same thing as a man’s status. A man’s status or legal character is constituted by the attributes which the law attaches to him in his individual and personal capacity, the distinctive mark or dress as it were, with which the law clothes him apart from the attributes which may be said to belong to normal humanity in general.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The plaintiff had claimed a declaration that he would be entitled to contribution from the defendant if and when occasion arose and it was held that such a suit was not maintainable under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Burmah Eastern Ltd.

When a specific relief is granted by preventing a party from doing that which he is under an obligation not to do, it is called preventive relief. This relief is to continue until the specific time named in die order. It is merely provisional in its nature and does not conclude a right. Its sole object is to preserve the subject in controversy without determining any question of right and to prevent further perpetration of wrong.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In order to sustain an action for the preservation of a property or a right in issue in status quo, it is not necessary to decide in favour of the plaintiff upon the merits nor it is necessary that he should present such a case as will certainly entitle him to a decree upon the final hearing; since he may be entitled to a temporary injunction although his right to the relief prayed for may ultimately fail. In other words, it would be sufficient if it be shown that he has a fair question to rise as to the existence of the right alleged.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>SN Gupta &amp; Co.

Therefore, despite the abrogation of the late Constitution and the promulgation of the Order, the order made by the Nigh Court on remand, to the effect that the acquisitions by the Government were void, being based on the law declared by the Supreme Court in Jibendra Kishore’s case, was perfectly legal and valid.

If the exceptions as to the wakf, debuttor or other religious trusts  deemed to relate only to those estates which, because of some technicality or special circumstances, had not been deemed to have been included in the omnibus notifications of 2nd April, 1966, then obviously, the executives were applying the law discriminatingly.

(This conclusion has been arrived at on the basis of the majority’s decisions in Khan Panni’s and Dosso’s cases.

Thus, the said section 87 which is a substantive law is not retrospective in operation by implication.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Province of East Pakistan Vs.

But the position of such a person with regard to the land which he has acquired on the basis of a deed of out and out sale with an agreement to reconvey, has no unique distinction providing a reasonable basis for classification for the purpose of expropriation.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Ali Ekabbar Farazi Vs.

So, if the expression out and out sale with an agreement to reconvey is construed in its ordinary and natural meaning, in consequence of insertion of the word ‘or’ in section 95A by President’s Order No. 24 of 1973, then the said provision will be discriminatory and as such violative of the fundamental right as provided in Article 27 of the Constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Ali Ekabbar Farazi</em> <em>Vs.

The legislature also prohibited a contract of Out and out sale with a clause of reconveyance and by a deeming clause had made such transaction as complete usufructuary mortgage. In other words, in Bangladesh a raiyat cannot enter into any other transaction of his raiyat holding except a complete usufructuary mortgage. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—After an enjoyment of the usufruct for a maximum period of 7 years u/s.95A the raiyat has the right to get back the property as provided in s. 95. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—Since 1928 recourse was taken of the deeming provision by the legislature and all sorts of mortgages, usufructuary mortgages, mortgages by conditional sale, anomalous mortgages have been displaced by providing that all such mortgages by a raiyat “shall be deemed to be a complete usufructuary mortgage” for which a definition was given in the Bengal Tenancy Act. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—Transaction entered into with raiyat, by way of mortgage is not governed by the Transfer of Property Act but must be deemed a complete usufructuary mortgage as defined in the Bengal Tenancy Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The High Court Division has fallen into error by construing the expression “transfer” in the context of the Transfer of Property Act. Since 1928 the Legislature wanted to take out the transaction of the raiyat from the purview of Transfer of Property Act for which specific definition was supplied, namely, “complete usufructuary mortgage” in the Bengal Tenancy Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">So far as the complete usufructuary mortgages are concerned with its meaning as given by the law there is no question of vested interest.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The High Court Division observed that the vested right of the property should not be extinguished “except in the manner as provided in the second part of Article 42(1) or 47(1)”. There is, however, no question of vested right because the complete usufructuary mortgage presupposes the restoration of land to the transferor either by redemption or by efflux of time whichever is earlier.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A transferee enjoyed the rights during these years before redemption or restoration and the transaction known in vernacular is “Khai Khalashi’ for which both the principal and interest are liquidated. Therefore, the question of vested right does not arise, nor can it be said that the raiyat gets it as a windfall because, after all, the property is his and he had to transfer it as complete usufructuary mortgage or “Khai Khalashi” in order to obtain loan. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p> </p></div></div>

Due to the peculiar geographical phenomena prevailing in the riverine part of this Province, a considerable part of the Province remains submerged for several months of the year. During this time, fishes may be available and may also be caught in these submerged areas. It cannot be said that these areas vest in the Government as fisheries as long as they remain under water and revert to the owners thereof as soon as the water recedes.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A fishery is a right to catch fish in any water of a more or less permanent nature, where fish is capable of being reared and caught throughout the year as an occupation, business or industry. Casual availability of fish in such areas will not render them a fishery.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In other words, in order to constitute a closed fishery, the land concerned must contain so much water throughout the year as is sufficient for enabling rearing and catching of fish therein and, that too, in pursuit of fishing as a trade, business, occupation or industry. As a corollary, it follows that the purpose of the lease and the nature of the tenancy right recognized and treated by the lessee and the manner in which the land is being used or capable of being used are all important factors to be considered in determining whether a land does or does not constitute a fishery. If the purpose of lease is not one for fishing exclusively, or if the land grows or is capable of growing crops or if the owner of the land is being usually recognized and treated by the successive landlords including the Government as a raiyat then the inference would be that the land concerned is not a fishery.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Province of East Pakistan Vs.

Their main contention was that on co-operative basis they have undertaken to do large-scale farming. The Trial Court granted plaintiffs prayer for temporary injunction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Basis of the plaintiffs prayer was that he was entitled to a certificate for retaining the excess land. Such certificate was, in fact, granted but was later on cancelled by the Board of Revenue. That matter was challenged and ended with the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The order of cancellation was challenged in Writ Petition No. 169 of 1964 but the Writ petition was dismissed and the order of cancellation of the certificate was maintained. An appeal against the said order of the High Court was dismissed by the Supreme Court which observed that the ex-rent receivers got no legal right to grant of a certificate under sub-section (4) of s. 20 After this decision of the Supreme Court no suit for permanent injunction against the Government is maintainable whether it is filed by the ex-rant-receivers directly or in the name of their co-operative society. While the certificate granted by the Revenue Authority, which is revisable, permit’s the retention of the quantity of land in excess of the permissible limit, such certificate does not confer any right upon the certificate-holder because sub-section (4B) says,” the land held under a certificate under sub-section(4) or 4A) by the prescribed Revenue Authority shall absolutely vest in the Government and the certificate-holder on an application submitted by him for granting a Lease on a long-tern basis in respect of such land” but he is to give up “claim of compensation” and such land may be Leased out to him under certain conditions.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The purpose of the law clearly is this that the certificate-holder becomes the lessee under the Government and he is to give up his claim of compensation which otherwise woukl has been admissible to him. Such being the right and privilege the question is whether the plaintiff can claim any injunction restraining the Government from interfering in the setting of such facts when admittedly no certificate is in existence. The opinion is that no right inheres in him so as to entitle him to an injunction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In this case no case has been made Out for temporary injunction nor any certificate is in existence and, therefore, the question what is the distinction between the temporary injunction or status quo or whether there is any distinction at all becomes academic.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Debishahar Agricultural &amp; Fish Farming Cooperative Society Ltd.

There is specific provision for preemption. of non-agricultural land in the East Bengal Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act. Under that Act a contiguous owner cannot claim right of preemption. Section 96 of the Act is confined to agricultural land and therefore a right of pre-emption under this section cannot be claimed in respect of a homestead land within a Municipality. <em>[EB Nonagricultural Tenancy Act: (XXIII of 1949)].</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Mst.

Such transactions are usufructuary mortgages within s. 58(d) and unless the instrument of mortgage in such a case is in writing, and the transaction also falls within s. 53-A, the terms of the mortgage cannot be relied on as a ground of attack or of defense by either the plaintiff or the defendant in a mortgage suit, except in cases in which they are embodied in a duly registered written instrument. Accordingly, a suit framed as a suit for redemption of lands which are the subject of an oral usufructuary mortgage cannot be sustained, inasmuch as the plaintiff pleads and relics on the oral mortgage which is required by law to be effected by a registered instrument.

The holding thus being one at fixed rate of rent, the landlord in view of section 22 had no locus standi to file an application for pre-emption under section 33 of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Chandra K Bhattacharya Vs.

The statute nowhere provides that the right of the landlord vests only on the service of the notice either under section 30 or section 33 of the Syihet Tenancy Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Chandra K Bhattacharya Vs.

Code is a decree made in a suit. A proceeding under section 34(b) of the Sylhet Tenancy Act is started by an application and not by a plaint, and consequently the order under section 34(b) of the Act is not an order in a suit.

There is no provision in the Sylhet Tenancy Act or in the Civil Procedure Code providing that there shall be no appeal from such an order.

The defendant company is entitled to the exclusive use of the coined words “Saribadi Salsa” also on the ground that it had been in continuous use by the defendant company since 1914, according to the provisions of the proviso to section 6. Further seven years have passed since the original registration of the mark and as such the defendant company is also entitled to the protection afforded by section 24 of the Trade Marks Act as no acceptable case has been made out of any fraud perpetrated by the defendant company in having the trade mark registered nor does the trade mark offend against the provisions of section 8 of the Trade Marks Act<em>.

So the respondent’s contention was that this will confuse and deceive the buyers who may purchase the product of “PMS” as that of “Bayer”.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Held:</strong> In the absence of legal bar the Registrar is not entitled to impose a condition arbitrarily.

There may be cases in which an application for stay of the suit may be sought merely for the purpose of delaying the Suit by making an application to the Registrar under section 10(2). This application may be frivolous and devoid of any substance and may have been made after the institution of this suit. when the defendant may have found his position difficult and untenable. To stay the suit in this situation and to wait for the decision of the Registrar which may sometimes take years, would be denial of justice. It may also be noted that the decision by the Registrar in any case is not final and is subject to an appeld to the High Court. Then there may be cases which may involve the determination of other issues apart from those arising under section 10(2) which could only be tried by the Civil Court. The stay of the suit, therefore, cannot be granted as a matter of course merely upon the presentation of an application by the defendant before the Registrar particularly when that application is made after the institution of this suit. The question whether stay should be granted must be answered with reference to the facts of each case. It is a matter within the discretion of the Court and the discretion has to be exercised in the interest of justice. One of the considerations which may determine an exercise of that discretion is the time when the application for stay is made. Another factor to consider would be whether the application for stay is bona fide. Yet another consideration would be the nature of the case itself.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>N. B. Philip Vs. Electric Lamp Manufactures of Pak.

The limitations were over reached because, whereas Shipton Tea Co was entitled without registering its trade mark to freely use its trade name and to print it in any colour it liked on its goods, so long as its labels did not in any other respect infringe the trademarks of Lipton Ltd., after Its registration the name would be partly suppressed by its deletion from the most important place in the trade mark and partly obscured by the flattening effect of reduced size of panels of labels and turned down colour scheme<em>. </em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Abdul Gani Vs.

A trade union of employees has been recognized as a very effective vehicle of such collective bargaining. The East Pakistan Trade Union Act, 1965 which was enacted on repealing the Trade Union Act of 1926 has embodied provisions for constitution of a Trade Union of workers as well as of employers primarily for the purpose of regulating the relation between workers and employers or workers and workers or between employers and employers as wills appear from the definition of a Trade Union as given in section 2(n) of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Mohiuddin Khan Vs.

The object of the Act as recited in the preamble of the Act is for providing for the registration and recognition of trade unions and in certain respects, for defining the law relating to registered trade unions and recognized trade unions and for matters connected therewith.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Mohiuddin Khan Vs.

A recognized Trade Union must necessarily be a registered Trade Union but a recognized Trade Union appears to have some special advantage in the matter of negotiation and conclusion of agreement with the employer in certain cases, which is .not enjoyed by a registered Trade Union, if not recognized.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Mohiuddin Khan Vs.

Even if no order slaying the operation of the order of withdrawal of registration had been made by the Labour Court, the legal position would not have been different inasmuch as the strike notice was given at a time when the petitioner was a registered Trade Union.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>General Secretary Employees Union Wapda Vs.

He cannot pass an indefinite order of appointment without any limitation as to the duration of the office of the Mutawalli appointed by him. The power of the District Judge in appeal is also similarly limited.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Abdul Jabbal Vs.

The petitioner preferred an appeal to the District Judge against Administrator’s order and the District Judge upheld the decision of the Administrator. The petitioners thereafter moved the High Court on revision. It was contended that the District Judge was a ‘persona designata’ and did not act as a Court and as such no revision lies against his order before the High Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Held:</strong> There is no real antithesis between the expressions ‘persona designata’ and ‘Court’. Even a persona designata may be a Court which depends upon his powers and the functions which he has to discharge.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In the present case the appeal has got all the ingredients of an appeal and the District Judge is to determine the rights of the parties as contemplated under section 43 of the Ordinance. That being so the revisional application is competent.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Md. Khurshed Alam Vs.

According to the waqf-deed, the appellant is a fit person for appointment as Mutawalli, and, in fact, he was so appointed. But provisions of section 44 override all other things contained either in the waqf-deed or elsewhere in this Ordinance. The appellant was appointed mutawalli by the Administrator in terms of the waqf-deed. But in view of the circumstances, as stated, the Administrator modified his earlier order appointing the appellant as mutawalli and proceeded to appoint a committee of five persons to act as Mutawalli under section 44.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Golam Ataher Chowdhury Vs.

A comparison of these two expressions in these two sections with reference to the expression used in proviso to section 50 clearly shows three different expressions have been used in the same statute. The Legislature in the same statute has in different context used different expressions. It is a well- accepted principle of interpretation that where different language is used in the same statute different intention is to be presumed unless there is in the context anything to hold to the contrary. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em> </em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>S. 50</strong>—The expression “any person aggrieved” in sec. 50 means any person who is interested to challenge the order made under this sub-section. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—“In question’—What the word “question” means.

Other matters in the definition of the term workman, have to be proved by the person asserting them, if it is denied that the person in respect of whom the application was made was a workman. <em>(1952) PLR (Lah) 822.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>S 2(1)(b)—</strong>Permanent total disablement— Where reduction in earning capacity in respect of works the workman was capable of performing before the accident is total—disability sustained by the workman is one of permanent total disablement.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A bus conductor was knocked down by another bus and as a result of the accident his left leg became permanently disabled and he could not bend his knee- joint nor could he run or stand for a long time. His physician certified that he was unfit for active physical work. The Commissioner, Workman’s Compensation. Dacca held that since the conductor did not completely and permanently lose the use of his left leg and as he still could stand a while and walk a short distance, the percentage of loss of his earning capacity should be assessed at 25%.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Held</strong>: In a case under the Workman’s Compensation Act the primary duty of the Court is to find out whether the disablement is total or partial. In other words, the result of the injury should be clearly and fully considered and it should be found out whether the same produced a result of permanent partial disablement or permanent total disablement.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The type of work which the workman was acquainted with and capable of performing, prior to his sustaining the injury, could no longer be undertaken by him due to the injury sustained by him. In view of the above, it is evident that the reduction of the earning capacity in respect of the works the workman was capable of performing was total and as such the disability sustained by the workman was one of permanent total disablement. The expression, “as incapacitates a workman for all work which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident” as occurring in section 2(l) (b) of the W.C. Act clearly relates only to those kinds of work which the workman was capable of performing in relation to his earning of livelihood and does not mean a category broader than that.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>A.K.M.

The proviso to section 2(I)(g) of the Act only says that the injuries specified in Schedule Ito the Act shall be deemed to result in permanent partial disablement irrespective of the fact whether the earning capacity has been reduced or not.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Muslim Cotton Mills Vs.

The proviso only lays down that in cases of injuries enumerated in the proviso to section 2(1) (I) they will be deemed to be cases of permanent total disablement irrespective of the fact whether the workman has or has not been incapacitated for all work which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Muslim Cotton Mills Vs.

In the absence of evidence in this regard and also in the absence of any request having been made by him after the receipt of the report of the medical specialist to show that he was really incapacitated for all work, no finding can be claimed by the appellant that he has been incapacitated for all work which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Zohooruddjn Vs.

The duty or work which the, workman is performing at the time of the accident, if falls within the employment and even if it is not directly connected with the object of the accident which though falls within the place, scope and connotation of employment; then the accident would be said to have arisen out of and in the course of employment.

The law says the decision of the Controlling Authority shall be final.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Municipal Committee could not maintain a writ petition and the High Court erred in law in setting aside the order of the Controlling Authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">No writ petition is maintainable at the instance of a Municipality against any decision of the Controlling Authority. Any other view will lead to absurd position, namely, the Controlling Authority’s direction can be challenged by a municipality by invoking the writ jurisdiction and thereby dismantling the statutory structure.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Dacca Municipal Corporation Vs.
