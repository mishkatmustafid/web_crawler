The pendency of the suit under s.52 as it stands after the amendment of 1929, extends up to the complete satisfaction of the decree passed in the suit; and under the present law the injunction will go with the land and the decree can be executed against the legal representative and also against the transferee of the judgment-debtor. <em>1935 AMU 67.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Pauper Suit</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A transfer made after the application for leave to sue informa pauperis is filed but before it is registered as a suit is affected by the rule of us pendens. when the immovable property transferred is specifically in issue in the suit.

A mortgage executed by the judgment-debtor after the decree and before the sale is therefore affected by us pendens. The fact that in a suit for maintenance by a Hindu widow a charge is claimed over all the family properties which are specified in the plaint would not make any difference in the application of the doctrine, if the properties are sufficiently designated so as to make them directly and substantially the subject-matter of the litigation. <em>1935 M. 867—69 M.LJ. 447</em>.
