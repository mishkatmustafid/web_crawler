The provisions to the contrary contained in the Calcutta Rent Ordinance, 1946, or in the E.B. Premises Rent Ordinance, 1951, were not made retrospective in their operation either by express word or by implication so as to apply to pending suits and appeals, and, therefore, did not affect the suit property instituted during the currency of the Bengal House Rent Control Order, 1942.</p><p><em>Sree Nath Bhuiya Vs.

When a decree-holder fails to put in such an affidavit, all proceedings on the basis of an application for attachment must be declared to be void and of no effect. <em>5 PLR (Dac.) 233.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>S.14 (i)(b) —</strong> Landlord to show contract with tenant prior to August, 1951, prohibiting him from sub-letting any portion of the premises occupied by him-Section 108 J of the Transfer of Property Act. <em>5 PLR (Dac) 458.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Sec 14 (3) —</strong> Sub-tenant has no right to stay where a decree for ejectment is passed against the tenant.

Premises Rent Control Ordinance, can be interfered by High Court.</p><p>Although the decision of the District Judge is final under clause 6 of section 30 of the East Bengal Premises Rent Control Ordinance, it does not. operate as a bar to an application under section 115 of the C.P.Code, for there is no provision in this Ordinance to the effect that not only the decision of the District Judge shall be final but that no shall have any jurisdiction to interfere in any with the order so passed by the District Judge. An application in revision under section 115 of the C.P.Code lies against an order of any Court subordinate to this Court in which the legislature has not provided for any appeal and unless there is any provision, express or implied, taking away this jurisdiction of this Court, it must be held that Court has jurisdiction to hear an application in vision directed against the decision of the District Judge passed in an appeal.</p><p>In order to get an ejectment decree in respect the premises under the Ordinance, two elements must be established, viz, the requirement is fide and that it is genuine.</p><p><em>Binkim Ch.
