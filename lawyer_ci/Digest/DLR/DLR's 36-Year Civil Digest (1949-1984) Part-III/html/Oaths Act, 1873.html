It only provides for a procedure by which certain facts may be held to be conclusively proved as against the party which offers to be bound by the oath administered under the Act. But we cannot subscribe to the view that where a decree follows in respect of the whole or part of the subject—matter of a Suit on the basis of a statement made by a party, or a witness, on oath, in pursuance of the agreement of the parties to the suit, the decree should be regarded as a consent decree. But if the intention of the parties is not to obtain a decision of the whole or part of the subject—matter of the suit , but is only confined to finding a short cut for the proof of some or facts in controversy by means of a statement on oath, no decree can immediately follow such oath and the question of determining the nature of the decree in such a case does not really arise.</p><p><em>Lal Vs.

It appears that an Advocate empowered by a party to enter into a compromise, etc. is fully competent to make an offer to abide by the special oath and in doing so he must be deemed to have been so instructed by his client.</p><p><em>Mewo Vs.

Indeed section 9 of the Oaths Act, which enables the Court to give effect to an offer by a party to be bound by the oath of the opposite party, clearly provides that “no party or witness shall be compelled to attend personally in Court solely for the purpose of answering such question” i.e. whether or not he will make the oath.</p><p><em>Md.
