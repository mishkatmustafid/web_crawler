Evidence m establishes such comprehension is most obviously found in proof that the deed was read over to the settler and, where necessary explained. The extent and character of the explanations required must depend on die circumstances. Length, intricacy, the number and complexity of the dispositions, of the unfamiliarity of the subject—matter are all reasons for requiring an increased amount and efficiency of explanation. Fraud, duress and actual undue influence are separate matter.</p><p><em>Suratunnassa Bibi Vs. Md.
