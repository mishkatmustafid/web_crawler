If, therefore 0. 21. 66, was intended to exclude any jurisdiction, it is to that extent ultra vires of section 5 of the Act:</p><p><em>[(Kayani. I.) West Punjab Government v. Akbar Hussain: PLD Lah. 430]</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>Ss. 9 &amp; 10</strong>—Possession of boxes containing poppy heads established—Burden of proving want of knowledge that the boxes contained poppy-heads is on accused. Where it is established that the accused was in possession of boxes which were found to contain poppy-heads, there is a presumption under section 10 that the accused has committed an offence under section 9. Burden is on the accused to prove that he did not know that the boxes contained poppy-heads. In the absence of evidence to discharge that burden the accused would be rightly convicted. 8 C W N 349 rel. 4 I C898; 13 I C 788 and A I R 1930 cal. 688 distinguished:</p><p><em>[(Akram, Shahabuddin and Mohd.
