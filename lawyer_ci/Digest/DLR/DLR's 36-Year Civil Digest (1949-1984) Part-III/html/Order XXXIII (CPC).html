A pauper suit which is initiated by an application under rule 2 of Order 33 C.P. Code, has to contain particulars like a plaint in a suit. It is thus a composite document consisting of the application to sue as a pauper and the plaint for the suit. If the application is granted, it is automatically deemed as a plaint to be numbered and registered as</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">such under rule 7 thereof. If it is rejected, one of the reasons for which may be, as stated in rule 5 of Order 33 CPC, that the allegations do not show a cause of action, the plaint goes with it, and nothing survives thereafter for the determination of the Court. The rejection of the application bars a subsequent application of like nature in respect of the same right to sue, but a suit can be instituted in the ordinary manner in respect of such right, subject to the law  limitation and subject to costs (if any) in cuffed by the Provincial Government and the opposite party in opposing the application for leave to sue as a pauper.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Mst.
