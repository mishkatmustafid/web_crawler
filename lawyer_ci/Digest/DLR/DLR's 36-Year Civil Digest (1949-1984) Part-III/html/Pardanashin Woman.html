To discharge this onus, it is not sufficient to show that the allegations made by the person attacking the disposition are untrue.</p><p>Mere proof that execution had been admitted by an illiterate pardanashin lady is not enough. The real point is that the disposition made must be substantially understood and must really be the menial act as its execution is the physical act of the maker.</p><p><em>Abdul Motlab Biswas Vs Matulla (1954) 6 DLR 202</em>.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Pardanashin Lady:</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>—Onus of proof of a document executed by her.

Held: that the agreement embodied in the document is voidabe:</p><p><em>[(Lord Normand) Parikh Atmaram Maneklal vs. Bai Hira : PLD 1948 P C 40]</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Pardanashin woman—Transfer of property by—Transferee must prove affirmatively that transfer was result of free will of Pardanashin—Independent advice— Opportunity for, necessary in case transferee stands in position of confidence.</strong></p><p>It is for the person, who seeks to hold a pardanashin, ignorant and illiterate woman to the terms of the deed, transferring the property to her disadvantage to prove affirmatively that not only the document was read over and explained to her before she put her thumb—impression to it, but that it was the result of her own free will, after she had thoroughly comprehended the terms of the document. If a person deriving benefit under the deed stands towards her in fiduciary character or in some relation of personal confidence, then the Court is to act with greater caution and in ordinary circumstances must presume confidence put and influence exerted. It is for him to bring evidence on the record to show that the lady executing the document was free from all undue influence, and when she executed it, she understood the terms of it quite intelligently and nothing was concealed from her. Generally it is prudent, although the rule is not rigid or inelastic that a woman of the description mentioned above before she disposes of her property to her disadvantage, is given an opportunity to seek independent advice given by a person, who has no interest in the party acting or in the property proposed to be disposed of. It, however, all depends upon the circumstances of the individual case, whether such an advice was necessary or not, and what kind of advice was needed. In cases where the transfer is gratuitous and in favor of a person, who stands towards a woman in fiduciary character or in some relation of personal confidence, the presumption will be still strong against the validity of the deed.
