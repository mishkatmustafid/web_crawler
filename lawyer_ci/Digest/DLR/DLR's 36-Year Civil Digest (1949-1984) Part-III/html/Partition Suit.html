Partition is, therefore, necessary for giving possession to the plaintiff— mortgagee.</p><p>Suit for partition is maintainable at the instance of the usufructuary mortgagee whether he is in actual possession or out of possession of the mortgaged land, provided the mortgagor is a party to the Suit and the suit is necessary for giving effect to the mortgage.</p><p>In case the mortgagee be not in actual possession of the mortgaged land it would be necessary to pray not only for partition but also for khas possession of the share allotted to him on ejectmcnt of other co-sharers from that portion.</p><p><em>Md. Eshaque vs. Afzal Ahmed (1960) 13 DLR 115.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Where defendant also asks for partition of his share—procedure to follow—Effect on the jurisdiction of the Court when defendant joins in asking a share.</strong></p><p>If a defendant wants to get his share by partition the ordinary rule should be that he files a suit for it. He may however be allowed to make such claim even in a written statement provided he pays court fee on this claim.</p><p>In such a case, truly speaking, the written statement is only a plaint, and proceedings in the two suits, that is one filed by the plaintiff and the other by the defendant, arc deemed to be consolidated and the answer to the question as to what is henceforth the jurisdictional value of the suit would depend upon whether the Court regard the two suits as one or regard it an ordinary case of consolidation. If it is a simple consolidation of two suits, i.e., there is no effect on jurisdictional value. If the view is taken that the defendant who has prayed for a partition of his share should also be regarded as plaintiff in the suit then the jurisdictional value would be the total of the values of the shares of the plaintiff and of those defendants who claim to have their shares separated.</p><p><em>Ajiruddin Mondal vs. Rahman Fakir (1961) 13 DLR (SC) 191.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Plaintiff out of possession—Claim amounts to asking for two reliefs.</strong></p><p>When the plaintiff is out of possession of joint property the grant to him of separate possession of his partitioned share amounts really to two reliefs. (1) Joint possession of his share, and (2) the transformation of that joint possession into separate possession of his partitioned share, for a plaintiff out of possession is not entitled to partition unless he first gels joint possession. Ibid</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Partition suits and suit for mesne profits, drawing up of the final decree.</strong></p><p>In partition suits and in suits for mesne profits, the drawing up of the final decree may depend upon the filing of the necessary stamp paper or court fees.</p><p><em>Barada Prasanna vs. Kobbad Mia (1961) 13 DLR 765.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>A surplus of two decimals of land with nobody to claim it—No other co-sharer being in existence, the suit for partition maintainable.</strong></p><p>The trial court has discovered that a residium of 2 decimals of land would ensue on a computation of he figures that have been given by the parties to the suit. True, but it does not follow that, of necessity, there must be another co-sharer in existence with regard to the aforesaid 2 decimals of land which appears to be a surplus on actual measurement of land as claimed by the parties.</p><p>In this view of the matter there is no substance in the argument that the prayer for partition is incompetent without impleading a co-sharer whose existence has not been proved and who may not exist at all.</p><p><em>Bazlur Rahman vs. Mahmudur Rahman Bhuiyan (1967)19 DLR 344.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Partition suit remained pending till the passing of the final decree.</strong></p><p>The judgment does not clearly lay down the shares of the respective parties and also about the allotment of saham. We do not consider that there is any bar in the learned Subordinate Judge’s doing so, for a partition suit remains pending till the passing of the final decree.</p><p><em>Muzaffar Vs. Kabiruddin, (1969) 21 DLR 97.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Partition suit—where plaintiff (co-sharer) out of possession of his share of property— Remedy lies in a partition suit.</strong></p><p>Plaintiff having right and title in respect of his share to the property in suit but being out of possession, his remedy for separate possession lies in a partition suit.</p><p><em>Haji Sorkum Ali Vs. Huson Ali (1969) 21 DLR 423.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Declaration of title in a partition suit when not necessary.</strong></p><p>The main question is whether the Suit IS maintainable without declaration of title of the plaintiffs. On the death of Sachindra his title passed on to the plaintiffs, his minor sons, and his widow, defendant No. I, but the plaintiffs for some reason or other was thrown out of possession, according to the defendant No.2 since their father’s death. But their dispossession will not disentitle them to recover possession on payment of ad—valorem court—fee. The suit is not barred by limitation as the suit has been filed within one year of attainment of majority by plaintiff no.1. He is entitled to file the suit within three years from attainment of his majority as laid down in section 6 of the Limitation Act. During the period of their minority plaintiffs’ title was not extinguished and as such there is no necessity for getting a declaration of their title. The view taken by j the High Court Division that the suit is not maintainable without declaration of title is clearly erroneous.</p><p><em>Sanjib Kumar Bose &amp; another, Vs. Syed Shamsuddin Ahmed.
