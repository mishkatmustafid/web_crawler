Commr. Income-Tax, PLD 1964 Dacca 373=PLR 1962 Dacca 1419 (FB). (Chowdhury, J,).</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>S.6, Expl. I—Joint lease of agricultural land—Joint management and sharing of profits—Not enough to prove partnership.</strong></p><p>The land in dispute was taken on lease jointly by two persons. It was contended that they were partners on that score.</p><p>Held: The respondent only alleged that the land in dispute was obtained by the parties jointly with a view to share profits. That by itself cannot make this adventure as of partnership and will not make the relationship of the parties as that of partners. According to section 6 of the Partnership Act in determining whether a group of persons is or is not a firm, or whether a person is or is not a partner in a firm, regard shall be had to the real relation between the parties; as shown by all persons. Holding a joint or common interest in that property does not of itself make persons partners. Thus, in the absence of any allegation of the respondent that the lease was obtained by them as partners or that the land in dispute was to be cultivated in order to carry on a partnership business, and further in the absence of any case of the appellant that the lease was obtained in partnership and the parties were carrying on any partnership business, it is difficult to appreciate how the question of partnership can arise in the present case. It, however, appears that if the co—owners of the land or the co—lessees of the land are shown not to have any interest in the land other than of receiving their share of its income that by itsself would not make them partners.</p><p><em>Mobarak Ali Shah vs. Muhammad Sadiq, PLD 1961 (W.P.)

No limitation, however, is placed on the power conferred by section 32 of the Act, on a partner to retire from the partnership, by agreement with the other partners, but this does not mean that such an agreement between them can override any other provisions of the Partnership Act, specially those of section 44, which permit a Court to dissolve a firm under certain conditions. Sections 32 and 44 of the Act being both independent provisions of law, one cannot override the other and hence, the argument that an agreement entered into between the partners permitting one of them to retire, would take away the power of the Court to dissolve such a partnership under section 44 of the Act, has no force.</p><p><em>Muhammad Yaseen Vs.

But in this case a specific provision has been made to the effect that while applying for registration under section 26—A of the Act, the application shall be signed by all the partners. Section 18 of the Partnership Act cannot override the provision of another Central Act, namely, 26A of the Income Tax Act and compel the Income Tax Authorities to accept the application filed by some of the partner. The Partnership Act is a general law which will go era the business transaction of the firm but cannot over—ride a specific provision made in section 26A of the Income Tax Act. In fact this specific provision shall override the general provisions made in the Partnership Act.</p><p><em>M/S Essential Industries Dacca Vs.

In a trading concern a partner has implied authority to accept and draw bills on behalf of the firm. Even if the authority to do so has been cancelled and such cancellation has not been brought to the notice or knowledge of a discounting bank, the bank is entitled to recover as against the other partners also.</p><p><em>Suleman Ibrahim vs. Eastern Rice Syndicate, PLD 1966 (W.P.)

Now, as by law they arc held prima facie to authorize all acts done in carrying on the business. of the firm in the usual way, they cannot escape liability for any act of this character unless they can show that the apparent authority to do it did not exist, and was known not to exist. But when it is sought to make the firm liable for some act not prima fade authorized by it. an actual authority by it must be shown; and if this cannot be done, no case is made out against the firm, however, ignorant the person seeking to charge it may have been of what was authorized and what was not. In the case now supposed the firm did not mislead him; and if he was misled by the representations of the partner with whom he dealt, his remedy is against that partner; just as when an agent untruly represents his authority, a person dealing with him acquires no right against the principal but must look to the agent for indemnity.</p><p><em>Aziz-ur-Rahman vs. Bahawalnagar Corp: Commn.

Under Order XXX, rule 1, Civil Procedure Code, a plaintiff is not debarred from making his choice in the above mentioned matter. The rule is a permissive one and does not make it incumbent on a plaintiff to sue a firm in the name of the firm. The liability of the partners of a firm being joint and several, any one of the partners could be sued with reference to the liability of the firm.</p><p><em>Nazar Mohd. Vs.

There is no reason why the inclusion of the minors should render the constitution of the firm itself invalid when there were at least two adult partners, besides the minors, who could lawfully have entered into the partnership. Under section 26—A of the Income—Tax Act two conditions have only to be satisfied, firstly, that the firm has been constituted under an instrument of partnership, and, secondly, that the instrument has specified the shares of the partners. If these conditions are satisfied, the firm is entitled to registration.</p><p><em>Commr. of I-T. vs. Amin Match Works, PLD 1964 Supreme Court 337=(1964) 16 DLR (S.C. 183.

But the partnership agreement as between the adult is valid, the minor would be deemed to have been admitted to the benefits of the partnership. Ibid.</p><p>A contract entered into by a minor is void. But the doctrine of the minor’s incapacity is a doctrine for his protection by preventing others from injuring him by taking advantage of his incompetence.   Ibid.</p><p>Partnership is an agreement and agreement with a minor is void. No doubt under sec. 30 of the Partnership Act a minor can be admitted to the benefits of partnership, but in order that section 30 may apply there should be a partnership already in existence and cases where a minor became a partner from the very inception of partnership are beyond the scope of sec. 30. <em>1955 PLR (Lah) 588.</em></p><p> </p><p>—Minors acquire interest in partnership business by right of inheritance—To such a case section 30 not applicable.</p><p><em>Commissioner of Income Tax, Vs.

Although a partner, for the purposes of Income Tax Act, includes a minor who has been admitted to the benefits of partnership, a partner within the meanings of the Partnership Act does not include a minor.</p><p><em>Amin Match Works vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, PLD 1964 Dacca 295 (DB).

He cannot be regarded merely as a person entitled to a particular sum of cash ascertained upon the striking of balance. If the continuing partners choose to carry on the business they obviously utilize the assets of the partnership and are thus placed in a fiduciary position with regard to the share of the outgoing partner in those assets.

Under this system of accounting, if insisted upon by the outgoing partner under section 37 of the Partnership Act, it will be t open for the remaining partners to claim to be recompensed for the skill and labor employed by them in the conduct of the business after dissolution and they will also be entitled to prove what portion, if any, of the profits was obtained not by reason of the use of the partnership assets but in some other manner.
