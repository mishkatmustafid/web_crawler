Firstly that the Managing Director was guilty of misconduct in so far as he had been utilizing the assets of the partnership for his personal needs, secondly, that although the partnership was carried on for more than two years not a pie in the shape of profits, was paid to the financing partner,</p><p>and thirdly, that the relations between the parties having become strained, on account of criminal litigation, it was just and equitable to dissolve the firm.

It was argued that as the intimation of the change had not been sent to the Registrar regarding the change at the time of the filing of the suit; the suit did not lie.</p><p><strong><em>Held:</em></strong> Section 63 of the Partnership Act under which an intimation with regard to the change in the members of the firm and of the name of the firm has to be given to Registrar does not prescribe any time limit for sending such intimation. The mere fact that intimation about this change was given to the Registrar subsequently does not alter the situation. The firm running under the name and style of Messrs Jumani Brothers, therefore, was fully competent to file a suit against the applicant and by filing such a suit there has been absolutely no contravention of the provision contained in section 69 of the Partnership Act.</p><p><em>Muhammad Zaman Khan vs. Jumani Bros., PLD 1961 (W.P) Karachi 19.

Applicablity of provision of section 69 when the suit is one for accounts of dissolved firm.</strong></p><p>Where on an interpretation of the plaint it is evident that the suit was for the accounts of a dissolved firm, the provisions of section 69 would not be a bar for the maintainability of the suit.</p><p><em>Sudhanjshu Birnal Biswas Vs. Md. Mustafa Chowdhury.

Merely because the name of the firm has been changed or some of the members of the firm have left and some new members have been taken in it does not necessarily mean that the firm has been dissolved and that a new firm has been set up. The firm Messrs Jumani Brothers &amp; Co. which has ultimately come into being as Messrs Jumani Brothers is not a new firm but is the same firm continuing under a different name. Therefore the suit was maintainable.</p><p><em>Muhammad Zaman Khan Vs. Jumnani Brothers, PLD 1961 (W.P.) Karachi 19 (DB).

This section only bars a Suit for enforcing a right arising out of a contract against either the firm or any past or present member of it or against any third party.</p><p><em>Usman vs. Haji Omar Haji Ayub, PLD 1966 Supreme Court 328. (Hamoodur Rahman, J).</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>S. 69— Suit by partner in individual capacity— Not for benefit of the firm— Suit not barred under the Act</strong>.</p><p>Section 69 of the Partnership Act. 1932 applies to those cases only where the plain shows that the dispute in respect of which the suit is brought was for the benefit of the partnership and the plaintiff has either brought the suit for the benefit of the partnership or has based his claim in respect of a transaction which was entered into between the partners and the defendant. Where a suit, on a claim arising out of a contract, was brought by one person alone and there was no allegation in the plaint that the benefits of the contract in dispute also accrued to some other persons, it was held that the suit was not barred under section 69 of the Partnership Act, 1932.</p><p><em>Jaffar Khan vs. Muhammad Achar, PLC) 196 (W.P) Karachi 335 (DB).
