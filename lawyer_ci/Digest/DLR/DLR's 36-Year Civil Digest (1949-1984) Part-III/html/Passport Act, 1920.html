The rights to issue passport to a citizen arc recognized in a sovereign State under the well—established rule of International Law and the issuing of passport is a part of the State Department’s Foreign Affairs function, which is not justifiable. In other words, Pakistani citizen has no legal right, much less Constitutional right, to be issued a passport.</p><p><em>Manzoor Khan vs. Government of Pakistan, PLD 1966 (W.P) Peshawar 29 (D.B.)
