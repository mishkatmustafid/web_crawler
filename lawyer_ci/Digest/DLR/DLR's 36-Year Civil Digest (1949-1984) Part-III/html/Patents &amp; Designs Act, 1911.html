In the presence of these statutory provisions it is difficult to see how the length of time in which registration may exist, or mere doubts, whether substantial or otherwise, as to its validity which may be entertained can be given weight for not protecting copyright in a registered design, irrespective of whether the protection that is needed is temporary or otherwise. Section 53 (1) is categorical when it says that “(luring the existence of copyright in any design it shell not be lawful for any person” other than the registered proprietor to use it for the purpose of selling his goods.</p><p><em>Silver Cotton Textile Mills Ltd.
