The Post Office acts in such a case as an agent of the sender and not of the addressee. Again, if the letter is sent through a messenger and overtakes him by a quicker means of transport, so as to prevent him reaching his destination, the resignation, would not take effect.</p><p><em>Fazlul Quader Chowdhury Vs.

On a direction by the Appellate Court to Trial Court (which dismissed the applicant’s cast,) for giving opportunity to the applicant to get the abatement set aside, the applicant made an application on 26.8.61 for treating the application made on 9.8.58 as one under Order 22, r. 9, C.P.Code for setting aside the abatement consequent on the death of the opposite party No.1. The Court granted the prayer and set aside the abatement of the case but on appeal, the High Court held that the application filed on 9.8.58 could not be treated as one made under Order 22, r. 9, of the Code. On appeal by special leave to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, it has been held: It is true that there was no prayer for setting aside abatement in the application filed on 9.8.58 and there could not be any such prayer in the said petition since the death of opposite party No. I was shown as within time. But in the application filed on 26.8.61 the appellant stated:</p><p>“Before the date of 9.8.58, this petitioner was not aware of the death. Therefore, this petitioner is entitled to get extension under section 5 of the Limitation Act.”</p><p>And thereafter made the following prayer: “The application filed on 9.8.58 by this petitioner for the substitution of the heirs may be treated as an application under Order 22, r. 9 C.P.C.</p><p>Technically it can be said that the petition filed on 9.8.58 cannot be treated as an application for setting aside abatement since there was no such prayer in the said petition. But when the applicant for setting aside abatement filed a petition on 26.8.61 stating that he had no knowledge of the death earlier and is entitled to get extension under section 5 of the Limitation Act and the learned Munsif, for ends of justice, treated the petition as a proper one for disposal of the issue and disposed it accordingly.</p><p>The technicality of form, if adhered to, as the High Court took to be so, and then there would be no proper dispensation of justice in the facts and circumstances of the case. The substance of the prayer should be looked into taking an overall view of the facts and circumstances of the case, ignoring the mere technicality of form of the petition, and it is not desired that the technicality of form should prevail causing impediment of dispensation of justice.</p><p><em>Abdul Hamid Kazi Vs. Abdul Jabbar (1974) 26 DLR (SC) 68.</em></p><p>—When an order has taken effect and in pursuance of that order certain right has been created in favor of any person that order cannot be withdrawn or rescinded to the detriment of that person.</p><p>When a right has accrued to a person by virtue of an order that order cannot be rescinded by the person who made it. Again, when it is not incumbent upon the Government to punish a 3overnment servant merely because he has been convicted by a court a fresh order of punishment after the petitioner will be reinstated is wholly un-warrantal.</p><p><em>A.H.M. Abdul Hai Vs. Bangladesh (1979) 31 DLR 88.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Next friend—appointment of in the appellate stage.</strong></p><p>Order for Appointment of next friend of a deity can be made in the Appellate stage.</p><p><em>Lalai Mia &amp; ors. Vs. Sree Subhankar Bhowmik Shubha (1981) 33 DLR 288.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>New trial when should not be asked—</strong>Their Lordships of the Privy Council cannot concede to the application made by counsel on behalf of the defendant that the case should be remitted for a new trial to enable him to prove the existence of an agreement in writing which was essential to his case and which he failed to do during hearing which had with numerous adjournments covered a period from March, 1947 to February, 1949.</p><p><em>Emmanuele Grech Vs. Antonio Grech (1954) 6 DLR 598 (PC) 603.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>Notice of requisition issued without any lawful authority—</strong>Impugned notices of requisition in these cases were issued without any lawful authority and of no legal effect.</p><p>The main respondents could not say whether there was any public purpose of public interest in the matter or any form of propriety, as they appeared to be hell—bent in getting the lands for a Society which was not even registered. In their anxiety they even forgot the law that the authority requisitioning or acquiring any property, under the compulsive power of the act, must indicate definitely what part of the land is required by them.</p><p><em>Chandi Kaibarta Das Vs. Bangladesh. (1982) 34 DLR 227.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>Notice for particular relief not available to plaintiff—</strong>Particular relief asked for in the notice not being available to the plaintiff, the court can substitute appropriate relief, without the necessity of a fresh notice under section 80 C.P.C.</p><p><em>Federation of Pak.

(1957) 9 DLR (SC) 16.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>No Court can pass a decree in favor of a defendant which is not sought—</strong>The contention was that the plaintiffs have come to Court for relief but not the defendants but the lower Court passed orders in favour of the defendants though not claimed. The portion of the order objected to, runs thus: The defendant Government and the lessees under the Government arc quite entitled to enter into the Suit properties by removing there from all the plaintiffs of the suits aforesaid’ and the same has been made part of the decree i.e, a decree has been passed in favour of the defendants.</p><p><strong>Held</strong>: No Court can pass a decree in favour of a defendant which is not sought for by him legally.</p><p><em>Jadu Nath vs. Province of East Bengal (1961) 13 DLR 496.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>No existing law authorizing taking over the possession of the petitioner’s Tea garden</strong></p><p>Neither in the affidavit—in—opposition nor in course of submission the learned Assistant Attorney General appearing for the respondent No.2 could point out any provision of law authorizing the Government take possession of the Tea garden in the manner it has been done.</p><p><em>Neerala Tea State Vs. Bangladesh Tea Board (1982) 34 DLR 161</em>.</p><p><strong>No notice served on the Petitioner—</strong>No notice as required by law was served on the petitioner and the Government action further violates rule of natural law—Government action wholly illegal without jurisdiction—government re-entering the garden is without any lawful basis.
