If such rent cannot be ascertained, then he has to determine approximately the rent, at which in reasonable probability the premises were let out in December, 1941. In trying to arrive at a reasonably payable rent he should ascertain rent of similar premises in that locality in 1941.</p><p align="justify">The Municipal assessment by itself cannot be taken as a correct index for fixing basic rent. If no other better data is available, then perhaps the Rent Controller can take it into consideration in ascertaining the reasonable rent in 1941.</p><p align="justify"><strong>Onus on tenant—</strong>When the tenant applies for fixation of standard rent and thereby evades payment of contractual rent, the onus of establishing standard rent should be on him.</p><p align="justify"><em>Aminul Islam Vs.

In such a case, he may fix a standard rent at such amount as, having regard to the provisions of the Act and the circumstances of the case, he deems just. Bearing in mind the proviso to the definition of “standard rent”, the result might be that in a case of the present kind the “standard rent” is any rent which the Controller might think to be just in his uncontrolled discretion. Such a conclusion would, however, run contrary to the nature of the Act, which provides with great particularity, in regard to a large number of specific cases the manner in which the “standard rent” shall be ascertained.</p><p align="justify"><em>Md.

The acceptance of the deposit by the Rent Controller will at least mean that he has assumed jurisdiction of the matter.</p><p align="justify">When a deposit case is heard and decided on the ground that the parties do not stand in the relationship of landlord and tenant at all, the House Rent Controller has .to come to some decision on the same. In such a situation, the House Rent Controller is not a mere conduit pipe for deposit or his office a mere counter for the acceptance of deposit.</p><p align="justify"><em>Haji Yunus Bepari Vs.

The only question is as to whether the needs of the daughters comes sufficiently within the meaning of ‘own occupation’ for the purposes of this Act. It would be putting too narrow a construction on the words ‘own occupation’ to say that the words were limited to the personal occupation of the landlord himself and of none others. The words ‘own occupation’ must embrace the occupation of the landlord himself personally as also of such members of his family as are dependent on him.</p><p align="justify"><em>Mulla Mahbub Ali Vs.
