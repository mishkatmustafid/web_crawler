The word ‘premises’ includes not only a building or hut but also grounds, among other things</p><p><em>Abdul Mutaleb Vs. Musammat Rezia Begum (1970) 22 DLR (SC) 134.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>S. 10(a)(b)</strong> Advance payment of rent for a premises hit by S. 10(b) of the Act—Agreement for advance payment of rent hit by S. 23 of the Contact Act.</p><p>Clause (a) of section 10 of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance prohibits the acceptance of any sum of money over and above the rent payable by a tenant. This clause has also made illegal even any claim or invitation of an offer for the payment of such some of money in the form of premium, salami or fine either when a tenancy is being created or renewed, or during its continuance. Under Clause (b) no one is allowed to claim or receive a payment of more than one month’s rent in advance.</p><p>Agreement for lease was void under section 23 of the Contract Act as its object was not lawful and that it having not been registered was unenforceable and also inadmissible in evidence.</p><p>The agreement to pay Tk. 19,200/- by way of advance rent was undoubtedly a part of the consideration of the transaction as defined in section 2(d) of the Contract Act. This contravenes the positive statutory mandate as provided in section 10(b) of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance.</p><p>In view of the unenforceability of the agreement the position is that the appellant is a monthly tenant who is liable to ejectment if he makes default in payment of rent as provided in section 18(5) of the premises Rent Control Ordinance.</p><p><em>Shamsuddin Ahmed Vs. Mohd. Hassan. (1979) 31 DLR (AD) 155.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>S 15(1):</strong> Fixation of standard rent - Rent Controller has to fix standard rent of premises- He shall not hold roving enquiry for the purpose.</p><p><em>Abu Ahmed Vs. Mobarak Ali Chowdhury (1973) 25 DLR 324.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>S. 15(1)</strong>: Rent Controller’s competency in alteration of rent previously fixed by him.</p><p>The Rent Controller has been expressly authorized by section 15 (I) of the Ordinance to fix the standard rent of any premises at the amount per annum which is equivalent to fifteen per cent of the market value of the premises to be assessed in such a manner as may be prescribed.</p><p>In the present case the Rent Controller has exactly done so by altering the monthly rent fixed under the previous enactment from Rs. 35/- to Rs. 125/- and therefore, fixing of the rent in the manner is permissible under the law.</p><p>The word ‘modification’ or ‘alteration’ has been used in the proviso in its usual and ordinary sense and it will be wrong to interpret these words prescribing different meaning thereto.</p><p><em>Abdul Maleq Vs. Alhaj A. K. Md. Hussain (1970) 22 DLR 737.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>Sec 17 —</strong> The transfer of land during the pendency of partition suit so long as a tenant pays to the full extent allowable by the East Pakistan Rent Control Ordinance, but the person in occupation must be tenant. A tenancy created during the pendency of a suit relating to a right to that property is not a tenancy in the eye of law.</p><p><em>Wazed Ali Vs. Sudhir Chandra Das (1968) 20 DLR 513.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>S. 17: Transfer of land during the tenancy of partition suit is hit by the doctrine of lis pendens.</strong></p><p>The Transfer of Property Act will not be applicable so long as a tenant pays rent to the full extent allowable by the East Pakistan Rent Control Ordinance, but the person in occupation must be a tenant. A tenancy created during the pendency of a suit relating to a right to that property is not a tenancy in the eye of law. Ibid.</p><p> </p><p><strong>S.18.</strong> Bonafide requirement—Requirement of room for commercial purposes in an area meant for use as residential purposes. The finding that the shop room is bonafide required by the landlord is based on proper consideration of materials on record as well as on correct interpretation of section 18.</p><p><em>Md. Monzoor Adam Vs. Noor Mohaminad. (1984) 36 DLR (AD) 94.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>S.18(1) — </strong>Eviction of Tenant from the suit premises when sought on the ground of rebuilding--Landlord to prove his such requirement as being bonafide which must contain an element of need.</p><p><em>Abdur Rashid Bhuiyan Vs. Mosammat Rahima Khatun (1983) 35 DLR 388.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>S. 18 (1)(e) — ‘Bonafide require’ explained: </strong>The expression “bonafide require” means a feeling of genuine need and not colorable pretext. The use of the term ‘require’ indicates something more than a mere wish or fancy and it involves an element of need, that is to say, it does not connote a mere subjective phenomenon, but has also an objective Import. The use of the qualifying word ‘bonafide’ along with the word ‘require’ tries to limit the scope of the subjective aspect of the landlord’s feeling of need for his house, although the word ‘bonafide’, the equivalent of which is ‘honestly’ is essentially a subjective concept. The Legislature seems to convey by using the words ‘bonafide require’ a kind of genuine feeling of need and not a colorable pretext.</p><p>The expression, therefore, connotes an honest feeling of need for the house and in ultimate analysis it is a question of fact which is to be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances</p><p><em>Mst. Shamsher Nessa Vs. Mohsenuddin 1 (1975) 27 DLR 643.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>S. 18 (1)(e)</strong>: Bonafide requirement” as contemplated in section 18(I)(e) of the Ordinance means not merely an assertion as to the requirement of the house by the plaintiffs but something more. He has also to prove by evidence that he needs the house for the use of the same.</p><p><em>Abdul Rouf Vs. Mir Muhibur Rahman Chowdhury. (1970) 22 DLR 811.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Bonafide requirement: </strong>According to law, bonafide requirement also included building or re-building but unfortunately the court below rejected the prayer on the presumption that since the plaintiff had other houses, there was no bonafide requirement. The Learned Judge did not at all consider the petitioner’s case and the exhibits filed by the plaintiff in support of his case.</p><p><em>Dr. Md. Arfan Au vs. Bazlur Rahman (1976) 28 DLR 444.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>S. 18(1) —</strong> So long a tenant pays rent to the full extent he has right to. possess the premises subject to conditions set forth in proviso (a) to (c) of S. 18(I).</p><p><em>Jahur Mia Vs. Sri Ram Prasad (1977) 29 DLR 170.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>S. 18(1) and (4)</strong> : The landlord can evict the tenant if he requires the premises for own use and occupation—Tenant’s right to get back the premises when accrues.</p><p><strong>Sec. 18(4):</strong> Gives an opportunity to the tenant to re-enter the premises or obtain damages if the landlord fails to fulfil the purpose for which eviction was sought.</p><p><em>Haji Habihuilah Vs. Abdul Hamid, (1969) 21 DLR 104.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>S. 18 (1) (5).</strong> Tenant’s obligation- to pay rent fallen due to the full extent—Deposit of rent in court should follow refusal to accept rent duly offered by the tenant. The deposit of rent shall have to be accompanied by an application u/s. 19 (5).</p><p><em>Jahir Mia Vs. Sree Ram Prasad (1977) 29 DLR 170.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>When a tenant becomes a defaulter with liability to eviction—</strong>Tenant is entitled to protection under subsection (1) of section 18 so long as he paid rent to the full extent and performed the conditions of the tenancy. Sub-section (5) of section 18 lays down that the tenant shall not be entitled to the benefit of section 18 (1) unless he paid rent due by him in respect of the premises to the full extent within time fixed either by contract or allowed under the law. It was therefore abundantly clear that under the law any default in payment of rent or failure to deposit the rent with the Rent Controller in accordance with law would render the tenant a defaulter.</p><p><em>Begum Fazilatunessa Vs. Nowshad Au (1977) 29 DLR 314.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>No protection against eviction once the tenant is found a defaulter—</strong>Prayer for eviction cannot be refused on the ground that he was not a habitual or willful defaulter. The law makes no distinction whether a defaulter was habitual or willful otherwise. Ibid.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Secs.18(1), 18(5) —</strong>To get the benefit of section 18(5) the tenant must clear his rent dues in terms of the contract or within the 15th day of the month next following.</p><p><em>Dr. Md. Arfn Ali Vs. Bazlur Rahman (1976) 28 DLR 444</em>.</p><p> </p><p><strong>S. 18 (5) Tenant to take care that he does not become a defaulter: </strong>There is no duty cast upon the landlord to pursue the tenant in demanding the rent which falls. It is rather the duty of the tenant to pay rent to the landlord in time with a view to saving him from being a defaulter the consequence of which is his eviction from the premises in his occupation.</p><p><em>Abul Layes Vs. Mst. Anwara Khatun (1977) (SC) 29 DLR 13.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>S.18 (1) (5</strong>): Rent must be paid in terms of contract if any or within 15th day of the next h—In case of refusal to accept rent by landlord the tenant is to remit it by money order. If that too is refused deposit of rent shall be with the Rent Controller—These provisions followed duly secures protection against ejectment—Circumstances which are not within the control of the tenant need consideration.</p><p><em>Profulla Kumar Chakraborty Vs. Anil Proshad Chowdhury (1981)33 DLR (AD) 55.</em></p><p><strong>—Payment of rent in lump (for several months) does not help the tenant from the mischief of default.</strong></p><p>A tenant by making payment of rent in lump of rent in terms of section 18(1) and 18(5) of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance, 1963 is not protected unless there is a contract to the contrary or such payment is covered by waiver and acquiescence on the part of the landlord. Ibid.</p><p> </p><p><strong>S. 18(5) — </strong>Tenant defendants are not entitled to the benefit of the House Rent Control Ordinance unless they pay the rent due in respect of such premises to the full extent within the time fixed in the contract or within 15 days of the month next following which the rent is payable.</p><p><em>Joynal Abedin Vs. Nazira Banu (1974) 26 DLR 221.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>—Deposit of house-rent u/s. 18(5) of the Ordinance must be strictly within the time permitted by the statute or by contract</strong>.</p><p>Failure to deposit the amount of rent on the alleged ground that the necessary permission of the House Rent Controller has not been accorded for such deposit will not protect the tenant from being a defaulter within the meaning of sub-section (5) of section 18 of the Ordinance.   Ibid.</p><p>The learned Counsel submitted that untill the entire amount of Tk. 19,200/- taken by the respondents at the time of creating the tenancy was adjusted, the appellant could not be said to have defaulted in paying rent within the meaning of the aforesaid section. It cannot be denied that there is considerable force in this argument. As long as the respondents had the unadjusted amount in their hands, they could have adjusted it towards the payment of rent for the months of October, November and December.</p><p><em>Shamsuddin Ahmed Vs. Mohd. Hossain (1979) 31 DLR (AD) 155.</em></p><p> </p><p>—Benefit of the sub-section can be claimed only where the tenant pays rent due to the full extent in the due time and not otherwise.</p><p><em>Sk. Md. Emaduddin Vs. Jasimuddin Mistry, (1973) 25 DLR 404.</em></p><p> </p><p>—The explanation to sub-section (5) of section 18 clearly indicates that there is no refusal unless the landlord has refused to accept any rent remitted within the period mentioned in sub-section (5). Ibid.</p><p> </p><p>—Defaulter-tenant cannot seek the protection under the sub-section. Protection against eviction available only when in due time the tenant pays the rent in full. A defaulter cannot claim protection against eviction. Ibid</p><p> </p><p><strong>Ss. 18(5) and 19</strong>: Tenant not entitled to get protection from eviction unless he pays rent to the landlord within the stipulated time as provided in section 18(5) and 19 of the Act—Once default is made that cannot be cured by subsequent deposit of rent with the Rent Controller.</p><p>The tenant is bound to pay rent to the landlord or to deposit the same in the treasury within the stipulated time under sections 18(5) and 19 of the Ordinance (i.e.) by the 15th day of the month next following that for which the rent is payable or deposit such rent in case of refusal by the landlord to accept the rent, within a fortnight of the date on which the rent so remitted is returned to the tenant by the defendant through postal authority.</p><p>But in the present case the defendant deposited rent for the months of February to September, 1958, with the permission of the Rent Controller on the 6th October, 1958.</p><p><strong>Held:</strong> Once a defaulter always a defaulter. If once a default is established it cannot be cured by subsequent deposit of the rent with the Rent Controller. A tenant not having paid the rent to the landlord in terms of section 18 (5) or not having deposited the same with the Rent Controller according to the provisions of section 19, is not entitled to claim a protection from eviction.</p><p><em>M/S East Bengal Paper Traders Association Ltd. Vs. Md. Waziullah (1969) 21 DLR 572.</em></p><p> </p><p>—Tenant’s liability to pay rent—If landlord improperly refuses to accept the rent, the steps which tenant must rake for protection against eviction.</p><p>To sum up, the tenant must pay rent in terms of the contract, and in the absence of the contract within fifteenth day next following month on which the rent falls due, and if the landlord refuses to accept the rent tendered by the tenant the tenant must remit the rent within the aforesaid fifteenth day of the following month by money order. If the rent remitted by money order is refused, the tenant can deposit the rent with the Rent Controller within a fortnight from the date of the receipt of the undelivered rent sent through the postal authority, and when these conditions as prescribed in the Ordinance are fulfilled by the tenant, he gets the protection, otherwise the protection from ejectment on ground of default in the payment of rent granted by the Ordinance is clearly taken away by the express language of sub-section (5) of section 18.</p><p><em>Ramjan Ali Mistry Vs. Md. Headayatulla (1979) 31 DLR (AD) 183.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>—Forfeiture of protection when there is default to pay rent: </strong>The Ordinance makes no distinction between default for one month and default for more than one month or a habitual defaulter. If the default has taken place, the protection from ejectment is withdrawn. Ibid.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Sections 18 &amp; 19:</strong> Compliance with statutory conditions regarding deposit of rent, mandatory: When the conditions under sections 18 and 19 are fulfilled the tenant is entitled to protection and that the law makes no distinction between default for one month or default for more than one month or a habitual defaulter. When the conditions of section 19 are not fulfilled the tenant is not entitled to deposit rent in time and such a deposit is not a valid deposit.</p><p><em>Indra Kumar Paul Vs. Mvi. Sirejuddin Ahmed, (1979) 31 DLR 389.</em></p><p> </p><p>—Tenant’s liability to ejectment for default in payment of rent and protection against ejectment-Explained.</p><p>In case of default in payment of rent, a tenant is protected, notwithstanding the provisions of Transfer of Property Act or the Contract Act from ejectment as long as he pays rent to the full extent allowed by the East Pakistan Premises Rent Control Ordinance and he performs the conditions of the tenancy.</p><p><em>Ramjan Ali Mistry Vs.

Premises Rent Control Act is to be read subject to the provisions of other Acts. This section provides machinery within the Act for realizing the dues of repairs carried out by the tenant from the landlord but it is not the exclusive method. It must be regarded as an alternative method in addition to other methods permissible by law. Moreover the section refers to any repairs. It was not a question of mere repairs but it was a question of support of the suit premises as required to be altered by the Municipality</p><p><em>Kazi Md. Ishaque Vs.
