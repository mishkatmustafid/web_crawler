An election petition in which an allegation of corrupt or illegal practice in relation to election expenses is made, has to be filed within 14 days from the date of receipt of the return of election expenses under Article 54 of the President’s Order No. 13 of 1962.</p><p>593.</p><p><em>Jamalus Sattar Vs.

It has been further provided by way of amendment of Article 21(3) of President’s Order No. 13 of 1962 by Order No. 1 of 1963 that an election petition shall be dismissed by the Tribunal if any provision of Article 9 to 14 has not been complied with, notwithstanding that it has not been dismissed by the Commission under Article 15.</p><p><em>Mahbubul Huq Vs.

When that is not done it cannot be said that the petition becomes non- maintainable in terms of Article 21 of President’s Order No. 13 of 1962 as amended by president’s order No. I of 1963. If there had been any attempt to introduce any such particulars by way of amendment to the original election petition of which no idea could be gathered from the contents of the original election petition, then certainly the petition would be hit by Article 21 of President’s Order 13 of 1962, as amended.</p><p><em>Mahbubul Huq Vs. Chief Election Commissioner of Pakistan, (1968)20 DLR 883.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>Art. 12—All particulars of corrupt or illegal practice to be set forth: </strong>Under the provisions under Chapter III of President’s Order No. 13 of 1962, there is no provision made for the Tribunal to declare an election void on the ground of an illegal or corrupt practice adopted by the successful candidate of which no mention has been made in terms of Article 12 of the Order in the election petition.
