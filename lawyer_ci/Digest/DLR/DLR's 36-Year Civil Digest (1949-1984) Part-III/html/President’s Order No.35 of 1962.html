The result is that the Tribunal itself had ceased to function as a legally constituted authority on and from the 21st of November, 1964. Order 35 of 1962 cannot be described as an “existing law”; under Article 225(7) having come into force after the 8th June, 1962, that is, after the Constitution itself has come into force.</p><p>Therefore, the finding arrived at by Election Tribunal and the order made by it against the petitioner in this case are of no legal effect as it was passed by an authority which had no legal existence on and from the 21st November, 1964.</p><p><em>K.A.
