As, however, Article 225 contains such a provision the argument that these provisions are meant to govern only laws other than those which were operative on the authority of Article 229, cannot be accepted. President’s Orders Nos. 4 and 13 of 1962 are still in force and will cease to be operative only when a notification under section 117 of the National and Provincial Assemblies (Election) Act (IV of 1963) is issued. (Sattar. J.)</p><p><em>K.A. Kader Vs. Election Tribunal, East Pak. (1966) 18 DLR 16.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>—Ceased to have effect from 2 1. 11.64.</strong></p><p>Salahuddin Ahmed, J. (disagreeing with Sattar, J.)</p><p>President’s Orders Nos. 4 and 13 of 1962 are temporary Acts and are subject to the consequences of such Acts. Article 229 ceased to have effect on the constitution of the Electoral College as provided in Article 158 of the Constitution on the 21st November, 1964, and with this according to the accepted principle of interpretation came to an end the said Orders. The source, namely, Article 229 having ceased to exist, these orders which followed from that source, too, must die a natural death.</p><p>The expression “subject to this Constitution” in Art. 225 must necessarily mean subject to Article 229 of the Constitution as well. Article 229, by its own decree ceased to have effect on the constitution of the Electoral College of Pakistan and with this, the said orders, too, ceased to exist as if they never existed.</p><p>Article 225 having made the continuance of ‘existing law subject to the Constitution” must mean that the Article saves only such existing laws as are not hit by other provisions of the Constitution. Thus interpreted the Article does not save the said orders.   Ibid.</p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
