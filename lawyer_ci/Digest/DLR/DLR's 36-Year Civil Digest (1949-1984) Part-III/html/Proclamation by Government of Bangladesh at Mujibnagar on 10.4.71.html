In pursuance of the Proclamation of Independence and Laws Continuance Enforcement Order all laws that were in force in erstwhile East Pakistan before 25th March, 1971 should continue to be in force with such consequential changes as might be necessary on account of the creation of the State of Bangladesh.</p><p><em>Md. Yahya Vs. Government of Bangladesh (1983) 35 DLR 82.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Proclamation of Independence and Martial Law Regulation—</strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">On the 16th March, 1971 Bangladesh proclaimed independence and a proclamation was issued to that effect on 10th day of April, 1971 from Mujib Nagar.</span></p><p><em>Mullick Brothers, Appellant.

Income Tax Officer (1979) 31 DLR (AD) 165.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Martial Law as distinguished from law passed under the will of the people: </strong></p><p>The Martial Law Regulations promulgated by the Martial Law Regime lack the trappings of law. It is issued by one person who arrogates to himself all the State powers on the basis of force of arms and commands obedience to him by the force emanating from the military power.</p><p>Law, as it is understood in jurisprudence, draws its authority from the will of the people of a country and absence of the expression of that will or rather silencing that will of the people through the strength of military force cannot be substituted for the jural concept of law. Martial Law comes into existence under certain conditions and it rules the country by Regulation and Orders and such Regulation and Orders if are desired to be continued are saved and preserved by a protective clause by constitution framed by a Parliament.</p><p><em>Mullick Brothers vs. Income Tax Office (1979) 31 DLR (AD) 165.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Martial is anti-thesis of constitutional law—</strong>On return to constitutional government, regulation as referred to in the definition clause of the] General Clauses Act is a regulation made under constitutional instrument by a person or authority empowered on that behalf in Bangladesh. - Law is an anti-thesis of any Constitutional authority.</p><p><em>Mullick Brothers, Appellant.

(1979) 31 DLR (AD) 165.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>Tax assessed under Martial law Relation not legally enforceable—</strong>Tax assessed under the Regulation was not imposed under any law in force in Bangladesh immediately before the commencement of the constitution. As has already been noted it was not  under any Act, Ordinance, Order, Rule, Regulate Bye-law, Notification or other legal Instrument The amendment of Regu1atioa” in the General Clauses Act shall be deemed to have came into feet on the 26th day of March 1971. Article 83 the Constitution provides as follows: “No Tax shall be levied or collected except1 or under he authority of an Act of Parliament”. Article 83 authorizes levies or collection on under the authority of an Act of Parliament. Merely use of procedural mechanism for collection of a tax provided in the Income Tax Act, does not make the levy or collection under the authority of Act of Parliament.</p><p>Regulation being a Martial Law Regulation has not been saved by any legal Instrument of People’s Republic o Bangladesh.</p><p><em>Mullick Brothers Vs.
