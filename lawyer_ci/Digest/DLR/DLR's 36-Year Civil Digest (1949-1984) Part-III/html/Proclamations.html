It is difficult to accept the arguments in support of the view that the Constitution as such is still in force as the supreme law of the country, untrammeled by the proclamation and Martial Law Regulation.</p><p>So long the Constitution is in force as the supreme law of the country, any act done or proceeding en by a person purporting to function in connects with the affairs of the Republic or of a local authority may be made the subject-matter of review by the High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction. The moment the country is put under Martial Law, the above noted constitutional provision along with civil laws of the country loses its superior position.</p><p><em>State, People’s Republic of Bangladesh Vs.
