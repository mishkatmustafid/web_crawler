A.K.M.Rezaul Karim (1969) 21 DLR 492.</em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>S. 4—</strong>The word “finding” does not necessarily i an adverse finding—Appointing authority is empowered to refer a case to Advisory Committee.</p><p><strong><em>Md. Taiyab Ali Vs. Province of East Pakistan (1961) 23 DLR 131.</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>—</strong>The Department Head (in this case DPI) was directly subordinate to the Chief Executive (i.e. the Provincial Government represented by the Secretary of the department). A Committee under the Public Conduct (Scrutiny) Ordinance recommended the compulsory retirement of the respondent for misconduct in respect of whom the D.P.I. was the appointing authority and under the provisions of the above mentioned Ordinance was authorized to pass the final order on the recommendation of the, Committee.</p><p>In the present case the D.P.I. found himself unable to agree with the Committee recommending the compulsory retirement of the respondent and wrote to the chief executive for direction. The latter directed compulsory retirement of the respondent and the D.P.I in compliance with that direction rendered his compulsory retirement.</p><p>The respondent moved the High Court and contended that the impugned order was not a lawful order as it was not the order of the appointing authority the D.P.I who was under law authorized to act finally in his own discretion (and his inclination was just the other way) but it was the chief executive’s order which the D.P.1 faithfully carried out. The High Court upheld this contention and set aside the impugned order.</p><p><strong>Held</strong>: The question in this case is not merely as to the exercise of discretion, but whether, in the direct line of subordination, such as obtain between the chief executive and the Head of a Department, it is necessary, to maintain a power in the Departmental Head independent of, and if necessary mop- position to, the power of the Chief Executive.</p><p>The DPI made his order as befits a subordinate authority, as to the exercise of discretion vested in him, in an executive matter. It is not dishonesty fop a subordinate to submit his judgment to that of an executive superior.</p><p>The judicial power of the Crown in the prerogative can never be employed so as to create conflict between senior and subordinate in a direct line of executive authority.</p><p>There can be no excess or abuse of authority in the exercise of, on the executive side, by superiors over subordinates.</p><p><strong><em>Province of East Pakistan vs. Amir Hossain (1963) 15 DLR (SC) 110.</em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>—Governor has the power to revoke his earlier order</strong></p><p>On the basis of the recommendation of the Screening Committee the Governor on 28.6.59 passed an order of compulsory retirement of respondent, under section 4 of the Public Conduct (Scrutiny) Ordinance and accordingly a notification was issued notifying the fact of retirement.</p><p>The recommendation of the Screening Committee was not accepted by the Advisory Committee who found the respondent fit and competent.
