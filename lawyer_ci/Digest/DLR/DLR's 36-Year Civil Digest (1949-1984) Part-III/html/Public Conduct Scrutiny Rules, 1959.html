Misconduct—Canvassing for cancellation of transfer order -‘unbecoming of officer’s office’</strong></p><p><em>Province of East Pakistan Vs. Muhd. Sajjad Ali Muzumdar (1962) 14 DLR (SC) 13.</em></p><p>—The notification by which the respondent was reduced in rank said that he was guilty of inefficiency and misconduct. There being no charge of inefficiency against the respondent reference of inefficiency in the notifications was otiosc. The mere presence of the charge of inefficiency does not, however, indicate that Government failed altogether to apply its mind to the case.</p><p><strong>Rule 2</strong> under which action against the respondent was taken did not contain the word ‘misconduct’ but contained the words ‘guilty of conduct contrary to good order or unbecoming his office.’</p><p>It was contended that the word ‘misconduct’ which has not been defined in the Ordinance or Rules normally should be interpreted by the Court narrowly in the sense of an infringement of a binding rule of conduct applicable to Government servants.</p><p>The expression “misconduct” in the notification has been used in the wide sense of improper conduct. Ibid.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>R. 2(a)(b)(c). Reputations of being corrupt different from misconduct and inefficiency from both.</strong></p><p>Under rule 2 of the Public Conduct (Scrutiny). Rules the offence of general and persistent reputation of being corrupt is an offence which is distinct and different from that mentioned in sub-clause (b), namely, misconduct or conduct unbecoming his office and lastly, inefficiency is a separate offence by itself. Again under clause (b) of this rule a difference has been made between the offences with which Government Servants on the one hand and persons holding the other offices specified in clause (1) of Article 6of the Laws (Continuance in Force) Order on the other hand, may be charged.</p><p><em>Muhd. Sajjad Ali Vs. Province of East Pak. (1961) 13 DLR 175.</em></p><p>—Proceeding before the Screening Committees and Appointing Authority are not judicial proceeding. Ibid.</p><p>—Government servants in screening proceedings are not to be condemned unheard—substance of charge should be provided. Ibid.</p><p> </p><p><strong>—Disregard of provisions of law by the Committee is a misuse of power</strong></p><p>In the category of actions considered to be ‘malafide,’ actions described as “misuse of powers” even “abuse of powers” or as acts done in “colorable exercise of powers” are also included.</p><p>A total disregard of the provision prescribed by the statute or rules amounts to a misuse of powers and brings it within the ambit of an act which in fact it is not taken though it purports to have been taken under the statute.   Ibid.</p><p> </p><p><strong>—Appointing authority’s power of Punishment not dependant on the committee’s recommendation.</strong></p><p>Discretion of the appointing authority as regards the punishment to be imposed is not in any way fettered by the recommendation offered by the Screening Committee. Ibid</p><p> </p><p><strong>R. 2(c):</strong> A Government official retired compulsorily from service by the Governor under sub-clause (b) of clause 5 of Article 6 is valid in law after the introduction of sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (5) vided the order of retirement is passed before the July of 1959. The Laws (Continuance in Force) Ordinance 1958 is a super constitutional law and has a riding effect over all other laws.</p><p><em>Govt. of East Pakistan Vs. Mr. Murzuqullah (1969) 21 DLR (SC) 16.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Rule 2(2):</strong> Compulsory retirement order the ground of unsatisfactory service’ or upon recommendation of the Screening made on 24.4.59 not legal and operative inasmuch any basis for such recommendation for retiring a 1 son on the ground of inefficiency was no available on 24.4.52, that ground have been with effect from 28.2.59 from the statute con namely, Public Conduct (Scrutiny) Rules 1959. being basis of the order in the present case it be said that it was passed by the Governor under dc 7(5) of the laws (Continuance in Force) Order.</p><p><em>Naziruddin Ahmed Vs. Prov. of East Pakistan (1968)20 DLR 394.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>Rr. 6 and 7. Rules framed have to force of the provisions of the Ordinance itself.</strong></p><p>The phrase “shall pass orders thereon according to law” in section 4 of the Public Conduct (Scrutiny) Ordinance comprehends as well the Rules framed undo the Ordinance.</p><p>The Rules stand on the same footing as the substantive provisions of the Ordinance and consequently the infraction of the Rules would have the effect of taking an order passed out of the purview of the Ordinance itself.</p><p>Rules 6 and 7 require the appointing authority to consider any appeal, filed within 15 days, by any person concerned against the recommendation of the Screening Committee. Where therefore the appointing authority without allowing 15 days time to prefer appeal against the recommendation of the Screening Committee passed orders immediately on receipt of recommendations.</p><p><strong>Held:</strong> An essential part of the procedure designed to ensure a fair heating to the person conned not being complied with, the impugned order could not be said to be immune from challenge, in view of the bar raised by section 10 of the Ordinance.</p><p><em>Sardar Muhd. Zaman Khan vs. M B. Nishat (1962) 14 DLR (SC) 1.</em></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
