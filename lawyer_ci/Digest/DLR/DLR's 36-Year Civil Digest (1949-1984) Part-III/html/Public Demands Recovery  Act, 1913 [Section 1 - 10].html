Mahim Chandra (1962) 14 DLR 213.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>S. 4:</strong> <strong>Certificate against dead person void and also the sale there under—</strong>A certificate was issued in the name of one Jagadish Chandra Ganguly by the Certificate Officer of Mymensingh and was transferred to the Certificate Officer of Dacca for execution. The Certificate debtor was in fact one Jagadish Chandra Banarjee. It is admitted that Jagadish Chandra Banarjee died in 1946 and the certificate was filed in 1956. After receipt of the peon’s report the Certificate Officer of Dacca substituted the heirs of Jagadish Chandra Binarjee and the sale was held.</p><p><strong>Held:</strong> The certificate issued is void having been issued against a dead person. The Certificate Officer of Dacca could only return the certificate to the Certificate Officer of Mymensingh for necessary correction. As this has not been done in the present case not only sale but also the certificate proceedings pursuant to which the sale is made is absolutely void.</p><p><em>Yar Ahmad Vs. Province of East Pakistan, (1968) 20 DLR 1103.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>—Ss. 4 and 5:</strong> Duty of the certificate officer is to satisfy himself that a particular demand was recoverable and in a long drawn and complicated case, the certificate officer should not shift the onus (as to the clearance of the certificate dues) entirely upon the certificate debtor.</p><p><em>Jitendra Nath Das Vs. Income Tax Officer, (1969) 21 DLR (BR) 12.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>—S. 4:</strong> A certificate against a dead person is void ab- initio and a fresh certificate must issue against the legal representatives of the deceased.</p><p><em>Abdul Jahl Shaikh Vs.

Omission of these words does not affect validity of a certificate.</p><p><em>Shafiqur Rahman Vs. Certificate Officer (1977) 29 DLR (SC) 234.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>—S. 4. Party to Certificate Proceeding.</strong></p><p>The plaintiff purchased the share of the defendants in a holding in a money sale and the landlord’s. fees and notice were duly sent to the landlord before the confirmation of the sale on 29.9.34.</p><p>Thereafter, in a certificate sale under the Public Demands Recovery Act against the recorded tenants only in which the plaintiff was not impleaded as a party, the holding was put to sale and purchased by one M and 2 others on 8.4.35.</p><p>Thereafter, in a suit by the plaintiff, he gave up his title in the land to the defendants by a compromise decree. The holding was again sold in execution of a rent decree and was purchased by the plaintiff, the defendants not being made parties to the rent suit or the execution proceeding. An application by the defendants for setting aside the sale under sec. 174 of the Bengal Tenancy Act was dismissed on the ground that they had no interest and, therefore, no locus standi. The plaintiff then attempted to take possession of the land but was resisted by the defendants. Hence the present suit for declaration of title and possession.</p><p><strong>Held</strong>: The plaintiff not being made a party in the Certificate sale or suit sale, his title in the land remains intact and went to the benefit of the defendants under he compromise decree. Even if it be conceded that the plaintiff had no title at the time of the compromise decree, still, after subsequent acquisition of title under the rent sale, he would be estopped by the principle of ‘estoppel by the conduct” from taking such a plea and re-asserting his title to the land he previously gave to the defendants under the compromise decree.</p><p><strong>Also held</strong>: The applications under sec. 174 of the Bengal Tenancy Act was neither a suit nor a continuation of a suit, and did not operate as res judicata against the defendants and in favour of the plaintiff. The appeal was dismissed.</p><p><em>Upendra Ch. Acharya Vs. Prazap Ch. Sutradhar.

Provisions of section 7 explained: </strong>Service of notice and copy of certificate served on certificate debtor.</p><p>Section 7 says that when a certificate has been filed the Certificate Officer shall serve upon the certificate-debtor in the prescribed manner a. notice in the prescribed form. After service of the notice, when a period of 30 days has elapsed, and no objection has been taken in terms of the Act, the Certificate Officer under section 14 shall proceed with the attachment id sale, or sale without previous attachment of any property or attachment of the decree, or arrest and detention of the certificate-debtor as the case may require.</p><p>The prescribed manner is to be found in rules 2 to 9 contained in Schedule H of the Act. A reading of the rules shows that there must be an attempt to serve the notice directly on the certificate-debtor in. But there is also the alternative provisions for service, by way of substituted service, if the attempt personal service fails that is contained in Rules 6 (a) (b)</p><p><em>Golam Hafez Mia Vs. Khadem Ali Mia (1971) 23 DLR 9.</em></p><p> </p><p>—Decision in the case of Md. Muslim Ali Molla held to be wrong.</p><p>The decision in Mohammad Muslem Ali Molla’s (PLR 1957 Dac. 6) which says that rule 6(b) cannot be resorted to for service under section 7 of the Act is not correct. For substituted service of notice under section 7 of the Act, both the alternative clauses (a) and (b) of rule 6 can be resorted to, according to the facts of exact case. Ibid.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>—Consequences following from service of notice under section 7.</strong></p><p>On the service of notice under section 7 the consequences following from it are first: any private transfer of any immovable property in the district where certificate is filed is void, and secondly, the certificate dues become a charge upon the immovable property of certificate-debtor throughout the country. Ibid.</p><p>—Sections 7-10. Any variation from the prescribed form would not be fatal in a certificate issued under the Bengal Public Demands Recovery Act for realisation of certificate dues.</p><p><em>Shafiqur Rahman Vs. Certificate Officer (1977) 29 DLR (SC) 233.</em></p><p>—If no certificate is filed having the force of a decree no valid sale can be held under the certificate. Ibid.</p><p> </p><p><strong>—Requirements to comply with the provisions embodied in sections 7, 8, 9, &amp;10.</strong></p><p>It is necessary to refer to the sections mentioned above namely, 7.8, 9 and 10. By section 7 when certain public demands were in arrears, the Collector of the district was to make under his hand a certificate (in the Form 2 given in the said Act) for the amount of such arrears remaining unpaid and was to cause the same to be filed in his office. By section 8 such certificate should, as regards the remedies for enforcing the same, have the force and effect of a decree of a civil court. Under section 10 such certificate having been filed in the office of the Collector, he has to issue to the Judgment- debtors a copy of such certificate and a notice in form No. 4 as given in the Act, and such certificate from the time it was served would bind all the immovable properties of the debtor if it has been attached under section 274 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Old). Such certificate u/s 19 of the Act is to be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code as a demand for money.</p><p><em>Shafiqur Rahman Vs. Certificate Officer (1977) 29 DLR (SC) 234.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>—Ss. 7 and 36.</strong> Notice under section 7 is found as not a proper service on the certificate- debtor. What is the effect of this improper service of notice under section 7? Under section 36 it does not make the sale void but the defendant could have challenged it either in the certificate proceeding or by a suit. It appears that he did file a case to set aside the sale before the Revenue Authority but failed: But he did not pursue his remedy by a suit. Could he be allowed to challenge it collaterally in the present suit? On the plain language of section 36 of the Act he cannot.</p><p><em>Julfu Molla Vs.
