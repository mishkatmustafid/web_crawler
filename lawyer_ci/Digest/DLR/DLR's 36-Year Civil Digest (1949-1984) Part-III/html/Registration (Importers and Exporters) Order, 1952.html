Suspension of export or import certificate pending an enquiry.</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The question arose was whether the principles of natural justice would he attracted to a case of temporary suspension of an export and import certificate pending enquiry into the conduct of the exporter or importer.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Suspension may be a punitive suspension or one in aid of an enquiry. An order in the nature of punishment is always required to be preceded by a properly constituted enquiry. The other kind of suspension is designed to facilitate the due prosecution of the enquiry. Such a temporary suspension is deemed to be an implied term in every contract of service.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;">Messrs East Exports Vs. Chief Controller of Imports &amp; Exports (1965) 17 DLR (SC) 508.</span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—Temporary suspension of an export or import certificate has different consequences from the suspension of Government servants.</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">On this principle it may be said that the Chief Controller can also exercise this power summarily pending an enquiry against the Importer (as in the present case). It must, however, be remembered that the Government servant, by reason of his suspension, does not lose his office or suffer degradation. He merely ceases to discharge the duties of his office during pendency o the departmental enquiry against him. Ho also draws a subsistence allowance during the period of suspension. In the event of his honor- able acquittal he is allowed to draw full salary for the period of suspension.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Clause 4(4)</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;"> On the other hand, if an Export or Import Registration Certificate is temporarily suspended, it may cause incalculable harm to the importer or exporter for which he cannot get any redress even if later on the order of suspension is withdrawn. If suspension continues longer it may even totally destroy his trade. It is, therefore, desirable that this summary power should be exercised very sparingly, and that too only when the urgency of the situation demands it. Even then the authority concerned should without the least possible delay inform the person concerned of the charges against him.
