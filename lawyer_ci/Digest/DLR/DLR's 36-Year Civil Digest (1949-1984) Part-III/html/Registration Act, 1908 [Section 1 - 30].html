Petition of compromise in a rent suit enhancing rent whether requires registration.</strong></p><p>In a suit for rent of agricultural land the annual rental was enanced from Rs. 16-odd to Rs. 25 odd by an unregistered solenama which was incorporated in the decree. In a subsequent suit for rent at the enhanced rate of rent, the question arose whether in the absence of registration, the compromise decree in the earlier rent suit incorporating the terms of the compromise was admissible in evidence in view of section 49 of the Registration Act.</p><p><strong>Held</strong>: As the compromise petition amounted to a present demise which did not come within any exception in section 17(2) of the Registration Act, it was compulsorily registrable under section 17(1) of the Act, and is inadmissible under section 49 of the Act in the absence of registration. <em>8 PLR (Dac.) 394.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>S.17.

If it was the intention of the parties that it would not be acted upon till the consideration money was passed, then simply the execution and registration of the document will not confer title on the transferee.

Held: No rights of ownership in the prop- city were transferred by the document to the plaintiff. It is also difficult to spell out of this agreement any exemption from accountability for the rents realised to the owner although it seems that, in consideration of the services to be rendered in recovering rents, the plaintiff was authorized to use the rent personally also. No express words were to indicate that the plaintiff would not be liable to account for everything that he had realised by way of rent to the owner.</p><p>In the circumstances it is clear that the document did not create any interest in immovable property and did not operate as an assignment of future rents. It was, therefore, not compulsorily registerable under section 17 of the Registration Act.</p><p><em>Riazul Ambia vs. lbrahim (1961) 13 DLR (SC) 32.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>— S. 17.
