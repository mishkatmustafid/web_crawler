Question of knowledge or lack of knowledge about pendency of appeal or revision irrelevant, the bar to review being complete.</p><p><em>Ghulam Mohiud-Din Vs. C.S. Commr.

Rahman and Hamoodur Rahman, 3.3.) was that such authority has no power review its own order. The power of review in this context cannot be regarded as ancillary to the revisional power conferred on the delegate. A power of review is a creature of the statute and it cannot be id that a delegate exercising revisional powers under sub-section (2) of section 20 of the Act has inherent power to review orders passed in his capacity as a delegate.</p><p><em>Mst.

(differing from the majority view) expressed the opinion that such power of review by the sub-ordinate officer does exist.</p><p>His Lordship further held that there is an inherent power of review, that is, whoever has the authority to review it, without there being any specific provision.</p><p>The power to review an order goes with the power to pass the order whether one calls it an ancillary power or a power that accompanies or is inherent in the power to pass an order.
