The words “such goods shall be liable to confiscation” in the penalties column could only refer to goods which had been the subject of an offence of that character by an importer or exporter or his abetter or agent. The mere finding of goods that may have been initially brought into the country against a prohibition or restriction without paying the necessary duty, in the hands of an innocent transferee, was within the mischief of section 167(8).</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Federation of Pakistan Vs.

This part refers to the cases where the goods shown in the import manifest are lost or are none existing. But so far as the second part is concerned, the section does not refer to any place of measurement and there is nothing in the section to indicate that measurement must Sc taken on board only and nowhere else.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The proper time and place of actual measurement according to common sense should be place where the oil is finally discharged.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Hegge &amp; Co.

The presumption, therefore, with respect to any goods which may be sold in the open market, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, would be that the duty has been paid on them.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Pakistan Vs.

The words of items (81) arc unambiguous and expressly make goods of the relevant kind liable to confiscation and their possession an offence from the date of the amendment. No question of giving retrospective effect to such a provision arises. From the date of promulgation of the Ordinance, anyone, who retained possession of such goods, however or whenever they might have been acquired could do so at his peril.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Federation of Pak.

Prosecutions duty under section 167, item (81) is to show  the goods are chargeable with duty which has not been paid or their importation is prohibited. Under section 177-A, the onus is on the defense to prove that the duty on the goods seized had been paid or they had been imported before the imposition or restriction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Collector of Customs, Karachi Vs.

Ibid.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—The section lays down a procedural rule and it is, well-settled that any change in procedure would affect pending actions or proceedings. Ibid.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>—S.177-A. Presumption rose under section 177-A. Presumption raised under section 177-A is only with respect to the goods and no presumption as to the person who committed the act.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The presumption raised by virtue of section 177- A is only as to an act having been committed, and there is no presumption as to the person who committed the act. Even if the first part of section 177-A were applicable, yet the person from whose possession the goods were seized could not have been found guilty on the basis of that presumption alone. For there will be no presumption that it was he who committed an act to defraud the Government. So far as the second part of section 177- A is concerned, this too raises a presumption only as to the commission of the act to evade a prohibition or restriction and not with respect to the person who committed the act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Further the presumption under section 117-A even if it is raised with respect to a particular person is not sufficient for holding that person guilty inasmuch as an act may be committed in violation of a prohibition or restriction and yet it may not be committed “knowingly and with intent to evade” the prohibition or restriction and unless this element of “knowingly and with intent to evade” is found to exist no offence can be said to have been committed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Presumption under section 177-A which arises as to an act would not be sufficient proof of guilt as against the person in possession. And that being so the proper procedure for application of section 177-A would be that the officer who seizes the goods states the grounds of his belief in order that the reasonableness of the belief may be tested.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Pakistan Vs.

He is not bound to conform to the provisions of the Evidence Act. But in exercising a judicial or quasi-judicial function, he decides in a judicial spirit and manner in conformity to well recognized principles of natural justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Osman Abdul Karim Bawaney Vs.
