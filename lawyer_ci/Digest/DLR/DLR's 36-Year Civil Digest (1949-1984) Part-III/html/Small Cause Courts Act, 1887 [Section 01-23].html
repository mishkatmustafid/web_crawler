Thus a suit for ejectment of a tenant which is not exclusively triable by a particular court or officer is not contained within the ambit of article 4) of the Second Schedule. In view of the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 15 of the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act, 1887, such Suits arc cognizable and triable by a Court of Small Causes.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Even in a case where the principal point is one relating to the question of determination of title, the same can be considered and decided by a Court of Small Causes provided the suit is otherwise triable by such a Court and does not fall outside the ambit of its jurisdiction in views of the subject- matter being included within the list of articles mentioned in the Second Schedule of the Small Cause Courts Act.

The suit being of a certain value it has to be filed before the judge either in his ordinary file or in his Small Cause Court file and he keeps it in one file instead of the other and adopts a procedure other than that prescribed for a Small Cause Court suit, that by itself will not alter the character of the suit, for the mode of trial does not change the character of the suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Shamsuddin Pradhan Vs.

As the judge had the powers of a judge of the Small Cause, he must have tried the suit as a judge of the Small Cause Court, even if the procedure adopted by him is not one of Small Cause Court.

The section does not extinguish the jurisdiction but only prevents the exercise of it, if the suit is recognizable by a Small Cause Court. If a Court by error tries a Suit which is of a nature cognizable by a Small Cause Court exercising jurisdiction within the same limits, then the proceedings of the Court are not entirely without jurisdiction and therefore, arc not a nullity. Such a case is not a case of want of jurisdiction. It is a case of exercise of jurisdiction in violation of the prohibition imposed by sec. 16 of the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act. The executing Court is not competent to treat the decree as a nullity nor is it open to the defendant to impeach it, he having raised no objection to the trial.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Mofizuddin Mia vs. Muslim Khandakar (1954) 6 DLR 588.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>—S. 16—</strong>On a true construction of section 9 read with Order 46, rule 7, C.P. Code it is clear that trial of a small cause by a Court not invested with small cause court’s power is not a nullity when no objection to such trial was taken initially.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Even apart from rule 7 of Order 46 of the Code of Civil Procedure on a true construction of section 9 of the Code and section 16 of the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act, the only conclusion that can be reached is that violation of the provisions of section 16, through mistake and in the absence of an objection by any parties to the suit, cannot render the trial of a small Cause suit by a Court not invested with Small Cause Court powers a nullity.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Sansosh Lal Gape Vs.

Judge cannot be a case for want of jurisdiction in spite of the violation of the provision imposed by section 16 of the Small Cause Courts Act since the Legislature intended to cure such defect by taking recourse to the provision of Order 46, rule 7(2) of the C.P. Code. So, unless it is found that substantial justice has not been meted out by the court who tries the suit, the decree cannot be set aside simply on the ground that the case was tried by a Court other than the Small Cause Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Neyaz Ahmed Khan Vs.

Its decision on the question of title wills not, of course, be final arid, therefore, will not be res judicata in a suit brought before a Civil Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The provision of section 23 of the Small Cause Courts Act does not lay down that an issue as to title renders a S.C.C. suit non-maintainable as such but enacts that the authority of a S.C.C. judge to hear such a suit is discretionary.<em> Merajuddin Vs.
