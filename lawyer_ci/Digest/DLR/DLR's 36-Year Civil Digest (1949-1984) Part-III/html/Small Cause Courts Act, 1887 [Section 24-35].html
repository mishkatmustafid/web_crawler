The test, as provided in section 27 read with sec. 25 of the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act, is’ that the suit in question should not only be in the nature of Small Cause Courts suit but it must also be decided by a Court of Small Causes.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In the absence of a Munsif invested with Small Cause Courts power, a suit which is otherwise as a Small Cause Courts suit will have to be tried as an ordinary money suit and as against such a decision an appeal will lie.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Motiullah Shaikh Vs.

To say merely that it has considered the evidence and it is satisfied that a particular plea cannot be believed is not sufficient.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Alauddin Mia &amp; anr.

The suit was filed before him for refund of earnest money valued at Rs. over 500/- and the Munsif, in consequence, tried the suit in his ordinary evil jurisdiction. A first appeal was taken against the decision of the Munsif to the Subordinate Judge.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Relying on the principle enunciated in (1954) 6 DLR 277 it was contended that the present suit being a suit of the nature of Small Cause Courts even though it was tried under the ordinary civil jurisdiction, no appeal lay against the decision of the Munsif. Overruling this contention it was held— The Munsif in the present case who tried the Suit was not invested with powers to try a suit of the nature of Small Cause exceeding in value of Rs. 300/- and as such he had jurisdiction to try the suit in the ordinary civil jurisdiction and the order passed by him was appealable.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Ahmad Haldar Vs.

The test, as provided in section 27 read with section 25 of the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act, is that the suit in question should not only be in the nature of Small Cause Courts suit but it must also be decided by a Court of Small Causes. In the absence of a Munsif invested with Small Cause Courts power, a suit which is otherwise as a Small Cause Courts suit will have to be tried as an ordinary money suit and as against such a decision an appeal will lie.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;">Motiullah Shaikh Vs.

Where the Court of first instance was not such a Court the decree passed by it would not be final and would be appealable under section % of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Santosh Lal Gope Vs.

(I) applicable. The words “suits instituted or proceedings commenced” in sub-sec.(2) mean when the plaint is presented or the application is put in. If at that time there is no Court of Small Cause in the locality and the suit or application is Filed in a Civil Court that sub-section would apply, even if the presiding judge of the Civil Court be later on invested with Small Cause Court powers.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A suit, if rightly instituted as a regular suit would continue to remain as a regular suit and must be tried as a regular suit, even though the officer trying it may at the time of its trial, but subsequent to the institution thereof, have been invested with the necessary Small Cause Court powers.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Md.

It therefore follows that the trial procedure prescribed in the Code shall be followed in all suits cognizable by a Court of Small Causes except to the extent excluded. Provisions of section 144 of the Code which has not been excluded is available to the Court of Small Causes and the power is to be exercised when language of section is attracted to the facts of the case before it.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Sayeb Ali…Appellant Vs.
