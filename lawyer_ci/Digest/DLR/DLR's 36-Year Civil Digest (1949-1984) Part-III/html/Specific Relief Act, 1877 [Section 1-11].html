A party adversely affected in a suit under the section has an alternative remedy by way of a regular suit for establishing title and it covering possession or by way of revision to High Court under section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code, but any order passed in appeal, against the express provisions of law, as contained in the last part of section 9, Specific Relief Act, must be held to be without jurisdiction and a nullity in the eye of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Nawabzada Muhammad Umar Khan Vs.
