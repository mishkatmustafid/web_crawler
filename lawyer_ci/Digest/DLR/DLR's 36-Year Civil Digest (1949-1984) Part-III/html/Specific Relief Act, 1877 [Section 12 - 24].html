In equity jurisdiction, it has often been said that equity may treat land as money or money as land for the purpose of doing justice in the case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Joydeb Agarwala Vs. Baitulmal Karkhana (1964)16 DLR (SC) 706.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>S. 15—Applicability of the section</strong>—is confined to a case where the vendor purports to sell the whole property making no reference to any co sharer, when in fact a co-sharer exists.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">On a proper reading of section 15 of the Specific Relief Act it becomes plain that this section would have application if the vendor had expressly purported to sell the whole property to the plaintiff, making no reference to any co-sharer. But where (as in the present case) the agreement expressly says that the vendor undertakes to get the property duly and legally conveyed in favour of the vendee by his co-sharer the provisions of sec. 15 of the Specific Relief Act have no application.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">This circumstance makes it clear that the vendor (as in the present case) was not entering into an agreement by which he was obliging himself to convey the whole property to the plaintiff and consequently the provisions of sec Lion 15 cannot be called in aid (to the present case).</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Anwara Chowdhury Vs. M. Majid (1964) 16 DLR (SC) 609.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>—Applicability of the section when a part of a contract can be performed and a part cannot be performed.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section 15 is applicable only where the defendant made a representation that the whole of the property belonged to him, which eventually turned out not to be correct. The section has no application where the defendant contracted on his behalf and on behalf of a minor and it is found that the contract is unenforceable against the minor. The object of enactment of section 15 is to provide for abatement of compensation when the title of the persons agreeing to sell or lease is defective.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The section applies only when “a party to the contract is unable to perform the whole of his part of it.” A defendant who holds himself out as the owner of the entire property and whose claim turns out not to be correct is the party to the contract who is unable to perform the whole of his part of it, because it was his duty to convey the whole property to the plaintiff. Section 15 applies to him. But when a defendant contracts on his behalf and on behalf of a minor and it is found that the contract is unenforceable against the minor then that defendant is not a party to the contract who is unable to perform the whole of his part of it.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Archana Prasad Nandi, Vs.

Before the actual transfer of the property M.R. died leaving behind the plaintiff and the defendant in the case as his heirs and legal representatives and the share which the plaintiff got was 1/4th of the property and remaining 3/4th fell to the share of the defendant. After Mr.’s death plaintiffs filed the present suit against the defendant to transfer the 4th share of the property on the basis of the contract with M.R. Question arose whether the plaintiffs claim in the case amounts to enforcing a part of contract within the meaning of section 17 of the Specific Relief Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Held :</strong> In this case after the death of M.R. 1/ 4th share of the property has devolved on the plaintiff and the defendant has inherited the specific 3/4th share of M.R. and it cannot therefore be said thai defendant’s share is either undefined or indivisible.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The share of defendant is well defined and capable of being specifically enforced and if the contract is enforced against the defendant there will be performance of the whole contract and no part will remain unperformed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In granting specific performance against the defendant the obligations under the whole contract arc satisfied and so it cannot be held that in allowing the suit there will be violation of the provisions of section 17 of the Specific Relief Act which prohibits enforcement of a part of contract and, therefore, it cannot be said that it will amount to allowing specific performance of part of the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Nur Nessa Khatun Vs. Saleha Rahman (1974) 26 DLR 347.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>—When specific performance of contract cannot be granted</strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">. The general rule of equity is that the Court will not compel specific performance of a contract unless it can enforce the whole contract. This rule is embodied in section 17 of the Specific Relief Act. Under section 17 a contract cannot be specifically enforced in part except under situations provided for under sections 14, 15 &amp; 16 of the said Act. </span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A<em>rchana Prasad Nandi Vs.

The expression “any party thereto” in clause (a) does not mean any one of the parties to the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The plain meaning of clause (b) of section 23 appears to be that the representative-in-interest of any one of the several joint promises may claim specific performance of a contract. If that be so, there is no reason why any of the several joint promises should not be entitled to obtain specific performance of a contract under clause (a) of section 23.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Part performance of contract enforceable in relation to cases under sections 15, 16 and 17 of the Specific Relief Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In view of the rigid provision of section 17 of the Specific Relief Act, specific performance of a part of contract can be obtained only in a case covered by any of the sections 14, 15 and 16 of the Specific Relief Act and not otherwise.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">All co-promises under a contract ought to be joined as plaintiffs in a suit where performance of the contract is claimed.

A court cannot foist upon an unwilling private firm an employee whom it has thought fit to get rid of, and to that end, rightly or wrongly whom it has discharged, or whom, for one reason or the other, the firm is unwilling to accept. Should an employee, however, feel aggrieved and consider that he has been wrongfully and illegally discharged, all that he can seek from a Court is damage and not his reinstatement, which the Court is not competent at all to order.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Although an employee may establish that he has been wrongly dismissed, still he is not entitled to the remedy of an injunction or of specific performance inasmuch as a contract involving his personal service cannot be specifically enforced in view of section 21(b) of the Specific <em>Relief Act. </em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Azizar Rahman Vs.
