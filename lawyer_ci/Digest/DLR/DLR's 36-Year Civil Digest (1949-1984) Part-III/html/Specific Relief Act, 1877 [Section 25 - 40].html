With regard to the question as to what should be the quantum of proof that a person claiming to have purchased the property in good faith without notice should offer, it seems that since the onus is to disprove notice, the burden is a light one and may even be shifted by a mere denial of the factum of the notice on oath.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Dula Mia Vs.

Held—Prayers are purely for declaration only for which a fixed court-fee under Article 17(iii) of the Court-Fees Act payable.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">If suit be framed as one for declaration that certain document is void, should it be treated as one coming under section 42 or section 39 of the Specific Relief Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">(Hasan, J)—The first prayer for a declaration that the documents arc void ab initio comes under section 39 of the Specific Relief Act and the second prayer that the defendants have acquired no interest in the premises by virtue of the said documents comes under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act. They are prayer for declaration only and nothing more.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The prayer (b) is nothing but the ground in support of prayer (a). As such the plaintiff is liable to pay fixed court-fee under Article 17(iii), Schedule II of Court-fees Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Court is not bound to give relief for cancellation of a document in every case under section 39 of the Specific Relief Act by canceling the document, whether there is a prayer for cancellation or not.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The language of section 39 does not make it obligatory on the Court to order the instrument to be delivered up or cancelled even if not so prayed for. A relief may be granted when it is prayed for and not otherwise.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Where illegality of the document appears on the face of it, its cancellation may not be necessary. Where a person not a party to the instrument, apprehending injury thereby sues to have it adjudged void or voidable, he is not in a position to pray for cancellation. In such cases plaintiff cannot be compelled to pray for advisories court-fee for it. Where illegality or nullity of the document is non-apparent, the danger of its use in defense is always there and in such cases cancellation and delivering up of the document is necessary and the Court may give such relief. But the relief shall have to be prayed for and unless prayed for, it cannot be granted nor can the plaintiff be forced to pray for it and pay advalorem court fee for it. A suiter has absolute authority to frame his suit as he likes; he may suffer or gain for so doing.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Daibakilal Basak Vs. Iqbal Ahmed Quarishi (1965) 17 DLR 119.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—(Sattar, J.)—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">The suit as framed is a purely declaratory one in which the document need not be cancelled. Plaintiff is to pay fixed court-fees for declarations separately in respect of several documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A document to which the plaintiff is not a party need not be cancelled and mere declaration that it is void is sufficient. Only a document which has vested efface a valid claim, needs to be challenged. A forged document does not come under this category.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">If, however, the plaintiff asks for cancellation of a forged document, though such cancellation is not needed, he must pay for it.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">If on consideration of the plaint as a whole, the Court finds that there are both prayers for declaration and cancellation is to be ordered having regard to the case made out in the plaint, fixed court-fee under Article 17(iii) Schedule If of the Court-fees Act is not sufficient.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Simply because section 39 of the Specific Relief Act contemplates that relief of cancellation can be granted by the Court, even when the plaintiff has not asked for it, it cannot be said that the plaintiff need not pay for ii. The plaintiff must pay for the relief if it is granted by the Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is not necessary to cancel a document in every case. It depends upon the facts of a case. Relief of cancellation under section 39 need not be specifically asked for in view of the language of the section. It may be granted by the Court. If such a relief has to be given, the plaintiff must pay for it and payment of fixed court-fee for mere declaration is not sufficient.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Daibakilal Basak Vs. Iqbal Ahmed Quarishi (1965) 17 DLR 119</em>.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">(Sayem, J.)—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">The contention that in a suit under section 39 of the Specific Relief Act, plaintiff need not specifically pray for cancellation and that the section casts a duty on the Court to grant the relief cannot stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is only the relief specified in the second paragraph of the section 39 which provides that if the instrument has been registered under the Registration Act, the Court shall, in its discretion, adjudge it void or voidable and order it to be delivered up and cancelled, send a copy of its decree to the registration of- lice for noting the fact of cancellation, and that need not be prayed for. The discretion mentioned in the section cannot relate to adjudgment alone but also to the relief of cancellation. A discretion conferred on the Court cannot be exercised in favour of a party even though the party chooses not to ask for its exercise. It cannot be said that once an instrument is &amp; judged void the discretion of the Court for cancellation is to follow, just as the relief set out in the second paragraph is to follow an order of cancellation.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;">Daibakilal Basak Vs. Iqbal Ahmed Quarishi (1965) 17 DLR 119.</span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>—It is not necessary to pray for cancellation in every suit under section 39 of the Specific Relief Act.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section 39 primarily provides a relief by way of a declaration. It does not expressly provide, as is done by the proviso to section 42, that an omission to pray for a further relief that might be asked for in the suit would entail its dismissal. If cancellation is not prayed for in such a suit, or having been prayed for has been refused, in a subsequent Suit for cancellation the plaintiff may be confronted with the bar under Order 2, rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or by a bar of limitation, or by some other bars. But that cannot be a reason for the Court to assume that every Suit brought under section 39 of the Specific Relief Act is to contain a prayer for cancellation, and to insist on payment of an enhanced court-fee. It I only after the trial that the Court is called upon to consider the question as to, if, in exercise of its retionary power under the section, a bare declaraurn should be granted. If the plaintiff is a party to instrument, the Court refuses as a rule to grant  a declaratory relief, on the ground that the imminent, in such a case, need be avoided by cancellation. The plaintiff in such a case is required to pray for cancellation, by way of a consequential relief. Where, however, the plaintiff is not a party to the instrument no such difficulty arises. There he is entitled to a simple declaratory relief.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Daibakilal Basak Vs. Iqbal Ahmed Quarishi (1965) 17 DLR 119.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>—“Suit for declaration that the instrument is not binding on the plaintiff” and “a suit for cancellation of instrument</strong><strong>”— Difference.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">There is a difference between a suit for declaration that the instrument is not binding on the plaintiff and a suit for cancellation of an instrument When the plaintiff seeks to establish a title to himself and cannot establish that title without removing an obstruction such as a decree or a deed to which he has been a party, then he must get that decree or deed cancelled or declared void and his suit is in substance a suit for cancellation of the decree or deed, as the case may be, even though it be framed as a suit for a mere declaration.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Where a document is to be set aside or declared null and void by a person who is a party to the deed, a mere declaration would not do and cancellation of the deed is a necessary relief unless the document is void ab initio. But a person who is not a party to the deed is not bound to have it set aside or cancelled and a mere declaration that it will not affect the plaintiffs right would be quite enough. If the plaintiff is bound to have the document set aside or declared null and void the plaint must be treated as including a prayer for consequential relief; if it is not incumbent upon the plaintiff to get rid of the document the plaint must be treated as one for a declaration, pure and simple.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Abdul Hamid Vs.

But a voidable contract is valid until it is avoided or specifically set aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In case of void document a person may rely on its invalidity as against himself without suing for its cancellation. But in a case of a document that is only voidable, the case is otherwise as the party cannot impeach it without having it cancelled.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Abdul Hamid Vs.
