So long as the matter remains in status quo and there is nothing to show that the party called upon to perform the contract has been misled by the inaction of the other party to alter his position in such a manner as to make it inequitable to force him to perform his part of the contract, lapse of time short of the period prescribed by the Limitation Act should not be allowed to operate as a bar to the claim of relief.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Habibullah Khan Vs.

In section 42 of the Specific Relief Act the expression “legal character” or “status” denotes a character or status conferred by law on an individual or a number of individuals, viewed, as a unit of society and not shared by the generality of the community but only by individuals, placed in the same category of character. The character itself must be conferred by law on person viewed from the stand point of membership of the community. It is a “status” or “character” conferred by law. It is not a creature of contract but of law. For example, a minor cannot contract into majority nor can one, who has attained majority, under law, contract himself into minority.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A declaration was sought that a personal contract subsisted between the plaintiff and the defendant. It was contended that a declaration about contractual rights could not be claimed or granted under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Held</strong> : The contention must be upheld to this extent namely, that section 42 of the Specific Relief Act does not contemplate a suit like the present. A man’s “legal character” is the same thing as a man’s status. A man’s status or legal character is constituted by the attributes which the law attaches to him in his individual and personal capacity, the distinctive mark or dress as it were, with which the law clothes him apart from the attributes which may be said to belong to normal humanity in general.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The plaintiff had claimed a declaration that he would be entitled to contribution from the defendant if and when occasion arose and it was held that such a suit was not maintainable under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Burmah Eastern Ltd.
