When a specific relief is granted by preventing a party from doing that which he is under an obligation not to do, it is called preventive relief. This relief is to continue until the specific time named in die order. It is merely provisional in its nature and does not conclude a right. Its sole object is to preserve the subject in controversy without determining any question of right and to prevent further perpetration of wrong.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In order to sustain an action for the preservation of a property or a right in issue in status quo, it is not necessary to decide in favour of the plaintiff upon the merits nor it is necessary that he should present such a case as will certainly entitle him to a decree upon the final hearing; since he may be entitled to a temporary injunction although his right to the relief prayed for may ultimately fail. In other words, it would be sufficient if it be shown that he has a fair question to rise as to the existence of the right alleged.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>SN Gupta &amp; Co.

Under Chapter IX of the Act it has been provided that preventive relief is granted at the discretion of the Court by injunction, temporary or perpetual, whereas granting of perpetual injunction has been specifically provided for in section 54 under Chapter X with the me-condition as to the existence of an obligation and a perpetual injunction may be granted to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in favour of the applicant, whether expressly or by implication.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Sk.
