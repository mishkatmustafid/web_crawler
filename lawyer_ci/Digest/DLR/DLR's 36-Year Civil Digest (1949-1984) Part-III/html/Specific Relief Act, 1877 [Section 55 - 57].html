It is right and proper that the order of its demolition, if at all, by way of mandatory injunction should ordinarily be passed on the conclusion of the stilt.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Abdul Barik Vs.  Serajul Islam (1968) 20 DLR 501.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mandatory injunction—The Court can grant u/s. 151 apart from provisions of Order 39.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Court’s power to issue temporary injunction of mandatory nature—</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The view that as the matter of temporary injunction has been dealt with by the Code of Civil Procedure under Order 39, there is no scope for the Court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction cannot be accepted as sound.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Order 39 does not exhaustively deal with the granting of temporary injunction and so apart from the provisions of Order 39 the Court can grant temporary injunction in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The tenant had filed an application for temporary injunction restraining the landlord from proceeding with the new construction on the suit premises. The landlord contested that application. Just before delivery of the Judgment in the injunction matter the landlord with indecent haste constructed a wall in order to defeat the order of the Court by doing the act which the temporary injunction intended to restrain.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Held</strong>: In a case of this description the Court would if necessary proceed not only to grant a temporary injunction restraining further erection of the building, but also to direct that the building already erected be taken down.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">An injunction restraining a person from causing an injury may from the very circumstances of the case be of mandatory nature.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is no answer to such injunction that in effect the defendant is compelled to perform certain acts which ordinarily would be subject of a mandatory injunction. And if for some reason the Court finds it necessary to issue a temporary mandatory injunction it cannot be said that such an injunction is beyond its inherent power.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">On an interlocutory application the Court has inherent jurisdiction to order demolition of a wall which was erected in defiance of the authority of the Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>The National Bank of India Ltd.

In others words, proposal made by them for supplying the labour and transport was not accepted.
