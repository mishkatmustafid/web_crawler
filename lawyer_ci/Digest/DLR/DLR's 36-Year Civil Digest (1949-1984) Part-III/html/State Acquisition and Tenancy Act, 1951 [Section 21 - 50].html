This notification relates to a number of villages including Jarulia in which the disputed Bazar situates. Sub-section (2) of section 43 of the Act provides that notification under that sub-section shall be conclusive proof of its publication and its date thereof. Since the notification relates to a number of villages including the whole of the village Jarulia and as the disputed Bazar lies within that village, it should be taken that the compensation assessment- roll published in this case is also relatable to the disputed Jarulia Bazar.
