On or from 14th of April 1956, the relationship of landlord and tenant so far as the previous rent-receivers are concerned ceased to exist. The State had become the landlord throughout the province. Therefore, the ex-landlord could bring only a suit which could be called money suit for realization of their arrears of rent.

If the exceptions as to the wakf, debuttor or other religious trusts  deemed to relate only to those estates which, because of some technicality or special circumstances, had not been deemed to have been included in the omnibus notifications of 2nd April, 1966, then obviously, the executives were applying the law discriminatingly.
