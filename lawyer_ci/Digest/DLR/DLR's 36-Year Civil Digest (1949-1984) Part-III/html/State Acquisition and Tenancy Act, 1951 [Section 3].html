Therefore, despite the abrogation of the late Constitution and the promulgation of the Order, the order made by the Nigh Court on remand, to the effect that the acquisitions by the Government were void, being based on the law declared by the Supreme Court in Jibendra Kishore’s case, was perfectly legal and valid.
