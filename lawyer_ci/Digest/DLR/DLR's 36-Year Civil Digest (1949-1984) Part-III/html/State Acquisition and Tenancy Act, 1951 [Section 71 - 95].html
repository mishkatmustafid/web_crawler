Haji Abdul Gani Biswas (1980) 32 DLR (AD) 233.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—The present law regarding usufructuary mortgage was enacted to protect the helpless raiyat.<em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—The legislature in section 95 provided that the raiyat shall not enter into any form of usufructuary mortgages other than the complete usufructuary mortgage. The legislature also prohibited a contract of Out and out sale with a clause of reconveyance and by a deeming clause had made such transaction as complete usufructuary mortgage. In other words, in Bangladesh a raiyat cannot enter into any other transaction of his raiyat holding except a complete usufructuary mortgage. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—After an enjoyment of the usufruct for a maximum period of 7 years u/s.95A the raiyat has the right to get back the property as provided in s. 95. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—Since 1928 recourse was taken of the deeming provision by the legislature and all sorts of mortgages, usufructuary mortgages, mortgages by conditional sale, anomalous mortgages have been displaced by providing that all such mortgages by a raiyat “shall be deemed to be a complete usufructuary mortgage” for which a definition was given in the Bengal Tenancy Act. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—Transaction entered into with raiyat, by way of mortgage is not governed by the Transfer of Property Act but must be deemed a complete usufructuary mortgage as defined in the Bengal Tenancy Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The High Court Division has fallen into error by construing the expression “transfer” in the context of the Transfer of Property Act. Since 1928 the Legislature wanted to take out the transaction of the raiyat from the purview of Transfer of Property Act for which specific definition was supplied, namely, “complete usufructuary mortgage” in the Bengal Tenancy Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">So far as the complete usufructuary mortgages are concerned with its meaning as given by the law there is no question of vested interest.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The High Court Division observed that the vested right of the property should not be extinguished “except in the manner as provided in the second part of Article 42(1) or 47(1)”. There is, however, no question of vested right because the complete usufructuary mortgage presupposes the restoration of land to the transferor either by redemption or by efflux of time whichever is earlier.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A transferee enjoyed the rights during these years before redemption or restoration and the transaction known in vernacular is “Khai Khalashi’ for which both the principal and interest are liquidated. Therefore, the question of vested right does not arise, nor can it be said that the raiyat gets it as a windfall because, after all, the property is his and he had to transfer it as complete usufructuary mortgage or “Khai Khalashi” in order to obtain loan. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p> </p></div></div>
