Due to the peculiar geographical phenomena prevailing in the riverine part of this Province, a considerable part of the Province remains submerged for several months of the year. During this time, fishes may be available and may also be caught in these submerged areas. It cannot be said that these areas vest in the Government as fisheries as long as they remain under water and revert to the owners thereof as soon as the water recedes.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A fishery is a right to catch fish in any water of a more or less permanent nature, where fish is capable of being reared and caught throughout the year as an occupation, business or industry. Casual availability of fish in such areas will not render them a fishery.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In other words, in order to constitute a closed fishery, the land concerned must contain so much water throughout the year as is sufficient for enabling rearing and catching of fish therein and, that too, in pursuit of fishing as a trade, business, occupation or industry. As a corollary, it follows that the purpose of the lease and the nature of the tenancy right recognized and treated by the lessee and the manner in which the land is being used or capable of being used are all important factors to be considered in determining whether a land does or does not constitute a fishery. If the purpose of lease is not one for fishing exclusively, or if the land grows or is capable of growing crops or if the owner of the land is being usually recognized and treated by the successive landlords including the Government as a raiyat then the inference would be that the land concerned is not a fishery.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Province of East Pakistan Vs.

Their main contention was that on co-operative basis they have undertaken to do large-scale farming. The Trial Court granted plaintiffs prayer for temporary injunction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Basis of the plaintiffs prayer was that he was entitled to a certificate for retaining the excess land. Such certificate was, in fact, granted but was later on cancelled by the Board of Revenue. That matter was challenged and ended with the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The order of cancellation was challenged in Writ Petition No. 169 of 1964 but the Writ petition was dismissed and the order of cancellation of the certificate was maintained. An appeal against the said order of the High Court was dismissed by the Supreme Court which observed that the ex-rent receivers got no legal right to grant of a certificate under sub-section (4) of s. 20 After this decision of the Supreme Court no suit for permanent injunction against the Government is maintainable whether it is filed by the ex-rant-receivers directly or in the name of their co-operative society. While the certificate granted by the Revenue Authority, which is revisable, permit’s the retention of the quantity of land in excess of the permissible limit, such certificate does not confer any right upon the certificate-holder because sub-section (4B) says,” the land held under a certificate under sub-section(4) or 4A) by the prescribed Revenue Authority shall absolutely vest in the Government and the certificate-holder on an application submitted by him for granting a Lease on a long-tern basis in respect of such land” but he is to give up “claim of compensation” and such land may be Leased out to him under certain conditions.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The purpose of the law clearly is this that the certificate-holder becomes the lessee under the Government and he is to give up his claim of compensation which otherwise woukl has been admissible to him. Such being the right and privilege the question is whether the plaintiff can claim any injunction restraining the Government from interfering in the setting of such facts when admittedly no certificate is in existence. The opinion is that no right inheres in him so as to entitle him to an injunction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In this case no case has been made Out for temporary injunction nor any certificate is in existence and, therefore, the question what is the distinction between the temporary injunction or status quo or whether there is any distinction at all becomes academic.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Debishahar Agricultural &amp; Fish Farming Cooperative Society Ltd.
