The period of 4 months referred to in section 96(1) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act is the limitation prescribed for exercising the right by a tenant holding land contiguous to the land transferred from the date of the knowledge of such transfer.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Habibur Rahman Vs.

In a contest over the claim of pre-emption between A and B, question arose who is the earlier purchaser of a portion of holding so as to entitle him to maintain an application for pre-emption under section 96 of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Held</strong>: Right of pre-emption accrues not on the date of execution but on the date of registration of the document and hence in the present case B acquired the right of pre-emption of the land sold to A inasmuch as B’s document was registered in 1965 though the execution of A’s deed as in 1959 and that of B’s deed was in 1961.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Abdur Rahman Vs.

In such a case rule of partial preemption has been applied. In a case of pre-emption coming under the second part of sub-section (1) of section 96 the tenant is not required to meet the same test. In case of tenant’s right of pre-emption falling under the second part, the pre-emptor is required to establish that he has land contiguous to the land transferred. The expression holding land contiguous to the land transferred cannot be suetched to support the view that even in such a case the preemptor is required to include in the application for pre-emption also the lands to which he does not hold contiguous land and implead all the tenants holding contiguous lands to non-contiguous lands.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Akhtarun Nessa Vs.

It must necessarily follow that even if there has been a sale of several holdings by one transaction and by a single document, a co-sharer has a right under the aforesaid section, in respect of a particular holding covered by the same document and of which he is to be a co-sharer. It would be a misnomer to describe it as a partial transaction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The right conferred upon a co-sharer under the provisions of section 26F of the Bengal Tenancy Act is a distinct holding. A prayer may be made in one application relating to two distinct holdings.

A tenant holding land contiguous to the land transferred applied u/s 96 for two out of three plots averring that these two plots are contiguous to his land. The court on evidence found that only one plot was contiguous to the applicant’s land and allowed pre-emption of the plot only.

In the former case all other co-sharer tenants of the holding and the transferees are to be impleaded and in the latter case all the co-sharer tenants and all the tenants holding lands contiguous to the land transferred and the transferee to be made parties.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Akhtarun Nessa Vs.

The cause of action for pre-emption of any transfer accrues to the co-sharer tenants and contiguous land owners. The right of the applicant or applicants claiming to be co-sharer tenants or owner of contiguous land, is not absolute but subject to the right of other co-sharers and other holders of land contiguous to the land transferred as the case may be for proper adjudication. To give full effect to the statutory provision, all the necessary parties must be impleaded, because relief cannot be given in the absence of such party.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Abdus Samad Vs.
