Section 1 17(I)(c) contains the provision for sub-division of a joint tenancy for distribution of rent thereof.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">High Court Division was in error in its view that it is a case of sub-division of a joint tenancy as prescribed u/s. 1 17(I)(a) for which an application was required to be filed and in the absence of such an application the Revenue Officer had no authority on his own motion to sub-divide the joint tenancy.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Md.

Khairullah</em> <em>Bhuiyan Vs.

A co-sharer after getting his share separated may get his portion constituted into a new tenancy or he may tag this share with his other land, if any, and if he does so, his case may be referred to as a case of separation and amalgamation for the sake of convenience, though the two terms are quite different. His former co-sharers are not interested in such amalgamation.<em>  Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—For separation of a joint tenancy mandatory provisions as required under clause (c) of s. 117 (1) must be complied with—undivided share of a joint tenancy can not be amalgamated with another independent holding without first having it ‘separated’ under clause (c) of s. 117(I). <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—When a joint tenancy is split up by a RO, thereby taking away the right of the co-sharer to exercise his right of pre-emption—a court of law is fully competent in a pre-emption proceeding to see whether the splitting up order was made according to law as required by s. 117(I)(c). <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em> </em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>S. 117(a)(b)(c)—</strong>Provisions made for amalgamation, consolidation or sub-division of holding—Amalgamation or consolidation by revenue officer on his only motion or on application—Subdivision can be effected only on application by co sharer tenants.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Haladhar Dutta Vs.

Sumati Bala Haldar (1966) 18 DLR. 293.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—Section 141 has no application when the sale had taken place before the introduction of Chapter V of the Acquisition Act and when the demand for which the sale had taken place was not a public demand. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Notice—Proceedings introducing Chapter V of the East Bengal State Acquisition Act is no notice to the Judgment-debtor whose land has been sold.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Proceedings taken as preliminary to the intro- due section of Chapter V of the Acquisition Act cannot be construed as notice to a Judgment-debtor in respect of a sale of a holding held for arrears of rent unless it is shown that the judgment-debtor was, as a matter of fact, aware of the proceedings. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>S. 142 read with section 3(4a) — </strong>Period of limitation for recovery of arrear rents is 5 years in Sylhet district.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Chandpur Tea Co.

The scheme of the section shows the possession is the material question. This was a special provision and this section was inserted after section 143 by EP Ordinance VIII of 1965. It was, however, omitted after a few years by Ordinance No. LXIV of 1975.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Within the scope of section 143A, there is hardly any ground for the Custodian of the Enemy Property appellant to challenge the title of the plaintiff. The learned Judge found that the Custodian of Enemy Property had no document in his possession to claim the property as enemy property. Before the High Court Division no one appeared on behalf of the present Custodian. The learned Judge of the High Court Division having found the plaintiffs prima-facie title and clear possession of the case land, rightly reversed the decision of the lower appellate Court and restored that of the trial Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Assistant Custodian Vs. Bholanath Guha (1984) 36 DLR (AD) 79.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em> </em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">— The section confers a summary power on the Civil Court for the purpose of correcting mistakes.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section 143A contemplates a summary power to be exercised by the Civil Court within the prescribed limits. The purpose of introducing this special provision is correcting mistakes.” The special provisions made in section 143A arc intended for a definite and limited purpose.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Abu Daud Vs. Ruhul Amin Sardar (1979)31 DLR 421.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—Addition of parties in a proceeding u/s. 143A as envisaged in Or. 1 r. 10(a), CP Code not allowable. <em>Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>S. 143A</strong>—A right of easement sought to be confirmed in a proceeding under section 143A is absolutely beyond the scope of investigation under this section.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Prayer in the form of declaratory relief not contemplated in a proceeding u/s. 143A.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Certain prayers have been made in declaratory form with regard to title of the petitioner. Section 143A does not contemplate such relief.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Abu Daud Vs. Ruhul Amin (1979) 31 DLR 421.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 143(a)—</strong>has authorized a person aggrieved by an order or omission of entry in the record-of-rights finally published under Chapter IV of the Act to file a suit for correction of such record- of-rights in the Civil Court. It is obvious, therefore, that an alternative right has now been provided for a detailed probe into the matter and for rectifying an erroneous entry in a record-of-rights.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;">Pijush Kanti Chowdhury Vs.
