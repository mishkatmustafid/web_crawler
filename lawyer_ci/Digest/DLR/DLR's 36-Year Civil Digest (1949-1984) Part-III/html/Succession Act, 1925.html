The Tahsildar’s report simply shows that “sons of Satish Chandra are Indian Nationals’. Even if his sons are Indian nationals this fact does not make him an enemy alien or his property an enemy property under the Defense of Pakistan Rules Mere claim of the Asset. Custodian that the property of the deceased testator is an enemy property in respect of which an enemy property case was started in 1978 is not sufficient for coming to a conclusion that the property is an enemy property.

In accordance with section 191 gifts “made in contemplation of death” are resumable by the donor if he survives and the power to make such gifts is co-extensive with the power of testamentary disposition. It is true that gifts “in contemplation of death” are gifts which are to take effect in case the donor dies, but authority can be found in any commentary for the proposition that although the donor does not say so the presumption in the case of gifts made during apprehension of death is that they are to take effect only in case of death.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Shamshad All Vs.

The two sections are intended to apply in very different circumstances, the former where the will has been proved and the latter where it has not been proved at all.

The true function of an executor ceases when funeral and testamentary expenses, debts and legacies have been satisfied and the surplus, if any, have been invested upon the trusts of the will, for, thereafter the executor sheds his character as an executor and becomes a trustee in the proper sense of that term.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">When the legal estate, if devised absolutely to the legatee, is transferred to the legatee, there is nothing left to administer and the administration is then deemed to have come to an end.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Once an executor always an executor is a correct maxim, for his functions of the executor are confined to the execution of the will. <em>   Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">— In the present case, having regard to the provision of the will the court held that the intention of the testator was to set up a sole shebait and two or three other persons as supervisors over the said sheban, and this function of acting as a supervisor shebait was a function which was distinct and separate from that of an “executor”.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Although in the latter portion of the will the testator has used the words “executor for the purpose of supervision” and “executor supervisor”, the word “executor” in the context does not mean an executor in the strict sense of the term.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The will contained a clause that Ramanath Das and Ashutosh Dhar should contribute Rs. 30/- p.m. It was thereupon urged that until and unless the executors made proper arrangements for setting up an annuity fund for this purpose it could not be said that they had as executors completed the execution of the will:</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Held:</strong> Administration under the will does not include the performance of injunctions or directions which have nothing whatever to do with the estate of the deceased. This was not a disposition of the estate by him and, as such, it was not a part of the administration of the estate of the deceased which an executor had to perform. <em>   Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>S. 306</strong>—Section 306 of the Act applies to executors and administrators of the deceased and not the heirs representing the estate of the deceased. <em>PLR (1960)1 (WP) 412.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—‘Personal injury’—Decree in favour of the injured man for such injury—Death of the injured man while an appeal against decree was pending—Heirs entitled to get the decreetal amount and defend the appeal.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">When a suit is instituted by an injured person and a decree is obtained by him the cause of action merges into the decree and the amount instead of being unhiquidated becomes an ascertained sum and heritable.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In the present case the plaintiff instituted the suit for compensation on account of injury caused to the plaintiff by a running truck and obtained a decree against the defendant. As against the decree the defendant filed an appeal and during the pendency of the appeal the plaintiff died and thereupon the legal representatives of the plaintiff entered their appearance in support of the decree. It was however contended that the injury being personal to the plaintiff the cause of action for damages cannot survive after the death of the plaintiff.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Held: </span></strong>The cause of action of the plaintiff after the passing of the decree merged in the decree which was heritable, transferable and enforceable by the heirs of the plaintiff and as such, merely because the plaintiff died during the pendency of the appeal the suit cannot abate.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Pakistan Vs.

The right, even though an inchoate right until assent, is nevertheless an interest created by the will itself and the assent is only a perfecting act for the security of the executor. The assent thus creates no new title, for, the title vests in the legatee from the moment of the death of the testator, in the case of a specified bequest, under section 104 of the Succession Act, and it cannot, therefore, be said that till the executor has signified his assent the legatee has no interest whatsoever in the subject matter of the legacy.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Jassumal Vs.
