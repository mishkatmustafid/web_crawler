Such transactions are usufructuary mortgages within s. 58(d) and unless the instrument of mortgage in such a case is in writing, and the transaction also falls within s. 53-A, the terms of the mortgage cannot be relied on as a ground of attack or of defense by either the plaintiff or the defendant in a mortgage suit, except in cases in which they are embodied in a duly registered written instrument. Accordingly, a suit framed as a suit for redemption of lands which are the subject of an oral usufructuary mortgage cannot be sustained, inasmuch as the plaintiff pleads and relics on the oral mortgage which is required by law to be effected by a registered instrument. The proper course of the mortgagor to take in such a case would be to sue for possession relying on his title. In such a suit, it is not permissible for the defendant to rest his claim to remain in for possession on the oral mortgage which could not be proved. <em>13 R 274 (FB).
