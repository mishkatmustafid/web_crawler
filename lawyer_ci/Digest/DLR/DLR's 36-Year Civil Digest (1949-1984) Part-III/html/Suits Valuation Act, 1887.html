In such a suit the crucial value is value of the relief and the plaintiff need not state any value for purposes of jurisdiction because it will be the same as laid down in section 8 of the Suits Valuation Act, 1887. The value for purposes of jurisdiction inadvertently stated in the plaint, therefore, cannot be taken to be value for purposes of relief claimed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Suleiman Khan Vs.

The proper method is first to make the valuation for the purpose of court-fees, and then to take that value for the purposes of jurisdiction and not vice versa.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Patak Ch.

It is difficult to appreciate why in a case for partition, where the plaintiff is in joint possession he must be given the benefit of having his suit tried or his appeal heard by a higher tribunal by valuing his suit according to the value of the entire property sought to be partitioned.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Ajizuddin V.

This is absolutely an independent power consciously given by the legislature to the Court and the legislature must be presumed to have in its mind the provision of Section 9 of the Suits Valuation Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section 9 of the Suits Valuation Act is not only an independent section but is also contained in a different Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;">Govt. -of East Pakistan Vs.

If the objection as to jurisdiction is taken in the court of the first instance, there is hardly any scope for the application of section 11.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Nagendra N.

The matter again came up before the Appellate Division on being moved by the officer concerned. Held: The High Court Division was under a clear misapprehension. If the party concerned violated the order regarding the attachment of the Trawler concerned it is the order of the Appellate Division which has been violated and therefore the High Court Division acted without jurisdiction in proceeding to take action against the offending officer.
