In computing this period the parties areentitled to a deduction of the days actually spent in obtaining certifiedcopies of the judgment under appeal which is required to be filed along withthe petition. Similarly, where an application for leave under clause 15 of theLetters Patent has also been made in the High Court, the parties might also beallowed to claim a further deduction of the period of time actually spent inmaking the application under clause 15, because it is only proper that a partyshould first exhaust all available remedies in the High Court before approachingthe Supreme Court. But this does not entitle any one to claim a fresh startingpoint of limitation as from the date of the order rejecting the application forleave under clause 15 of the Letters Patent.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>Mistake madeby the Branch Registry cannot create any right in the appellants to have theappeal heard even though it is out of time. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><i><span style='Cambria","serif";'>KalachandSikdar Vs.
