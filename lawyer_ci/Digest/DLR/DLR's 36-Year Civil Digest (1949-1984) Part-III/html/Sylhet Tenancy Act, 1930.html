I, Clause (V) (Explanation)—Lands within Tea Estate not governed by the Act. </strong>Clauses (V) of section 1 of this Act extend the Act to the district of Sythet except “Lands used for special cultivation or for purposes ancillary thereto so long as such use continues”. The provisions in Explanation to clause CV) provide that the words “purposes ancillary thereto shall include the letting out of portion of such land for the maintenance of the coolies working on such cultivation”.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>New Dhamat Tea Estate Limited Vs.

The holding thus being one at fixed rate of rent, the landlord in view of section 22 had no locus standi to file an application for pre-emption under section 33 of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Chandra K Bhattacharya Vs. Suraj Mia (1951) 3 DLR 358.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Secs. 30, 33—Right of pre-emption to the landlord.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The right of pre-emption to the landlord in a case of transfer of an ordinary occupancy holding accrued to the landlord as soon as the transfer is effected by a registered instrument and the right vests as soon as the instrument is registered. The statute nowhere provides that the right of the landlord vests only on the service of the notice either under section 30 or section 33 of the Syihet Tenancy Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Chandra K Bhattacharya Vs. Suraj Mia.

(1951) 3 DLR 358</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>S. 34—Order under the section not appealable</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The decree contemplated by section 96 of the C.P. Code is a decree made in a suit. A proceeding under section 34(b) of the Sylhet Tenancy Act is started by an application and not by a plaint, and consequently the order under section 34(b) of the Act is not an order in a suit. The order complained against therefrom is not appealable before the District Judge.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Harmuz Ali &amp; ors Vs. Mafiz Ali &amp; ors.

There is no provision in the Sylhet Tenancy Act or in the Civil Procedure Code providing that there shall be no appeal from such an order. Clearly, therefore, an appeal lies. <em>(1952) 2 PLR (Dac) 37.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>S. 34(4)—</strong>Complete usufructuary mortgage (kot-mortgagc) does not require to be attested by two witnesses and is a valid document if it is registered in accordance with the Registration Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Karamath Ali Talukdar Vs.
