Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act recognizes only a lease for certain time, express or implied, that is, periodic leases and leases in perpetuity.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Rai Mohan Chowdhury Vs.

If a suit has to be filed against him Article 139 of the Limitation Act will not apply but Article 144 will apply and this latter Article also applies to a Suit against a trespasser.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Rai Mohan Chowdhwy Vs.
