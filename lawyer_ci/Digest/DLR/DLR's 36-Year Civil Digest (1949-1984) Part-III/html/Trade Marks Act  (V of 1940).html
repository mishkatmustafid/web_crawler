The defendant company is entitled to the exclusive use of the coined words “Saribadi Salsa” also on the ground that it had been in continuous use by the defendant company since 1914, according to the provisions of the proviso to section 6. Further seven years have passed since the original registration of the mark and as such the defendant company is also entitled to the protection afforded by section 24 of the Trade Marks Act as no acceptable case has been made out of any fraud perpetrated by the defendant company in having the trade mark registered nor does the trade mark offend against the provisions of section 8 of the Trade Marks Act<em>.

So the respondent’s contention was that this will confuse and deceive the buyers who may purchase the product of “PMS” as that of “Bayer”.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Held:</strong> In the absence of legal bar the Registrar is not entitled to impose a condition arbitrarily. He can impose such condition when it is necessary in view of the prohibitions imposed by the statute in respect of registration of trade mark.

The respondents have no market of this trade mark in respect of any goods in this country.

There may be cases in which an application for stay of the suit may be sought merely for the purpose of delaying the Suit by making an application to the Registrar under section 10(2). This application may be frivolous and devoid of any substance and may have been made after the institution of this suit. when the defendant may have found his position difficult and untenable. To stay the suit in this situation and to wait for the decision of the Registrar which may sometimes take years, would be denial of justice. It may also be noted that the decision by the Registrar in any case is not final and is subject to an appeld to the High Court. Then there may be cases which may involve the determination of other issues apart from those arising under section 10(2) which could only be tried by the Civil Court. The stay of the suit, therefore, cannot be granted as a matter of course merely upon the presentation of an application by the defendant before the Registrar particularly when that application is made after the institution of this suit. The question whether stay should be granted must be answered with reference to the facts of each case. It is a matter within the discretion of the Court and the discretion has to be exercised in the interest of justice. One of the considerations which may determine an exercise of that discretion is the time when the application for stay is made. Another factor to consider would be whether the application for stay is bona fide. Yet another consideration would be the nature of the case itself.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>N. B. Philip Vs. Electric Lamp Manufactures of Pak.

The limitations were over reached because, whereas Shipton Tea Co was entitled without registering its trade mark to freely use its trade name and to print it in any colour it liked on its goods, so long as its labels did not in any other respect infringe the trademarks of Lipton Ltd., after Its registration the name would be partly suppressed by its deletion from the most important place in the trade mark and partly obscured by the flattening effect of reduced size of panels of labels and turned down colour scheme<em>. </em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Abdul Gani Vs.

A disclaimer is added to define a right arising out of registration in a doubtful case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Even without such a disclaimer the respondent (Nutun Chandra Sinha) will be entitled to such rights as will be ensured by a disclaimer.

The burden of proof for rebutting that presumption is on those who question its validity. In this case, the burden has been on the Deputy Registrar himself. He has discharged it by. pointing out phonetic similarity, while conceding that there was no obvious visual likeness. The fact that the similarity on which he has now relied was not initially noticed by him, is a proof against its obviousness. His view, therefore, that there is transparent phonetic similarity is not an adequate rebuttal of the statutory presumption. The weakness of the rebuttal becomes more clear when it is noticed that the trade mark has remained on the Register for about seven years and no consumer or trader thought of any deceptive similarity during this long period.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Bengal Oil Mills Ltd.
