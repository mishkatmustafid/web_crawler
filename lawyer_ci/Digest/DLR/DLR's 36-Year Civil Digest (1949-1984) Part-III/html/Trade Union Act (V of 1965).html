A trade union of employees has been recognized as a very effective vehicle of such collective bargaining. The East Pakistan Trade Union Act, 1965 which was enacted on repealing the Trade Union Act of 1926 has embodied provisions for constitution of a Trade Union of workers as well as of employers primarily for the purpose of regulating the relation between workers and employers or workers and workers or between employers and employers as wills appear from the definition of a Trade Union as given in section 2(n) of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Mohiuddin Khan Vs.

The object of the Act as recited in the preamble of the Act is for providing for the registration and recognition of trade unions and in certain respects, for defining the law relating to registered trade unions and recognized trade unions and for matters connected therewith.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Mohiuddin Khan Vs.

A recognized Trade Union must necessarily be a registered Trade Union but a recognized Trade Union appears to have some special advantage in the matter of negotiation and conclusion of agreement with the employer in certain cases, which is .not enjoyed by a registered Trade Union, if not recognized.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Mohiuddin Khan Vs.

Even if no order slaying the operation of the order of withdrawal of registration had been made by the Labour Court, the legal position would not have been different inasmuch as the strike notice was given at a time when the petitioner was a registered Trade Union.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>General Secretary Employees Union Wapda Vs.

(15(d)—Functions which a Trade Union discharges.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">From the provisions in clauses (c) and (d) of s. 15 of the Act it is clear that one of the main objectives of a registered Trade Union is to undertake the prosecution or defense of any legal proceedings for the purpose of securing or protecting any right arising out the relation of any member of the Trade Union to his employer and also for conducting labour disputes on behalf of the Trade Union or any of its members.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Mohiuddin Vs.
