It’s only right conceivable could be, as a registered Union, to represent a workman who may be a party to an industrial dispute, by virtue of section 34 of the Industrial Dispute Ordinance, 1959. But to attract that provision, a “dispute” requires to have been raised by a workman himself and not by the Union on his behalf.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Chittagong Mercantile Employees’ Association Vs.
