In the alternative, if the ownership of the money did not pass to the Bank but remained with the plaintiff then it was a case of a deposit by the plaintiff with the Bank, subject to the express condition that a part of it would be paid back to him and a pars appropriated by the Bank, when the disputed question of the rate of exchange was resolved. In these circumstances too the bar of limitation could not be successfully pleaded against the claim.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>S. M. Hanif Ltd. Vs.
