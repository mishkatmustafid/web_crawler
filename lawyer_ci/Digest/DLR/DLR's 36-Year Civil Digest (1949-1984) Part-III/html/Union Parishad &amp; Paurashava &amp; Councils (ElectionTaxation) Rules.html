Additional Commissioner (1968)20 DLR 282.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Rule 3—Chairman’s election should be held without delay.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The entire scheme of the Rules with particular reference to rule 3 and rule 15 shows that the Legislature intended that the election of the Chairman 01 LISL he held at the earliest possible opportunity after the Union Council has been constituted under section 57 of the Electoral College Act and that when a Chairman has actually been elected, there should be no impediment in his way from taking over charge of the office of the Chairman from the outgoing.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Chairman, Md. Serajul</em> <em>Huq Vs. Sub Divisional Officer (1968)20 DLR 37</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>R. 5</strong>—Resignation of the Chairman accepted and thereafter another member elected as the Chairman. The fact that resignation was gazetted after the fresh election of the Chairman does not invalidate fresh election of the Chairman.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Shah Badrul Haque Vs. MR Chowdhury (1968) 20 DLR 556.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Rule 5 (I)—Where mark is clear for whom vote was cast, some irregularity makes no difference.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The form of voting paper which is prescribed under rule 5(l)is merely for the purpose of facilitating the voters to put their cross marks against the name of a particular candidate they are voting for and the rule does not make it obligatory that the cross mark must be put in column 2. Ii is sufficient compliance with the rule if the mark is clearly put against the name of candidate.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Taleb Ali Vs.

Writ jurisdiction under Article 98 of the Constitution cannot be involved.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is evident from the rules 10,11,12 and l3of the EP Union Councils and Town and Union Committees (Election of Chairman) Rules, 1965 that a particular forum has been established for the resolution of a dispute as to the validity of the election of the Chairman of the Union Council. IL is now a settled rule of law that if a statute or for the matter of that rules framed there under has created a special tribunal for the resolution of a particular dispute, ii is that Tribunal alone which has jurisdiction to decide the dispute. The petitioner having failed to approach the Collector under rule 10 of the Rules for a resolution of the dispute cannot maintain the present application under Article 98 of the Constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Md. Serajul Haq Vs. Sub-Div. Officer (1968) 20 DLR 37.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Rule 11—Deputy Commissioner acts in quasi-judicial character—Should not take guidance from any quarter for disposing of an election petition—Decision should be in unambiguous terms.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">We have no hesitation to say that the Deputy Commissioner who in the matter of disposal of an election petition was acting in a judicial capacity should not have under any circumstances taken any guidance from any communication made to him by way of clarification by the Government on the point. He should have acted independently according to his best judgment, knowledge, good conscience and the rules governing the matter. That the Deputy Commissioner acts at least in quasi-judicial character under rule 11 of the Rules is also admitted by the learned Advocate-General.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">We would like to impress on the functionaries who are entrusted with election matters that decision should be given in clear and unambiguous terms touching upon each point involved in the case without leaving anything to be guessed or conjectured. This must be so as very important rights of citizens are involved in election matters.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Mazharul Huq Vs. Addi. Commr.

The use of the word “person” in the said Govt. order may be an obvious slip or the word was inartistically used. The word “persons” has been used with the qualifying words “one” preceding it and therefore, in the Context it must be held that “person” in the order meant an individual or natural person and therefore the Companies and Corporations arc not entitled to the benefit of exemptions provided in rule 43A(2).</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The two clauses in rule 43A refer to two different purposes and the use of different words “individual” and “person” must be deemed to have been employed to convey two different meanings. Interpreted in its proper context the exemption of maximum payment of Rs. 500/- in the former clause of the proviso to rule 43A seems to have been granted to any individual meaning natural person as opposed to anybody corporate or association of persons like the limited Company or Partnership.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Chittagong Jute Manufacturing Co.

The election can not be called in question for non- correction of such defect.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Mozammel Huq Vs.

Election Tribunal (1979) 31 DLR 140.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—It is true that a voter has no hand in taking the initial or the official seal on a ballot paper given to him but the Rules make a specific provision in order to be valid a ballot paper shall contain both the initial of the Polling Officer and the official mark. This procedure appears to have been prescribed to guard against any unfair means in ballot paper such as casting of a ballot paper which is not issued to a genuine voter. In view of this provision of the Rules, for the purpose of accepting a ballot paper as valid it must bear both the official mark and the initial of the Polling Officer and for the purpose of rejecting it as invalid absence of either the official mark or the initial of the Polling Officer will be sufficient. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Rules 35 and 40(4)—</strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Rule 35 speaks of the voting procedure to be observed by the Polling Officer, whereas rule 40 speaks of counting of votes.

Sharifullah Vs. Election Tribunal Munsif Court Rajshahi (1979) 31 DLR 119.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—To find out the Status of the Election Tribunal one is to examine the powers conferred under rules 48 and 49 of the Union Parishads (Election) Rules, 1976. Rule 48 corresponds to rule 61A of the Union Parishad and Paurashava (Election) Rules, 1973. Similarly, rule 49 corresponds to rule 61B of the said Rules. Rules 48 and 49 are identical to rules 61A and 61B. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Rule 50—Election when can be declared void.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A declaration that the election of returned candidate or election as a whole is void depends on two conditions—(I) failure of any person to comply with or the contravention of the rules, and (2) the noncompliance or contravention must materially affect the result of the election<em>.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Iman Hossain Bepari Vs.

Election means an election of a Member, Commissioner, Women Commissioner, Chairman, or Vice- Chairman, as the case may be. This shows that for a person contesting the Chairmanship ‘election’ means election of the Chairman only. It is, therefore, clear that when the question of election of the Chairman arises the election of Vice Chairman or of any member is irrelevant.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Siddique Ahmed Vs.

The word candidates which is in plural has been used because of the possibility of more than once candidate left in the field.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is true that the last word in rule 20A is ‘candidates’ which refers to persons in the plural but the expression ‘the poll shall be restricted to the remaining candidates’ is highly significant. This expression clearly excludes the possibility and negatives the idea of introduction of a new candidate or candidates in the field through fresh nominations.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Mazharul Huq Vs.

As to the High Court’s jurisdiction under Article 102, it should be remembered that writ is a writ and not an appeal. Ordinarily, this Court does not interfere with the findings of a subordinate Court, if the findings are arrived at on consideration of relevant facts and correct appreciation of evidence being free from any unfairness of mind. If the findings are not so arrived at, this Court has got every power to interfere therewith.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Decision of the Appellate Division cannot be interpreted to hold that the ballot papers found valid by the Presiding Officers in presence of the parties can be arbitrarily rejected by the Tribunal.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Nurul Islam Vs.

Again, when, on discovery of apparently tampered ballot papers, so many in numbers, examination of the Presiding Officer was indispensably necessary in the interest of justice, but he arbitrarily refused to examine them and thereby failed to exercise jurisdiction vested in him. Findings arrived at in these circumstances cannot claim any sanctity nor can they be immune from interference.   <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>NuruI Islam Vs.

Otherwise there will be no sanctity of a free election which is a must for running democratic institutions. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—Election laws should be stringently applied to prevent corruption in elections.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The facts and circumstances of the case unerringly show that the questioned ballot papers of the petitioner were tampered with by some malicious hand after their dispatch from the local officers. Subsequent act of tampering with the ballot papers cannot be a ground for undoing the election. To do so would be to give premium to corrupt practices. To ensure free and fair election of people’s representatives Election Laws against corrupt practices should be made stringent. In this case the authorities may direct an enquiry as to how the ballot papers were tampered with. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em> </em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Rule 59(3)—</strong>Election petition must accompany a receipt showing deposit as required under rule 15(5).
