This does not restrict the powers of the Administrator from asking for accounts of wakf estates from the Mutawallis beyond the period of one year, because, in view of section 27(a), one of the powers of the Administrator shall be to investigate and determine the nature and extent of wakfs and wakf properties and calling from time to time for accounts, returns and information from Mutawallis. This is a power given to the Administrator in general and wide terms, and under this provision, if not under section 52(a), the Administrator is given am- pie authority to call for accounts of the wakf estate from the Mutawalli either present or past<em>. </em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Yar Ali Khan Chowdury Vs.

If these three sections are read together, the only meaning that appears to follow is that section 34 only gives the power to the administrator to take over possession of any wakf property. The procedure to be followed for doing so has been laid down in sections 37 and 39. The provisions contained in sections 37 and 39, therefore, do not go counter to the provisions of section 34. They are rather supplementary to the provisions of section 34.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Maqbulal Haq Vs.

From the provisions of this section, it is found no vexatious applications should be allowed to be made by any person interested in a wakf property or putting the ex-Mutawalli or a sitting Mutawalli to the doscomfiture of explaining his conduct with regard to the management of the property for a period of more than three years on charges of maladministration.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Yar Ali Khan Chowdhury Vs.

It is obvious that the Administrator has been empowered to make a temporary appointment limited to a specified period. He cannot pass an indefinite order of appointment without any limitation as to the duration of the office of the Mutawalli appointed by him. The power of the District Judge in appeal is also similarly limited.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Abdul Jabbal Vs.

The petitioner preferred an appeal to the District Judge against Administrator’s order and the District Judge upheld the decision of the Administrator. The petitioners thereafter moved the High Court on revision. It was contended that the District Judge was a ‘persona designata’ and did not act as a Court and as such no revision lies against his order before the High Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Held:</strong> There is no real antithesis between the expressions ‘persona designata’ and ‘Court’. Even a persona designata may be a Court which depends upon his powers and the functions which he has to discharge.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In the present case the appeal has got all the ingredients of an appeal and the District Judge is to determine the rights of the parties as contemplated under section 43 of the Ordinance.

Therefore, an appeal as contemplated in section 43 of the Ordinance could be heard and disposed of by an Additional District Judge and no illegality has been committed in the present case because the same has been so disposed of by the Additional District Judge.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Forrukh Ahmed Vs.

According to the waqf-deed, the appellant is a fit person for appointment as Mutawalli, and, in fact, he was so appointed. But provisions of section 44 override all other things contained either in the waqf-deed or elsewhere in this Ordinance. The appellant was appointed mutawalli by the Administrator in terms of the waqf-deed. But in view of the circumstances, as stated, the Administrator modified his earlier order appointing the appellant as mutawalli and proceeded to appoint a committee of five persons to act as Mutawalli under section 44.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Golam Ataher Chowdhury Vs.

But if we refer to section 35, we find that along with the Mueawalli the other person who has been given the right to challenge the notification made under section 34 is “any person claiming any interest in the property”. A comparison of these two expressions in these two sections with reference to the expression used in proviso to section 50 clearly shows three different expressions have been used in the same statute. The Legislature in the same statute has in different context used different expressions. It is a well- accepted principle of interpretation that where different language is used in the same statute different intention is to be presumed unless there is in the context anything to hold to the contrary. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em> </em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>S. 50</strong>—The expression “any person aggrieved” in sec. 50 means any person who is interested to challenge the order made under this sub-section. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—“In question’—What the word “question” means.
