Said Khan Vs. Govt. of West Pakistan (1969)21 PLD (Peshawar) 147.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em> </em></p><p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>West Pakistan Government Servants (Further Usefulness in Public Service) Rules, 1963</u></strong></p><p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><strong><u><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></u></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Provision for retirement on completing 55th year of age made by Art. 178(4)(c) can be enforced only prospectively and not retrospectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Orders of retirement of the respondents (who are employees under the West Pakistan Provincial Government) from service were passed by the Provincial Administration under the authority of rules framed under Article 178(2) of the Constitution by the Governor of West Pakistan.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The orders were passed after the incumbents in question had passed the stage of 25 years qualifying service or, in some cases, even after he had passed his 55th year of age and before anyone of them had reached the superannuation age of 60.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">On the 23rd of October, 1960, clause (9) was added Lo Article 6 of the Order. By sub-clause (a) of this clause it was enacted that the superannuation age of a person would be the age on which he attains his sixtieth birthday. The position earlier was that the superannuation age had been fixed at fifty-five.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Purporting to act under Article 178(2) of the1962 Constitution, the Governor of West Pakistan made Rules, called the West Pakistan Government Servants (Further Usefulness in Public Service) Rules, 1963.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">On the basis of the Rules framed by the Governor, it was argued that the Provincial Government servants were under the liability of having their cases dealt with in the manner provided by the proviso to rule 4, even under clause (9) of Article 6 of the Laws (Continuance in force) Order.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Held</strong>: We arc unable to accede to this argument as correct. It is undoubted true that under the Order the Governor could have framed rules under sub-clause (d) of clause (9) of Article 6, providing for a power to retire officers even after they had passed the two stages of twenty-five years qualifying service and the fifty-fifth year of age. This amounted, however, merely to the possibility of a law being framed, under which the respondents could have become liable to such action. No such liability, could be said to have accrued unless the law had been properly framed and enforced.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Govt. of West Pakistan Vs. Karamatullah Khan Muslim (1968) 20 DLR (SC) 300.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Rule 4, proviso—</span></strong>Proviso to rule 4 violative of Arts. 178(3) and 234 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1962.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Till the commencing day of the new Constitution, no law existed, under which orders of retirement of the respondents could have been passed, after any one of them had passed the twenty-five years qualifying stage of service or the fifty-fifth year of age, as the case may be. The position clearly was that till that day, the only liability of the respondents was one of being retired at either of the two preliminary stages mentioned above or failing that to continue in service fill the normal superannuation age of sixty.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The proviso to rule 4 must be held to be violative of the provisions of clause (3) of Article 178 and Article 274 of the Constitution, which contain solemn guarantees of continuity of the old terms and conditions, obtaining prior to the enforcement of the Constitution, to the respondents.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Govt. of West Pakistan Vs.

Servants (non- gazette) giving retrospective effect from 14th October 1955.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—Respondents post not being included in the list, Govt. by a notification included his post in the list revising his pay scale in pursuance of the Pay Revision Rules, 1959 but denied to give the benefit of retrospective effect of the revised scale to the respondent with effect from 14th October, 1955.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Held:</strong> Government cannot deny the benefit of retrospective effect of the revised pay scale to the respondent.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>West Pakistan Govt.

Court not to question the sufficiency of the case which was the basis of the authority’s satisfaction, but the Court can look into the grounds of detention to satisfy itself that on the grounds which are the basis of detention the authority could be satisfied as to the correctness of order of detention and the Court must satisfy itself that authority has not exceeded its limit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">No reasons for detention have been made out in the present case—Detentions held to be without Lawful authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Farid Ahmad Vs.

His appearance before the Controlling Officer and the evidence he gave does indeed expose the fact that the disputed vote was cast by him, but this was for a subsequent and collateral purpose, namely, the election petition, and does not, in any way, affect the secrecy under which the vote was cast.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Muhammad Asghar Vs.

The denial of permission to use a loud speaker means a denial of the right to communicate one’s views and thoughts even to those who want to hear them.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The right of citizen to be heard and to communicate one’s views on religious, political and other subjects is placed in the uncontrolled discretion of the Deputy Commissioner which renders the power conferred violative of the guarantee provided in the ninth fundamental right.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Khawaja Muhammad Safdor Vs.
