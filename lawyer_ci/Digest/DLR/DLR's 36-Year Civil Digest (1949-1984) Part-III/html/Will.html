It is a secret and confidential document which the executants is never ordered to produce. In India where a will may be deposited with the Registrar, under the Indian Registration Act, the terms of the Act ensures that the contents remain secret until the death of the executants.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Hubert James Vs.

There is no justification for treating such an admission as admitting the existence of a partnership effective before the death</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">of the testator with all the consequences which would flow from such a relationship. <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>—Construction of—</strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">The rule of construction generally is that a will must be read as a whole to ascertain there from the intention of the Testator and having so ascertained that intention must be given effect to so far as legally possible. </span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Joy Kumar Dutta Vs.

Painton and Pandock Barry v. James Butlim laying down the rule that when a will is sought to be propounded the onus of proof in every case lies on the person seeking to prove the will to satisfy conscience of the court that the instrument so propounded in the court is the last will of the testator, it must not be forgotten that the law is laid down in clear imperative terms by Acts of the Indian Legislature, and it is by the provisions of those Acts that a court must be guided.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Samarendra N Roy Vs.

The rules governing proof of due execution of a will which is charged with suspicion were examined by the Privy Council in the case of ‘Harmes v. Hinkson’ as referred to above. It was observed there.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">“Those rules enjoin a reasonable skepticism not an obdurate persistence in disbelief. They do not demand from the Judge, even in circumstance of grave suspicion, a resolute and impenetrable incredulity.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">He is never required to close his mind to the truth.” <em> Ibid.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>—Witness</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">However excellent a judge’s note may be, the cases must be rare where no transcript being available, the appellate Court in a case involving the veracity of a witness can properly disturb the finding of the fact of the trial Judge who made the note.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Md.
