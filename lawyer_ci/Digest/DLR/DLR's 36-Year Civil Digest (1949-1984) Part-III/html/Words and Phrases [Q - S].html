The apparent conflict gets easily resolved when the two expressions as to time are construed in proper perspective.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In ascertaining the period of time the general expression is to be ignored when the beginning and the end of the questioned period of time is clearly specified and dated.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Nazera Begum Vs.

It does not create or extinguish title to land. At best, along with other evidence, it may support an evidence of tide.

The holding of both the offices of Registrar and Chairman of the Society by the same person may give rise to an embarrassing situation.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Zeaul Haq Vs.

The error in the proceedings is fundamental where the relief granted is different from the one prayed and flows not from the right alleged but from a right which has not been pleaded and as to which the court has never heard the parties. This is true in all proceedings but more so in proceedings for prerogative writs where the court does not generally act <em>ex debito justitiae</em> but confines the petitioner to a specific right and a specific relief.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The petitioner had asked for a writ of <em>mandamus</em> requiring the Government of Pakistan to let the respondent continue in office as Joint Secretary, National Assembly, for a further period of two years, but the writ or direction actually issued was not in accordance with this prayer and it restrained (he Government from interfering with the rights of the respondent as an employee for the remaining period of his service. Thus, in place of a writ of mandamus, a writ of prohibition in substance was issued against</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">the Government, requiring it not to interfere with the rights of the respondent as an employee of the Government. Thus the High Court granted to the petitioner a relief for which there had been no argument before the High Court and accordingly the order of the High Court was set aside.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;">Pakistan through Secy.

It has been used in a much wider sense than in the Companies Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">According to the plain and dictionary meaning of the word ‘reserve’ there must be some setting apart of the amount for some special or general purpose by a person or a body authorized under the Articles of Association of the Company to allocate the funds for particular purposes.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>R.

It is only when the intention of the Legislature does not lie on the surface that a question of interpretation arises and, in such a case, in deciding whether the enactment concerned is intended to operate retrospectively certain well-known principles are followed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Commr. of Income Tax East Pak Vs.
