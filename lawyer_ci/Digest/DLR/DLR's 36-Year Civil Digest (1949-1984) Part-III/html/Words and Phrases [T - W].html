Govt. of Bangladesh (1982) 34 DLR 34.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em> </em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">—Writ of mandamus in English Courts—when will not be to compel restoration of offices.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Cases in which the English Courts have invoked this extraordinary power for compelling restoration by writ of mandamus are all cases of offices which arc either corporate or elective offices or municipal positions. In England no court could possibly compel the restoration of office of any public servant in the service of the Crown, for all such servants of the Crown hold office during the pleasure of the Crown and no Court in England would presume to command the Crown. The authorities cited in Halsbury would also seem to indicate that even for other offices, the tenure of which is precarious or dependent on the will of another, a mandamus would not lie to compel restoration to such offices.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Munshi Abdul Jabbar Vs.
