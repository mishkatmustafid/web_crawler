Other matters in the definition of the term workman, have to be proved by the person asserting them, if it is denied that the person in respect of whom the application was made was a workman. <em>(1952) PLR (Lah) 822.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>S 2(1)(b)—</strong>Permanent total disablement— Where reduction in earning capacity in respect of works the workman was capable of performing before the accident is total—disability sustained by the workman is one of permanent total disablement.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A bus conductor was knocked down by another bus and as a result of the accident his left leg became permanently disabled and he could not bend his knee- joint nor could he run or stand for a long time. His physician certified that he was unfit for active physical work. The Commissioner, Workman’s Compensation. Dacca held that since the conductor did not completely and permanently lose the use of his left leg and as he still could stand a while and walk a short distance, the percentage of loss of his earning capacity should be assessed at 25%.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Held</strong>: In a case under the Workman’s Compensation Act the primary duty of the Court is to find out whether the disablement is total or partial. In other words, the result of the injury should be clearly and fully considered and it should be found out whether the same produced a result of permanent partial disablement or permanent total disablement.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The type of work which the workman was acquainted with and capable of performing, prior to his sustaining the injury, could no longer be undertaken by him due to the injury sustained by him. In view of the above, it is evident that the reduction of the earning capacity in respect of the works the workman was capable of performing was total and as such the disability sustained by the workman was one of permanent total disablement. The expression, “as incapacitates a workman for all work which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident” as occurring in section 2(l) (b) of the W.C. Act clearly relates only to those kinds of work which the workman was capable of performing in relation to his earning of livelihood and does not mean a category broader than that.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>A.K.M.

The proviso to section 2(I)(g) of the Act only says that the injuries specified in Schedule Ito the Act shall be deemed to result in permanent partial disablement irrespective of the fact whether the earning capacity has been reduced or not.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Muslim Cotton Mills Vs.

The proviso only lays down that in cases of injuries enumerated in the proviso to section 2(1) (I) they will be deemed to be cases of permanent total disablement irrespective of the fact whether the workman has or has not been incapacitated for all work which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Muslim Cotton Mills Vs.

In the absence of evidence in this regard and also in the absence of any request having been made by him after the receipt of the report of the medical specialist to show that he was really incapacitated for all work, no finding can be claimed by the appellant that he has been incapacitated for all work which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Zohooruddjn Vs.

Under clause(n) of section 2(I) of the Act two conditions, namely, employment of a casual nature and employment otherwise for the purpose of employer’s trade or business both must exist before the exclusion can be operative.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The use of the word ‘and in clause (n) denotes that these two conditions are to be read conjunctively and not disjunctively<em>.

The duty or work which the, workman is performing at the time of the accident, if falls within the employment and even if it is not directly connected with the object of the accident which though falls within the place, scope and connotation of employment; then the accident would be said to have arisen out of and in the course of employment. This view is influenced by the facts of this case and cannot be held to be of universal application.

The underlying principle is that after the death of the workman, it is the dependants who are entitled to the compensation and that they should not be deprived of it due to anything which was not their (dependants’) fault.

He was admitted in the hospital and was discharged there from on the 25th October 1955. The evidence disclosed it that he had suffered some internal injuries in the spinal cord, could not resume his normal avocation after discharge from hospital and died on 3rd Nov., 1955. It was contended in these circumstances on behalf of the employer that the case of death of the workman had not been established upon the evidence and, therefore, no compensation can be claimed on the evidence led in this case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Held:</strong> The cause of death in the case of workman under the provisions of Workman’s Compensation Act has not to be established with such particularity as in a criminal case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">There must be some kind of casual relationship between the injury and the death and not that the death must be directly and specially attributable to the particular injury caused.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em>Adam Ltd.
