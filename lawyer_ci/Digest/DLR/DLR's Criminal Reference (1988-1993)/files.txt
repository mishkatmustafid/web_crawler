The accused could be considered to have discharged his burden if he succeeds in creating a reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances that would absolve him of criminal liability, but the prosecution is to discharge its burden by establishing the guilt of the accused. An accused’s burden is lighter, because the court is to consider his plea only after, and not before, the prosecution leads evidence for sustaining a conviction.

The fact of calling away of victim Khairul by accused Khasru was satisfactorily established as the first circumstance in support of the prosecution and witnesses have also satisfactorily proved that the victim travelled with the two accused from their village Noapara to a distant place called Takerhat by bus and got down there at 4.00/4.30 PM on 4.1.79. This is the second circumstance proved against the accused. From this point onward up to the time of recovery of the body of Khairul at about 3.00/3.30 PM on the following day the accused were alleged to have been seen along with the deceased, the third circumstance in the absence of ocular evidence of murder, by PWs 11 and 12. The High Court Division rejected their evidence due to apparent contradiction between their evidence and the statement made by them before the police and also for the reason that their identification of the accused in the TI Parade had lost all significance in view of the fact that they had chance to see the accused. There has been no violation of any norm or procedure in assessing the evidence of the said two witnesses for which the finding of fact made by the High Court Division could be disturbed. The position, therefore, comes to this that the third circumstance, that of seeing the three boys together near the bank of the river where the victim’s body was found was not satisfactorily established. The circumstances of the case can never be said to be conclusive as to the guilt of accused Khasru and his brother Nowab.

The offence is one and same. Therefore there is no question of joinder or misjoinder of charges. Though it has been made punishable under both the laws, but to try this offence exclusive jurisdiction has been given only to the Tribunal under the Special Powers Act, and as such, jurisdiction of an ordinary court, such as a Magistrate, to try the offence under ordinary law stands ousted. The respondent was rightly charged by the Tribunal under section 25B of the said Act and after trial he was rightly convicted under section 25B of the Act. The addition of the words “read with section 156(8)” in the charge is superfluous and totally unnecessary.

Undoubtedly the detenu was never placed before the Advisory Board within six months from his detention on 8.1.88. Therefore, the order of detention Annexure—F dated 23.5.88 is illegal. We are of the view that the detention of the detenu is illegal, without any lawful authority and does not come within the scope of the Special Powers Act and is in contravention of Article 33(4) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"/><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;"><em style="box-sizing: border-box;">Monowara Begum Vs.

As the license s of the guns in question were not cancelled by any legally competent authority such as the District Magistrate or by any authorised officer to whom he is subordinate as required under the provisions of Arms Act or the Arms rules, cancellation thereof by the SDO is illegal. Conviction under sections 16(1) and 19(1) of the Arms Act read with section 26 of the Special Powers Act is not sustainable in law.<br/><strong><em>Anawar  Hossains.

Mansur Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 42 DLR 272.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 33 (4)—</strong><br/>Government cannot detain a person beyond 6 months as the Advisory Board did not submit its opinion within that period. Detention is illegal being also in contravention of Article 33(4) of the Constitution.<br/>It is clear from the provision of Article 33 (4) of the Constitution that if the Advisory Board does not report within six months that there is, in its opinion, cause for such detention of the detenu concerned the Government cannot detain the detenu beyond six months. Undoubtedly the detenu was never placed before the Advisory Board within six months from his detention on 8.1.88. Therefore, the order of detention Annexure—F dated 23.5.88 is illegal. We are of the view that the detention of the detenu is illegal, without any lawful authority and does not come within the scope of the Special Powers Act and is in contravention of Article 33(4) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.<br/><strong><em>Monowara Begum Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 41 DLR 35.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 33(5)—</strong><br/>Preventive detention—Detaining authority must keep in view Article 33(5) of the Constitution—Grounds to be communicated at the earliest to the detenu regarding the order of detention.<br/> The detaining authority must always keep in view Article 33(5) of the Constitution which provides that the authority making the order for preventive detention shall, as soon as may be, communicate to the detained person the grounds on which the order of detention has been made and the Legislature in section 8(2) of Special Powers Act has taken pains to specifically direct the detaining authority to cause service of the order containing the detailed grounds of detention at the time of detention, that is, at the very moment he is detained under the order of preventive detention.<br/><strong><em>Dr. Md. Habibullah Vs. Secretary Ministry, of Home Affairs 41 DLR 160.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 33(5)—</strong><br/>Grounds in the initial order of detention cannot be substituted for separate grounds to be communicated to the detenu.<br/><strong><em>Chunnu Chowdhury Vs. District Magistrate 41 DLR 156.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 35—</strong><br/>Double Jeopardy—The accused is going to be prosecuted in respect of an  offence which did not occur during the earlier transaction nor the present case arose out of the same fact and for the present offence he was not tried previously. In such a position the doctrine of the Constitution or of the Code as to double jeopardy is not applicable in the present case.<br/><strong><em>HM Ershad Vs. State 45 DLR 534.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 35(5)—</strong><br/>In case of malafide the matter of non disclosure will be justifiable one but for  the clear constitutional sanction a non—disclosure of fact that was considered to the prejudice of the detenu ought to be regarded as a violation of basic principle of natural justice.<br/>The detenu cannot also ask as a matter of right to the detaining authority the facts not disclosed on the plea of public interest. This is the privilege of the State and this privilege the Slate can always claim against the detenu, Further, when the liberty of a citizen is a1 snake and when constitutional protection is sought for, it is the Court alone which can very well look into all the materials including the materials to which privilege is claimed by the detaining authority. If, in fact, a privilege is claimed in respect of any material, it is the High Court Division alone that would finally decide as to whether the document is really a privileged one or not. Under proviso to Article 33 (5) of the Constitution, the authority has got a constitutional protection not to disclose anything in public interest and it is the constitutional court alone which can look into the materials pertaining to the detention of the detenu as contemplated in the Constitution for its satisfaction alone. The privilege is given to the State in the interest of the State. People or community cannot be asked for as a mailer of right.<br/><strong><em>Habiba Mahmud Vs. Bangladesh 45 DLR (AD) 89.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 39—</strong><br/>Contempt— Limits of the press — Freedom of the press is recognized in our constitution—a court is to suffer criticism made against it only in the exceptional cases of bad faith or ill motive it will resort to law of contempt.<br/><strong><em>Saleem Ullah Vs State 44 DLR (AD) 309.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 40—</strong><br/>Right to profession— The impugned restriction on the petitioner’s right to be enlisted as a contractor may be bonafide and in the interest of the board, but when it interferes with his fundamental right to profession, the restriction cannot be allowed to exist unless authorized by law.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Jalil Vs. Chairman, REB 45 DLR 24.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 41—</strong><br/>Right to profess religion— The right of the Ahmadiyya community to preach their religious beliefs is subject to law, public order and morality. The book having contained matters which are deliberately and maliciously intended to outrage the religious beliefs of the bulk of the Muslims, the Government was justified in forfeiting the book.<br/><strong><em>Bangladesh Anjuman-e-Ahmadiyya Vs. Bangladesh 45 DLR 185.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 56(3)—</strong><br/>For a detention order made by the District Magistrate on being satisfied about the prejudicial act by any person and the extension of such order by the Government under section 3 of the Special Powers Act, there is no requirement of law to place it before the President for his approval, and consequently there is no obligation nor scope to pass order by noting it as “by order of the President” and this being a purely executive order the provision of Article 56(3) of the Constitution is not applicable to this case.<br/><strong><em>Sekandar Ali Vs. Bangladesh 42 DLR 346.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102—</strong><br/>A litigant has no inherent right in procedural remedy. Since the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court has observed in 35 DLI? (AD) 127 that there is no scope for second revision the matter ends there. That does not mean that of necessity a writ jurisdiction may be invoked.<br/><strong><em>Haji Golam Hossain Vs. Abdur Rahman Munshi 40 DLR (AD) 196.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102—</strong><br/>In certiorari the Court can declare that the conviction of the accused was recorded without lawful authority—if the accused’s trial is vitiated by irregularities in procedure causing him prejudice, the proceedings can be quashed.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Zahir and ors. 45 DLR (AD) 163.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102—</strong><br/>A writ petition does not lie against the decision of the Sessions Judge under section 439A CrPC. A litigant has no inherent right in procedural remedy. Appeal or revision must be given expressly by law. A writ jurisdiction cannot of necessity be invoked.<br/><strong><em>Haji Golam Hossain Vs. Abdur Rahinan Munshi 40 DLR (AD) 196.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102—</strong><br/>Forfeiture of book—Defect in the order is no ground for exercise of writ jurisdiction—For enforcement of fundamental right and for cancellation of order, the Court should look to the equity and good conscience in passing the impugned order (forfeiting the book in question). When the book contains materials justifying the government’s action, the impugned order cannot be struck down on the ground that it does not mention the facts in support of the action.<br/><strong><em>Bangladesh Anjumane-e-Ahmadiyya Vs. Bangladesh 45 DLR 185.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102—</strong><br/>The right to hear is a personal right—the writ petitioner being not the author or publisher of the forfeited book is not entitled to prior notice asking him to show cause against the impugned order.<br/><strong><em>Bangladesh Anjuman-e-Ahmadiyya Vs. Bangladesh 45 DLR 185.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102—</strong><br/>The Court is to hold the balance between the State’s need to prevent prejudicial activities and citizen’s right to enjoy his personal liberty.<br/><strong><em>Habiba Mahmud Vs. Bangladesh 45 DLR (AD) 89.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102—</strong><br/>When court examines a confidential file relating to a detenu it should indicate, without disclosing the materials, that there are facts in the confidential file that are relatable to the ground of detention.<br/><strong><em>Habiba Mahmud Vs. Bangladesh 45 DLR (AD) 89.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(a)(i)—</strong><br/>read with section 439A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)—The Sessions Judge having reversed the finding of possession made in favour of the appellant by the Magistrate, the appellant cannot file writ petition in the nature of mandamus under Article 102(a)(i) of the Constitution.<br/><strong><em>Haji Golam Hossain Vs. Abdur Rahman Munshi 40 DLR (AD) 196.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(b)(i)—</strong><br/>While detaining a person the Government must serve specific grounds for detention so as to enable him to know what are his faults and illegalities. Detention on grounds vague and indefinite without giving sufficient materials to enable the detenu to make effective representation is illegal.<br/><strong><em>Md. Sekandar Ali Vs. Bangladesh 42 DLR 346.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(1)—</strong><br/>The High Court Division clearly proceeded on a misapprehension of the nature of an application under Article 102(2)(1) of the Constitution.<br/><strong><em>Sajeda Parvin Vs. Government of Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(1)—</strong><br/>The Dhaka High Court and after 1972 the High Court of this country have consistently held that where the petitioner has challenged his detention as illegal and the detention is continued by successive orders and the detaining authority fails to show that any of the successive orders of detention is illegal, the rule does not become infructuous.<br/><strong><em>Sajeda Parvin Vs. Government of Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2) (1)—</strong><br/>The fact of detention and not the date of order of the detention is the material point.<br/><strong><em>Sajeda Parvin Vs. Government of Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(b)(1)—</strong><br/>High Court Division which took the view “This rule therefore has become infructuous after revocation of the impugned (original) order and the detenu is in detention not under the said order but under the subsequent order which is not the subject— matter of the present rule” missed the tenor of Article 102(2)(b)(l) which confers jurisdiction on it to “satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner”<br/><strong><em>Sajeda Parvin Vs. Government of Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(b)(i)—</strong><br/>Writ of Habeas Corpus—Nature of enquiry—HC Division’s view erroneous—Considering the nature of enquiry as it is, there is no hesitation in saying that the High Court Division has erroneously taken the view that the Rule (issued by it) has become infructuous as because fresh order had been passed which was not, speaking technically, a subject—matter of the Rule. To say the least, the view that was taken in the case of Abdul Latif Mirza 31 DLR (AD) 1 was overlooked.<br/><strong><em>Sajeda Parvin Vs. Government of Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(b)(i)—</strong><br/>in 31 DLR (AD) 1, it was held that the order of detention for its validity is to be tested on the basis whether the detaining authority had before it material which gave a rational probative value of the order and are not extraneous to the purpose of the Act and beyond which the order of detention is immune from challenge except on the ground of malafide.<br/><strong><em>Sajeda Parvin Vs. Government of Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(b)(i)—</strong><br/>Malafide vitiates everything and the point is so settled that it needs no reiteration by referring to the decided case [Ref: 34 DLR (AD) 222]<br/><strong><em>Sajeda Parvin Vs. Government of Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 102(2)(b)(i)—</strong><br/>Order of detention was passed for collateral purposes. Hence the detention is illegal.<br/><strong><em>Sajeda Parvin Vs. Government of Bangladesh 40 DLR (AD) 178.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 103—</strong><br/>Where serious defect in the finding of fact given by the High Court Division is discovered and the same are considered not tenable then it should be open to the Appellate Division to come to its own) independent finding upon a re-examination or the evidence untrammeled by the opinion of the Court appealed from.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Abdus Sattar 43 DLR (AD) 44.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 103—</strong><br/>State filed a leave petition against the order of acquittal by the High Court Division which was dismissed after hearing—Subsequently the informant filed another leave petition. There is no scope for hearing the second petition at the instance of the informant.<br/><strong><em>Mostoshir Ali Vs. Arman Ali 42 DLR (AD) 12.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 104—</strong><br/>Reduction of sentence—The respondent suffered much during these long years and any direction to suffer further imprisonment will only add to his misery of which he has had enough. The order of the High Court Division acquitting him though set aside and that of the Conviction by the Special Judge under section 409 Penal Code is restored, the sentence of his imprisonment is therefore reduced to the period already undergone by him.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Abdul Muttaleb Khan 45 DLR (AD) 131.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Article 112—</strong><br/>Where specific criminal charge has been levelled and specific criminal case is pending, the executive authority should not take recourse to preventive detention— Executive authority is to act in aid of the Supreme Court as a solemn constitutional obligation.<br/><strong><em>AKM Azizul Hoque Vs.

Section 339C of the Code being not inconsistent with any provisions of the Act shall apply to the proceedings before Special Tribunals constituted under the Act Section 39 is intended for expeditious trail, the special statute is intended for “more seedy trial”.

The expression “complaint” has been defined in section 4(h) of the code of Criminal procedure. It is defined there to mean an allegation made in writing or verbally to a Magistrate. Therefore, a complaint made orally or in writing to a Magistrate would be a complaint and when the Magistrate would be sending that complaint to the Special Judge along with the deposition of the witnesses, and his comments for the disposition of the witnesses and his comments for the Special Judge to take cognizance and if that cognizance is taken again it could not be said that the Special Judge had not taken Cognizance on a complaint.<br/><strong><em>Matiur Rahman Vs State 4O DLR 385.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 5(2) and 167(5)—</strong><br/>The powers conferred under the general provisions of the Code are subject to any special provisions enacted under the Special Powers Act.

A proviso must be considered in relation to the principal matter to which it stands as a proviso; To treat the proviso as If it were an independent enacting clause instead of being dependent on the main enactment is to sin against the fundamental rule of construction, as observed by Moulton, U in RV Dibdin, (1910) (Prob. Dn) 57. The same view has been expressed in Corpus Juris Secondum, Vol. 2 (pp. 887—88).<br/><strong><em>Nurul Huda Vs.

Read with section 28, contained in the same Part II, the “jurisdiction” referred to in sub-section (3) of section 9 is limited to the trial Jurisdiction. Hence the Assistant Session Judges deemed to be appointed as Additional Sessions Judges under the proviso to sub-section (3) shall exercise only trail jurisdiction as Additional sessions Judges and nothing else.

Baharuddin 41 DLR 395.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 9(3), 29C, 31(4), 409—</strong><br/>An Assistant Sessions Judge deemed to be appointed as Additional Sessions Judge has the limited power of passing higher sentences except a Death Sentence in those sessions cases which are now triable by him by deeming and treating him to be an Additional Sessions Judge, consequent upon the changes brought. He shall not be deemed to be an Additional Sessions Judge for all the purposes under the Code, e.g. for hearing appeals, revisions, reference and reviews if they are made over or transferred to him by the. Sessions Judge. Under section 409 the Sessions Judge can transfer the hearing of an appeal only to an Additional Sessions Judge and not to an Assistant Sessions Judge deemed to have been appointed as an Additional Sessions Judge. The dismissal in the instant appeal by the Assistant Sessions Judge and refusal of interference by the High Court Division in revision are therefore illegal. The appeal against conviction is therefore allowed and it is directed that the Sessions Judge may himself dispose of the appeal or transfer it to an Additional Sessions Judge for disposal.<br/><strong><em>Abul Kashem Vs.

The order passed by the learned Sessions Judge on 19.11.1986 dismissing the appeal summarily on the ground of limitation is set aside.<br/><strong><em>Moktar Ahmed Vs.

Dr. Amanullah 40 DLR 94.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 144 and 145(4)—</strong><br/>The instant case is not one of conversion from section 144 to 145 CrPC. By the impugned order the application under section 144 CrPC was disposed of and a proceeding was drawn under section 145 CrPC being satisfied as to the apprehension of serious breach of peace.<br/><strong><em>Nazibul Islam &amp; others Vs. Dr. Amanullah &amp; the State 40 DLR 94.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145—</strong><br/>A proceeding under section 145 CrPC is not a criminal matter.<br/>As to proceedings under section 145 CrPC it is erroneous to designate the complainant as an informant, having regard to the provisions of that section. Once an information is brought to the notice of the Magistrate he has to be satisfied that a dispute as to Immovable property is likely to cause a breach of the peace Further proceedings which he starts are not proceedings in the interest of any private party but in the Interest of public peace (See Babu Vs. Shyam, ILR 1950 All 543). It Is, therefore, highly doubtful if a proceeding under section 145 CrPC can properly be termed as a “criminal matter’.<br/><strong><em>Jobeda Khatun Vs.

Mujibar Rahman 44 DLR (AD) 56.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145—</strong><br/>Jurisdiction of Magistrate acting under sub-section (1) does not and unless the proceeding is either cancelled under sub-section (5) or is finally disposed of under sub-section (6)-Exercise of power under sub-section (5) not dependent upon the result of inquiry under sub-section (4).<br/>The jurisdiction once validly acquired by the Magistrate acting under sub-section (1) of section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not cease until and unless the said proceeding drawn under sub-section (1) is cancelled under sub-section (5) or the subject—matter of the proceeding is finally disposed of under sub-section (6) declaring a party to be entitled to possession thereof. At any stage of the proceeding the Magistrate may come to the conclusion that there is no longer any case for continuing the inquiry.<br/>The exercise of power under sub-section (5) is not dependent upon the result of inquiry under sub-section (4).<br/><strong><em>Moslemuddin Dhali Vs. Helaluddin DhaIi 41 DLR 120.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145—</strong><br/>Right to show that no dispute exists or existed—in moving for cancellation for preliminary order a party has Liberty to produce evidence—What is evidence depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case—Single piece of paper may prove to the satisfaction of the magistrate that a dispute exists or existed or that there Is no apprehension of breach of peace.<br/><strong><em>Moslemuddin Dhali Vs. Helaluddin DhaIi 41 DLR 120.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 &amp; 146—</strong><br/>Dispute as to possession of land—Attachment to continue until civil Court’s decision on title—the parties are litigating their title, as also possession in a Title Suit. It is for them to raise the entire question therein. All comments, observations and findings of the Magistrate in the proceedings under section 145 CrPC and of the High Court Division while disposing of the application under section 561A CrPC with regard to the title and possession of the disputed property (the subject matter of the proceeding under section 145 CrPC) will be ignored by the civil Court while deciding the title suit. It will be lit and proper, in the facts and circumstances of the case, to keep the Magistrate’s order directing the receiver to hand over possession of the case land to the 1st party of section 145 proceeding in abeyance for the present and it is so ordered. It is further ordered that pending disposal of the title suit the disputed land will remain under attachment and the 1st party is to hand over possession thereof to the receiver. On receipt of judgment in the title suit, the Magistrate shall dispose of the proceeding before him in conformity with the decision of the civil Court.<br/><strong><em>Samirun Nessa Vs. Kamaluddin 43 DLR (AD) 175.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 145 and 146(1)—</strong><br/>the purpose of the proceeding under section 145 CrPC is to find the possession of the property.<br/><strong><em>Haji Golam Hossain Vs. Abdur Rahman Munshi 40 DLR (AD) 196.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145(1)—</strong><br/>Grounds of satisfaction not stated in the preliminary order—Additional Sessions Judge could inquire whether there were materials on record for such satisfaction and come to a conclusion that the same was not based on materials.<br/><strong><em>Moslemuddin Dhali Vs. Helaluddin Dhali 41 DLR 120.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145(1)(5)—</strong><br/>Subjective satisfaction in passing order under sub-section (1) but not so when moved under sub-section 5. When a Magistrate passes a preliminary order under sub-section (1), he has to exercise a subjective satisfaction with regard to the apprehension of breach of peace. But when he decides to cancel or not to cancel the preliminary order on being moved under sub-section (5), his satisfaction is no longer subjective. Decision under sub-section (5) is subject to scrutiny on a wider ground than in an order under sub-section (1). This subsequent decision under subsection (5) is subject to scrutiny by the revisional Court on a wider ground than the Magistrate’s order passed under sub-section (1). Order under sub-section (5) based on objective satisfaction—open to wider challenge on revision. But an order passed under sub-section (5) is based on objective satisfaction and it is open to wider challenge before the revisional Court.<br/><strong><em>Moslemuddin Dhali Vs. Helaluddin Dhali 41 DLR 120.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145(4)—</strong><br/>Power in section (4) of section 145 CrPC is an extraordinary power to be exercised in a case of emergency and should not be resorted to as a matter of routine<br/>—No apprehension of breach of peace and parties being in joint possession, the order is to be vacated.<br/><strong><em>Gura Miah Vs. Fazar Ali 42 DLR 70.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 145(5)—</strong><br/>Magistrate came to the conclusion that there is apprehension of breach of peace on the basis of a certain material—In revisional jurisdiction a different view may be taken.<br/>The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate by his order dated 12.4.87 came to the conclusion that the posting of ansars is a further material for coming to a conclusion that there is apprehension of breach of peace. Sitting in the revisional jurisdiction from an order under sub-section (5) the learned Additional Sessions Judge was perfectly entitled to take a different view.<br/><strong><em>Moslemuddin Dhali Vs. Helaluddin Dhati 41 DLR 120.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154—</strong><br/>FIR—Delay—The Court has always viewed First Information Report with grave suspicion when there had been unexplained delay in lodging it. It can be presumed that the delay was used for manipulation of the prosecution story.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Latif Vs. State 44 DLR 492.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154—</strong><br/>FIR does not contain detailed facts of the prosecution case. Its main purpose is to give information of a cognizable offence to the public and set the law in action.<br/><strong><em>Ataur Rahman Vs. State 43 DLR 87.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154—</strong><br/>FIR—Effect of departure from FIR story—where the prosecution has a definite case, it must prove the whole of it; partial departure from the prosecution case affects credibility of the witnesses and complete departure makes their testimony to be entirely discarded.<br/><strong><em>Gapal Rajgor Vs. State 42 DLR 446.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154—</strong><br/>A FIR may be lodged by any person for, it is meant just to set the machinery of law in action.<br/><strong><em>Shah Alam Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 31.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154—</strong><br/>where FIR does not contain an important statement deposed to by the witnesses, it is clear that there has been subsequent embellishment of the prosecution case which makes it untrustworthy.<br/><strong><em>Nazrul Islam Vs. State 45 DLR 142.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 154—</strong><br/>FIR can be used only to corroborate or contradict the maker thereof. There is neither any law nor any principle on the ‘basis of which the testimony of another witness can be ignored or rejected, because the informant had made an omission to mention about the fact which the witness stated in his deposition.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Abdus Sattar 43 DLR (AD) 44.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 154 &amp; 162—</strong><br/>the document exhibited as FIR in the case should not be treated as an FIR for the reason that an information as to the murder was lodged earlier and there was a GD Entry thereon, but the same had not been produced.<br/><strong><em>Akhtar Hossain Vs. State 44 DLR 83.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 155—</strong><br/>A police officer is not to investigate into a non—cognizable case under section 155 CrPC without the order of a Magistrate of the first or second class. Under the law when the police has a report of a non—cognizable offence he is bound to refer the informant to the Magistrate for initiating the process of investigation.<br/><strong><em>Aroj Ali Sarder Vs. State 41 DLR 306.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 157—</strong><br/>First Information Report— FIR cannot be substituted for evidence given on oath and when there is no other evidence the facts mentioned in the information could not be relied upon as proof of the offence alleged.<br/><strong><em>Babul Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 186.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161—</strong><br/>The right of cross—examination on the basis of witnesses’ previous statements under section 161 CrPC having not been available, prejudice to the defence could not be ruled out. The right given to the accused of getting copies of the statements under section 161 CrPC is a valuable right. End of justice requires setting aside the conviction.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Zahir and ors. 45 DLR (AD) 163</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161—</strong><br/>The examination of prosecution witnesses under section 161 CrPC after a considerable lapse of time casts serious doubt on the prosecution story.<br/><strong><em>Moin Ullah Vs. State 40 DLR 443.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161—</strong><br/>The investigation officer having not been cross—examined on the question of delay in recording the statement under section 161 CrPC, there is no substance in the contention that the delay should have been taken as a factor to question the veracity of the witnesses concerned.<br/><strong><em>Shadat Ali Vs. State 44 DLR 217.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 162—</strong><br/>Statements made to the Police in course of investigation of an offence started on the basis of FIR are admissible in evidence. Ext. I not being statements made in course of investigation to the Police comes within the above provision of law.<br/><strong><em>Nurul Islam Vs. State 40 DLR 122.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>A retracted confession cannot be used to base a conviction for murder unless corroborated by credible independent evidence.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Manik Bala 41 DLR 435.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>Statement recorded under section 164 CrPC cannot be used as substantive evidence against the accused person except for contradicting or corroborating its maker.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Manik Bata 41 DLR 435.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>Confessional statement subsequently retracted—To base a conviction for murder upon a retracted confession alone is not safe when the proof of factum of murder is pendent upon that confession.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Manik Bala 41 DLR 435.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>Confession——Question of credibility when part of the occurrence is omitted or suppressed—it cannot be found nor it could be suggested by either the prosecution or the defence why throttling part of the occurrence was omitted or suppressed. Even if it be taken that accused Rina had deliberately suppressed the throttling part of the occurrence in her judicial confession that cannot mean that the confession was not true.<br/><strong><em>ShahJaizan Manik Vs. State 42 DLR 465.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>Confession—Its nature and credibility—The recording Magistrate having not made any genuine effort to satisfy himself to find out the real character of the confession, it casts a serious doubt on the voluntariness of the confession which is the basic requirement of law.<br/><strong><em>Akhtar Hossain alias Babul Akhtar alias Akhtar  Ali and another Vs. State 44 DLR 83:</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>Confessional statement— such statement whether retracted or not, if found to be true and voluntary, can form the basis of conviction of the maker.<br/>Confessional statements, credibility of—The UNO stated that he recorded the statements merely in his own language—there is nothing to show that he gave the accused warnings before recording the same, there is nothing to show the time given for reflection, it was not mentioned whether police were present at the time of recording—The Magistrate also did not inform the accused that they would not be sent to police custody after the making of the statements and the Magistrate’s statement as to the presence of PW 5 at the time of recording of the statements is contradictory to that of the latter—the confessional statements, in such facts and circumstances, are neither voluntary nor true.<br/><strong><em>Hafizuddin Vs. State 42 DLR 397.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>Conviction can be based solely on confession, if found true and voluntary, though retracted subsequently.<br/><strong><em>Hazrat Ali &amp; Abdur Rahman Vs. State 42 DLR 177.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>Confession—Rule of law as opposed to rule of prudence—Whether conviction can be based on confession if voluntary and true. For ascertaining as to whether the confession is voluntary and true or not the Court has to examine the confession itself and consider the same in the light of the materials on record and broad probabilities of the case.<br/>There is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of the learned Magistrate who recorded the confession. No material could be elicited by the defence that the confession was the result of torture and maltreatment and hence it was not voluntary and not true as well.<br/><strong><em>Hazrat Ali &amp; Abdur Rahinan Vs. State 42 R177.</em></strong><br/> <br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>Retracted confession—A confession can be taken into evidence, though retracted, if found to be true and voluntary. A belated retraction at the end of the trial would be of no value.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Nurul Hoque 45 DLR 306</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section I64—</strong><br/>Statement made by the victim of an offence , when it can have evidentiary value—In the absence of examination of the alleged victim, her statements allegedly made to the police or to the magistrate cannot be treated as evidence against the accused. As neither the victim girl nor the magistrate was examined, the statements recorded by the latter is not even a secondary evidence and in that view it is no legal evidence to prove the prosecution case.<br/><strong><em>Abdul  Kashem Vs. State 43 DLR 420.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>Confessional statement—The Magistrate having admitted that after recording the confessional statement, the condemned prisoner was sent back to the police custody, his confessional statement is to be  treated as not voluntarily made.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Ali Kibria 43 DLR 512.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>The Magistrate while recording the confession did not record any questions and answers. But then he made real Endeavour for coming to the conclusion that the statement was voluntary. The omission to record questions and answers cannot be considered as fatal defects when confession was made duly, though not recorded duly, for want of prescribed form. Facts stated in the confessional statement appear to be consistent with the evidence of PWs. In that view, the confessional statement is true as well.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Kalu Bepari 43 DLR 249.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>Credibility of confessional statement—No substantial compliance would cure the defect of noncompliance with the provisions of section 164 CrPC on material points. Confessional statement in a plain paper without the narration of questions and answers would not, by itself, make it inadmissible in evidence. Certificate given by the Magistrate, who had recorded the confessional statement, as to what had happened, how he warned and gave time for reflection to the person confessing, how yet he insisted on making confession and his admitting the same to be correct and the Magistrate’s believing the same to be voluntary ought to be treated as conclusive evidence of facts stated therein unless shown to be otherwise.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Hakim Vs. State 43 DLR 389.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>Confessional statement of appellant Dablu runs counter to the prosecution case. The whole story is inconsistent with the confessional statement of the appellant—PW 2 changed the version in court which differs from the FIR about the number of participants in the murder.<br/>Circumstances of the case—PW 4’s statement differs from the confessional statement of appellant Dablu rendering it contradictory to each Other.<br/><strong><em>Mizazul Islam Vs. State 41 DLR (AD) 157</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>The shivering condition in which the accused made confession indicated that he was subjected to threat and torture before he was produced for recording the confession. His Conviction though could be based on the retracted confession. Even if it was uncorroborated, is illegal when it appears to be neither voluntary nor true.<br/><strong><em>Sanwar Hossain Vs. State 45 DLR 489.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>When an accused is under threat of being sent back to the police remand he is likely to make confession out of fear. His statement in such a position should not be considered as voluntary.<br/><strong><em>Nazrul Islam Vs. State 45 DLR 142.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>Previous statement, use of—The statement of a witness made u/s 164 CrPC is meant for binding him down to the statement made during investigation. The defence may use it to contradict the witness, whereas the prosecution may use it to corroborate him when he gives evidence in court (per Shahabuddin Ahmed CJ concurred by MH Rahman &amp; ATM Afzal j).<br/><strong><em>Abu Taher Chowdhury Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 253.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 164—</strong><br/>If a statement recorded under this section is true and voluntary, the same alone is sufficient for convicting the confessing accused. Retraction of confession is immaterial once it is found to be voluntary and true.<br/><strong><em>Bakul Chandra Sarker Vs. State 45 DLR 260.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164 &amp; 364—</strong><br/>Presumption as to confession—Even though provision is there for making certain presumption in respect of a confession by an accused person produced before a court taken in accordance with law and purporting to be signed by a Magistrate, having regard to the facts of the case it was injudicious to rely upon such confession without calling the Magistrate as a witness. In respect of a confession the court is required to see not only that the forms under sections 164 and 364 CrPC were complied with but the substance underneath the law was equally adhered to—There must not be any reason for doubt as to the truth of the statements, be it circumstantial or proved otherwise. In this particular case it is difficult to deny accused appellants an opportunity to cross—examine the Magistrate who allegedly recorded their statements.<br/><strong><em>Babul Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 186.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164 and 364—</strong><br/>All the formalities in recording the confessional statement were observed. The magistrate recording the confessional statement was satisfied that the confession was voluntary and free from taint. Facts revealed in confession substantially corroborate the prosecution story.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Mizanul Islam 40 DLR 58.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164 and 364—</strong><br/>No hard and fast rule as to the time to be given to the accused for reflection before confession.<br/><strong><em>Ratan Khan Vs. State 40 DLR 186.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164 and 364—</strong><br/>Confession— Statement not recorded in the language of the maker but in the language of the Magistrate— Accused admitted nothing.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Abdur Rashid 40 DLR (AD) 106.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164 &amp; 533—</strong><br/>Confession— Non—compliance with provisions for recording confession, effect of—in a case of non— compliance with the provisions of section 164 CrPC on material points, no question of any substantial compliance would arise.<br/>Certificate given by the Magistrate as to what had happened, how he warned, gave time for reflection, yet how the accused insisted on making the confessional statement ought to be treated as conclusive evidence of facts therein unless shown to be otherwise.<br/>Section 533 CrPC is the curable section but it would not cure a non—compliance if the error had injured the accused in the defence on merits. Thus, when the statements were not even read out to him or could not possibly be read over to him for him to admit or to deny or to examine its correctness or not even shown to him and signed by him, specially when the said are made against his interest and would be used against him it could not be said that the said would be cured under section 533 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Hakim Vs. State 43 DLR 291.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164 and 537— </strong><br/> The recording Magistrate did not make any genuine effort to find out the real character of the confession.<br/>Omissions in the filling up of many paragraphs cast serious doubt upon the voluntary character of confessional statement.<br/>On a careful perusal of the confessional statement we are satisfied that the recording magistrate did not make any genuine effort to find out the real character of the confession which he recorded. The omissions to fill up the above mentioned paragraphs are not mere omissions curable under section 537 Crpc and the manner in which the confession was recorded casts serious doubt as to the voluntary character of the statement.<br/><strong><em>Azad Shaikh Vs State 41 DLR 62</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 164(3) and 364—</strong><br/>Section 164(3) a mandatory provision of law. The requirement of adherence to the provisions of section 164(3) CrPC is not a mere matter of form but of substance that has to be complied with—Viewed in the light of the principles indicated above we have no hesitation to hold that the recording of the confessional statement Ext. 5(c) was not done in compliance with the requirement of sub-section (3) of section 164 read with section 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><strong><em>Azad Shaikh Vs.

Unless the accused is sent to the Magistrate and the Magistrate passing the order of remand without the accused being forwarded to him, the legal requirement is not complied with for the Magistrate to assume jurisdiction to pass the order of remand.

If the document in question is not produced in Court, but a certified copy of same is produced, no complaint from the c is necessary for prosecution of the alleged offenders. In view of the decision in the of Sanmukhsingh and others Vs.

State 40 DLR 186</em></strong><br/> <br/>—Principle of identification of an accused by witness in dock when there was a previous TI parade—Circumstances when a witness Cannot possibly identify the accused in dock stated. Ratio decidendi in 1925 AIR (All) 223 approved. We are in respectful agreement with the ratio decidendi reported in 1925 AIR (All) 223. It is well—settled that the evidence that a witness gives in the witness box is the  substantive evidence and it is always desirable that the witness should be able to identify the accused persons in dock when there was a previous TI Parade, but owing to lapse of time and other compelling reasons it may not possible for the witness to identify the accused persons in dock.<br/><strong><em>Ratan Khan Vs. State 40 DLR 186</em></strong><br/> <br/>—Failure of witnesses to identify accused sons who are strangers to the witnesses— if made without naming them—Court’s duty to sift evidence in that circumstance—Any statement, express or implied, made by a witness identifying the accuseds but without naming them, it qualifies as substantive evidence—Test of.<br/><strong><em>Ratan Kha Vs.

That the appellants were taken either to the house of the informant or to the police barrack first and were shown to the PWs 1—3 before the TI parade has no leg to stand upon.<br/><strong><em>Ratan Kha Vs.

This section of the Code provides that a person who earlier accepted  the pardon may be the offence in respect of which the pardon was tendered, if the Public Prosecutor certifies that in his opinion the person has either wilfully concealed anything essential or had given false evidence and has not complied with the condition on which the tender was made. This implies that the whole basis for the prosecution of a person to whom pardon has been tendered under section 337 or 338 of the Code for the offence in respect of which the pardon was tendered is a certificate by the Public Prosecutor that in his opinion the person who has accepted the pardon has either wilfully concealed anything essential or had given false evidences and has not complied with the condition on which the tender was made.<br/><strong><em>Angur Vs.

From the materials on record it is also found that this appellant was produced before the Court on 4.6.78 for the first time and thereafter was produced in Court on various occasions before the holding of the TI Parade on 11.6.79 and definitely therefore, it was possible for the witnesses like PW 3 Joynal see the appellant in Court. In such circumstances of the case the identification by PW3 in the’ TI Parade is found to be quite Unreliable and without any significance.<br/>Furthermore, the Magistrate who conducted the TI Parade has not been examined during the trial. There is no material before the Court to find definitely that the TI parade was conducted legally and after observing legal formalities. In view, of the above it is found that the identification of appellant Angur by PW 3 Joynal is very much unreliable and the appellant is entitled to the benefit of doubt.<br/><strong><em>Angur Vs.

The learned: Assistant Sessions Judge on the basis of this petition directed for framing charge against the appellant. This petition, dated 8.12.82 and the petition dated 23.3.85 submitted by successor APP Mr Khan at Kishoreganj cannot be termed as a certificate issued by the Public Prosecutor as contemplated under section 339(1) of the Code.<br/><strong><em>Angur Vs.

It is desirable in the interest of administration of justice that witnesses be summoned on a day when the Court is in a position to examine them. No adjournment at the instance of any party should be allowed causing inconvenience to witnesses. Practice of adjourning criminal trial frequently on the prayer of the defence in spite of appearance of prosecution witnesses on the ground of absence of any accused overlooking provision of section 339B CrPC is contrary to law and should be discontinued.<br/><strong><em>Mahbubur Rahman Khan Vs.

Jahaur Ali 42 DLR 94.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339B, sub-section (1)—</strong><br/>Failure to publish the order in at least one Bengali daily newspaper is violative of the provision of section 339B CrPC and also of principle of natural justice.<br/><strong><em>Moktar Ahmed Vs. Haji Farid Alam 42 DLR 162.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C—</strong><br/>Provisions of this section is not merely a procedural law. It is a law vesting the accused with a right which could not be taken away by a subsequent amendment of the law.<br/><strong><em>Abu Sufian and 3 ors. Vs.

State 42 DLR 97.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339C—</strong><br/>‘Working days” for disposal of criminal cases—stopping proceedings for release of the accused—”Working days” of the Court—”Working days” shall be understood to mean the “Working days” during which the learned Judge will hold the charge of the trial Court—A Division Bench of the High Court Division rightly excluded the period of 53 days from the statutory period for the trial as the Additional District Judge held the charge of the District and Sessions Judge for 53 days which were not treated as “Working days” for the trial Court. The application for quashing the proceedings rightly rejected.<br/><strong><em>Abul Kashem Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 97.</em></strong><br/> <br/>Section 339C read with Ordinance No. 37 of 1983 (coming into force on 8.8.1983 extending the time—limit up to 30.6.1985 in his case and later on finally up to 30.9.1985)<br/>Charge—sheet was submitted on 16.6.83 before SDM who in due course forwarded the record to the Sessions Judge for trial. The case comes within the ambit of the Lime limit of the Ordinance No. 37 of 1983 which was intended to save such trials. Construction put to the Ordinance by the HC Division is not correct to conclude that this case is “not pending” on the date of commencement of the Ordinance.<br/><strong><em>State Vs.

State 40 DLR 139.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 339C(4) &amp; D—</strong><br/>Revival of a case—By the use of expressions in an unambiguous manner the legislature has left absolutely no doubt that the limitation regarding making an application by the Government to the court for revival of the relevant case shall run from the date on which the court concerned actually stopped the proceedings and not from the date on which the proceedings of the trial of the case should have been stopped.<br/><strong><em>AHM Kamaluddin Vs. State 43 DLR 294.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section “339C, sub-section (6)—</strong><br/>Criminal trial—”Working days” to be counted in determining the time for disposal of criminal cases—”Working days” mean the days on which a Judge works as such. So, the days when the learned Sessions Judge was on leave and outside the stations should not be regarded as “Working days” of the learned Sessions Judge. The court is of the opinion that these days should be excluded while computing the time required for disposal of the sessions case. This being the legal position 150 days did not expire in the present case and application for stopping of the proceeding of the session’s case and for release of the accused petitioners has rightly been rejected.<br/><strong><em>Akbar Ali Vs. State 40 DLR29.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 339D—</strong><br/>Revival of a case under section 339D. Under the scheme of the Code itself, the Public Prosecutor is competent to file application for revival of a case on behalf of the Government without any authority or instruction whatsoever.<br/><strong><em>Dr. SM Abu Taher Vs.State 42 DLR 138.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 340—</strong><br/>An Advocate to defend an undefended accused charged with capital offence should be appointed well in time to enable him to study the case and the lawyer should be of sufficient standing and able to render assistance. He should be provided with papers which are ordinarily allowed to the accused.<br/>The deficiencies as on the record are due to the appointment of State lawyer without giving him sufficient time to prepare the case. This has seriously prejudiced the accused persons and their defence was materially affected. The State defence lawyer could not do justice to the case of the absconding accused who have been sentenced to death. The impugned order of the learned Sessions Judge convicting and sentencing condemned prisoner Hanif and convict Waliar to death under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code is set aside and they are directed to be tried of the charge already framed. The case is sent back on remand for fresh trial in the light of the observation made.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Hanif Gani 45 DLR 400.</em></strong><br/> </div></div></div>

In such circumstances also the confessional statement cannot be used against the appellant. The trial Court also should not state anything regarding any incriminating evidence against the appellant under section 342 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Angur Vs.State 41 DLR 66.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>There being nothing on record to show that the main aspects of the confessional statement of the accused was brought to his notice he was certainly prejudiced and as such the statement could not be used against him.<br/><strong><em>Kabir and others Vs. State 45 DLR 755.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>The accused appellant was asked questions during statement under section 342 CrPC with the preconceived notion that he was already found guilty under sections 395/397 of the Penal Code. This type of questions being against all norms of procedure of criminal jurisprudence are highly prejudicial to the accused.<br/><strong><em>Abu Taleb Vs. State 41 DLR 239.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>No question relating to bloodstained cloth or injury in the hand was put to the condemned—prisoner. This circumstance has no basis to base conviction.<br/>It is surprising that though some of the PWs alleged to have seen the said bloodstained shirt, no attempt was made even by the police to seize the same and also to examine the said blood by any chemical examiner. Further, in the examination under section 342 CrPC no question relating to such blood—stained cloth or injury in the hand was put to the condemned— prisoner. So, this circumstance has no basis and the same has not been established at all by any reliable evidence.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Badsha Mollah 41 DLR 11.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/> Provisions of section 342 having not been followed strictly, Ext. 5, the confessional statement, was wrongly relied upon.<br/>Since the officer who conducted the test identification parade was not examined by the prosecution, the test identification report is not admissible in evidence.<br/>So far as accused appellant Amir Hossain is concerned since his confessional statement has not been mentioned in his examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he cannot be convicted relying upon his confessional statement.<br/>Since the prosecution can neither rely upon his confessional statement nor take advantage of the evidence of identifying witnesses there is no other legal evidence against accused Amir Hossain to sustain his conviction under sections 395/397 of the Penal Code.<br/><strong><em>Amir Hossain Vs. State 41 DLR 32.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>A statement of the accused under section 342 CrPC is meant for giving him an opportunity to explain the circumstances appearing against him in the evidence adduced by the prosecution—This is entirely for the benefit of the accused and the accused only—This statement cannot be used by the Court against him, nor is the prosecution permitted to use it to fill up any gap left in the prosecution evidence. Relied on (1923) ILR Lah 50.<br/><strong><em>Shah Alam Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 31.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>One of important items for linking up the accused with the crime, namely the sandal, was not at all put to the accused as a circumstance appearing in the case against him while he was examined under section 342 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Mirazul Islam Vs. State 41 DLR (AD)157.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>The trial Court failed to take into consideration along with evidence on record the accused’s written reply giving vivid description of the highhandedness of BDR personnel in support of their defence that they were implicated in the case at the instance of their rival businesses men.<br/><strong><em>Subodh Ranjan Vs. State 45 DLR 521.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>Prsence at the place and time of murder—reasonable doubt as to guilt—In his examination under section 342 CrPC, though all the evidence against him were brought to his notice to prove the charge of murder, accused Kashem did not explain away his presence with co—accused Abbas at the place and time of the murder to raise doubt in the mind of the Court about his guilt, not to speak of raising any reasonable doubt.<br/><strong><em>Abul Kashem Vs. State 42 DLR 378.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>Allegation of torture made in statement recorded under section 342 CrPC—No reliance can be placed on the belated allegation of torture by police in obtaining confession in the absence of materials on record to substantiate the same.<br/><strong><em>Hazrat Ali &amp; Abdur Rahman Vs. State 42 DLR 177.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>Conviction of co—accused who has not confessed—Circumstances show the accused Shahjahan Manik had Intimacy with accused Rina and this put them on visiting terms and the visits had strengthened his intimacy with Rina. Their guilty conscience is also evident from the false plea in their statements made under section 342 CrPC that not know each other.<br/><strong><em>Shahjahan Manik State 42 DLR 465.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>The provision of this section is meant for giving the accused an opportunity to explain the circumstances appearing against him. There is no merit in the contention that the appellate Court acted illegally in relying on his statement under section 342.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Karim Vs. Shamsul Alam 45 DLR 578.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>Omission to examine the accused under this section is not curable under section 537. After the prosecution closes its evidence the court shall examine the accused and ask them whether they will adduce any evidence in defence. Omission to do so vitiates the conviction if such omission has prejudiced the accused in their defence. The conviction is set aside and it is directed that the accused be examined under section 342 CrPC by the trial Court and thereupon the case be disposed of according to law.<br/><strong><em>A. Gafur Vs. Jogesh Chandra Roy 43 DLR (AD) 62.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 342 &amp; 537—</strong><br/>Omission of charge as to common intention—Non—mentioning of section 34, Penal Code during his examination under section 342 CrPC has not in any manner prejudiced the accused in their defence. It is a mere irregularity which is curable and there has been no failure of justice for such non—mentioning.<br/><strong><em>Abul Kashem Vs. State 42 DLR 378.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344—</strong><br/>Stay of proceeding—In the facts of the case as in point of time the civil suit was instituted before the filing of the FIR and the questioned documents in their originals are yet to be produced and examined by the civil Court. The criminal proceeding, where the documents are claimed as forged, may, in the interest of justice, be stayed till the disposal of the civil suit.<br/><strong><em>Zakir Hossain and others Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 102.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344—</strong><br/>Refusal of prayer for ad-interim stay while issuing Rule in criminal revision—When appellant clearly stated before the High Court Division while obtaining the Rule that she gave birth to a child just five months ago and it would be injurious to her health as also to the baby if both were to be placed under any type of custody at that critical stage it was not a judicious and sound exercise of discretion to refuse the said stay.<br/><strong><em>Azima Begum Vs. Yusif Khan 43 DLR (AD) 53.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344—</strong><br/>Prayer for stay of judgment in criminal case on the ground of pendency of civil suit—Section 344 CrPC authorizes the Court to adjourn a trial. That a judgment in a criminal court is pronounced “after the termination of the ia1” is provided in section 366 CrPC. Therefore, the prayer for stay of delivery of judgment under section 344 was misconceived.<br/><strong><em>Hussain Mohammad Ershad Vs. State 44 DLR (AD) 145.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344—</strong><br/>Power to postpone proceedings—Applicability of such power to postpone judgment in a criminal case pending disposal of a civil suit—The application under section 344 CrPC had been moved at a belated stage after the evidence was closed and the trial came to an end. Only because the judgment remains to be delivered, the application does not appear to be one as contemplated under section 344. In fact the petitioner knew of this and prayed for adjournment of the judgment, not of the triaL The application at this stage does not appear to be maintainable.<br/><strong><em>Hussain Mohammad Ershad Vs. State 44 DLR 116.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344—</strong><br/>Stay of criminal proceedings—Remand—A case and counter case over the self—same occurrence are to be tried by the same Court one after another. The judgment in both the cases is to be pronounced on the same date by the same Magistrate so that there is no conflicting decision and the parties are not prejudiced. The impugned judgment and onler is set aside and the case remanded back to the Magistrate with direction to try CR Case No. 155 of 1989 and CR case No. 152 of 1989by the same Magistrate giving opportunity to the parties to adduce their evidence and keeping the evidence already recorded in Cr Case No. 155 of 1989 intact.<br/><strong><em>Sharif Vs. Md. Obaidur Rahman 43 DLR 66.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 367—</strong><br/>There has not been any miscarriage of justice caused by non compliance with the provisions of section 367 CrPC while acquitting the accused persons by — the Magistrate though his judgment was not in proper form.<br/><strong><em>Nurul Huda Vs. Bhashanu Sardar 40 DLR (AD) 256.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 367—</strong><br/>Judgment—Writing of a proper judgment—If the trial Court’s judgment is such that it cannot be termed as a judgment as per requirement of this section, then an order of writing a proper judgment may be necessary—When the entire matter is open to the criminal Appellate Court which is— required by law to assess the evidence. Independently and come to its finding, then merely because there has been some omission made by the Trial Court in not considering &amp; piece or pieces of evidence, would hardly offer a valid ground for sending the case on remand for a proper judgment.<br/><strong><em>Md. Moslehuddin Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 160.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 367—</strong><br/>Remand—As a general rule an order for retrial would be proper if the trial in the lower Court was vitiated by illegality or irregularity or for, other reason.<br/><strong><em>Md. Moslehuddin Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 142.</em></strong><br/> <br/>Section 367 as amended by the Law Reforms Ordinance (XLIX of 1978), Section 2 and Schedule thereto read with the Penal Code (XLV of 1860), Section 302.<br/>Substitution of sub-section (5) of section 367 CrPC by the Law Reforms Ordinance— Effect of change on sentencing—Previously death sentence was the normal sentence for murder and the court was required to give reasons if the lesser sentence of life imprisonment was given—After the sub—situation now reasons have to be given in either case —A death sentence is to be justified in as much in the same way as in the case of lesser sentence of life term imprisonment.<br/><strong><em>Abed Ali Vs State DLR (AD) 171.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 367(1)—</strong><br/>Mere stating by the , Court that the appeal is dismissed on merit and  the order of conviction and sentence  is confirmed without considering the evidence on record and the cases of the parties cannot be said to be a judgment on merit.<br/><strong><em>Abul Basher Vs sate 40 DLR 248. </em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section367 (1)—</strong><br/>Section 367(1) relates to Criminal Court of original jurisdiction but the same has been made to apply to the Appellate the High Court Division by reasons of section 424 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Abul Basher Vs. State 40 DLR 248.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 369—</strong><br/>Review—Application praying for review of judgment passed .in a criminal case is totally contrary to the provisions of section 369.<br/><strong><em>Samad Ahmed Vs. State 45 DLR 394.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374—</strong><br/>Commutation of sentence— extenuating circumstances for commutation —condemned prisoners are under peril of death. Sentence for almost 3 years suffering agony and torments and thereby partially purged their guilt. Their life may be spared. Sentence of death commuted to one of imprisonment for life.<br/><strong><em>Abul Kashem Vs. State 42 DLR 378.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374—</strong><br/>Accused Rina is a young woman aged 24 with an infant and she confessed expressing repentance. Both the convicts suffered pangs of death sentence for about 3 1/2 years. There are extenuating circumstances for sparing them from the extreme punishment, of death.<br/><strong><em>Shahjahan Manik Vs. State 42 DLR 465.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374—</strong><br/>Commutation——Delay by itself is no extenuating circumstance for commuting the sentence. There must be other circumstances of a compelling nature which together with delay will, merit commutation.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Khair Vs. State 44 DLR (AD) 225.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374—</strong><br/>Commutation of sentence— In the instant case there is an immediate voluntary confession. The accused could have taken a plea of innocence but being repentant he made rather an open breast of everything and may be asking for mercy of God. This aspect .of his character needs be kept in view and then the delay in hearing this reference had not been done by him but he had suffered the agony all these 6 years.<br/><strong><em>Abdur Rahman Syed Vs.

State 42 DLR (AD) 171.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376—</strong><br/>There is nothing or record to show that there was (any real) love between the appellant and deceased Dilara. The appellant being not a jilted lover, it is difficult to commute the sentence of death to one of imprisonment for life.<br/>Further soon before the occurrence there was no provocation from the prosecution side and there was no occasion for the appellant to show any emotional imbalance and disequilibrium. On the contrary, the evidence on record shows that the appellant with a premeditated and pre—planned manner entered into the hut of the deceased with a dagger and killed her. The trial Court as also the High Court Division found no mitigating circumstances. Nor did we.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Quddus Vs.

It remains in force, but the convict due to an order of remission and suspension passed under section 401 CrPC is not to serve out the period of sentence so suspended and is not to pay the fine so remitted.<br/><strong><em>Nasiruddin Miah Vs. State 40 DLR 244.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 401 and 423—</strong><br/>In case of an appeal from an order of acquittal, the Court may refuse the prayer of withdrawal of the appeal as it may find on hearing the appeal on merit that the order appealed is illegal and calls for an order of conviction.<br/><strong><em>Nasiruddjn Miah Vs. State 40 DLR 244.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 403—</strong><br/>Double Jeopardy—The accused is going to be prosecuted in respect of an offence which did not occur during the earlier transaction nor the present case arose out of the same fact and for the present o1fence he was not tried previously. In such a position the doctrine of autrefois acquits and autrefois convict or of the Code as to double jeopardy is not applicable in the present case.<br/><strong><em>HM Ershad Vs. State 45 DLR 534.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 403(2)—</strong><br/>Trial of an accused for one distinct offence will not stand in the way of his subsequent trial for the other distinct offence as specifically provided by sub-section (2) of section 403. The former trial for unauthorised possession of the firearms will not be a bar to the subsequent trial for the offence of robbery, even if the same firearms have been used while committing the robbery. The trial of the petitioners in this case is perfectly lawful.<br/><strong><em>Arfan Ali Vs.

He shall not be deemed be an Additional Sessions Judge for all the under the Code, eg for hearing appeals revisions, references and reviews if they are  made over or transferred to him by the Judge. Under section 409 the session Judge can transfer the hearing of an appeal only to an Additional Sessions Judge and to  an Assistant Sessions Judge deemed been appointed as an Additional session Judge. The dismissal in the instant appeal by the Assistant Sessions Judge and refusal of interference by the High Court division are therefore illegal. The appeal against conviction is therefore allowed and it is directed that the Sessions Judge may himself dispose of the appeal or transfer it to an Additional Sessions Judge for disposal.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Kasham Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 77.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 409, 410, 435, 436, 438 and 439A—</strong><br/>Under section 409 the Sessions Judge can transfer the hearing of an appeal only to an Additional Sessions Judge and not to an Assistant Sessions Judge. Section 410 has also full force and any person convicted on a trial held by a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge may appeal to the High Court Division. This section has no reference to an Assistant Sessions Judge deemed to have been appointed as an Additional Sessions Judge. The same applies to sections 435, 436, 438 and 439A.<br/><strong><em>Nurul Huda Vs. Baharuddin 41 DLR 395.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 410—</strong><br/>The High Court Division sitting in appeal was bound to give due weight to the opinion of the trial Court with regard to the credibility and demeanour of the witnesses.<br/><strong><em>State Vs.

MH Azad 41 DLR 257.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417—</strong><br/>Review of evidence—The reason given by the Judges of the High Court Division to disregard the evidence of PWs 2, 3 &amp; 4 relying only upon the evidence of PW 7 is rather artificial. In an appeal by the State against acquittal it is quite open to the Court to review the evidence in order to see whether finding on which acquittal is based is perverse being in wanton disregard of good and unblemished evidence given by other witnesses.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Ashraf Ali 43 DLR (AD) 83.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417, 418 and 423—</strong><br/>Provisions under these sections give to the High Court Division full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal was founded—No limitation should be placed upon that power.<br/><strong><em>Shah Alam Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 31.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417 and 439(4)(5)—</strong><br/>Petitioner acquitted of the charge of dacoity by the trial Judge—Government had not preferred any appeal under section 417 CrPC—Section 439 CrPC does not authorise High Court Division to convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction. Held—the Rule issued suo motu by the High Court Division was without jurisdiction.<br/><strong><em>Jalal Uddin Vs. Mrs. Bilkis Rahman&amp; State 42 DLR 107.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417A—</strong><br/>Appeal by informatnt— Competency—The contention that an appeal at the instance of an informant from an inadequate sentence lies under section 417A has no substance. <br/><strong><em>Abdul Aziz Vs. State 44 DLR 594.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417A—</strong><br/>That all judgment, whether conviction or acquittal are appealable under section 30(1) Gf the Special Powers Act.Under sub-section (1) Of section 27, criminal cases coming within the ambit of the Special Powers Act can only be initiated on a report in writing made by a police officer not below the rank of Sub—Inspector So no private party has any right to initiate such cases. Section 30 seems to cover appeals by a State. Therefore this appeal is not maintainable under section 417(1) of CrPC.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Wanur Rahman 40 DLR 346.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417(1) (a)—</strong><br/>Maintainability of appeal by witness against order of acquittal— The State under section 417(1)(a) of the Code is authorised to present an appeal against an order of acquittal passed by the Court of Sessions. But in the present case, the appeal was not preferred by the State. The appeal was filed before the High Court Division by a witness who is also the petitioner in the present petition for leave to appeal. Hence this leave petition is not maintainable in law.<br/><strong><em>Fazar Ali alias Manik Chand Vs.

State 40 DLR (AD) 286.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 426—</strong><br/>Bail after conviction—The accused could obtain bail from the Appellate Court or from the High Court Division and not from the trial Court which became functus officio after the filing and disposal of appeal against conviction.<br/><strong><em>Dulal Vs.

State 40 DLR (AD) 281.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 426—</strong><br/>Bail—Condition for the bail is quite reasonable and can be complied with by the person seeking bail without any difficulty but payment of fine involving huge amount of money as a condition for bail may not be possible—Impugned order of payment of fine as a condition for the bail is not supportable either in law or on the principle of reasonableness.<br/><strong><em>Iqbal Vs.

On his death during the pendency of the revision case arising out of the matter his wife having stepped into his shoes so far as it relates to his properties, she is required to be brought on record to protect her interest in the land.<br/><strong><em>Dr. Md. Abdul Baten Vs. State 43 DLR 60.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435 and 436—</strong><br/>Sessions Judge called for records of the case triable under the provisions of the Special Powers Act from the Court of the Magistrate in exercise of his power under sections 435 and 436 CrPC and took cognizance of the offence after converting himself into a Special Tribunal—this is not contemplated by law.<br/><strong><em>Satya Ranjan Sarda Vs. State 42 DLR 142.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435 and 439—</strong><br/>Interpretation of Statute—The expression “if the accused is in confinement” in section 439 CrPC is used as a condition precedent to bail.<br/><strong><em>Abdus Samad Vs.

State 41 DLR 291.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435, 439 &amp; 561A—</strong><br/>Power under sections 439 and 561A is different in nature—Section 439 read with section 435 refers to inferior Court under High Court Division—Exercise of power under section 561A is not limited to the inferior Court only.<br/><strong><em>Jagodish Chandra Dutta Vs. MH Azad 41 DLR 257.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 436—</strong><br/>Sessions Judge’s power to order enquiry—The Sessions Judge commits no illegality in setting aside the order of discharge of the accused passed by the Magistrate and in directing the latter to send the case record to the Court of the Sessions Judge along with statements recorded by the police. The order is within the scope of section 436 CrPC. But the Sessions Judge’s further order giving direction to send the accused for trial being in excess of his jurisdiction cannot be sustained. The Magistrate is left with his absolute discretion in the matter of taking cognizance of the offence and sending the accused—petitioners to the Court of Sessions for trial after holding further enquiry according to law.<br/><strong><em>Motaleb Vs. State 43 DLR 519.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 436—</strong><br/>Sessions Judge’s power to order inquiry—The jurisdiction of the Sessions Judge is wide enough to direct further inquiry by a Magistrate. If the Sessions Judge directs to make further inquiry by the Magistrate by holding a judicial inquiry it is fully within the express power given to the Sessions Judge under section 436 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Farid Ahmed &amp; others Vs. State 44 DLR 30.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 436—</strong><br/>The Magistrate seemed to have acted within his jurisdiction to decide; on assessment of evidence on record, whether all or some of the accused are to be sent fr trial. The order of the Sessions Judge having the effect of directing the Magistrate to take cognizance of the 8 accused against whom the latter found no prima facie case is not within the scope of further inquiry contemplated under section 436 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Mohibar Rahman Vs.

When appellant clearly stated before High Court Division while obtaining the rule that she gave birth to a child just five ago and it would be injurious to her health as also to the baby if both were to be placed under any type of custody at that critical stage it was not a judicious and sound exercise of discretion to refuse the said stay.<br/><strong><em>Azima Vs. Yusuf Khan 43 DLR (AD) 53.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439—</strong><br/>Revision against order of acquittal When the appellate Court and the High Court Division upon evidence and circumstances which is not unreasonable or Perverse refused to believe the prosecution case, this court merely because a different view is possible of the evidence does not interfere with an order of acquittal.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Hamid Mollah Vs.

State 40 DLR (AD) 294.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439—</strong><br/>Direction for filing a separate, application. for bail while moving a revisional application whether proper—When the appellants were already on bail granted by the lower Appellate Court, the direction that has been given after rejecting the prayer for bail is not proper and is not in keeping With the normal practice and procedure that is traditionally followed in the High Court Division in revision. In that view of the matter, the appellants will remain on bail already granted, till, disposal of the revision case.<br/><strong><em>Baneazuddin Ahmed Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 120.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439—</strong><br/>Application for condonation of delay in filing an appeal under the Special Powers Act is not maintainable. And such an appeal when time—barred cannot be treated as a revisional application under CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Shamsul Haque Vs. State 43 DLR 247.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 439—</strong><br/>The remand order amounts to a double jeopardy for the petitioners and offers a chance to the prosecution to remedy its lacuna. Such a remand should not be made.<br/><strong><em>Fazal Vs. State 43 DLR 40.</em></strong><br/> <br/>Section 439 read with Employment of Labour (Standing Orders) Act (VIII of 1965)— Section 26—High Court Division in exercise of its power under section 439 CrPC has no jurisdiction to review any order of the Labour Court passed under section 26 of the Employment of Labour (Standing Orders) Act.<br/>The application on which the instant Rule was issued and was filed under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. We, therefore, find that this Court has no jurisdiction to review any order of the Labour Court passed under section 26 of the Employment of Labour (Standing Orders) Act, 1965.<br/><strong><em>Jagodish Chandra Dutta Vs. MH Azad 41 DLR 257.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439 &amp; 439A—</strong><br/>Revisional power of the High Court Division—It is true that the party in a revision case under section 439A is debarred from agitating his point before the High Court Division under section 439 of the Code, but the power has not been restricted by any clause of section 439 or by any law if it is considered necessary to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court. The order of the Sessions Judge being not in accordance with law requires interference and the aid of section 561A of the Code can be appropriately invoked there being no scope for a second revision.<br/><strong><em>Dr. Md. Abdul Baten Vs. State 43 DLR 60.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439, 439A &amp; 561A—</strong><br/>Propriety of exercising jurisdiction under section 561A CrPC to quash Magistrate’s order drawl proceeding under section 145 CrPC —as the High Court Divisions revisional jurisdiction is concurrent with that of the Session and although the High Court Division could decline to interfere for not moving the Sessions Judge, the interference that has been made cannot be said to be without jurisdiction. Jurisdiction under section 561 A CrPC is not ousted in the presence of the revisional jurisdiction of the Sessions Judge under section 439A of the Code. The only question will be, has any case been made out either under section 439 or 561A of the code? The answer will vary case to case.<br/><strong><em>Samirun Nessa Vs. Kamaluddin 43 DLR (AD) 175.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439A &amp; 561A—</strong><br/>Inherent jurisdiction whether available to one losing in revision—The inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Division will be available even to a party who has lost in revision before the Sessions Judge. But it must be clearly borne in mind that the powers under section 561A being extraordinary in nature, should be exercised sparingly and where such exercise essential and justified by the tests specially laid down in the provision itself.<br/><strong><em>Aminul Islam Vs Mujibur Rahman 45 DLR (AD) 9.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439A &amp; 561A—</strong><br/>Revision jurisdiction of the High Court Division— Revision in a case arising out, of section 145 CrPC. A party who has been unsuccessful in revision under section 439A CrPC is not totally debarred from invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court Division under section 56lA. The opening words of this latter section—”Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent power of 1t High Court Division” repels any contention of such debarment.<br/><strong><em>Aminul Islam Vs. Mujibur Rahman 44 DLR (AD) 56.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439(4) and 439A(2)—</strong><br/>No Second revision lies in view of the law in Sections 439(4) &amp; 439(A)(2) of the CrPC. The purported distinction sought to be drawn by the learned Judge of the High Court Division was misconceived and the obiter was unwarranted.<br/><strong><em>Haji Golam Hossain Vs.

In section 439 of the Code there is a bar, as sub-section (4) of the section provides to the effect that in an appealable case the party who has right to appeal cannot invoke section 439. But there is no such restriction in section 561A.<br/><strong><em>Khalilur Rhaman Vs.

The Rule against the appellants was made absolute, but it was discharged against the two Advocates. Hence this appeal.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Gafur Vs.

Bangladesh Bar Council 42 DLR 201.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 488—</strong><br/>Order of maintenance of wife and son—the purpose of the Family Courts Ordinance is to provide for speedy disposal of family matters by the same forum. There will be anomaly and multiplicity of proceedings if, in spite of the establishment of Family Courts, the Magistrate continues to entertain cases for maintenance. Provisions made in the Family Courts Ordinance have ousted the jurisdiction of the Magistrates to entertain application for maintenance which is a family court matter.<br/><strong><em>Md.

The phrases “illegally” or “improperly” used in the sub-section (b) of section 491 of the Code mean that when a person is not detained within the provisions of any, law, the detention becomes an illegal detention.

The custody or detention of a victim  girl is different from that of a criminalor a political detenu. Judicial custody has the complexion of the custody of a guardian. This custody is necessary for giving the girl a chance to make up her mind and develop her independent opinion free from external influence facts and circumstances of each case will determine as to how and when the inherent discretion of the court for judicial custody is to be exercised.<br/><strong><em>Dr. Kazi Mozammel Hoque Vs.

State 42 DLR 138.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 497—</strong><br/>Bail—This section enjoins upon the Court to exercise judicial discretion in the matter of granting bail for ascertaining whether the materials placed before the court by the prosecution are of such a tangible nature that if left unrebutted, they may lead to the inference of guilt of the accused. In the present case there is no other material on record other than the FIR and mere allegations thereof. The court thus committed an error in refusing bail in this case.<br/><strong><em>AKM Mosharraf Hossain Vs. State 44 DLR (AD) 246.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 497 and 498—</strong><br/>Bail—A person is not automatically debarred from getting bail merely because his name was mentioned in the charge-sheet.<br/><strong><em>Liaqat Sharf Vs.

State 44 DLR (AD) 8.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498—</strong><br/>Bail—It is not the prima facie case against the accused but ‘reasonable grounds’ for believing that he has been guilty which prohibits granting of bail. The onus is on the prosecution to disclose those reasonable grounds. Court has to examine the data available in the case to find out whether reasonable grounds exist to connect the accused with the crime alleged.<br/><strong><em>Shaikh Shahidul Islam Vs. State 44 DLR (AD) 192.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498—</strong><br/>Bail—Refusal of bail in a case of murder in which the accused was earlier exempted from trial—In view of Sessions Judge’s findings that non— submission of charge sheet against the petitioner earlier was without valid reason, that he is a powerful man in the locality and there is a possibility of his influencing the witnesses has substance—there is no compelling reason to enlarge the petitioner on bail.<br/><strong><em>ASM Abdur Rob Vs. State 44 DLR 205.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498—</strong><br/>Sentence for one year—The Court ought to have exercised discretion in granting bail to the appellants in view of the short sentence of imprisonment.<br/><strong><em>Saimuddin Vs State 43 DLR (AD) 151</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498—</strong><br/>Bail in a case where the sentence is of short duration—In the present case the sentence is of two years and the disposal of the appeal in question normally takes time. In that circumstances the High Court Division ought to have exercised judicial discretion in the matter of granting bail to the appellants. The judicial discretion having not been properly exercised in the facts of the case the order is set aside and the appeal allowed.<br/><strong><em>Dhanu Mia Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 119.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498—</strong><br/>High Court Division in criminal revision cancelled the appellant’s bail when there was no new material before it and no allegation of tampering with the evidence. Co—accused against whom cognizance of a murder case has already been taken is already on bail. High Court Division did not exercise its judicial discretion properly in cancelling the appellant’s bail—Appellants to remain on bail already granted by Upazila Magistrate.<br/><strong><em>Bakul Howlader Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 14.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498—</strong><br/>Bail—Inctidnating facts disclosed in the FIR after due inquiry by the inspecting team are reasonable grounds for believing that the petitioner is guilty of criminal breach of trust. The Sessions Judge has rightly rejected the petition for bail.<br/><strong><em>Mustafizur Rahman Vs. State 45 DLR 227.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498—</strong><br/>Bail—When there is hardly chance of abscondance of the appellant in peculiar circumstances, the Court has found that he is entitled to bail—Appeal allowed. We need not consider the appellant’s contentions with regard to the order of conviction. In the peculiar circumstances of the case we think the appellant is entitled to bail particularly where there is hardly any chance of abscondance. The respondent found it difficult to oppose the appellant’s prayer.<br/><strong><em>SM Sajahan Ali Tara Vs. State 41 DLR (AD) 112.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498—</strong><br/>Anticipatory bail— Circumstances when such bail was granted by the High Court Division. The police went to the residence of the petitioner to arrest him on the basis of a case started upon a newspaper report. He was a candidate for the National Assembly election. His political rivals and enemies were bent upon defeating him by putting him in confinement through the help of the police. In such circumstances, the prayer for anticipatory bail was granted.<br/><strong><em>Zulfiqur Ali Bhutto Vs. State 43 DLR 312.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498—</strong><br/>Bail—there was a free fight between the parties; the accused are in jail for 9 months, the case has not been sent to proper court for trial as yet and both sides have case against each other on the self—same matter— Hence it will not be unreasonable to enlarge the petitioners on bail till the trial starts when the trial Court will see whether they should continue on the same ball.<br/><strong><em>Shahidullah Vs. State 42 DLR 394.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498—</strong><br/>Successive bail petition, propriety of—The Judges were not right in taking the view that once a petition for bail is rejected no further application can be made and the remedy lies only in an appeal. It is also not right to say than an application for bail could not be filed before the Vacation Judge and that he had no jurisdiction to grant interim bail (when he was himself a party to the rejection of bail for the same accused earlier by the Division Bench). At the most, it may be said that it was indiscreet on the part of the Vacation Judge to grant bail in the facts of the case.<br/>In the application for bail before the Vacation Bench, it was not mentioned that prayers for bail had been refused earlier. For this suppression of fact alone the ad interim bail could have been cancelled.<br/><strong><em>MA Wahab Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 223.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 498—</strong><br/>Bail matter—High Court Division admitted a criminal appeal but rejected the prayer for bail pending disposal of the appeal—Ad interim bail granted by the Appellate Division at leave stage for two months cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely—ad—interim bail extended for six months more and meanwhile parties are directed to make sincere efforts for disposal of the appeals—on expiry of the extended period, prayer for bail is to be moved before the High Court Division.<br/><strong><em>Azizul Hoq Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 284.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A—</strong><br/>Post-mortem report although excluded from consideration while dealing with the prosecution case due to its having been brought on record without compliance of the provision of section 509A, the defence could very well use and refer to any portion of the report for its own purpose and for assisting the Court in reaching its decision.<br/><strong><em>Tariq Habibullah Vs. State 43 DLR 440.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A—</strong><br/>Post-mortem report—For bringing such report in evidence strict compliance of section 509A of the Code is necessary.<br/>The report of the Post-mortem examination was neither produced by the doctor who had held the Post-mortem examination nor was the doctor examined as a witness in the trial. While producing the report PW 7, an investigating officer, had shown no cause explaining the circumstances under which the doctor could not be produced in court.<br/><strong><em>Tariq Habibullah Vs. State 43 DLR 440.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A—</strong><br/>Post-mortem report—The trial Court committed error of law in considering and relying upon the Post-mortem report when it was produced in court without fulfilling the requirements of section 509A.<br/><strong><em>Khelu Mia Vs. State 43 DLR 573.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A—</strong><br/>Report of Post-mortem examination—As the doctor concerned who held the Post-mortem examination was not examined although he was available in the country at the relevant time, the report was not legally admittex44rto evidence and as such the conviction based thereon is illegal.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Quddus Vs. State 44 DLR 441.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A—</strong><br/>Post-mortem report is admissible evidence when three requirements laid down in the section are satisfied.<br/><strong><em>Ezahar Sepai Vs. State 40 DLR 177.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A—</strong><br/>The Post-mortem report was not a substantive evidence before insertion of section 509A in the Code of Criminal Procedure by Ordinance No. 24 of 1982.<br/><strong><em>Ezahar Sepai Vs. State 40 DLR 177.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A—</strong><br/>Non—examination of the doctor was not fatal for the prosecution case. Conviction can be based on the evidence of a solitary witness if the testimony is not tainted with suspicion.<br/><strong><em>Ezahar Sepai Vs. State 40 DLR 177.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 509A—</strong><br/>Ext. 13, Post-mortem report of the deceased, has been admitted into evidence in utter violation of the mandatory provisions of section 509A. The doctor who held the Post-mortem on each of the dead bodies was not examined during the trial.<br/><strong><em>Md. Ali Haider Vs. The State 40 DLR 97.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 516A—</strong><br/>Section 51 6A empowers a criminal court to pass an order for custody and disposal of property dining any enquiry or trail and it does not empower an Investigating officer to give any property in the custody of any person.<br/><strong><em>Siddique Ahmed Sowdagar Vs.State 40 DLR 268.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 516A—</strong><br/>Where the offence is not committed regarding particular property the Court has no authority to pass order directing Sale of such property and deposit the sale price in courts account.<br/><strong><em>Shahabuddin Vs. Abdul Gani Bhuiyan 45 DLR 217</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section516A—</strong><br/>Custody— of property pending trial for theft and cheating— Jurisdiction of civil Court over such property—Order passed by the criminal court giving custody of a vessel, the subject—matter of the criminal case, to the local Upazila Chairman was subject to revision and the application under section 151 CPC made before the civil Court by the complainant  as the plaintiff in his suit for injunction is misconceived.<br/><strong><em>Mitali Shipping Lines Vs Bhuiyan Navigation Agency 44 DLR 230.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 517—</strong><br/>Disposal of seized goods— It is for the trial Court to consider all the relevant facts and hear all the necessary parties before making an order for disposal of goods under section 517 CrPC, if called upon.<br/><strong><em>Sompong Vs. State 45 DLR (AD) 110.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 517, 520 and 561A—</strong><br/>Stolen necklace—Whether the possession of the same should be restored to the petitioner who was acquitted bf charge of retention of stolen property due to incomplete evidence and also upon benefit of doubt—Stolen necklace cannot be restored to the petitioner under such circumstances.<br/><strong><em>Hajera Khatoon Vs. State 40 DLR 280.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 517(1)—</strong><br/>The Court has a very wide discretion as to the mode of disposal of the property produced before it or in its custody.<br/><strong><em>Sree Monaranjan Das. Vs. State 40 DLR 485.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 522—</strong><br/>Power to restore possession of immovable property—Provision of section 522 of the Code cannot be made applicable to the accused persons by filing a separate application to the trial Court after disposal of the appeal and revisional application arising out of the case against him under section 447 Penal Code.<br/><strong><em>Dr. Md. Abdul Baten Vs. State 43 DLR6O.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 522—</strong><br/>Restoration of possession of immovable property—The order of the Court restoring possession must be passed within one month from the date of conviction. The Magistrate having passed the order of restoration beyond 30 days of the order of conviction acted without jurisdiction. The provision of section 522 cannot be availed of if the dispossession is not by means of criminal force or show of force or criminal intimidation. In the instant case the accused petitioner wrongfully entered into the shop at 10—30 PM but at that time the complainant opposite party or his wife, who was the tenant, was not upon the scene. There was neither assault nor any resistance or use of jrina1 forte in the act of dispossession by the accused petitioner. The Magistrate’s order is bad on this count also.<br/><strong><em>Sheikh MA Jabbar Vs. AKM Obaidul Hug 43 DLR 233.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 523(1)—</strong><br/>The act of the Investigating Officer to give custody of the property on the basis of the practice in vogue in the Police Department without any support of the statutory provisions of law to that effect in violation of section 523 CrPC is without any lawful authority and is illegal.<br/><strong><em>Siddique Ahmed Sawdagar Vs. State 40 DLR 268.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 526—</strong><br/>Transfer of case—Plea of bias—The question of admissibility or non—admissibility of evidence should be left to be agitated when the case is argued. Merely because a Court acted illegally in allowing some evidence to go into the record or disallowing some evidence as irrelevant or took a wrong view of the law in passing an order would not by itself be a ground for bias. (Per Anwarul Huq Chowdhury)<br/>Per Habibur Rahman Khan J (agreeing):In the present case the order refusing to grant adjournment having been passed by the Special Tribunal not in violation any mandatory provisions of law but in exercise Of his discretionary power, could not itself give rise to a ground for transfer as no prejudice could be shown to have been caused to the accused.<br/><strong><em>Hussain Mohammad Ershad Vs. State 43 DLR 347.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 526B—</strong><br/>Counter cases, trial of—It is desirable that counter case be tried by the same judge simultaneously——by such trial the court will get opportunity for looking to all the aspects of both the cases which is necessary for arriving at a correct decision and to avoid conflicting findings.<br/><strong><em>Lutfar Rahman Vs. Mosammnat Aleya Begum 45 DLR 57.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 533—</strong><br/>Any irregularity in recording the confession is curable under section 533 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Ratan Kha Vs. State 40 DLR 186.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 533—</strong><br/>Credibility of confessional statement—No substantial compliance would .cure the defect of noncompliance with the provisions of section 164 CrPC on material points. Confessional statement in a plain paper without the narration of questions and answers would not, by itself, make it inadmissible in evidence. Certificate given by the Magistrate, who had recorded the confessional statement, as to what had happened, how he warned and gave time for reflection to the person confessing, how yet he insisted on making confession and his admitting the same to be correct and the Magistrate’s believing the same to be voluntary ought to be treated as conclusive evidence of facts stated unless shown to be otherwise.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Hakim Vs. State 43 DLR 389. </em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong><br/>When sanction for prosecuting a government servant is invalid, the trial Court would not be a court of competent jurisdiction and a defect in the jurisdiction of the court can never be cured under sections 5 &amp; 7 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Hakim Vs. State 45 DLR</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong><br/>The remand order amounts to double jeopardy for the petitioners and offers chance to the prosecution to remedy its lacuna. Such a remand should not be made.<br/><strong><em>Fazal Vs. State 43 DLR 40.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong><br/>Cognizance—Scheduled and non—scheduled offence—When the very taking of cognizance of an offence, the framing of accusation and the trial upon charges of both scheduled and non—scheduled offences together suffered from complete lack of jurisdiction, this could not at all be considered to be a mere defect in the framing of charges which by aid of section 537 of the CrPC can be cured if prejudice is not caused to the accused. A mere defect in framing of charge by the Court having jurisdiction is one thing while framing of charge without having any jurisdiction is a completely different thing.<br/><strong><em>Mozammel (Md) Huq Vs. State 43 DLR 614.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong><br/>Adoption of a procedure prohibited by Code of Criminal Procedure is not curable by section 537 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Lal Miah Vs. State 40 DLR 377</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong><br/>Defect in framing of charge when not curable—a mere defect in framing of charge by a court having jurisdiction is one thing while the framing of charge without having any jurisdiction is a completely different thing. The contention that section 537 of the Code could be invoked to cure defect due to lack of jurisdiction cannot be accepted. Joinder of scheduled and non-scheduled offences and the trial of both these offences were illegal.<br/><strong><em>Mozammel Hoq Vs.State 42 DLR 527.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong><br/>Examining prosecution witnesses as Court witnesses—Magistrate has power to summon material witness whose relevance is disclosed in evidence, but he cannot examine them as Court witness— Magistrate’s order has been modified accordingly.<br/><strong><em>Helaluddin &amp; others Vs. State 40 DLR 352.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong><br/>Scope of section 540 consists of two parts—the first part is discretionary and the second part is obligatory.<br/><strong><em>Md. Jalaluddin Ahmed Vs. State 40 DLR 564.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong><br/>It is obligatory for the Court to allow the examination of witness if he thinks it essential for the just decision of the case. The accused will not be prejudiced if the witness is examined in the Court.<br/><strong><em>Md. JaIaluddin Ahmed Vs. State 40 DLR 564.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong><br/>The ends of justice has been negatived by the trial Court by refusing to recall certain witnesses for cross— examination by the appellant.<br/>The trial Court is not meant for only convicting or acquitting the accused persons but their duty is to administer justice. In the present case before us by refusing to recall certain witnesses for cross—examination by the appellant the ends of justice have been negatived by the trial Court. In such circumstances for ends of justice we are inclined to set aside the order dated 1.11.88 passed by the learned Tribunal and direct him for affording opportunity to the appellant to cross—examine the witnesses already examined by the prosecution. This is very much necessary for ends of justice.<br/><strong><em>Jamil Siddique Vs. State 41 DLR 30.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong><br/>Court’s power to examine witness not named in the FIR—the scope of the provision in CrPC in this connection .pears to be wide. It gives discretion to the court to examine such witness at any stage. It is imperative for the Court to examine such a witness if his evidence appears to be essential for a just decision.<br/><strong><em>Akhtar Jahan Vs.

Syed Omar Ali 42 DLR (AD) 240.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>The accused cannot challenge the entire criminal proceeding at a stage when the case is ripe for trial following framing of charge. When he has taken a specific defence against the charge on the basis of a GD entry he has to establish the same. The charge under section 420 Penal Code is upheld.<br/><strong><em>Shafiuddin Khan Vs. State 45 DLR 102.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>Questions whether the occurrence was accidental and whether the petitioner had intention to commit mischief to the complainant needs evaluation of evidence to be led by the prosecution which cannot be stifled by exercising power for quashment. When allegations create both civil and criminal liabilities it is for the complainant to choose any or both of the forums for redress of grievance.<br/><strong><em>Tofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Vs. Mir Amanutlah 45 DLR 263.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>Stay of proceeding—In the facts of the case as in point of time the civil suit was instituted before the filing of the HR and the questioned documents in their originals are yet to be produced and examined by the civil Court. The criminal proceeding where the documents are claimed as forged, may, in the interest of justice, be stayed till the disposal of the civil suit.<br/><strong><em>Zakir Hossain and others Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 102.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>It has been asserted that the FIR itself was lodged by the complainant after receiving an order from the Home Ministry and not on his own. A prosecution cannot be quashed just because it was initiated at the instance of the Home Ministry.<br/>The question of possession can only be decided on evidence and not on submission on law as to what constitutes possession. The question whether the proceeding should be quashed or not should be decided on facts alleged in the FIR and charge—sheet. The accused’s general denial that the facts disclosed in the FIR are not true will not do. To succeed, the accused must show that the facts alleged by the prosecution do not constitute any offence or that the prosecution is otherwise barred by law.<br/><strong><em>Hussain Mohammad Ershad Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 50.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>Quashing of proceeding— Court will be loath to stifle a prosecution at the initial stage unless facts are such as would attract inference that even upon admitted facts no case can be made out and continuation of the proceeding would be an abuse of the process of the Court.<br/><strong><em>Al-Haj Md. Serajuddowlah Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 198.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>Quashing of proceedings—Whether the untrue statement of the accused regarding his imported goods on which he has been prosecuted under the Customs Act is intentional or unintentional, bonafide mistake or a case of absence of knowledge is for the trial Court to decide on the basis of evidence that would be adduced—if the pending proceeding is stopped at this stage it would amount to stifling the proceeding in limine.<br/><strong><em>Atiqur Rahman Vs. AKM Fazlul Hoque 43 DLR 49.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>Indictment proceeding against a detenu—Question of its legality or otherwise at the time when it was initiated and at a subsequent time—an order of detention would be deemed to be a warrant of arrest from the Court of Magistrate; if the detenu would violate the warrant he would be a fugitive from justice. His failure to comply with direction to surrender would immediately attract the mischief of prosecution and consequent punishment. The offence would be complete on failure to surrender, subject however, to the defence of impossibility of performance which is a matter of fact to be decided on evidence. Section 7 (I) (b) is a punitive provision to come into play immediately after the lapse of time for surrender. The contention that the detention orders being illegal the detenu had not rightly surrendered has little substance. It is not the order of detention but it’ is the fact of detention itself that matters. At the time it was initiated the proceeding was not prohibited by any law nor was it taken in violation of any law. It need not therefore be quashed at the present stage.<br/><strong><em>Anwar Hossain Monju Vs. State 43 DLR 447.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>Petition of complaint contains allegations under sections 295Af298/ 109 Penal Code out of which, to initiate and continue with the proceeding, compliance of the provision of section 196 CrPC in respect of offence under section 295A Penal Code is necessary but no compliance is necessary in respect of offences under sections 258/109 Penal Code. Interference by way of quashing the entire proceeding is not called for.<br/>Name of the petitioner finds mention in the petition of complaint but on a reading of the same his complicity with commission of offence could not be traced out. The proceeding as against him is liable to be quashed in terms of the principles enunciated in 28 DLR (AD) 38.<br/><strong><em>Jamir Sheikh Vs. Md. Fakir 43 DLR 417.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>Right of heirs of deceased complainant top with the complainant’s case—The complainant in the criminal case under section 447 claimed ownership and possession of the land in question. On his death during the pendency of the revision case arising out of the matter his wife having stepped into his shoes so far as it relates to his properties, she is required to be brought on record to protect her interest in the land.<br/><strong><em>Dr. Md. Abdul Baten Vs. State 43 DLR 60.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>Inherent power under this section though unlimited should be exercised only in 3 cases when no other alternative remedy is generally available under the Code to make such order as may be necessary to give effect to any order wider this Code or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.<br/>In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, any interference with the impugned order of the learned Magistrate at this belated stage will not serve any of the purposes of this section, rather such interference may cause undue harassment to the opposite party and defeat the ends of justice.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Satya Narayan Sarada 43 DLR 529.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>The decision in this case having depended on findings of facts as to whether the seized arms were recovered from the possession of the petitioner, whether the same came within the exception provided for and covered by amnesty, if any, declared by the Government. The extraordinary power to — prevent the abuse of the process of the Court is not required to be exercised.<br/><strong><em>Hossain Mohammad Ershad Vs. State 43 DLR 150.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>Allegation made in the— FIR having not disclosed any offence of extortion as defined, under section 383 Penal Code, the impugned proceeding against the accused for his punishment under section 387 Penal Code is quashed.<br/><strong><em>Abul Bashar Vs. State 44 DLR 391.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>Default in delivery of share certificate—Quashing of proceeding for such default—It is not the complainant’s case that his share certificates were not made — ready within time. Once the share certificates are completed and made ready within time, the liability of the accused person’s ends. The law does not provide that the certificates are to be made ready for delivery to the complainant. Non-delivery of the share certificates is not an offence and the proceeding is liable to be quashed.<br/><strong><em>Muhammadullah Vs. Makbul Ahmed 44 DLR 107.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>Writ Jurisdiction and inherent jurisdiction of the H1gh Court Division, applicability of—If there was any statutory provision of appeal and revision for setting aside the proceedings in question against the petitioner, then the question whether any equally efficacious adequate alternative remedy is available to him would act as a bar to move the High Court Division under the writ jurisdiction. Inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Division under section 561A CrPC cannot be said to be an alternative remedy to the Court’s writ jurisdiction.<br/><strong><em>Anisul Islam Mahmood Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 1.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>Inherent jurisdiction—it is not an alternative jurisdiction—Inherent jurisdiction for quashing of criminal proceedings should not be invoked where some other remedy is available. This is not an alternative jurisdiction nor an additional jurisdiction but it is a jurisdiction preserved in the interest of justice to redress grievances for which no other procedure is available or provided by the Code itself. This power cannot be so utilized as to interrupt or divert the ordinary course of criminal procedure.<br/><strong><em>MM Rahmatullah Vs. State 44 DLR 576.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 561A—</strong><br/>Quashing of criminal proceeding whether can be allowed under writ jurisdiction—Labour Court being a court subordinate to the High Court Division quashing of criminal case can appropriately be prayed before the criminal bench of the Court which is the efficacious remedy under the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><strong><em>SM Shaflul Azam and others Vs.

His failure to comply with direction to surrender would immediately attract the mischief of prosecution and consequent punishment. The offence would be complete on failure to surrender, subject however, to the defence of impossibility of performance which is a matter of fact to be decided on evidence. Section 7 (I) (b) is a punitive provision to come into play immediately after the lapse of time for surrender. The contention that the detention orders being illegal the detenu had not rightly surrendered has little substance.

The order of detention is not sustainable in law.<br/><strong><em>Mrs. Nabila Chowdhury Vs.

Hence the conviction of the condemned prisoner Badsha Mollah on the basis of alleged extra—judicial confession cannot be sustained in law.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Badshah Mollah 41 DLR 11.</em></strong><br/> <br/>—Mere absconding cannot always be a circumstance to lead to an inference of guilt of the accused.<br/>Mere abscondance cannot always be a circumstance which should lead to an inference of guilt of the accused. Sometimes out of fear and self—respect and to avoid unnecessary harassment even an innocent person remains absconding for some time.<br/><strong><em>State Vs.

Accused has been falsely implicated in this case out of grudge and enmity.<br/>In this case the condemned—prisoner Badsha remained absent or absconding for some time but subsequently he surrendered himself in court before the commencement of the trial. It appears this abscondance was not with any guilty mind. So, this circumstance cannot be treated as an incriminating one.<br/><strong><em>State Vs.

Ratio decedendi reported in AIR 1925 (All) 223. It is well—settled that the evidence that a witness gives in the witness box is the substantive evidence and it is always desirable that the witness should be able to identify the accused persons in dock when there was a previous TI Parade, but owing to lapse of time and other compelling reasons it may not be possible for the witness to identify the accused persons in dock.<br/>Failure of witnesses to identify accused persons who are strangers to the witnesses— Identification if made without naming them Court’s duty to shift evidence in that circumstance—Any statement, express or implied, made by a witness identifying the accuseds but without naming them, if qualifies as substantive evidence—Test of.<br/><strong><em>Ratan Kha Vs.

State 40 DLR 122.</em></strong><br/> <br/>—A newspaper is admissible in evidence without formal proof yet the paper ipso facto is not a proof of its contents.

X, which is the Daily Sangbad, which published the story of the commission of murder by the accused persons.<br/><strong><em>Nurul Islam Vs. State 40 DLR 122.</em></strong><br/> <br/>—There is no rule of law that once a witness has been discredited on one point, no credit it is to be given to another. If a natural witness is declared hostile, his evidence may be accepted if corroborated. The evidence of PW 2 cannot be discarded.<br/><strong><em>Md. Ali Haider Vs.

State 40 DLR 472.</em></strong><br/> <br/>—“Trail”—Whether it includes judgment—Trail as appearing in various sections of the CrPC had not been specifically defined but considering the scheme of the law, it is found to be  a “drama” in three successive acts i.e. investigation, inquiry and trial . Judgment is a separate scene where the judge is the only player writing down his judgment on the basis of the last scene of the drama already played. Thus, trial does not include judgment.<br/><strong><em>Hussain Mohammad Ershad Vs.

State 44 DLR (AD) 169.</em></strong><br/> <br/>—Joint Trial—Joint trial of appellant Sunil a child, along with the appellants being adults was illegal.<br/><strong><em>Kadu Vs. State 43 DLR 163.</em></strong><br/> <br/>—Motive—If the prosecution assigns a particular motive in proof of its case, then the motive has to be established by the prosecution, failing which the prosecution must suffer on that account, not the defence.<br/><strong><em>Khelu Mia Vs. State 43 DLR 573.</em></strong><br/> <br/>—The prosecution is not bound to prove motive of the accused for committing the crime, for motive is not an ingredient of the offence—the accused may be held guilty even without proof of his motive if the evidence connecting the accused with the crime is unimpeachable in character.<br/><strong><em>Shah Alam Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 31.</em></strong><br/> <br/>Double Jeopardy—<br/>The remand order amounts to a double jeopardy for the petitioners and offers a chance to the prosecution to remedy its lacuna. Such a remand should not be made.<br/><strong><em>Fazal Vs. State 43 DLR 40.</em></strong><br/> <br/>Alibi—<br/>Burden of proof—Burden of proving alibi in a wife—killing—It is true that the burden of proving a plea of alibi or any other plea specifically set up by an accused— husband for absolving him of criminal liability lies on him. But this burden is somewhat lighter than that of the prosecution. The accused could be considered to have discharged his burden if he succeeds in creating a reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances that would absolve him of criminal liability, but the prosecution is to discharge its burden by establishing the guilt of the accused. An accused’s burden is lighter, because the court is to consider his plea only after, and not before, the prosecution leads evidence for sustaining a conviction. When the prosecution failed to prove that the husband was in his house where his wife was murdered, he cannot be saddled with any onus to prove his innocence.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Mofazzal Hossain Pramanik 43 DLR (AD) 64.</em></strong><br/> <br/>Alibi—<br/>Magistrate cannot discharge accused persons on the plea of alibi that they were at different places at the time of commission of offences alleged by the prosecution—Magistrate’s “finding” in this regard is based on no evidence. Mere submission of some papers supporting alibi is neither sufficient nor admissible as the stage of adducing defence evidence was not yet come. Magistrate’s order of discharge was not sustainable as it was based on gross misconception of law.<br/><strong><em>Nannu Gazi Vs. Awlad Hossain 43 DLR (AD) 63.</em></strong><br/> <br/>Last Seen—<br/>This is a case in which a minor boy, the victim of murder, was called away by and seen in the company of the two young accused for the last time before disappearance and then some time thereafter the body of the victim was found out. The fact of calling away of victim Khairul by accused Khasru was satisfactorily established as the first circumstance in support of the prosecution and witnesses have also satisfactorily proved that the victim travelled with the two accused from their village Noapara to a distant place called Takerhat by bus and got down there at 4.00/4.30 PM on 4.1.79. This is the second circumstance proved against the accused. From this point onward up to the time of recovery of the body of Khairul at about 3.00/3.30 PM on the following day the accused were alleged to have been seen along with the deceased, the third circumstance in the absence of ocular evidence of murder, by PWs 11 and 12. The High Court Division rejected their evidence due to apparent contradiction between their evidence and the statement made by them before the police and also for the reason that their identification of the accused in the TI Parade had lost all significance in view of the fact that they had chance to see the accused. There has been no violation of any norm or procedure in assessing the evidence of the said two witnesses for which the finding of fact made by the High Court Division could be disturbed. The position, therefore, comes to this that the third circumstance, that of seeing the three boys together near the bank of the river where the victim’s body was found was not satisfactorily established. The circumstances of the case can never be said to be conclusive as to the guilt of accused Khasru and his brother Nowab. The High Court Division has correctly applied the rule as to circumstantial evidence in the facts of the present case.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Khasru @ Syed Mostafa Hossain 43 DLR (AD) 182.</em></strong><br/> <br/>—Defence plea, when not acceptable— Plea of inadvertence, liable to be rejected if not taken during the trial but argued subsequently.<br/>Accused Fishery Officer did not take the plea of inadvertence during his trial on the charge of manipulation of lease deed which was argued on his behalf —subsequently—no suggestion was made to any of the witnesses that on the date of executing the lease deed on government’s behalf, he was very busy as many other lease deeds were executed by him and by inadvertence, he executed the lease deed in question by putting his signature thereon—During examination under the section 342 CrPC all the incriminating facts in evidence were put to him in details by the court, but he did not take the plea and just pleaded not guilty—plea of—inadvertence due to pressure of work rightly rejected.<br/><strong><em>Atiqur Rahman Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 176.</em></strong><br/> <br/>—In case of direct evidence the question of motive is not of much importance.<br/><strong><em>Shah Alam Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 31.</em></strong><br/> <br/>—There cannot be any bar for a person to witness an occurrence and give evidence merely because the accused has brought the case against that person—His evidence is to be tested, scrutinized and assessed along with all other evidence and circumstances.<br/><strong><em>Shah Alam Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 31.</em></strong><br/> <br/>—Inference from the facts of the case— The two expressions “common intention” and “similar intention” are not coterminous or co—extensive in range—Each case is to be considered in its own background.<br/><strong><em>Chand Mia Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 3.</em></strong><br/> <br/>—Circumstantial evidence and extra— judicial confession not corroborated by any reliable evidence.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Badshah Mollah 41 DLR 11.</em></strong><br/> <br/> —Circumstantial evidence—Chains of circumstantial evidence missing—Facts proved must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused.<br/>In respect of charge of abduction with murder, even if the chains of circumstances are broken and a strong and dominant inference takes the place of evidence, such substitute by inference may often fill up the gap provided the inference stands on a very high degree excluding all other hypothesis save and except the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.<br/><strong><em>Soleman Vs.

The fact of calling away of victim Khairul by accused Khasru was satisfactorily established as the first circumstance in support of the prosecution and witnesses have also satisfactorily proved that the victim travelled with the two accused from their village Noapara to a distant place called Takerhat by bus and got down there at 4—00/4—30 PM oh 4.1.79. This is the second circumstance proved against the accused. From this point onward up to the time of recovery of the body of Khairul at about 3—00/3—30 PM on the following day the accused were alleged to have been seen along with the deceased, the third circumstance in the absence of ocular evidence of murder, by PWs 11 and 12. The High Court Division rejected their evidence due to apparent contradiction between their evidence and the statement made by them before the police and also for the reason that their identification of the accused in the TI Parade had lost all significance in view of the fact that they had chance to see the accused. There has been no violation of any norm or procedure in assessing the evidence of the said two witnesses for which the finding of fact made by the High Court Division could be disturbed. The position, therefore, tomes to this that the third circumstance, that of, seeing the three boys together near the bank of the river where the victim’s body was found was not satisfactorily established. The circumstances of the case can never be said to be conclusive as to the guilt of accused Khasru and his brother Nowab.

This part of his character and conduct is relevant to be considered as to who is capable of doing what. The husband of the victim girl had complete dominion and control over the wife. This fact of having an unfettered opportunity in causing an occurrence by the accused only, would also be a corroborative and relevant fact under the law (Ref: AIR 1977 (SC) 1116) and also the fact that after the commission of the alleged crime, the accused had absconded without any explanation or reasonable cause (Ref 126 IC 689, 62 IC 545) All these are relevant corroborative facts leading to the inference of guilt of the accused. 172 IC 374 and 39 CrLJ 129 relied.<br/><strong><em>State Vs.

It has long been a rule of practice for insisting on corroboration of the statement of the prosecutrix.

Secondly, a fact already known to the police cannot be re—discovered on the statement of an accused so as to make the accused’s conduct of pointing out a place admissible in evidence. Thirdly, when a discovery is made in consequence of information received from more than one person, but it cannot be determined who first made the crucial statement, it is no discovery and the joint information or joint production is not admissible against any one.

It may not be an evidence within the strict meaning of the term, but it lends assurance to other evidence on record.<br/><strong><em>State Vs.

Appreciation of oral evidence—so called confession by a co—accused (appellant Daud) relied upon by the trial Court—that confession is no confession in the eye of law as it was a testimony against the other accused without the maker having involved himself.<br/><strong><em>Ibrahim Mollah Vs.

After all these infirmities on the side of the prosecution the trial court and the High Court Division should have entertained reasonable doubt as to the alleged participation of the appellants in the throwing of bombs.<br/><strong><em>Ibrahim Mollah Vs.

Inculpatory part of the confession can also be used against the other accused.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Kashem Vs.

Though there is no compulsion that a confession need be materially corroborated 1 yet it is prudent that a court should look for it. We are t examine the confessional — statement in the light of the circumstances 1 under which it is made and the other evidence on record corroborating the chain of circumstances as narrated by the accused before the Magistrate. In his confessional statement and this corroborating need not always be in material particular as even a general corroboration or corroboration by medical evidence would be considered to be enough.<br/><strong><em>Abdur Rahman Syed Vs. State 44 DLR 556</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 30—</strong><br/>Confession—When not voluntary and true—The condemned prisoner was in police custody for 2 days with no explanation. This coupled with allegation of police torture shows the confession to be not voluntary, Confession containing exculpatory materials outweigh the inculpatory materials and then the statements having not been corroborated, the confession cannot be said td’ be true as well.<br/><strong><em>Farid Karim Vs. State 45 DLR 171.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 30—</strong><br/>In a joint trial of several persons the court may take into consideration confessional statement of an accused against himself and other accused.<br/><strong><em>Md.

State 41 DLR 62</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 30—</strong><br/>The extra—judicial confession made in Police Station in presence of constables who had arrested the confessing accused and the police officer who had investigated the case is inadmissible in evidence.<br/><strong><em>Mofazzal Hossain Mollah &amp; ors. Vs.

The alleged extra—judicial confession if at all made by the said accused also appears to be wholly untrue. So, in the whole analysis of the facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence on record and the alleged extra—judicial confession of the condemned— prisoner, we find that there is no reliable evidence of corroboration of the so—called alleged extra—judicial confession and it is not at all safe to rely and act upon such extra—judicial confession and convict the accused on that basis. Hence the conviction of the condemned prisoner Badsha Mollah on the basis of alleged extra—judicial confession cannot be sustained in law.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Badshah Mollah 41 DLR 11.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 30—</strong><br/>Mere absconding cannot always be a circumstance to lead to an inference of guilt of the accused. Mere abscondance cannot always be circumstance which should lead to an inference of guilt of the accused. Sometimes out of fear and self—respect and to avoid unnecessary harassment even an innocent person remains absconding for some time.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Badshah Mollah41 DLR11.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 30—</strong><br/>Abscondance was not with any guilty mind. Existence of enmity is not disputed. Accused has been falsely implicated in this case out of grudge and enmity.<br/><strong><em>State Vs.Badshah Mollah 4l DLR 11.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 30—</strong><br/>In this case the condemned— prisoner Badsha remained absent or absconding for some time but subsequently he surrendered himself in court before the commencement of the trial. It appears, this abscondance was not with any guilty mind. So, this circumstance cannot be treated as a discriminating one.<br/><strong><em>State Vs.

State 45 DLR 142.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong><br/>There appears some vagueness in the alleged verbal dying declaration and that is why before relying upon such dying declaration it is the rule of prudence that necessitates the corroboration of the same by reliable evidence.<br/><strong><em>Gadu MiahVs. State 44 DLR 246.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong><br/>Expectation of imminent death is not a requirement for treating the declaration as a dying declaration. What is relevant is whether the declaration is voluntary or under pressure from any outside quarter. Conviction can be based on such declaration.<br/><strong><em>Nurjahan Begum Vs. State 40 DLR 321.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong><br/>Dying declaration—If it stands the normal test for judging its veracity it becomes a wholly reliable piece of evidence, but if it does not, it is far ‘worse than an ordinary statement of a witness. The value of dying declaration depends in a case on its own facts and the circumstances in which it is made.<br/>If a dying declaration is found to be false in material particulars it must re—act on its genuineness as a whole because in the case of dying declaration the veracity of the contents is presumed on the basis that it happens to be the words of a dying man, who on normal human behavior would not at the close of his life like to tell a lie. Therefore, if a single matter is introduced in the dying statement which has a bearing on the result of the case and is found to be false, it will hit the whole dying declaration. It cannot then be said that it is the statement of a truthful person who has made the statement in realisation of his obligations to adhere to the truth while he is quitting his worldly existence to join his Creator, to whom he is answerable for his deeds.<br/><strong><em>Babu Vs. State 45 DLR 7.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong><br/>Hearsay evidence—The witness stated that he had heard from the deceased that the accused hired his van and were taking him to Jessore This part of the evidence, though hearsay, is admissible in evidence being circumstances of the transaction resulting in the death of the deceased.<br/><strong><em>Abul Kashem Vs. State 42 DLR 378.  </em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong><br/>Dying declaration—Conditions to act upon such declaration—The court is to see whether the victim had the physical capability of making such a declaration, whether witnesses who had heard the deceased making such statement heard it correctly, whether they reproduced names of assailants correctly and whether the maker of the declaration had an opportunity to recognize the assailants.<br/><strong><em>Hafizuddin Vs. State 42 DLR</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong><br/>Dying declaration—A dying man incapable of making any statement may by some gesture, sign or symbol express something which may be interpreted as his statements admissible under the law. But it is to be seen whether his expressions intrinsically ring tree or not.<br/>Dying declaration may be judged from several standpoints, whether the victim had physical capacity to recognize the assailant or whether he had the opportunity to recognize the assailant or whether there is any chance of mistake as to the identity of the assailant or whether it was free from outside prompting and lastly, if the evidence could be relied upon under the given facts and circumstances of the case.<br/><strong><em>A Alim Vs State 45 DLR 43</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32(1)—</strong><br/>Dying declaration—Its probative value (by majonty) A dying declaration although a piece of substantive evidence has always been viewed with some degree of caution as the matter is not liable to cross—examination It stands on the same footing as any other piece of evidence and has to be judged in the light of surrounding circumstances and common human experience. When there is a record of such statement of the deceased the court has to satisfy itself, in the first place, as to the genuineness of the same keeping in view all the evidence and circumstances in which the statement of the deceased was said to have been recorded. The alleged dying declaration, the only piece of evidence against the appellant, having not been free from reasonable doubt, the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt.<br/><strong><em>Sk Shamsur Rahman Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 200.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32(1)—</strong><br/>Dying declaration— Statement of a person about the cause of his death or circumstances leading to his death is substantive evidence under section 32(1) of the Evidence Act—If found reliable, it may by itself be basis for conviction even without corroboration.<br/>Statement falling under section 32(1) of the Evidence Act is called a “dying declaration” in ordinary parlance—A dying declaration may be recorded by any person who is available and it may be written or it may be verbal or it may be indicated by signs and gestures in answer to questions even—There is no requirement of law that a dying declaration should be recorded by a Magistrate as in the case of the confessional Statement of an accused under section 164(3) CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Nurjahan Begum Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 130.</em></strong><br/><br/><strong>Section 32(1)—</strong><br/>Legislature in its wisdom has put a dying declaration at par with evidence on oath for the simple reason that a man under the apprehension of death is not likely to speak falsehood and involve innocent persons in preference to his assailant. When a Probationer Officer actually recorded the statement in presence of, and under the observation of the Superior Officer (PW 9), there was hardly any wrong in his Evidence that he recorded it in presence of the witnesses.<br/><strong><em>Nurjahan Begum Vs.

State 43 DLR 336.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 33—</strong><br/>Evidence of the recording Magistrate was not placed before the trial Court under section 33 of the Evidence Act—Hence this cannot be used as evidence.<br/> But that statement of the Magistrate recorded in the earlier case cannot be taken into consideration in this case as it was not recorded in the presence of accused appellant and also because he did not have the opportunity to cross—examine the said Magistrate. This appellant was then a witness. So the evidence of the recording Magistrate cannot be considered in this case and the confessional statement cannot also be used against the appellant.<br/><strong><em>Angur Vs.

In respect of a confession the court is required to see not only that the forms under sections 164 and 364 CrPC were complied with but the substance underneath the law was equally adhered to—There must not be any reason for doubt as to the truth of the statements, be it circumstantial or proved otherwise. In this particular case it is difficult’ to deny accused appellants an opportunity to cross—examine the Magistrate who allegedly recorded their statements.<br/><strong><em>Babul Vs.

But this burden is somewhat lighter than that of the prosecution. The accused could be considered to have discharged his burden if he succeeds in creating a reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances that would absolve him of criminal liability, but the prosecution is to discharge its burden by establishing the guilt of the accused. An accused’s burden is lighter, because the court is to consider his plea only after, and not before, the prosecution leads evidence for sustaining a conviction. When the prosecution failed to prove that the husband was in his house where his wife was murdered, he cannot be saddled with any onus to prove his innocence.<br/><strong><em>State Vs.

The point canvassed on behalf of the accused in support of his application under section 561A CrPC Was that the liability, if any, was of a civil nature for which no prosecution would lie.

As the prosecution has not yet closed the case and as some of the witnesses have been examined in the absence of the appellant when he was produced before the Tribunal under arrest subsequently during the midst of trial the tribunal ought to have afforded an opportunity to the appellant to cross—examine the witnesses already examined.

If on settlement of accounts at the end of a period some money falls due to one party from the other party and the other party fails to pay the dues, such liability cannot be termed criminal liability.

Serajul Hoque Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 52.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 409 read with Prevention of Corruption Act (II of 1947) Section 5(2).</strong><br/>Sentence of imprisonment till rising of the Court—whether it is an imprisonment—An important question arose to be answered in this case. It is whether a sentence of imprisonment till rising of the Court can be said to be a sentence of imprisonment within the meaning of section 409 of the Penal Code as well as under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (Act II of 1947). Detention till rising of the Court is imprisonment. In the light of the aforesaid dictionary meaning and judicial pronouncements I have no hesitation to hold that the detention of the accused—appellant till the rising of the Court is imprisonment within the meaning f Section 09 of the Penal Code and section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (Act II of 1947) as his liberty freely to go about his business as at other times was restrained by order of the Court as he was confined in the Court precincts.<br/><strong>Jalaluddin Ahmed Chowdhury Vs.

The contention of the petitioner to the effect that it was a civil dispute and that the Court of Settlement had given a final decision over all the disputes including the question of criminal liability is not sustainable. The criminal proceeding cannot be held to be liable to be quashed.<br/><strong>Aga Kohinoor Alam Vs.

State 40 DLR 545.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 420—</strong><br/>It is not correct to say that in a case of cheating there Is no necessity to prove initial intention to deceive and that subsequent conduct of the accused is enough to find him guilty.<br/><strong>Abdul Karim Vs.

State 45 DLR 102.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 436 and 148—</strong><br/>Mere plea of right of private defence cannot be a ground for quashing the criminal proceeding, for such plea is to be established by the accused who takes it. A criminal proceeding is liable to be quashed only if the facts alleged, in the First Information Report or complaint petition, even if admitted, do not constitute any criminal offence or the proceeding is barred by any provision of law.<br/>Where disputed facts are involved, evidence will be necessary to determine the issue. The appellants have produced an order of temporary injunction against the complainant’s party .This must be considered along with other evidence during the trial. Their application for quashing the proceedings is found to have been rightly refused by the High Court Division.<br/><strong>SM Khalilur Rahman Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 62.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 463 and 464—</strong><br/>The circumstances, provisions of law and evidence on record show that the prosecution has failed to prove by evidence that the accused petitioners had committed the alleged offence:<br/>Forged document—When a document can be called forged—To call it forged a document must be executed with dishonest and fraudulent intention to defraud others—Such a finding is absent in lower Court judgments.<br/>The prosecution could not prove the elements of a forged document in the present case and as such the provisions of section 467 of the Penal Code cannot be invoked against the accused petitioners.<br/><strong>Manu Mia &amp; Sayedur Rahman Vs. State 42 DLR 191.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 463 and 467—</strong><br/>Applicability, of section 179 CrPC to the offences defined section 463 Penal Code—Provisions section 463 PC analysed—Two essential ingredients of section 463 PC pointed out—] both the competent criminal Courts at Noakhali and Comilla have jurisdiction to t the offence.<br/><strong>Sree Jagenath Chandra Bakshi Vs State 42 DLR 238</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 463 and 467—</strong><br/>When the bainapatra in question was given in evidence in Court no court can, take cognizance of any offence under section 467 of the Penal Code without a complaint in writing by the court concerned or by a court to which the said court is subordinate.<br/><strong>Sona Miah Vs.

State 45 DLR 35.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 467—</strong><br/>Accuseds claiming title on the basis of registered document which they assert to be genuine—In such a criminal proceeding they will not get reasonable opportunity to prove genuineness of their title deed which they will get in a civil proceeding—Section 467 Penal Code is not attracted to the case.<br/><strong>Monu Mia &amp; Sayedur Rahman Vs. State 42 DLR 191.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 467—</strong><br/>Making a false document— The maker must dishonestly execute the document with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document was executed by or by the authority of a person by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not executed.<br/><strong>Al-haj Md.

State 43 DLR 230.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 499—</strong><br/>Defamation defined in section 499 Penal Code. In our codified law the expression “defamation” has been defined in section 499 of the Penal Code. The exceptions are ten in number. English law of absolute privilege, whether applicable to the statements made by the parties or by the Advocates in Court proceedings in Bangladesh—Immunity having been not extended to judicial proceeding a respondent allegedly defamed would be competent to file a complaint in Court against the maker of defamatory statement—Court not to rely on Common Law of England.<br/><strong>AY Marshiuzzaman Vs.

The term Public Servants’ denotes some executive control over them and they are subject to disciplinary rules which are applicable to regular government servants. In view of these differences in respect of functions and duties, the Legislature thought it proper and expedient to treat them as a separate class of people’s representatives and has provided for the addition4 disqualification in question.<br/><strong><em>Sheikh Abdus Sabur Vs.

State 42 DLR (AD) 3.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 34—</strong><br/>In order to make an accuse constructively liable with the help of 34 for an offence not actually committed by him, it is essential to prove that he had intention to commit the offence. Unless such intention is proved, he cannot be made liable under that section.<br/><strong>Belal Ahmed Vs. State 40 DLR 154.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 34—</strong><br/>Mere standing of accused Belal at the door of Parvin will not constitute offence under section 34 read with section 324 Penal Code in causing voluntary hurt by dangerous weapon.<br/><strong>Belal Ahmed Vs. State 40 DLR 154.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 34—</strong><br/>Principle of vicarious liability, applicability of—Test as to the applicability of that principle—Common intention implies a pre—arranged plan and it must be proved that a criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the pre—arranged plan.<br/><strong>Kabul Vs.

Common intention within the meaning of section 34 of the Penal Code pre—supposes prior concert; it also requires pre—arranged plan and care must be taken not to confuse same or similar intention with common intention, the partition which divides “their bounds” is often very thin; nevertheless the distinction is real and substantial and if overlooked will result in miscarriage of justice.<br/><strong>Kabul Vs. State 40 DLR 216.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 34—</strong><br/>Mere proof of each of the participating culprits having same Intention to commit certain act is not sufficient to constitute common Intention.<br/><strong>Kabul Vs.

State 4O DLR 216.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 34—</strong><br/>Common intention—Nature of injuries caused by different accused—The fact that some of the accused had caused fatal injuries and others caused minor injuries is immaterial if the act was done in furtherance of their common intention. The nature of injuries has nothing to do as the two accused are found to have shared the intention of other accused whose acts resulted in the death of the victim.<br/><strong>State Vs. Montu 44 DLR (AD) 287.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 34—</strong><br/>Common intention—Pre—plan not essential ingredient—It is true in this case there was no pre—plan of the accused to kill the victim—their common intention to kill developed on the spot when they all simultaneously fell upon the victim as soon as he appeared on the scene.<br/><strong>State Vs. Montu 44 DLR (AD) 287.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 34—</strong><br/>Common Intention —Unless the Court Is told what the exact words were used by the accused person it cannot act on the inference supplied by the witnesses—There is no evidence on record that the appellant Nos. 2—4 had an intention to cause the death of Nandalal.<br/><strong>Amar Kumar Thakur Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 147.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 34—</strong><br/>Omission of charge as to common intention—Non—mentioning of section 34, Penal Code during his examination under section 342 CrPC has not in any manner prejudiced the accused in their defence. It is a mere irregularity which is curable and there has been no failure of justice for such non-mentioning.<br/><strong>Abul Kashem Vs. State 42 DLR 378.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 34—</strong><br/>Common intention—Each person may have same intention to kill yet there might not be a prior meeting of minds to form a pre—arranged plan—Individual liability as opposed to joint liability.<br/><strong>Kabul Vs. State 40 DLR 216.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 34—</strong><br/>No evidence of a pre—concert or meeting of minds to cause the death of the deceased—Assault in furtherance of common intention is difficult to prove.<br/><strong>Kabul Vs. State 40 DLR 216.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 34 &amp; 37—</strong><br/>Rule of joint responsibility for criminal act —In order to attract section 34 it is not necessary that any overt act must be done by the particular accused. The provision shall be applicable if it is established that the criminal act has been done by any one of the accused persons in furtherance of the intention of all. Mere distance from the scene of crime cannot exclude culpability. Criminal sharing, overt or covert, by active presence or by distant direction, making out a certain measure of jointness in the commission of the act is the essence of section 34.<br/><strong>State Vs. Abul Khair 44 DLR284.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 34 and 109—</strong><br/>The conviction of appellant Nos. 2—4 upon the evidence on record for the offence of murder with the application of section 34 or 109 Penal Code is not sustainable in law.<br/><strong>Amar Kumar Thakur Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 147.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 34 &amp; 149—</strong><br/>Constructive criminality—Section 149, like section 34, does not create and punish any substantive offence. These sections may be added to the charge of any substantive offence. Without the charge for any substantive offence, no charge under either of them can be conceived of.<br/><strong>Abdus Samad Vs. State 44 DLR (AD) 233.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 34 &amp; 149—</strong><br/>Common intention and common object—Section 34 provides that when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of their common intention each of them is liable for that act in the same manner as if it was done by him alone. Section 149 postulates an unlawful assembly and commission of an offence by any of its members in prosecution of the common object of such an assembly.<br/><strong>Abdus Samad Vs. State 44 DLR (AD) 233.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 34 &amp; 149—</strong><br/>Scope of the two sections—Both sections deal with combination of persons to become punishable as sharers in an offence. Basis of a case under section 34 is the element of participation, and that of one under section 149 is membership of an unlawful assembly. The scope of the latter is wider than that of the former.<br/><strong>Abdus Samad Vs. State 44 DLR (AD) 233.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 34 &amp; 149—</strong><br/>these sections do not confer punishment for any substantive offence. They are intended to deal with liability for constructive criminality. Section 34 applies where criminal act is done by two or more persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, whereas section 149 applies in the case of a member involved in unlawful assembly for a common object. So there is difference between the two sections as there is a difference between object and intention.<br/><strong>Ataur Rahman Vs. State 43 DLR 87.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 94—</strong><br/>Even order of the superior authority, in the absence of threat of instant death, was not sufficient to justify the irregular payment for which the accused was prosecuted.<br/><strong>AMA Wajedul Islam Vs. State 45 DLR 243.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 109—</strong><br/>Abetment of offence—Mere presence of the accused near the place of occurrence does not constitute the offence of abetment. Intentional aiding and active complicity is the gist of the offence in the absence of which the charge of abetment must fail.<br/><strong>Mostain Moliah Vs. State 44 DLR 295.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 109—</strong><br/>Common intention having been not proved against Belal, it is difficult to hold good the charge of abetment upon him.<br/><strong>Belal Ahmed Vs. State 40 DLR 154.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 109—</strong><br/>Non-consideration of a vital element of law while convicting accused has caused serious prejudice resulting in failure of justice to the accused.<br/><strong>Belal Ahmed Vs. State 40 DLR 154.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 147—</strong><br/>The Sessions Judge found the appellants guilty of charge under section 147 PC and granted interim bail pending filing of appeal. The learned Judge by the impugned order summarily rejected the appeal petition on the ground that the appellants did not surrender before moving their petition of appeal and they being “fugitive from Law cannot get its protection.” Leave was granted to consider whether the impugned order was a just and proper order.<br/><strong>Saidur Rahman Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 281.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 148 &amp; 149—</strong><br/>Error in recording conviction—the charge framed and findings of the Court show the accused to be guilty of rioting punishable under section 148. But the trial Court erroneously recorded conviction under section 149, although this section 149 does not independently punish any offence. The High Court Division attempted to correct it, but unnecessarily added section 149 to section 148. This is a mere irregularity which does not touch the merit of the case as the charge specifically said they were members of an unlawful assembly. The order of conviction needs be modified so as to record the conviction under section 148.<br/><strong>Abdus Samad Vs. State 44 DLR (AD) 233.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 148, 302/149 and 302/34—</strong><br/> Accused charged under section 149 Penal Code but convicted under section 302—On the question whether such conviction is sustainable in law, Court held: Conviction under sections 302/34 Penal Code is sustainable in law.<br/><strong>Md. Hossain Vs. State 41 DLR 373.</strong><br/> <br/>—Alteration of charge from section 302 to that of sections 302/34 Penal Code is permissible in the facts and circumstances of the case.<br/><strong>Md. Hossain Vs. State 41 DLR 373.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 148 and 324—</strong><br/>Members of unlawful assembly—Rioting committed in prosecution of their common object—Accused Tayeb Ali assaulted PW 1—Conviction of both the accuseds under section 148 PC and Tayeb MP conviction under section 324 BPC based on good evidence—But their conviction under sections 302/149 not sustainable as their —participation in assault upon deceased Bazlur Rabman doubtful.<br/><strong>Tayeb Ali Vs. State 41 DLR (AD) 147.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 149—</strong><br/>Member of an unlawful assembly—Whether he can be convicted when the principal offender has not been convicted —Once the court finds that an offence has been committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of its common object, then whether the principal offender has been convicted or not all other members may be constructively liable for conviction.<br/><strong>Abdus Samad Vs. State 44 DLR (AD) 233.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 149—</strong><br/>Applicability of the provision under section 149—Even after acquittal of the five accused there could be an unlawful assembly if there was evidence that besides the accused on trial there were others even though not stated as such in the charge or in the FIR.<br/><strong>Rafiqul Islam Vs. State 44 DLR (AD) 264.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 149—</strong><br/>Offence committed in prosecution of common object—Section 149 Penal Code by itself creates no offence; It carries the liability of each member of an unlawful assembly for the act done in prosecution of their common object.<br/><strong>Tenu  Miah and others Vs. State 43 DLR 633.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 149—</strong><br/>Constructive liability—T occurrence appears to have taken — sudden quarrel and in a fit of rage deadly appear to have suppressed material facts. In such a situation charge under section 149 is not maintainable. Mere presence of the accused at the scene of the occurrence of murder is not sufficient to charge him with1 constructive liability.<br/><strong>State Vs. Giasuddin 45, DLR 267.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161—</strong><br/>Illegal gratification—Trap case—Because of the tough requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt the laying of trap is the only method for detecting crimes like bribery which are committed in covert manner. Such a method is not prohibited. For laying a trap the Investigating Officer cannot be said to be thereby ‘instigating commission: of the offence. Principles of accomplice evidence cannot be extended to the evidence of trap witness, because the latter cannot be termed as accomplice. As to corroboration of trap witnesses no hard and fast rule can be given. There may be cases where the Court will look for independent corroboration— equally there may be cases where the Cowl may accept evidence of trap witnesses.<br/><strong>Shahabullah Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 1.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161—</strong><br/>There is no authority for the proposition that making demand for illegal gratification is an essential ingredient of the offence under section 161 Penal Code. In order to prove this offence it is the duty of the prosecution to prove that there was conscious acceptance of the bribery money by the accused.<br/><strong>AKM Mukhlesur Rahrnan Vs. State 45 DLR 626.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161—</strong><br/>When factum of recovery has not been proved by independent and disinterested witnesses, it would be unsafe to find the guilt of the accused under section 161 Penal Code.<br/><strong>AKM Mukhlesur Rahman Vs. State 45 DLR 626.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 161—</strong><br/>The act for which the illegal gratification is to be paid or received was already over before the commission of the alleged offence and in such circumstances it will be most unsafe to hold a person guilty.<br/><strong>AKM Mukhlesur RahmaA Vs. State 45 DLR 626.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 175—</strong><br/>Documents required to be filed on 27.4.1986 have been filed long after that date by which time cognizance of the alleged offence has been taken on 28.8.1986.<br/>Held—Prima facie offence has already been committed by the petitioner.<br/><strong>Abdu Sattar Bhuiya. Vs. Deputy Commissioner Dhaka 42 DLR 151.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 193 and 228—</strong><br/>The Tribunal shall have the same powers as vested in a civil Court for the purpose of inquiry and every enquiry as such shall be deemed o be judicial proceeding within the meaning of s1ions 193 and 228 of the Penal Code—A Tribunal shall be deemed to be a Civil Coil for. Purposes of sections 480 and.482 CrPC. The proceeding before tribunal is of a civil nature and as such there appears to be no bar to effect a compromise between the parties in a proceeding before the Tribunal. Fees paid to a lawyer for professional services is not a loan—The complainant was not entitled to receive back from the appellant any single farthing—The amount of Tk. 10,000.00 received from the appellant is not as a refund of money paid but as a compromise sum. Tribunal’s manner of acceptance of the case on a matter in which amicable settlement was reached between the parties out of their free will and without prejudice to any one disapproved.<br/><strong>Muhammad Raushan Ali Vs. Bangladesh Bar Council 42 DLR 201.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 201—</strong><br/>Accused’s statement the part of which is incriminating does not connect him with the act of killing. In the statement of accused Yasin Majhee which was recorded in Bengali it appears that he accompanied the murderers up to the house of Yasin Mridha where the dead body was brought. This part of the statement may be incriminating if at all in respect of the offence of concealment of the dead body, but it does not connect him with the act of killing.<br/><strong>State Vs. Abdur Rashid Piada 40 DLR (AD) 106.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 201—</strong><br/>The statement of the accused Joynal to the Chairman is of the same nature and as such is not a confessional statement As to the extra—judicial confession orally made by accused Joynal to PW 2, Chairman, this is also of the same nature as the statement recorded by the Magistrate; he did not implicate himself in the murder, and as such it is not a confessional statement implicating himself and other accused In the murder.<br/><strong>State Vs. Abdur Rashid 40 DLR (AD) 106.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 201—</strong><br/>Disappearance of evidence—there was no witness saying that the accused participated in concealment and burial of the dead body, nor the eye—witnesses disclosed that the accused assaulted the victim. In such circumstances mere pointing out the place where the dead body was concealed would not constitute the offence of causing disappearance of evidence.<br/><strong>Gopal Rajgor Vs. State 42 DLR 446.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 290—</strong><br/>Offence under section 290 of the Penal Code being a non-cognizable one, the proceeding initiated on police report without the permission of the Magistrate as required under section 155(2) CrPC is illegal.<br/><strong>Aroj Ali Sarder Vs. Stare 41 DLR 306.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Sections 298, 300, 302 and 304—</strong><br/> Ingredients of murder and culpable homicide stated to elaborate the point. It has been held in the decision reported in 1987 BLD (AD) 165 that “all murders are culpable homicide but all culpable homicides are not murder.” Excepting the General Exceptions attached to the definition of murder an act committed either with certain guilty intention or with certain guilty knowledge constitutes culpable homicide amounting to murder. If the criminal act is done with the intention for causing death then it is murder clear and simple. In all other cases of culpable homicide it is the degree of probability of death from certain injuries which determines whether the injuries constitute murder or culpable, homicide not amounting to murder and if death is the likely result of the injures it is culpable homicide not amounting t and; if death is the most likely result then it is murder.<br/><strong>Momin Maitha Vs.State 41 DLR 37. </strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 299, 300 &amp; 302—</strong><br/>In the case of culpable homicide the intention or knowledge is not so positive or definite. The injury caused may or may not cause the death of the victim. To find that the offender is guilty of murder, it must be held that his case falls within any of the four clauses of section 300 otherwise he will be guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Facts of the case show that death was caused without premeditation.<br/><strong>Bandez Ali Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 200.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 300, clauses 1, 2, and 3—</strong><br/>The weapon used was a lethal one and the injury I grave in nature was caused on the vital part of the body. The act was done with the—intention of causing such bodily injury intended to be inflicted as was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. It falls clearly within the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd clauses of section 300 Penal Code.<br/><strong>Md. Abdul Majid Vs. State40 DLR (AD) 83.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 300 Exception 1, Sections 302 and 304 part I—</strong><br/>the present case is—covered by the exceptions to the section: 300 of Penal Code. From the facts and circumstances of the case, we think that the criminal acts of the accuse4 respondents which resulted in the death of the victim constitute culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under section 3O4Part I of the Pena code.<br/>On a Consideration of the fact and circumstances of the case, it appears that the&amp; case is covered by exception—1 to section 300 of  the Penal Code and accordingly the conviction of the appellants is altered from section 302 to 304 Part I of the Penal Code and the sentence —of each of the appellants is reduced to RI for 10 years each thereunder.<br/><strong>Momin Malitha Vs. State 41 DLR 37.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 300, Exceptions 1 and 4—</strong><br/> Appellant cannot be convicted and sentenced under section 302 as the alleged offence conies within the ambit of Exceptions I and 4, section 300 of the Penal Code.<br/>From the evidence on record, it transpires that there was quarrel and golmal over the fencing on the disputed land and also altercation took place On the day of occurrence between the parties over removal of the fencing which ultimately culminated into a ‘maramari causing thereby bleeding injury on the person of the appellant’s son Kalu on one hand and the death of victim Abdul Karim on the other. Besides, the injury on the person of the son of accused Momin Malitha could not be explained away by the prosecution It also appears that the accused had no undue advantage in the matter Be that as it may, on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence on record and also the relevant provisions of law, we are of the view that the alleged offence committed by this appellant Momin Malitha comes within the ambit of the Exceptions I and 4 of section 300 of the Penal Code and as such this appellant cannot be convicted and sentenced under section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/><strong>Momin Malitha Vs State 41 DLR 37.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 300, Exceps 2 &amp; 4—</strong><br/>Murder— Right of private defence—In the case of right of private defence of property one accused of murder must prove that the property in question was his property. When upon evidence it is found that the primary object of the accused was to make a forcible attempt to snatch away the paddy of the informant party question of defending such right cannot arise. It was nowhere suggested that the informant party carried any weapon or made any kind of assault on the accused while, on the other hand, the accused were found to have been armed with lethal weapons. In this case there was certainly premeditation on the side of the accused without which he would not have come armed with lethal weapons.<br/><strong>Dilip Vs. State 43 DLR 269</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 300, 299 &amp; 304—Part I— </strong><br/>Culpable homicide—The injuries, though caused intentionally, are of such a nature that these are “likely to cause death” and this does not constitute murder’—It constitutes culpable homicide not amounting to murder.<br/><strong>State Vs. Montu 44 DLR (AD) 287.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 302—</strong><br/>Substitütion of sub-section (5) of section 367 CrPC by the Law Reforms ordinance—Effect of change on sentencing— Previously death sentence was the normalal sentence for murder and the court was required to give reasons if the lesser sentence of life Imprisonment was given—After the substitution now reasons have to be given in either case —A death sentence is to be justified in as much in the in the same way as in the case of lesser sentence of life term imprisonment.<br/><strong>Abed Ali Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 171.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 302—Sentence—</strong><br/>Commutation of death sentence—Delay of about two years or so in the disposal of the Death Reference Case and the Jail Appeal in the High Court division cannot by it if be a ground for awaiting lesser sentence.<br/><strong>Abed Ali Vs. State 42 DLR AD 171.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 302—</strong><br/>Culpable conduct of the accused that he made no attempt to look for his wife since she was missing is explicit, which is confirmatory of his involvement in the murder of his wife. Normally an accused is under no obligation to account for the death —for which he is on trial, but this is bound to be different.<br/><strong>Dipok Kumar Sarker Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 139.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 302—</strong><br/>In the present case the offence followed a brief tenure of a rancorous married life between the appellant and the deceased. It was admitted by the prosecution that it was not a blissful union from the beginning. Circumstances would have been taken notice of while inflicting proper punishment prescribed under the law.<br/><strong>Dipok Kumar Sarker Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 139.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 302—</strong><br/>The question Is whether the materials on record warrant conviction of the appellant Momin Malitha under section 302 of the Penal Code. We have carefully examined the evidence on record from all aspects and we are of the opinion that the offence committed by this appellant does not come within the scope of section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/><strong>Momin Maltiha Vs. State 41 DLR 37.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 302—</strong><br/>CommutatIon of sentence— extenuating circumstances for commutation —condemned prisoners are under peril of death sentence for almost 3 years suffering—agony and torments thereby partially purged their guilt. Their life may be spared. Sentence of death commuted to one of imprisonment for life.<br/><strong>Abul Kashem Vs State 42 DLR 338.</strong><br/> <br/><strong> Section 302—</strong><br/>subMission of sentence for confirmation—the order of conviction under section 302 Penal Code by the Sessions Judge on the basis of part of the evidence recorded by an Assistant Sessions Judge, who is not competent to hold trial under that section, is illegal. The death reference is rejected and the case is sent back for re—trial of the condemned prisoner in accordance with law and in the light of observations made.<br/><strong>State Vs. lmdad Ali Bepari 42 DLR 428.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 302/32—</strong><br/>Motive is though a piece of evidence and may not be a sine qua non for bringing offence home to accused, yet it is relevant and on the question of intention .The existence of motive has a great significance in a criminal trial.<br/><strong>State Vs. Mizanul Islam 40 DLR 58.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 302/132—</strong><br/>The credit to be given to the statement of witness is a matter not regulated by rule of procedure. The credibility of a witness depends upon his knowledge of fact to which he testifies his disinterestedness, his integrity and his veracity.<br/><strong>State Vs. Mizanul Islam 40 DLR 58.</strong><br/> <br/>Section 302/32—Evidence of a witness is to be looked at from a point of law of its credibility. Appreciation of oral evidence depending as it does on such variable inconsistent factor as human nature cannot be reduced to a set formula.<br/><strong>State Vs. Mizanul Islam 40 DLR 58.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 3O2/34—</strong><br/>Commnon intention—Whether the evidence of PW 1 and PW 11, two eye witnesses, shows that the appellant NOs 2—4 had shared common intention to cause the death of Nandalal along with the appellant No. 1—There was no proper evidence to make such an inference.<br/><strong>Amar Kumar Thakur Vs. State 40 DLR(AD) 147.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 302/34—</strong><br/>Evidence adduced by PW 1 was corroborated by PWs 3,17 and 18 who were eye—witnesses.<br/><strong>Nurul Islam Vs. State 40 DLR 122.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 302/34—</strong><br/>Common intention to murder the deceased Kanchan having been established by the appellant’s participation in the offence, they were rightly convicted.<br/><strong>Nurul Islam Vs. State 40 DLR 122.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 302/34—</strong><br/>Sessions Judge did not take any step for proper arrangement of defending the condemned prisoners who were denied the substantive right of being defended through a lawyer at the cost of the State— Conviction not sustainable in law.<br/><strong>State Vs. Jahar Ali 42 DLR 94.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 302/34—</strong><br/>Conviction of co—accused who had not confessed— Circumstances show the accused Shahajahan Manik had intimacy with accused Rina and this put them to visiting terms and the visits had strengthened his intimacy with Rina. Their guilty conscience is also evident from the false plea in their statements made under section 342 CrPC that they did not know each other.<br/><strong>Shahjahan Manik Vs. State 42 DLR 465.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 302/34—</strong><br/>The confession is sufficient to find accused Rina guilty of the charge under sections 302/34 Penal Code inasmuch as she participated in the murder starting from hatching of conspiracy for killing her husband in order to marry accused Manik to allowing the latter to bring in poison and mix it with the drinking, water of her husband’s jug and then to see the husband drinking that water, then after his death to hang the body and raising a feigned cry. Besides, the circumstances showed there was no scope for anyone to enter the room to kill her husband without her co-operation.<br/><strong>Shahjahan Manik Vs. State 42 DLR 465.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 302/34—</strong><br/>Inconsistent evidence of PWs 2 and 4—Omissions and contradictions in their depositions were not given consideration by the Courts below —Defence case appears to be more probable than that of the prosecution “as it fits in human, nature and conduct”. Appellants entitled to acquittal as a matter of right.<br/><strong>Abul Kashem Vs. State 41 DLR (AD) 152.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 302/34 and 201—</strong><br/>No hint having been given to her during her examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as to the disappearance of evidence of crime she was prejudiced in her defence, and her conviction under section 201 Penal Code is not sustainable.<br/><strong>Abdul Khaleque Vs. State 41 DLR 349.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 302/34 &amp; 302/ 109— </strong><br/>Confession —Conviction on confession alone—Relying on his incriminating statements that he made conspiracy with co—appellant Abdul Khaleq to murder his step—mother and when from his statement it appears that he was very much present standing outside the hut at the time of the murder, appellant Hazrat Ali can be safely convicted for abetment of murder.<br/><strong>Hazrat Ali &amp; others Vs. State 44 DLR (AD) 51.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 302/109 and 148—</strong><br/>Evidence on record does not justify the order of conviction under sections 302/109 and 148 of the Penal Code upheld by the High Cowl Division—The learned Judges did not at all consider the evidence relating to the alleged abduction of Sohrab, Mahtab and Mobarak for which the appellants were convicted also under sections 362/149 Penal Code.<br/><strong>Jamal Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 38.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 302/109—</strong><br/>Conduct of the accused—No evidence to suggest the intention of the accused to kill the victim while taking him along with them—Facts, evidence and circumstances do not bring the case under sections 302/109 Penal Code.<br/><strong>Soleman Vs. State 42 DLR 118.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 302/109—</strong><br/>Abetment—To sustain a charge of abetment of an offence it is necessary that there must be some evidence of overt act or omission so as to suggest a pre—concert or common design to commit a particular offence So long as the design rests in intention short of overt act directed to the commission of the offence it is not indictable in law.<br/><strong>Ali Ahmed Malaker Vs. State 43 DLR 401</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 302 and 304 Part 1—</strong><br/>Culpable homicide not amounting to murder— From the circumstances of the case and the nature of injury that resulted in the death of victim after 11 days after the infliction of the injury, the appellant cannot be held guilty of murder. Conviction altered to section 304, Part I.<br/><strong>Lal Miah alias Lalu Vs. State 41 DLR (AD) 1.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 304—</strong><br/>Culpable homicide not amounting to murder—In the absence of any conspiracy, pre—plan Or premeditation on the part of the accuseds while inflicting injury resulting in the death of the victim 4 days after the occurrence, the accuseds did not intend to cause his death but they caused culpable homicide not amounting to murder.<br/><strong>Dalilur Rahman Vs. State 44 DLR 379.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 304/34—</strong><br/>Joint action—Omission may also render an offender liable for punishment—If a man joins with another to assault a person, even though the original intention was merely to inflict relativel harmless injuries, but if he sees his. Companions in course of the action giving serious beating which is likely to cause his death, but he does not take any step to interfere and the victim dies, such omission may render him liable under section 304.<br/><strong>Shaikh Baharul Islam Vs. State 43 DLR 336.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 304/34—</strong><br/>since accused Abdul Bari merely in an innocent manner brought the victim in obedience to OC’s order; he is not involved in any criminal act.<br/><strong>Shaikh Baharul Islam Vs. State 43 DLR 336.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 304 Part I—</strong><br/>Culpable homicide not amounting to murder— from the facts proved it is clear that the victim did not die immediately after assault by her husband. There is no evidence of ill—feeling between the two, rather it is in evidence that he enticed her away and then married her. In the circumstances the accused—husband is not guilty of murder but of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.<br/><strong>Abdul Khaleque Vs. State 45 DLR 75.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 304 Part I—</strong><br/>The Immediate cause that triggered off serious violence and resulted in the loss of four lives though calls for the maximum punishment, being shrouded in mystery a lesser punishment may meet the ends of justice.<br/><strong>State Vs. Giasuddin 45 DLR 267.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 304 Part I—</strong><br/>Culpable homicide—Intention to cause death—From the evidence there can be no manner of doubt that the assault was done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as was likely to cause death. The accused—husband was not content by striking his wife with a branch of a tree but was reckless enough to kick her in the tender part of her body which immediately caused bleeding. It was not a case of mere knowledge only (to constitute offence under section 304 Part II) that such act was likely to cause death but that the intention to cause such injury as is likely to cause death was very clear. It is true —there is no finding as to “intention” either in the impugned judgment or in the judgment of the trial Court. This is certainly not desirable because the law requires a clear finding as to “intention” before recording a conviction under Part I of section 304. Notwithstanding the absence of the requisite finding as to intention, the appellant—husband was rightly convicted.<br/><strong>Jatin Chandra Sil Vs State 43 DLR (AD) 223. </strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 304, Part II—</strong><br/>Attack on the deceased by the appellant in an infuriated state—Imposition of 5 years’ imprisonment is a proper sentence. The criminal and not the crime must figure prominently in shaping the sentence. Reform of the individual in the society and other necessities to prevent recurrence are right factors. Heinousness of the crime is a relevant  factor in the choice of sentence.<br/><strong>Samosh Mia Vs. State 42 DLR 171.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 307/34—</strong><br/>Suspicion is not substitute of evidence. A faint doubt means a doubt without any reasonable basis. No benefit of doubt is contemplated in law.<br/>Reversal of the appellate Court’s finding will not bring the case within the ambit of murder under section 302 PC.<br/>Trial Court arrived at the finding that these injuries constitute murder. It is the degree of probability of death from certain injuries which determines whether the injuries constitute murder or culpable homicide not amounting to murder.<br/><strong>State Vs.

Mere pendency of a new partition stilt will not operate as a bar to the initiation of proceeding under section 145 CrPC. The aforesaid decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan 23 DLR (SC) 14 has been followed by our Appellate Division in the case of Md. Shahabul Huda Vs. Md. Shqfi 36 DLR (AD) 44. Hence mere pendency of the new partition suit will not operate as a bar initiation of proceeding under section 145 the Code of Criminal Procedure and we do not agree with the contention of the learned Additional Sessions Judge on this point.<br/><strong><em>Moslem Uddin Dhail Vs.

I am in respectful agreement with the observations made by the courts of the Indian Jurisdiction as quoted above AIR 1954 (Mad) 741 which are in accord with the view I have: taken to the effect that there is no bar under the: 1 Code of Criminal Procedure for making any complaint giving rise to a proceeding under sections 499/500 of the Penal Code independent of the criminal proceeding 1 which the defamatory statement has been made.

The offence alleged being a serious one the accused cannot be allowed to go scot free merely because of a mistake of the Judge in framing of charges invoking his jurisdiction for the trial. A fresh trial is ordered and should the appellant be found guilty in such trial the sentence he had already suffered should be taken into consideration while imposing sentence if any.<br/><strong><em>Mozammel Hoq Vs. State 42 DLR 527.</em></strong><br/> <br/>Superior Court Tradition—<br/>Narrating facts of the case—Judges ale to digest the materials and summaries them in the judgment.<br/>We record our strong disapproval of the manner in which the learned Judges of the High Court Division described the prosecution case in the two complaint cases. They have quoted in full the petitions of complaint in Bengali. The superior courts of this country have a tradition of narrating facts of the case in their own language, summarizing them as concisely as possible. Vernacular materials are translated into the language in which the judgment is written. Same is the case with the narration of FIR, Charge—Sheet, (where necessary) deposition of witnesses, etc the learned Judges are required to digest these materials and to summaries or paraphrase relevant and essential portions thereof in as short, succinct, concise and factual manner as possible Lest it develops into an infectious practice we like to nip this unhealthy trend in the bud.<br/><strong><em>Abdur Rahim Vs. Enamul Huq 43 DLR (AD) 173.</em></strong><br/> <br/>Examining a new question—<br/>Apart from the question on which leave was granted, counsel for the appellant submitted that the allegations made in the FIR do not constitute any offence as alleged. Court did not like to examine this question while hearing the appeal.<br/><strong><em>Zakir Hossain Vs. State 43DLR (AD) 102.</em></strong><br/> <br/>Credibility of witness—<br/>His disinterestedness, integrity and veracity—Court to look into surrounding circumstances as well as probabilities—Weight to be attached to the testimony of a witness depends on various considerations—Evidence should be in consonance with probabilities and consistent with the other evidence of the case to carry conviction of truth to a prudent mind.<br/><strong><em>Santosh Mia Vs. State 42 DLR 171.</em></strong><br/> <br/>—When a criminal Court is in seizin of the case against the detenu, the passing of order of detention is a colourable exercise of power.<br/><strong><em>Nabila Chowdhury Vs. Government of Bangladesh 41 DLR 345.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Fraud—</strong><br/>Fraud, when not taken into consideration—authorities accused of fraud and passing the impugned order have not been made parties in the Suit. Fraud cannot also be imputed to authorities exercising judicial function either as Court or as Tribunal.<br/><strong><em>Marida Begum Vs. Md. Hasan 43 DLR 242.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Judicial proceeding—</strong><br/>Court of first instance—Court’s duty to apply us judicial mind to the reflections made by the alleged defamatory statement vis-a-vis the exceptions under law. In a proceeding of this nature, initiated before the Court of  first instance, the court had  duty to apply its judicial mind to the reflections made by the alleged defamatory statement vis-a-vis the exception under the law and to find out whether those statements arc prima facie defamatory in nature or not before issue of the process. Nothing of this nature was done in the instant case by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate to apply his mind to the circumstances of the case as mentioned above, making his initial order of rejecting the complaint an illegality.<br/><strong><em>AY Mashiuzzaman Vs.

Such a method is not prohibited. For laying a trap the investigating officer cannot be said to be thereby instigating commission of the offence. Principles of accomplice evidence cannot be extended to the evidence of trap witness, because the latter cannot be termed as accomplice. As to corroboration of trap witnesses no hard and fast rule can be given. There may be cases where the Court may accept evidence of trap witnesses.<br/><strong><em>Shahabullah Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 1.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 5(2)—</strong><br/>The petitioner by showing false documents induced the purchaser to enter into an agreement to purchase the house on receipt of Taka 12 lacs on a plea that he would refund Taka 14 lacs in the event of failure to execute sale document. The contention of the petitioner to the effect that it was a civil dispute and that the Court of Settlement had given a final decision over all the disputes including the question of criminal liability is not sustainable. The criminal proceeding cannot be held to be liable to be quashed.<br/><strong><em>Aga Kohinoor Alam Vs.

The detention of the accused—appellant till the rising of the Court is Imprisonment within the meaning of section 409 of the Penal Code and section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (Act II of 1947) as his liberty freely to go about his business as at other times was restrained by order of the Court as he was confined in the Court precincts.<br/><strong><em>Jalaluddin Ahmed Chowdhury Vs State 41 DLR 87.</em></strong><br/> </div></div></div>

It confers on the Government the power to detain an individual for the purpose of preventing him from doing one or other or the 8 prejudicial acts mentioned in section 2(t) (i) to (viii) of the Act and for no Other purpose To keep a particular individual in detention for the purpose of protecting him front the onslaught of others is not contemplated within the four corners of the provision of law. The detenu might have a capability to create problem to public safety and public order, but that by itself cannot be the basis for passing an order of detention so long as he does not indulge himself in any prejudicial act and the members of the public, are not affected. (Per BB Roy Chowdhury J).<br/><strong><em>M Mahmood Vs. Bangladesh 43 DLR 372. </em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 2(f)(i)—</strong><br/>Detention order when void ab initio— Since the District Magistrate has no jurisdiction to pass an order of detention on the grounds enumerated in section 2(f)(i) the present Order of detention is void ab initio.<br/><strong><em>Moazzem Hossain Chowdhury Vs. Bangladesh 43 DLR 186.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 2(f) (i)—</strong><br/>A District Magistrate is not competent to make an order of preventive detention within the meaning of section 2(t) (1)—As it has been found that the initial order of detention passed by the District Magistrate On 31.:1 .89 and the detention of the detenu on the basis of it were illegal, the continuation of this illegal detention by the order of extension passed by the Government on 30.289 (sic) must also be deemed to be illegal. Initial order of detention was extended by a further order of detention with effect from an absurd date 30.2. 1989 whereas the month of February expired on 28.2.1989—Detention order being vague and indefinite is not lawful.<br/><strong><em>Khokan Kumar Saha Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 42 DLR 164.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 2(1) &amp; 16—</strong><br/>Where the subject matter of theft belongs to the citizen or any other organization or institution theft ipso facto of such property does not become prejudicial t6the economic and financial interest of the State. In the instant case as the motors in question belonged to the Project for irrigation of land of different individuals there is no scope to hold that the theft of the motors was prejudicial to the financial and economic interest of the State.<br/><strong><em>Anisuzzaman Vs. State 43 DLR 35.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 2(1) and 3(2)—</strong><br/>Detention— Ground NO. 4 relates to a specific criminal case—All other grounds are vague, Indefinite and lack in material particulars—Detenu’s release ordered by Court.<br/><strong><em>AKM Azizul Haque Vs. Bangladesh 42 DLR 189.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 2(1), 3 &amp; 8—</strong><br/>Jurisdictlonal facts for detaining a person—Since the detaining authority is curtailing the liberty of a citizen by detaining him on preventive detention, it is exercising a quasi—judicial authority. To curtail fundamental rights of personal liberty enshrined in the Constitution it is essential that the detaining authority must have reports and materials, that is, jurisdictional facts for exercising power to detain the detenu under the special Powers Act.<br/><strong><em>Anisul Islam Mahmood Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 1.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 2(f) (i), (ii) (viii) and 8—</strong><br/>Mandatory provision of section 8 of the Act has been violated by the Government by not serving the ground on the detenu that was mentioned in the detention order.<br/><strong><em>Rama Rani Bashak Vs. Bangladesh 40 DLR 364.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 2(f)(i), (iii), (v), (vii), (viii),— </strong><br/>Five different kinds of prejudicial acts were mentioned in the order without being sure as to which exact kind of prejudicial act the detenu was sought to be fastened with.<br/><strong><em>Rama Rani Bashak Vs. Bangladesh 40 DLR 364.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 2(f) (iii) &amp; 3(i)—</strong><br/>The Government which passed an independent detention order omitted all other grounds of prejudicial acts except the one defined in section 2(f)(iii) of the Act in the original detention order passed by the ADM—This shows non-application of mind.<br/><strong><em>Rama Rani Bashak Vs. Bangladesh 40 DLR 364.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 2(f) and 3(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)— </strong><br/>Authority vested by Special Powers Act in the detaining authority—Detaining Authority’s power to detain a person for preventing him from doing prejudicial acts—Prompt must be taken to prevent the detenu  from committing prejudicial acts any further—No explanation furnished by the detaining I authority as to the fact which prevents the detaining authority from taking prompt action.<br/>Detention order served after a delay of more than 2 years and 6 months after the incidents of prejudicial activities—No rational nexus between the grounds and the passing of detention order.<br/><strong><em>Mahabuba Wahed Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 42 DLR 153.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 2(f)(viii)—</strong><br/>Prejudicial act—Mortgaged machineries attached to the bank— Accused appellant did not commit any act, prejudicial to the economic or financial interest of the Shilpa Bank which comes within the ambit of State by legal fictions as defined in Article 152 of the Constitution.<br/><strong><em>Anwar Ali Vs. State 41 DLR 450.</em></strong><br/> <br/>Sections 2(f) (VIII) and 16 read with Constitution of Bangladesh 1972 (as amended) Article 152(1) Bangladesh Shilpa Bank Order, 1972 (P0 No. 129 of 1972) Articles 33, 34 and 35—Interpretation of Statute—Bangladesh Shilpa Bank is a statutory public authority within the meaning of Article 152(1) of the Constitution—The liability of the loanee to repay the secured loan being civil in nature, he did not commit any prejudicial act and cannot be convicted under section 16 read with section 2(1) (viii) of Special Powers Act for default in payment of loan.—The Bank is a State by legal fiction. Appropriate remedy for the bank is for action under Articles 33—35 of ‘P0 No. 129 of 1972.<br/><strong><em>Anwar Ali Vs. State 41 DLR 450.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 2(g)—</strong><br/>Report or statement— Whether it is a prejudicial act—A report or a statement which is or likely to be an incitement to the commission of a prejudicial act is a prejudicial act. The legislature made a report or statement whether true or false made by the reporter or the speaker which had the effect or likely to be an incitement to the commission of a prejudicial act not by the maker of the speech, but by his audience being incited by that speech is itself a prejudicial act.<br/><strong><em>Mostafizur Rahman Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 312.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3—</strong><br/>Detaining a person—Extent of satisfaction of the executive authority—The detaining authority is required to be very careful in examining the materials before passing the order of detention. Subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority can be looked into objectively by the High Court Division. The initial order of detention if found illegal the subsequent order of detention also suffers from infirmities.<br/><strong><em>Pearu Md. Ferdous Alam Khan for Serajul alam Khan Vs. State 44 DLR 603.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3—</strong><br/>The detention order, Annexure ‘A’, did not mention anywhere that the detention of the detenu was considered necessary to prevent him from doing any prejudicial act. Thus on the face of the order itself it is without any legal authority in view of the provision of section 3of the Act.<br/><strong><em>Tahera Islam Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 4O DLR 193.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3—</strong><br/>The purpose for, which the petitioner was taken into detention appears to be realisation of the bank loan.  Such detention was not contemplated in the Act. If anything is payable to the bank as unpaid loan, there are other modes of recovery of the dues as—the loan was obtained under bilateral agreement creating a civil liability. For default in this regard provision of preventive detention under the Special Powers Act cannot be resorted to.<br/><strong><em>Mirza Ali Ashraf Vs. State 43 DLR 144.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3—</strong><br/>Ground of detention— Capability to create problem cannot be, ground—A capability to create problems to public safety and public order by itself cannot be the basis for passing an order of detention so long as the detenu does not indulge himself in any prejudicial act endangering public safety and public order and the members of the public are not affected by his activities.<br/><strong><em>M Mahmood Vs. Bangladesh 43 DLR 372.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3—</strong><br/>There is no nexus between the grounds mentioned in the order of detention and the grounds that were subsequently served on the detenu. For this reason also the detention order is liable to be held illegal.<br/><strong><em>Tahera Islam Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 40 DLR 193.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 3 &amp; 8—</strong><br/>Purpose of detention and grounds—Nexus—In the initial order of detention nothing has been stated about any act of the detenu to be prejudicial to the economic interest of the State which appears to be the ground No. I in the list of grounds supplied to him. There is therefore no nexus between the purpose of detention and the grounds thereof and as such the detention is unauthorised being based on no proper grounds.<br/><strong><em>Aminuzzaman Vs. Bangladesh 45 DLR 242.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 3 and 8 read with Constitution of Bangladesh (as amended upto date) Article 33 (5)—</strong><br/>Grounds in the initial order of detention cannot be substituted for separate grounds to be communicated to the detenu.<br/><strong><em>Chunnu Chowdhury Vs. District Magistrate 41 DLR 156.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(1)—</strong><br/>When specific case has been stared in relation to the alleged activity of the detent,, the same activity could not in fairness be taken as a reasonable basis for making an order of detention. <br/><strong><em>Tahera Islam Vs. Secretary Ministry of Home Affairs 40 DLR 193.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(1)—</strong><br/>No order of detention from 23.8.87 to 26.8.87—illegal order of detention was sought to be legalized by an order of extension with retrospective effect which is not permiissible in law.<br/><strong><em>Tahera Islam Vs. Secretary Ministry of Home Affairs 40 DLR 193.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(1)—</strong><br/>Detention—detention to make one inactive to keep the even tempo of life—The Court in an examination of the ground upon which the detaining authority had acted would examine whether in a given case, in the light of the attending facts and circumstances, the authority could be satisfied that a person should be detained in order to make him inactive or rather neutralized so that greater public interest can be ensured. The criterion is the potentiality of his act, its impact on the members of the society.<br/><strong><em>Mostafizur Rahman Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 312.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(1)—</strong><br/>Detention—Detention with the apprehension that somebody else (students) may endanger public order due to some utterance of the detent, — There is no warrant for the view that for the action or programme of the students (that of proceeding towards the cantonment where the ousted President was then residing) should not be held responsible and that he had been detained not for doing any prejudicial act. A prejudicial act has been defined in section 2of the Special Powers Act to be “any act”. Here the law did not mention the act but made any act to be prejudicial which is intended by the doer of the act or likely to prejudice, which means the reasonable standard of likelihood or possibility to prejudice public order, etc.<br/><strong><em>Mostafizur Rahman Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 312.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(1) (a)—</strong><br/>Preventive detention— When it is colourable exercise of power—The detention has been based on self—same grounds as were communicated to the detenu on earlier Occasion and declared to be illegal. Repeated recourse to illegal grounds knowing them to be so speaks of a bad mind. In the facts of this case, the preventive 8ctibn of the respondent is nothing but a colourable exercise of power.<br/><strong><em>Fazana Huq Vs. Bangladesh 43 DLR 501.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(1) (a)—</strong><br/>There being no nexus between the initial order of detention and the, ground served, the order of detention is without lawful authority.<br/><strong><em>Mansur Moazzem Vs. Bangladesh 40 DLR 439.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(1) (a)—</strong><br/>Custody on the plea of conviction—where a prisoner is in custody on the basis of an order of conviction the onus of the respondent is discharged as soon as the return relating to the appellant’s custody ‘shows that there is an order of conviction justifying the custody. But the conviction is to N placed before the court for its satisfaction whether the irregularity in It can be overlooked. The warrant of commitment issued by one not authorized under the law can hardly prove the conviction.<br/><strong><em>Nasrin Kader Siddiqui Vs Bangladesh 44 DLR (AD) 16.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(1)(a)—</strong><br/>Detention—Simultaneous proceeding of criminal trial whether permissible—The jurisdiction under the detention law may be invoked when the available evidence does not come up to the standard of judicial proof but is otherwise cogent enough to give rise to a suspicion in the mind of the authority concerned. A preventive dent ion is to prevent a person on mere suspicion that some crime had been done and the same would be repeated and is not a question of proving an allegation by evidence which must be done when a proceeding is drawn under the Penal Code.<br/>Where a criminal proceeding is essentially on the same subject matter and no other matter than the criminal proceeding, then the proceeding under the normal law of the land would b allowed to be continued and the specific case would negative the necessity of any detention order except it could be shown on evidence or from records that the proceeding would come to a fiasco because there s no possibility of evidence to be produced in court in spite Of attempts made by the prosecution for him tube punished eventually and there is a possibility of has Immediately repeating the same activity an similar manner A criminal proceeding thus would not bar a detention order but there are limitations.<br/><strong><em>Salim Hasan Vs Bangladesh 45 DLR 318</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3 (1) (a)—</strong><br/>Where allegations are of serious nature the detaining authority may consider them, and despite pendency of a criminal case, can make an order of detention if it is satisfied that the detenu is to be prevented from indulging in prejudicial activities.<br/><strong><em>Habiba Mahmud Vs. Bangtodesh 45 DLR (AD) 89.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(1) (a)—</strong><br/>Government’s passing of order of detention on 23.2.1987 after expiry of 30 days cannot be treated as extending the previous order of detention.<br/><strong><em>Khair Ahmed Vs. Ministry of Home Affairs 40 DLR 353.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(1) (a)—</strong><br/>The detenu is not released on receipt of the order of the Court and is continued in detention without any order whatsoever, then a fresh order of detention passed.<br/>Held—by this order the Government merely continued an illegal detention and cannot be sustained.<br/><strong><em>Alam Ara Huq Vs. Government of Bangladesh 42 DLR 98.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(1) (a)—</strong><br/>The Government if satisfied with respect to any person that with a view to preventing him from doing any prejudicial act at is necessary to do so make an order directing that such person be detained This satisfaction is to precede the order of detention which means that all the materials are to be placed before the Government for forming an opinion that the detention is necessary.<br/><strong><em>Faisal Mahbub Vs Bangladesh 44 DLR 168.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(1) (a)—</strong><br/>Preventive detention— Nexus between the incident and the order of detention—The alleged offending acts of the detenu prior to his arrest in September 1987 formed the basis of the satisfaction of the detaining authority as to the necessity of the detention and those had a close link with the passing of the order of detention. The detenu has been in custody since 13.9.87 and there has been a long gap 2—1/2 years between the alleged prejudicial activities and the order of detention when there could legitimately be no material in possession of the detaining authority to show that there was any likelihood of the same being repeated. The detaining authority had, therefore, no material basis to form an opinion of satisfaction for passing the order of detention.<br/><strong><em>Farzana Huq Vs. Banladesh 43 DLR 501.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(1)(a)—</strong><br/>Detention order, nature and scope of—This provision requires that before the Government can pass an order of detention it must be satisfied with respect to the individual person that his activities are directed against the object mentioned in the section and that it is necessary to prevent him from acting against it. While empowering the Government to pass a preventive order the section appears to have expressly made it a part of its duty to satisfy itself about the existence of what the law makers regard as condition precedent to the exercise of that power. An order being indicative of the Stale of the mind of the authority making it, the concerned order of detention must expressly state that the Government is at it is necessary to make the Order to prevent the individual from doing any prejudicial act. If the order is silent in this respect the detention will be not in terms of the section.<br/><strong><em>M Mahmood Vs.

The Government have not been authorised to— extend the period of detention with retrospective effect. The detenu is therefore detained under—an illegal order of detention and is directed to be released forthwith.<br/><strong><em>Momtaz Sultana Vs.

After the expiry of 30 days on 174 1987, the detention order is without any lawful authority as it was not extended within 30 days.<br/><strong><em>Saleha Chowdhury Vs.

[Relied on 31 DLR (AD) 1]<br/>Pendency of a specific criminal case against detenu cannot be the ground for detaining him under section 3 of the Special Powers Act. 40 DLR 193 relied on.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Hakim Miah Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 42 DLR 219.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(3)—</strong><br/>Fourth and last order of detention was dated 8.7.89—This was passed in confirmation of order of detention dated 11.3.89 which was found to be illegal—Thus the order dated 8.7.89 which was in confirmation of an illegal order was also patently illegal.<br/>The last order was passed under section 3 (3) of the Act. An order under this provision of the Act is passed by the Government in approval of an order passed by the District Magistrate/Additional District Magistrate. In the instant case no order of detention was passed by either District Magistrate—Additional District Magistrate detaining the detenu. It was an order where the detaining authority has not applied its, mind and has acted mindlessly, nervously and desperately.<br/><strong><em>Alam Ara Huq Vs. Government of Bangladesh 42 DLR 98.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(3)—</strong><br/>Non—application of mind in the matter of detention makes the order of detention illegal—Any order of detention not ‘a signed by a competent officer cannot be treated as a valid order of detention.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Hakim Miah Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 42 DLR 219.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(3)—</strong><br/>the period of limitation of 30 days occurring in sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the Act will begin to run from the date of making of the order.<br/><strong><em>Saleha Chowdhury Vs Government Bangladesh 40 DLR 207. </em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 3(3)—</strong><br/>Detention of the detenu  after the expiry of 30 days (From 18.3.1987 to 17.4.1987) cannot be extended  by an order— dated 5.10.1987 when the said detention was not legally in existence on and from 18.4.1987—Detention order Is illegal—Detenu is entitled to be released.<br/><strong><em>Saleha Chowdhury. Vs Government of Bangladesh 40 DLR 207.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 7(b)—</strong><br/>Direction upon absconding — person following order of his detention— Validity of such direction —When the order of detention is a nullity and — subsequent notification under section 7(b) ot the Special Powers Act also becomes a nullity and  void ab initio and the consequential proceeding before the Special Tribunal under the  said section 7(b) for non—compliance such null and void order becomes illegal and without lawful authority. In the instant case the order of detention is void ab initio because the detaining authority did not at all have before it “the junsdactional facts” to enable it to form its opinion that the person concerned should be detained for preventing him from acting in pre judicial manner and also because the involvement grounds given for preventive detention do not come within the meaning of the expression “prejudicial act” as define under section 2(f) of the Act.<br/><strong><em>Anisul Islam Mahmood Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 1.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 7(1)(b)—</strong><br/>Indictment proceeding against a detenu— question of its legality or otherwise at the time when It was initiated and  at subsequent time—An order would be deemed to be a warrant of arrest from the Court of Magistrate; if the detenu would  violate the warrant he would be a  fugitive from justice. His failure to comply with direction to surrender would immediately attract the mischief of prosecution and consequent punishment. The offence would be complete on failure to surrender, subject however, to the defence of impossibility of performance which is a matter of fact to be decided on evidence. Section 7(l)(b) is a punitive provision to come into play immediately after the lapse of time, for surrender. The contention that the detentions order being illegal the detenu had not rightly surrendered has little substance. It is not the order of detention but it is the fact of detention itself that matters. At the time it was initiated the proceeding was not prohibited by any law nor was it taken in violation of any law. It need not therefore be quashed at the present stage.<br/><strong><em>Anwar Hossain Monju Vs. State 43 DLR 447.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 8—</strong><br/>Detention—It is now an established principle of law that the allegations out of which specific case is started are not proper grounds for preventive detention.<br/><strong><em>Aminuzzaman Vs. Bangladesh 45 DLR 242.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 8—</strong><br/>Grounds of detention—The detaining authority is under an obligation to furnish definite grounds as well as adequate particulars to the detenu so as to enable him to make a meaningful, representation against the detention. This obligation stems from the statutory right of the detenu embodying the constitutional mandate of Article 33 5). No detenu should suffer because of vagueness of grounds or of the fact that the evidence against him is not brought to his notice. The grounds in this case being extremely vague and indefinite the detenu was denied the opportunity to make an effective representation and consequently his detention has been rendered illegal.<br/><strong><em>Farzana Huq Vs. Bangladesh 43 DLR 501.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 8—</strong><br/>Communication of grounds— Its importance—When a ground is not specifically stated in the document communicated to the detenu under section 8 of the Special Powers Act the same cannot be used by the detaining authority to defend its preventive action as the detenu gets no opportunity to make any representation in respect thereof.<br/><strong><em>M Mahmood Vs. Bangladesh 43 DLR 372.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 8—</strong><br/>Grounds of detention— Whether the detention order would fall to the ground if the second ground of detention, out of two grounds, is found to be  a malafide addition—The contention that the entire detention order would suffer from illegality as the second ground of detention could not be a pre—existing material at the time the impugned order was passed is of no substance because this ground was not before the detaining authority at the time the detention order was made and cannot thus be availed of by the detaining authority and the same must be left out of consideration. The first ground itself is a self—sufficient ground and good enough for the satisfaction of the detaining authority to pass the order of detention.<br/><strong><em>Mostafizur Rahman Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 312.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 8—</strong><br/>Every citizen has an inalienable right to be treated in accordance with law—Mere insertion of a section of some law In the order of detention is not enough. The provision of law must be strictly followed. Under Article 102(2) (b) of the Constitution the Court is to be satisfied that the detenu is not being held in custody without lawful authority—the Court is t see whether the grounds of detention supplied to the detenu are supported by materials.<br/><strong><em>Faisal Mahbub Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 168.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 8—</strong><br/>It is thus amply clear from the reasons stated in the order made under section 8 the Special Powers Act, 1974 containing the grounds of detention that no reasonable person could be satisfied about the necessity to detain the detenu.<br/><strong><em>Dr. Habibullah Vs. Secretary MO Home Affairs 41 DLR 160.</em></strong><br/> <br/>Section 8—Fresh grounds not having been served within 15 days on the detenu, the respondents had no legal capability of adding or substituting any more grounds—Detention of the detenu illegal.<br/><strong><em>Alam Ara Huq Vs. Government of Bangladesh 42 DLR 98.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 8—</strong><br/>‘Grounds’ must include facts as well. Grounds are not only necessary to enable the defence to make representation— they are the starting points both for Advisory Board and the High Court Division for discharging their obligations.<br/>If the detenu asks for further particulars the Government may refuse to disclose a more facts on the ground of public interest. Section 8 of the Act requires that all grounds are to be given to the detenu and under the proviso to that section no ground can be withheld and only those fats may be disclosed whose disclosure is considered not to be against the public interest.<br/><strong><em>Habiba Mahmud Vs. Bangladesh 45 DLR (AD) 89.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 8(1)—</strong><br/>Ground Nos. 3, 4, 5 and7 being vague, indefinite and lacking In necessary particulars as to date, time and manner of detenu’s involvement in the activities, no effective representation could be made under section 8(1).<br/><strong><em>Khokan Kumar Saha Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 42 DLR 164</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 8(2)—</strong><br/>Grounds of detention to be served within 15 days from the date of order of detention—Order of detention passed and. served on 24.1.87 and grounds of detention I served on 14.2.87 after 21 days from the date1 of detention—Order of detention suffers from legal infirmity.<br/><strong><em>Khair Ahmed Vs. Ministry of Home 40 DLR 353.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 8(2)—</strong><br/>Interpretation of Statute— Expression “not later than fifteen days from the date of detention”—Meaning of—Detenu’s valuable legal right to make representation or to move the Court at once involved.<br/>The said extraordinary provision adding the expression “but not later than fifteen days from the date of detention” does not give a general licence to the Ministry of Home Affairs or to the District Magistrate, Additional District Magistrate to cause service of the order containing the grounds of detention in a. leisurely way within 15 days in every case deliberately to deprive the detenu of his. Valuable legal right to make effective representation at the earliest possible opportunity to the appropriate authority or to, move the Court at once.<br/><strong><em>Dr. Md. Habibullah Vs.

Bangladesh 40 DLR 18.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 10—</strong><br/>Requirements provided for preventive detention to be strictly followed. Failure of the detaining authority to comply with the mandatory provision of law renders the detention illegal.<br/><strong><em>Iftekhar Ahmed Vs.

Detenu directed to be released.<br/><strong><em>Birendra Chandra Pal Vs.

State 40 DLR 348.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 25B—</strong><br/>since no offence was committed as found by the Special Tribunal in respect of the goods seized from the petitioner, the petitioner’s possession of the property must be deemed to be lawful. The Special Tribunal’s failure to make an order for return of the property has resulted in a miscarriage justice.<br/><strong><em>Sree Monoranjan Das Vs.

The Special Tribunal has no jurisdiction to take cognizance or t proceed with trial in such a position.<br/><strong><em>Shahidullah Vs.

A mere defect in framing of charge by the Court having jurisdiction is one thing while framing of charge without having any jurisdiction is a completely different thing.<br/><strong><em>Mozammel (Md) Huq Vs.

Khalilur Rahman 41 DLR 1.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 26 and 27—</strong><br/>Section 27 of the Special Powers Act is a departure from the provision of section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Special Tribunal alone is empowered to take cognizance of the offence on the report of a Police Officer of the rank of Sub—Inspector and hold trial on the same—Sections 26 and 27 of the Special Powers Act provide for special machinery for investigation and trial by Special Tribunal.<br/><strong><em>Taslima Begum Vs. State 42 DLR 136.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 26—</strong><br/>Plea of misjoinder of offences when not sustainable—Offences which are made punishable both under the general law and the special law exciusivery triable by the Special Tribunal cannot be said to be different offences or non—schedule offences as those offences have been made exclusively triable by the Special Tribunal. As such it cannot be said that the present trial is vitiated by misjoinder of charges and the Special Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make charges of schedule and non—schedule offences. Cases reported in 31, 33 &amp; 35 DLR pages 174, 203, &amp; 127 respectively held not applicable.<br/><strong><em>Abul Kashem Vs.

Hormuz Ali 40 DLR 161.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 27(1)—</strong><br/>Quashing of proceeding under Special Powers Act—In matters of cognizance of offences triable exclusively by the Special Tribunal under the Special Powers Act initial cognizance of offence by a Magistrate in the manner provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure has no application.<br/>In an application for quashment of proceeding on the ground of expiry of period of limitation for investigation, the provisions of section 167(5) of the Code applies only to cases in which the Magistrate can take initial cognizance and does not apply to cases exclusively triable by the Tribunal. On this ground the application for quashing is summarily rejected.<br/><strong><em>Mahbubur Rahman Vs. State 42 DLR 375.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 27(1)—</strong><br/>It has been asserted that the impugned order of the learned Upzila Magistrate is palpably illegal as he had no authority to take cognizance of the offence under the Special Powers Act and as such he was not competent to accept the final report submitted by the police and to discharge the accused opposite party and to direct return of the goods.<br/>Held—As the Magistrate was not competent to take cognizance of the offence under section 27(1) of the Special Powers Act, the impugned order appears to have been passed by the learned Magistrate illegally and without lawful authority.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Satya Narayi, Sarada 43 DLR 529.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 27(l) (4)—</strong><br/>Power conferred on Special Tribunal by section 27(1) to take cognizance of any case relating to the Act on police report and also under section 27(4) to direct the Police Officer to make further investigation cannot be exercised by the Session Judge in the revisional jurisdiction under sections 435 and 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><strong><em>Satya Ranjan Sarda Vs. State 42 DLR 142.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 27(6)—</strong><br/>Trial in absentia without proper notification—As the trial was held under provision of the Special Powers Act, the notification of the trial regarding abscondence of the accused persons should have been made by the Special Tribunal. The notification done by the Magistrate who had transferred the case before the Special Tribunal for trial suffers from gross irregularity, if not illegality as well, in the matter. In such circumstances the accused did not get the opportunity of cross—examining the witnesses. The case should therefore go on remand to the Special Tribunal for retrial, especially in view of the irregularity in the notification regarding abscondence of the accused. The impugned judgment and conviction is, therefore, set aside and the case is sent back on remand for retrial.<br/><strong><em>Khokan Vs. State 43 DLR 387.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 27(6)—</strong><br/>it was still obligatory to publish in official Gazette a direction on the accused to appear before the Court before taking up the trial if the accused was considered absconding because of their absence.<br/><strong><em>Md. Sabuj vs. State 40 DLR 150.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 27(6)—</strong><br/>Both the accuseds could not be regarded as having absconded as they were granted bail and summonses and warrants were directed to be issued.<br/><strong><em>Md.

State 42 DLR 97.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 29—</strong><br/>Applicability of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the proceeding of the Special Tribunal does not empower the Special Tribunal to act as revisional court.<br/><strong><em>Satya Ranjan Sarda Vs. State 42 DLR 142.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 29—</strong><br/>Applicability of the Code to proceedings before Special Tribunals: The Act provides that the provisions of the Code shall apply to a case under the Act if they are not inconsistent with its own provisions. Section 339C of the Code being not inconsistent with any provisions of the Act shall apply to the proceedings before Special Tribunals constituted under the Act. Section 339C is intended for expeditious trial; the special statute is intended for “more speedy trial.” If the provision for speedy trial is not applied to trial under the Act, it will bring a situation not intended by the law—makers.<br/><strong><em>Kamruzzaman Vs.

State 42 DLR 349.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 30—</strong><br/>Time to take appeal—Considering the express provision of law for filing appeal within 30 days from the date of judgment by the Special Tribunal, the prayer for registering the appeal  for hearing on merits is rejected notwithstanding the fact that the accused had no opportunity to appear before the Tribunal and face trial.<br/><strong><em>Siddique Vs. State 45 DLR 214.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong><br/>Bail—The bar of granting bail in Special Powers. Act case is not absolute. It depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.<br/><strong><em>Dulal Miah Vs. State 44 DLR2O9.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 32—</strong><br/>The High Court Division summarily rejected the appellant’s prayer for bail on an erroneous view of section 32 of the Special Powers Act which does not provide for absolute bar on ball. Under section 32 even when the prosecution opposes the prayer for bail the court can release an accused on ball when it is satisfied that there are reaso4lalhie grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offence alleged.<br/><strong><em>Madar Chandra Basu Vs.

The protection given in this section is only for anything done or intended to be done in good faith.<br/>Mirza Ali Ashraf Vs. State 43 DLR 144.<br/> <br/><strong>Section 34—</strong><br/>Maintainability of writ petition challenging legality of the order of detention after release of the detenu—the petitioner being an aggrieved person along with others challenged the validity of the transaction made during his detention period touching the transfer of the mill of the Company of which he was the Managing Director. If the order of detention remained unchallenged it may be used against him which may create obstacle in the way of his getting proper remedy. No other Court other than this Court under Article 102 of the Constitution has jurisdiction in the matter. And suit or other proceeding may be taken in any appropriate Court for anything done not in good faith. The impugned order has net therefore become infructuous and the relief prayed for is not for academic purpose; in t view the writ petition is quite maintainable and the petitioner is entitled to the declaration prayed for.<br/><strong><em>Mirza Ali Ashraf Vs.

Trial of the accused for offences falling under the schedule by the Magistrate and hearing of the appeal as done by the Sessions Judge are absolutely without jurisdiction. If a court has no jurisdiction to try a case, the question of either submitting to the jurisdiction or raising objection to its jurisdiction would not arise. Parties by their mutual consent can neither confer a jurisdiction which does not exist in law nor can take away a jurisdiction which so exists. Jurisdiction is a question of statute and not of consent.<br/><strong><em>Dr. Joynal Abedin Vs. State 44 DLR 77.</em></strong><br/> </div></div></div>

State 45 DLR (AD) 48.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Adverse presumption—</strong><br/>The Court is justified to draw an adverse presumption against the prosecution for non—examination of competent witnesses without giving any reason.<br/><strong><em>Shah Alam Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 31.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Affidavit—</strong><br/>Affidavit is to be sworn by the party against whom allegations of personal nature are made—No permission was obtained  from the court for swearing the affidavit by Nityananda Das on behalf of the respondent No.3 and the said affidavit was not verified by the said deponent. Such affidavit on behalf of the respondent is not worth consideration. Since the respondent did not deny the allegatians against him the same remained uncontroverted.<br/><strong><em>Nurul Huda Miah Vs. Dhaka WASA 44 DLR 527.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Alibi—</strong><br/>Magistrate cannot discharge accused persons on the plea of alibi that they were at different places at the time of commission of offences alleged by the prosecution—Magistrate’s “finding” in this regard is based on no evidence. Mere submission of some papers supporting alibi is neither sufficient nor admissible as the stage of adducing defence evidence was not yet come. Magistrate’s order of discharge was not sustainable s it was based on gross misconception of law.<br/><strong><em>Nannu Gazi Vs. Awlad Hossain 43 DLR (AD) 63.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>“Alter the finding”—</strong><br/>The Appellate Court has jurisdiction under section 423 (l) (b) (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure to reverse an order of acquittal purporting to “alter the finding” of conviction.<br/>Mofizuddin Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 286;<br/> <br/><strong>Apology—</strong><br/>Apology is an act of contrition. When—a contemner tenders apology as an act of contrition the Court must weigh that apology and if it is found to be a realact of contrition, no action need be taken.<br/><strong><em>Shamsur Rahman, DIG of Prisons Vs. Tahera Nargis Syed 44 DLR (AD) 237.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Bail—</strong><br/>Court’s attention was drawn to the fact that in the FIR appellant No. 1 was not alleged to have done any overt act nor his name was there in the dying declaration—Trial had not yet begun even though charges had been framed more than a month before.<br/>Copy of the trial Court’s order produced in Court indicating that trial may be delayed further—Appellants allowed to remain on bail.<br/><strong><em>Ashraf Ali Mondol Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 8.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Bail—</strong><br/>The case of the petitioner who is a woman deserves special consideration— Merely because charge—sheet has been submitted against her under sections 302/109/120B/34 of the Penal Code, she is not automatically debarred from getting bail.<br/><strong><em>Majeda Khatun Vs. State 42 DLR 76.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Bail—</strong><br/>Bail is not to be withheld as a punishment [PLD 1972 (SC) 81). There is no legal compulsion to keep people in jail merely on the allegation that they have committed offences punishable with death unless reasonable grounds exist to disclose their complicity.<br/><strong><em>Liaqat Sharf Vs. State 40 DLR 506.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Bail—</strong><br/>Bail in a pending appeal—In a pending criminal appeal when an appellant files an application for bail, the Court should not ordinarily issue a Rule. The Court may grant or refuse bail or ask the petitioner to come up with a separate petition and may hear the State if necessary before disposing of an application for bail.<br/><strong><em>Sree Monju Kumar Saha Vs.

State 40 DLR (AD) 279.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Bail—</strong><br/>Purpose of granting bail may be defeated if payment of the fine is made a condition.<br/><strong><em>Iqbal alias Salim Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 279.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Bail—</strong><br/>Appellant’s name not mentioned in the FIR nor any material could be gathered against him by police—Bail was not allowed on this contention by High Court Division but appeal was allowed by Appellate Division.<br/><strong><em>SK Kumar Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 290.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Bail—</strong><br/>Appellant’s bail prayer on the ground of being a BA examinee. The appellant then alone prayed for bail by an independent application making out a special case for bail.<br/><strong><em>Nurul Islam Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 244.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Bail—</strong><br/>bail in a case where the sentence is of short duration. In the present case the sentence is of two years and the disposal of the appeal in question normally takes time. In that circumstances the High Court Division ought to have exercised judicial discretion in the matter of granting bail to the appellants. The judicial discretion having not been properly exercised in the facts of the case the order is set aside and the appeal allowed.<br/><strong><em>Dhanu Mia Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 119.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Bail Matter—</strong><br/>Interim ball granted by the Appellate Division during pendency of a criminal revision case in the High Court Division against trial Court’s order of conviction and sentence of three years RI under sections 325/34, Penal Code—Interim bail not to be allowed to continue for indefinite period when the sentence of imprisonment is hanging—interim bail allowed to continue further on specific terms.<br/><strong><em>Nizamuddin Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 183.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Bail Matter—</strong><br/>Ad interim bail granted by the Appellate Division during the pendency of a criminal appeal in the High Court Division against an order of conviction and sentence of five year’s RI with fine under section 304 Penal Code—Ad—interim bail cannot be allowed to continue simply because an appeal against conviction is pending in the High Court Division—Interim bail to continue further on specific terms only.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Hakim Howlader Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 178.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Banker—</strong><br/>The word “Banker” in section 409 Penal Code has not been used in the technical sense of the Banking Companies Act—it signifies any person who discharges any of the functions of the customary business’ of banking and would also include a firm or company that carries on such business.<br/><strong><em>Mustafizur Rahman Vs. State 45 DLR 227.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Benefit of Appeal—</strong><br/>When the Court sets aside the entire prosecution case on the benefit of doubt against appellants the non appealing accused is also entitled to the benefit of doubt.<br/><strong><em>Ator Ali Vs. State 44 DLR 478.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Bias—</strong><br/>Bias patent on the part of the Magistrate—High Court Division under Criminal Revisional Jurisdiction has found it appropriate to interfere with the impugned order of discharge under section 119 CrPC—The opposite parties were ordered to be bound down to keep peace without sending the case back on remand.<br/><strong><em>Sultan Ahmed Vs Golam Mostafa  41 DLR 219.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Bias—</strong><br/>The question of admissibility or non—admissibility of evidence should be left to be agitated when the case is argued. Merely because a Court acted illegally in allowing some evidence to go into the record or disallowing some evidence as irrelevant or took a wrong view of the law in passing an order would not by itself be a ground for bias, In the present case the order refusing to grant adjournment having been passed by the Special Tribunal not in violation of any mandatory provisions of law but in exercise of his discretionary power, could not itself give rise to a ground for transfer as no prejudice could be shown to have been caused to the accused.<br/><strong><em>Hussain Mohammad Ershad Vs. State 43 DLR 347.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Circumstantial Evidence—</strong><br/>In a case based on circumstantial evidence before hypothesis of guilt is 4rawn up on circumstances, the legal requirement is to prove the circumstances themselves like any other fact beyond reasonable doubt.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Arman Ali 42 DLR (AD) 50.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Circumstantial Evidence—</strong><br/>Confession leading to the recovery of dead bodies receives ample corroboration from independent circumstantial evidence such as the presence of a nylon rope on the necks of the dead bodies as confessed—Participation in the commission of murder established.<br/><strong><em>Hazrat Ali &amp; Abdur Rahman Vs. State 42 DLR 177.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Civil Action—</strong><br/>Acquittal in a criminal case does not stand in the way to seek remedy by civil action.<br/><strong><em>Abu Bakar Siddique Vs. Kafiluddin 44 DLR (AD) 314.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Contempt matter—</strong><br/>A contempt matter is in the nature of a criminal proceeding—The person proceeded against stands in the position of an accused. The allegation of contempt must be proved by the prosecution and in the case of any doubt its benefit shall go to the contemner. If no evidence is led the allegation must fail except in a case of contempt proceeding where the offence is committed in the very presence of the Judge.<br/><strong><em>Fazlur Rahman Molla Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR (AD) 194.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Contempt of Court—</strong><br/>Court’s order dated 5.4.89 received on 6.4.89 during lock—up hours—There is nothing in Jail Code preventing a release of the detenu on Friday 7.4.89—The contemners overstepped the boundaries of the Ministry of Home Affairs Memo date 7.2.87 as they have no business of waiting for a further telephone call on Saturday after they informed the Ministry of the impending release of the detenus. Comtemners disobeyed the order of the Court instead of acting in aid of the Court in releasing the detenus—Contemners are guilty of contempt of Court and accordingly convicted.<br/><strong><em>AK Banik &amp; Khokan Kumar Saha Vs. M Karim Jailor, Dhaka 42 DLR 122.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Corroboration—</strong><br/>In a case where bitter enmity is admitted between the parties it is required as a rule of prudence that there should be some such corroboration of the evidence of the interested witness as may inspire confidence in the mind of the court.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Mannan and others Vs. State 44 DLR (AD) 60.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Counter case—</strong><br/>counter case, what it is—the case which arose out of the same occurrence or when the time, place and manner of occurrence are the same and similar and the witnesses of one case are the accused in another case and vice versa it could be said that one case is the counter case of another.<br/>On a careful scrutiny of both the cases and the charge sheet and other materials on record we find it difficult to say at the moment that the two cases are distinctly separated and one is not at all connected with the other so far the time of occurrence, place of occurrence, and the accused and witnesses are concerned. Since it is found that over the occurrence there are two conflicting versions of the respective parties the learned Sessions Judge seemed to have committed no illegality or even irregularity in holding that one case is the counter case of another and in that view of the matter passing the order for withdrawal of the case from the Metropolitan Magistrate to his own court for the purpose of sending it to the court for holding simultaneous trial.<br/><strong><em>Lufar Rahman Vs. Mosammat Aleya Begum 45 DLR 57.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Court’s Observations—</strong><br/>State seeking extinction of observations made in the judgment of the High Court Division as they are totally irrelevant and unnecessary for disposal of the appeal before the Court and they are derogatory to the entire criminal legal system of the country. On perusal of the judgment, particularly the impugned observations, it is found that they are irrelevant and totally unnecessary for the purpose of disposal of the appeal. The offending observations are treated as expugned.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Abdul Mannan 44 DLR (AD) 173.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Criminal Matter—</strong><br/>Criminal proceeding— Pendency of civil case—It was not a good ground to refuse retrial of a criminal case due to pendency of civil suits. Result of a criminal case does not affect a civil Suit fl which the court is free to come to its own finding independently of the result of a criminal case.<br/><strong><em>Nagendra Chandra Sarker Vs. Aftabuddin 44 DLR (AD) 355.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Defence case—</strong><br/>When defence case fits in human nature and conduct the same should be considered more probable than the prosecution case.<br/><strong><em>Ator Ali Vs. State 44 DLR 478.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Delay—</strong><br/>Introducing PWs at a subsequent stage—Inordinate delay in examining important prosecution witnesses casts a serious doubt as to the truth of the prosecution case and in such circumstances their evidence is to be left out of consideration.<br/><strong><em>Sanwar Hossain Vs. State 45 DLR 489.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>“Extenuating circumstance”—</strong><br/>what constitutes “extenuating circumstance” is not capable of any precise formulation which may be judicially determined in the facts of each particular case—grave and sudden provocation has sometimes been considered as an extenuating circumstance.<br/><strong><em>Abed Ali Vs. State 42 DLR (AD). 171.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Forgery—</strong><br/>The offence of forgery by its very definition consists of an act and its consequence and these together constitute the offence.<br/><strong><em>Sree Jagenath Chandra Bakshi Vs. State 42 DLR 238.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Fraud—</strong><br/>A wider meaning was given in several Indian and Foreign jurisdictions. Jahangir Hasan Vs. State 40 DLR 545.<br/> <br/><strong>“Fugitive from law”—</strong><br/>The appellants submitted themselves to the sentence passed and obtained an interim order of bail in their favour albeit wrongly. In the facts of the case it will be less than charitable to attribute to the appellants that they were “fugitive from law”.<br/><strong><em>Saidur Rahman Vs. Stare 40 DLR (AD) 281.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Injunction—</strong><br/>Order of—An order of injunction presupposes the possession of the person in whose favour the order has been made and any determination of the question of possession without reference to the order of the Civil Court would be clearly untenable and unacceptable so long the order of the Civil Court is in force. Relied on 1988 BLD (AD) 157=41 DLR (AD) 129.<br/><strong><em>Chand Mia Vs. The State 42 DLR (AD) 3.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Joinder of offences—</strong><br/>Joinder of scheduled and non—scheduled offences—Whether the trial was vitiated by such joinder—If a non—scheduled offence is included in the trial of a scheduled offence the trial does not necessarily become void or without jurisdiction but a question may be raised as to whether the accused was prejudiced by such joinder and in a particular case there may be necessity to set aside such a trial and direct a trial afresh.<br/><u>Per Shahabuddin Ahmed CJ (agreeing):</u> Smuggling particularly of gold has been defined in the Special Powers Act and this definition is exactly the same as that of smuggling under section 156(8) of the Customs Act. The offence is one and same. Therefore there is no question of joinder or misjoinder of charges. Though it has been made punishable under both the laws, but to try this offence exclusive jurisdiction has been given only to the Tribunal under the Special Powers Act, and as such, jurisdiction of an ordinary court, such as a Magistrate, to try the offence under ordinary law stands ousted. The respondent was rightly charged by the Tribunal under section 25B of the said Act and after trial he was rightly convicted under section 25B of the Act. The addition of the words “read with section 156(8)” in the charge is superfluous and totally unnecessary. This addition has not affected the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to try the offence.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. MM Rafiqul Hyder 45 DLR (AD) 13.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Joint action—</strong><br/>Omission may also render an offender liable for punishment—If a man joins with another to assault a person, even though the original intention was merely to inflict relatively harmless injuries, but if he sees his companions in course of the action giving serious beating which is likely to cause his death, but he does not take any step to interfere and the victim dies, such omission may render him liable under section 304.<br/><strong><em>Shaikh Baharul Islam Vs. State 43 DLR 336.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Judicial decorum—</strong><br/>The court does not approve of the manner and language in which judges (of the Division Bench) had expressed themselves against a brother Judge of the same court. The innuendoes against (bail) petitioner are tendentious against a Judge and apt to bring the court itself, to which the judges (of the Division Bench) themselves belong, into disrepute. Extreme disapproval is expressed over the lack of restraint and sobriety which marks the offending paragraph.<br/><strong><em>MA Wahab Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 223.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>“Licensee’ and “Lessee’—</strong><br/>A Licensee has no right, title or interest in the property save and except the right to use the same on behalf of the real owner, but a lessee has a right in the property and such right is heritable also. A licensee is only a user of the right of the real owner, whereas a lessee acquires a right in rem in the property itself.<br/><strong><em>Abul Hassnat Vs. Ershad Ali Beg 42 DLR 244.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Malafide—</strong><br/>In order to establish malafide on the part of public functionaries malafide must be conclusively established and cannot be readily inferred.<br/>Several notices under the signature of the Secretary of the Dhaka University Discipline Board were dispatched to the petitioner directly to show cause against the proposed penalty or expulsion from Dhaka University which shows absence of malice on the part of the authority— Plea of malafide raised by the petitioner is not acceptable.<br/><strong><em>Farzana Haque Vs. University of Dhaka 42 DLR 262.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Malice in law—</strong><br/>Malice in law means wrongful act done intentionally without just cause or excuse and may also mean conscious violation of law to the prejudice of another.<br/><strong><em>Serajul Islam Vs. DG Food 43 DLR 237.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Oral Evidence—</strong><br/>Oral evidence of PW 4 contradictory to the confessional statement— This discrepancy arising out of the confessional statement and the main prosecution evidence not noticed by High Court Division—This is another infirmity in the conclusion of the HC Division. Since the recovery of the sandal and the dagger have been found not to have been proved beyond all doubt, the prosecution case which rests on only oral evidence cannot be relied on for sustaining the conviction.<br/><strong><em>Mizazul Islam Vs. State 41 DLR (AD) 157.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Passport— </strong><br/>A passport is a complementary part of its holder. It is needed to make a citizen complete outside his territory. It is not only a pass for any port, but also a part of its holder. Without it the right of locomotion abroad is a negation. A passport as such is more than a property to a citizen because without passport one cannot move an inch whenever he is outside the country. In the absence of the passport a person in an alien territory is a crippled person.<br/><strong><em>Syed Mokbul Hossain Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 39.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Possession—</strong><br/>Established principle as to possession of land delivered by a civil Court— if the possession has been delivered by a civil Court in execution of a decree or regulated by injunction, then it must be presumed that the person to whom possession has been delivered is in possession unless evidence is led to the contrary.<br/><strong><em>Chand Mia Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 3.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Principle of admission by non—traverse— </strong><br/>Applicability of—The age of the kidnapper not having been challenged the principle of admission by non—traverse will apply.<br/><strong><em>Krishna Pada Dutta Vs. Bangladesh 42 DLR 297.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Private defence—</strong><br/>It is not correct that the right of private defence cannot be raised if it was not put forward at the time of cross—examination of witnesses—a certain plea which was not put forward at the time when evidence of cross—examination was recorded does not prevent the Court from accepting it, if the plea received support from the prosecution evidence.<br/><strong><em>Fulu Mohammad Vs. State 44 DLR 431.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Promissory Estoppel—</strong><br/>Had there been any assurance as claimed that the Government would fulfil the demand of the hunger strikers even then the plea of promissory estoppel could not be invoked because it is a settled principle that where a statute imposes a duty of a positive kind, not avoidable by the performance of any formality, for the doing of the very act which the party suing seeks to do, it is not open to the opposite party to setup an estoppel to prevent it. A promise cannot supersede a statutory duty of a public authority.<br/><strong><em>ABM Quabil Ahmed Vs. Ministry of Health 44 DLR 385.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Promissory Estoppel—</strong><br/>Applicability of the principle against Government—Whether Government would be bound by the acts of its officers acting beyond the scope of their authority—On facts it has conclusively been proved that the land underneath M/s Drums Metals Limited belongs to the Ministry of Defence. The agreement executed by the Ministry of Industry for sale of the land to the petitioner cannot bind the Government on the doctrine of promissory estoppel, more so, when the petitioner had the knowledge that the land belonged to the Ministry of Defence.<br/><strong><em>National Engineers Ltd., a Private Limited Company Vs. Director, Military Lands and Cantonment Directorate and others 44 DLR 144.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Quantum of Sentence—</strong><br/>When law does not provide for imposition of minimum sentence of imprisonment and discretion is left with the court, it is for the court to decide the quantum of sentence in consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case and interest of justice.<br/><strong><em>AMA Wajedul Islam Vs. State 45 DLR 243.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Released—</strong><br/>Released on bail —Discharged— Acquitted—Convicted— Reading the Code as a whole it appears that in relation to an accused petitioner several terminologies have been used in the Code denoting different connotations. Each of these words has separate meanings and each word is attended with different consequences.<br/><strong><em>Niamat Ali Sheikh Vs. Be gum Enayetur Noor 42 DLR (AD) 250.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Re-trial—</strong><br/>Retrial is to be allowed to give the prosecution reasonable opportunity to prove its case— It is true ordinarily retrial should not be directed as it gives a chance to the prosecution to fill up the lacunae of its case, if any, but in a case where in spite of the best efforts two material witnesses could not be produced, justice demands that reasonable opportunity should be given to the prosecution to prove its case.<br/><strong><em>Harun Sarker Vs. State 45 DLR 49.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Re-trial—</strong><br/>When retrial cannot be ignored—The alleged offence is a serious one affecting the pecuniary interest of the country. So the accused cannot be allowed to go scot free merely because of a technical mistake. Of course, the sentence suffered by the accused should not be ignored if he be at all found guilty on fresh trial.<br/><strong><em>Mozammel Huq Vs. State 43 DLR 614.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Re-trial—</strong><br/>General rule—As a general rule an order for retrial would be proper where the trial in the original trial Court has been vitiated by illegality, irregularity or otherwise defective or when original trial has been unsatisfactory for any particular reason, etc.<br/><strong><em>Md. Moslehuddin Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 160.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Re-trial—</strong><br/>No retrial of the condemned prisoner could be allowed for abetting the offence especially when his unknown accomplices have been set free by the Sessions Judge.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Sree Ranjit Kumar Pramanik 45 DLR 660.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Revenue Court—</strong><br/>Revenue officer dealing in mutation of the name in the record of rights is Revenue Court.<br/><strong><em>Ajit Kumar Sarkar Vs. Radiia Kanta Sarkar 44 DLR 533.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Rules of Police Regulation Manual— </strong><br/>Accused facing trial on capital charge— Entitled to be defended by a lawyer even if the trial is held in absentia—Court’s responsibility to appoint a lawyer to defend—Section 339B CrPC does not come in conflict with the Rule of PR Manual— Cardinal principle of criminal administration of justice stated.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Jahaur Ali 42 DLR 94.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Suicide—</strong><br/>Value of a farewell letter written by the deceased in coming to decision in a criminal trial over a murder charge—The letter of the deceased written before her death indicating that she was going to commit suicide and other attending circumstances when considered in the light of NJ Modi’s comment that the finding of a general farewell letter is strongly presumptive of suicide, the defence version that it was no case of homicide but a case of suicide cannot be brushed aside.<br/><strong><em>Tariq Habibullah Vs. State 43 DLR 440.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Superior Court Tradition—</strong><br/>Narrating facts of the case—Judges are to digest the materials and summarise them in the judgment. We record our strong disapproval of the manner in which the learned Judges of the High Court Division described the prosecution case in the two complaint cases. They have quoted in full the petitions of complaint in Bengali. The superior Courts of this country have a tradition of narrating facts of the case in their own language, summarising them as concisely as possible. Vernacular materials are translated into the language in which the judgment is written. Same is the case with the narration of FIR, charge—sheet, (where necessary) deposition of witnesses, etc. The learned Judges are required to digest these materials and to summarise or paraphrase relevant and essential portions thereof in as short, succinct, concise and factual manner as possible. Lest it develops into an infectious practice we like to nip this unhealthy trend in the bud.<br/><strong><em>Abdur Rahim Vs. Enamul Huq 43 DLR (AD) 173.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Trap case—</strong><br/>Because of tough requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt the laying of trap is the only method for detecting crimes like bribery which are committed in covert manner. Such a method is not prohibited. For laying a trap the investigating officer cannot be said to be thereby instigating commission of the offence. Principles of accomplice evidence cannot be extended to the evidence of trap witness, because the latter cannot be termed as accomplice. As to corroboration of trap witnesses no hard and fast rule can be given. There may be cases where the Court will look for independent corroboration. Equally there may be cases where the Court may accept evidence of trap witnesses.<br/><strong><em>Shahabullah Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 1.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Written Constitution—</strong><br/>In a written constitution the Parliament’s right to making legislation is limited by the Constitution. This limited sovereignty of the Parliament in making laws is an essential feature of the working of the Government under a written Constitution.<br/><strong><em>Abdus Samad Azad Vs.
