Ali Ahmed Vs. Secretary, Home Affairs 40 DLR (AD) 170.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 16(1) and 19(1)—</strong><br/>The  Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Shariatpur had no jurisdiction whatsoever to cancel the license s of the guns in question under section 18(a) of the Arms Act or under any provision of the Arms Rules of 1924. As the license s of the guns in question were not cancelled by any legally competent authority such as the District Magistrate or by any authorised officer to whom he is subordinate as required under the provisions of Arms Act or the Arms rules, cancellation thereof by the SDO is illegal. Conviction under sections 16(1) and 19(1) of the Arms Act read with section 26 of the Special Powers Act is not sustainable in law.<br/><strong><em>Anawar  Hossains.
