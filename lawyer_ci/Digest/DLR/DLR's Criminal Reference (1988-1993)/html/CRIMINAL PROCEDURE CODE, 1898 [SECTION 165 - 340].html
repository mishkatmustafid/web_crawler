Shah Alam &amp; others 41 DLR 180.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong><em>Sections 195 &amp; 476—</em></strong><br/>Section 476 is not independent of section 195 of the Code— Section 476 does not abridge or extend the scope of section 195(b) or (c).<br/><strong><em>Abdul Hai Khan Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 226.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong><em>Section 195(1)(b)—</em></strong><br/>Proceeding in Court—In view of the decision that a Magistrate acts in his judicial capacity while discharging an accused on the basis of a final report by the Police and the reasoning in the majority judgment in 1979 AIR (SC) 777, the offence under section 211 Penal Code was committed in relation to a proceeding in Court and as such the bar under section 195(1)(b) is attracted.<br/><strong><em>Serajuddowla Vs. Abdul Kader 45 DLR (AD) 101.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong><em>Section 195(1)(b)—</em></strong><br/>Complaint of Court— Requirement—When the Magistrate considered the prayer of the Investigating Officer that the appellant be prosecuted for making a false charge and the prosecution report upon which cognizance was taken shows that the same was filed as directed by the Magistrate, it is clear that the prosecution of the appellant was sanctioned by the Magistrate himself and as such it could not be said that the cognizance was taken in violation of section 195(1)(b).<br/><strong><em>Serajuddowla Vs.

State 40 DLR (AD) 226.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong><em>Section l95 (1)(c)—</em></strong><br/>Legislature did not intend any anomalous situation that might arise if the trial of one offence may be made dependent upon a possible complaint by the Court while the other offence is tried upon a private complaint.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Hai Khan Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 226.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong><em>Section 195(1)(c)—</em></strong><br/>Jurisdiction of a criminal Court when barred.

The instant proceeding initiated by the complaintant opposite party is a bar under section 195(1) (c) CrPC and the courts concerned only have sole jurisdiction to make a complaint in the interest of justice.<br/><strong><em>Ajit Kumar Sarkar Vs Radhà Kanta Sarkar 44 DLR 533.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong><em>Section 195(1)(c)—</em></strong><br/>Prosecution for 4 document given in evidence—From a persusal of the provision of law it appears t words “documents produced or — evidence” contemplate the original documents alleged to be forged and not a certified copy of the same. If the document in question is not produced in Court, but a certified copy of same is produced, no complaint from the c is necessary for prosecution of the alleged offenders. In view of the decision in the of Sanmukhsingh and others Vs. King Air 1950 (PC) 31 the absence of complaint can stand as a bar to the trial of the accused petitioner in the present case for forgery relating to the sale deed produced in Court in the earlier SCC suit.<br/><strong><em>Shambhu Nath Saha and others.

State 40 DLR (AD) 226.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong><em>Sections 195(1)(c) and 476—</em></strong><br/>Restricted application of clause (c) to be discarded—I am, therefore, inclined to think that reading ci. (c) with section 476 of the Code, there does not seem to be any compelling reason to restrict the application of the said clause limiting the control of the court only to few offences committed (pendente lite) as would be the practical result of such interpretation. The clause will be applicable even when the offence alleged is committed by the party to proceeding in any Court before becoming such party if it is produced or given in evidence in such proceeding.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Hye Khan Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 226.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong><em>Sections 195(l)(a),(b),(c) and 476—</em></strong><br/> There is specified procedure and method for filing complaint by a Court in respect of offences described in clauses (a) and (b) but there is no such specified procedure for offences in clause (c) of section 195 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Hye Khan Vs.

Yakub Sardar and others 40 DLR (AD) 246</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong><em>Sections 200 &amp; 561A—</em></strong><br/>The purpose of examination of the complainant under section 200 CrPC is to see whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding and not whether there is sufficient ground for conviction. Whether the evidence is adequate for supporting conviction can only be determined at the trial and not at the stage of enquiry. Allegations made in the petition of complaint having made out a prima facie case of cheating against the accused—appellant, it is not a fit case to quash the proceeding at the present stage.<br/><strong><em>SA Sultan Vs. State 44 DLR (AD) 139.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong><em>Sections 202(1), (2A)—</em></strong><br/>Under section 202(1) and proviso to section 202(2A) of the Code of Criminal Procedure in a case exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions, a Magistrate for the purpose of ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the complaint is to consider the evidence in order to find whether prima facie case is made out or not, but he cannot assess the evidence as if in trial.<br/><strong><em>Syed Ahmed Vs.

Yakub Sardar 40 DLR (AD) 246.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong><em>Sections 204(3), 435 and 436—</em></strong><br/> Provisions under which Courts are competent to direct the Magistrate.<br/>The Sessions Judge and, for that purpose, the District Magistrate, Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and the High Court Division, got power under section 435 CrPC to call for the record of any case pending before any Magistrate and direct the Magistrate under section 436 to make further enquiry into any complaint which has been dismissed under section 203 or sub-section (3) of section 204 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Bangladesh Vs.

Ratio decidendi in 1925 AIR (All) 223 approved. We are in respectful agreement with the ratio decidendi reported in 1925 AIR (All) 223. It is well—settled that the evidence that a witness gives in the witness box is the  substantive evidence and it is always desirable that the witness should be able to identify the accused persons in dock when there was a previous TI Parade, but owing to lapse of time and other compelling reasons it may not possible for the witness to identify the accused persons in dock.<br/><strong><em>Ratan Khan Vs.

This section of the Code provides that a person who earlier accepted  the pardon may be the offence in respect of which the pardon was tendered, if the Public Prosecutor certifies that in his opinion the person has either wilfully concealed anything essential or had given false evidence and has not complied with the condition on which the tender was made. This implies that the whole basis for the prosecution of a person to whom pardon has been tendered under section 337 or 338 of the Code for the offence in respect of which the pardon was tendered is a certificate by the Public Prosecutor that in his opinion the person who has accepted the pardon has either wilfully concealed anything essential or had given false evidences and has not complied with the condition on which the tender was made.<br/><strong><em>Angur Vs.

Here in the present case before us the prosecutor who conducted the earlier sessions case in the 4th Court of Assistant Sessions Judge, Mymensingh has not issued any certificate as required under sub-section (1) of section 339 CrPC and there is also no finding that the approver has broken the condition on which the pardon was tendered which is sine qua non for prosecuting an approver. In that view of the matter we are of the view that section 537 has no manner of application in this case.<br/><strong><em>Angur Vs.

From the materials on record it is also found that this appellant was produced before the Court on 4.6.78 for the first time and thereafter was produced in Court on various occasions before the holding of the TI Parade on 11.6.79 and definitely therefore, it was possible for the witnesses like PW 3 Joynal see the appellant in Court. In such circumstances of the case the identification by PW3 in the’ TI Parade is found to be quite Unreliable and without any significance.<br/>Furthermore, the Magistrate who conducted the TI Parade has not been examined during the trial. There is no material before the Court to find definitely that the TI parade was conducted legally and after observing legal formalities. In view, of the above it is found that the identification of appellant Angur by PW 3 Joynal is very much unreliable and the appellant is entitled to the benefit of doubt.<br/><strong><em>Angur Vs.

The learned: Assistant Sessions Judge on the basis of this petition directed for framing charge against the appellant.

It is desirable in the interest of administration of justice that witnesses be summoned on a day when the Court is in a position to examine them. No adjournment at the instance of any party should be allowed causing inconvenience to witnesses.

So, the days when the learned Sessions Judge was on leave and outside the stations should not be regarded as “Working days” of the learned Sessions Judge. The court is of the opinion that these days should be excluded while computing the time required for disposal of the sessions case.

The impugned order of the learned Sessions Judge convicting and sentencing condemned prisoner Hanif and convict Waliar to death under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code is set aside and they are directed to be tried of the charge already framed.
