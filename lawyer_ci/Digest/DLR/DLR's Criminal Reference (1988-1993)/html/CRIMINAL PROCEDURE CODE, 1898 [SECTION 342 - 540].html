<h2 class="blog_entry-title">Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 [Section 342 - 540]</h2><div class="entry-content"><div class="entry-content"><div style="text-align: center;"><br/><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Criminal Procedure Code, 1898</strong><br/><strong>[V of 1898]</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>Appellant’s attention having been not drawn to the confessional statement, the confessional statement cannot be used against him.<br/>While examining this appellant under section 342 of the Code the trial Court has also not drawn the attention of appellant to the confessional statement made by him. In such circumstances also the confessional statement cannot be used against the appellant. The trial Court also should not state anything regarding any incriminating evidence against the appellant under section 342 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Angur Vs.State 41 DLR 66.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>There being nothing on record to show that the main aspects of the confessional statement of the accused was brought to his notice he was certainly prejudiced and as such the statement could not be used against him.<br/><strong><em>Kabir and others Vs. State 45 DLR 755.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>The accused appellant was asked questions during statement under section 342 CrPC with the preconceived notion that he was already found guilty under sections 395/397 of the Penal Code. This type of questions being against all norms of procedure of criminal jurisprudence are highly prejudicial to the accused.<br/><strong><em>Abu Taleb Vs. State 41 DLR 239.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>No question relating to bloodstained cloth or injury in the hand was put to the condemned—prisoner. This circumstance has no basis to base conviction.<br/>It is surprising that though some of the PWs alleged to have seen the said bloodstained shirt, no attempt was made even by the police to seize the same and also to examine the said blood by any chemical examiner. Further, in the examination under section 342 CrPC no question relating to such blood—stained cloth or injury in the hand was put to the condemned— prisoner. So, this circumstance has no basis and the same has not been established at all by any reliable evidence.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Badsha Mollah 41 DLR 11.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/> Provisions of section 342 having not been followed strictly, Ext. 5, the confessional statement, was wrongly relied upon.<br/>Since the officer who conducted the test identification parade was not examined by the prosecution, the test identification report is not admissible in evidence.<br/>So far as accused appellant Amir Hossain is concerned since his confessional statement has not been mentioned in his examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he cannot be convicted relying upon his confessional statement.<br/>Since the prosecution can neither rely upon his confessional statement nor take advantage of the evidence of identifying witnesses there is no other legal evidence against accused Amir Hossain to sustain his conviction under sections 395/397 of the Penal Code.<br/><strong><em>Amir Hossain Vs. State 41 DLR 32.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>A statement of the accused under section 342 CrPC is meant for giving him an opportunity to explain the circumstances appearing against him in the evidence adduced by the prosecution—This is entirely for the benefit of the accused and the accused only—This statement cannot be used by the Court against him, nor is the prosecution permitted to use it to fill up any gap left in the prosecution evidence. Relied on (1923) ILR Lah 50.<br/><strong><em>Shah Alam Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 31.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>One of important items for linking up the accused with the crime, namely the sandal, was not at all put to the accused as a circumstance appearing in the case against him while he was examined under section 342 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Mirazul Islam Vs. State 41 DLR (AD)157.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>The trial Court failed to take into consideration along with evidence on record the accused’s written reply giving vivid description of the highhandedness of BDR personnel in support of their defence that they were implicated in the case at the instance of their rival businesses men.<br/><strong><em>Subodh Ranjan Vs. State 45 DLR 521.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>Prsence at the place and time of murder—reasonable doubt as to guilt—In his examination under section 342 CrPC, though all the evidence against him were brought to his notice to prove the charge of murder, accused Kashem did not explain away his presence with co—accused Abbas at the place and time of the murder to raise doubt in the mind of the Court about his guilt, not to speak of raising any reasonable doubt.<br/><strong><em>Abul Kashem Vs. State 42 DLR 378.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>Allegation of torture made in statement recorded under section 342 CrPC—No reliance can be placed on the belated allegation of torture by police in obtaining confession in the absence of materials on record to substantiate the same.<br/><strong><em>Hazrat Ali &amp; Abdur Rahman Vs. State 42 DLR 177.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>Conviction of co—accused who has not confessed—Circumstances show the accused Shahjahan Manik had Intimacy with accused Rina and this put them on visiting terms and the visits had strengthened his intimacy with Rina. Their guilty conscience is also evident from the false plea in their statements made under section 342 CrPC that not know each other.<br/><strong><em>Shahjahan Manik State 42 DLR 465.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>The provision of this section is meant for giving the accused an opportunity to explain the circumstances appearing against him. There is no merit in the contention that the appellate Court acted illegally in relying on his statement under section 342.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Karim Vs. Shamsul Alam 45 DLR 578.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 342—</strong><br/>Omission to examine the accused under this section is not curable under section 537. After the prosecution closes its evidence the court shall examine the accused and ask them whether they will adduce any evidence in defence. Omission to do so vitiates the conviction if such omission has prejudiced the accused in their defence. The conviction is set aside and it is directed that the accused be examined under section 342 CrPC by the trial Court and thereupon the case be disposed of according to law.<br/><strong><em>A. Gafur Vs. Jogesh Chandra Roy 43 DLR (AD) 62.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 342 &amp; 537—</strong><br/>Omission of charge as to common intention—Non—mentioning of section 34, Penal Code during his examination under section 342 CrPC has not in any manner prejudiced the accused in their defence. It is a mere irregularity which is curable and there has been no failure of justice for such non—mentioning.<br/><strong><em>Abul Kashem Vs. State 42 DLR 378.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344—</strong><br/>Stay of proceeding—In the facts of the case as in point of time the civil suit was instituted before the filing of the FIR and the questioned documents in their originals are yet to be produced and examined by the civil Court. The criminal proceeding, where the documents are claimed as forged, may, in the interest of justice, be stayed till the disposal of the civil suit.<br/><strong><em>Zakir Hossain and others Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 102.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344—</strong><br/>Refusal of prayer for ad-interim stay while issuing Rule in criminal revision—When appellant clearly stated before the High Court Division while obtaining the Rule that she gave birth to a child just five months ago and it would be injurious to her health as also to the baby if both were to be placed under any type of custody at that critical stage it was not a judicious and sound exercise of discretion to refuse the said stay.<br/><strong><em>Azima Begum Vs. Yusif Khan 43 DLR (AD) 53.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344—</strong><br/>Prayer for stay of judgment in criminal case on the ground of pendency of civil suit—Section 344 CrPC authorizes the Court to adjourn a trial. That a judgment in a criminal court is pronounced “after the termination of the ia1” is provided in section 366 CrPC. Therefore, the prayer for stay of delivery of judgment under section 344 was misconceived.<br/><strong><em>Hussain Mohammad Ershad Vs. State 44 DLR (AD) 145.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344—</strong><br/>Power to postpone proceedings—Applicability of such power to postpone judgment in a criminal case pending disposal of a civil suit—The application under section 344 CrPC had been moved at a belated stage after the evidence was closed and the trial came to an end. Only because the judgment remains to be delivered, the application does not appear to be one as contemplated under section 344. In fact the petitioner knew of this and prayed for adjournment of the judgment, not of the triaL The application at this stage does not appear to be maintainable.<br/><strong><em>Hussain Mohammad Ershad Vs. State 44 DLR 116.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 344—</strong><br/>Stay of criminal proceedings—Remand—A case and counter case over the self—same occurrence are to be tried by the same Court one after another. The judgment in both the cases is to be pronounced on the same date by the same Magistrate so that there is no conflicting decision and the parties are not prejudiced. The impugned judgment and onler is set aside and the case remanded back to the Magistrate with direction to try CR Case No. 155 of 1989 and CR case No. 152 of 1989by the same Magistrate giving opportunity to the parties to adduce their evidence and keeping the evidence already recorded in Cr Case No. 155 of 1989 intact.<br/><strong><em>Sharif Vs. Md. Obaidur Rahman 43 DLR 66.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 367—</strong><br/>There has not been any miscarriage of justice caused by non compliance with the provisions of section 367 CrPC while acquitting the accused persons by — the Magistrate though his judgment was not in proper form.<br/><strong><em>Nurul Huda Vs. Bhashanu Sardar 40 DLR (AD) 256.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 367—</strong><br/>Judgment—Writing of a proper judgment—If the trial Court’s judgment is such that it cannot be termed as a judgment as per requirement of this section, then an order of writing a proper judgment may be necessary—When the entire matter is open to the criminal Appellate Court which is— required by law to assess the evidence. Independently and come to its finding, then merely because there has been some omission made by the Trial Court in not considering &amp; piece or pieces of evidence, would hardly offer a valid ground for sending the case on remand for a proper judgment.<br/><strong><em>Md. Moslehuddin Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 160.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 367—</strong><br/>Remand—As a general rule an order for retrial would be proper if the trial in the lower Court was vitiated by illegality or irregularity or for, other reason.<br/><strong><em>Md. Moslehuddin Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 142.</em></strong><br/> <br/>Section 367 as amended by the Law Reforms Ordinance (XLIX of 1978), Section 2 and Schedule thereto read with the Penal Code (XLV of 1860), Section 302.<br/>Substitution of sub-section (5) of section 367 CrPC by the Law Reforms Ordinance— Effect of change on sentencing—Previously death sentence was the normal sentence for murder and the court was required to give reasons if the lesser sentence of life imprisonment was given—After the sub—situation now reasons have to be given in either case —A death sentence is to be justified in as much in the same way as in the case of lesser sentence of life term imprisonment.<br/><strong><em>Abed Ali Vs State DLR (AD) 171.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 367(1)—</strong><br/>Mere stating by the , Court that the appeal is dismissed on merit and  the order of conviction and sentence  is confirmed without considering the evidence on record and the cases of the parties cannot be said to be a judgment on merit.<br/><strong><em>Abul Basher Vs sate 40 DLR 248. </em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section367 (1)—</strong><br/>Section 367(1) relates to Criminal Court of original jurisdiction but the same has been made to apply to the Appellate the High Court Division by reasons of section 424 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Abul Basher Vs. State 40 DLR 248.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 369—</strong><br/>Review—Application praying for review of judgment passed .in a criminal case is totally contrary to the provisions of section 369.<br/><strong><em>Samad Ahmed Vs. State 45 DLR 394.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374—</strong><br/>Commutation of sentence— extenuating circumstances for commutation —condemned prisoners are under peril of death. Sentence for almost 3 years suffering agony and torments and thereby partially purged their guilt. Their life may be spared. Sentence of death commuted to one of imprisonment for life.<br/><strong><em>Abul Kashem Vs. State 42 DLR 378.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374—</strong><br/>Accused Rina is a young woman aged 24 with an infant and she confessed expressing repentance. Both the convicts suffered pangs of death sentence for about 3 1/2 years. There are extenuating circumstances for sparing them from the extreme punishment, of death.<br/><strong><em>Shahjahan Manik Vs. State 42 DLR 465.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374—</strong><br/>Commutation——Delay by itself is no extenuating circumstance for commuting the sentence. There must be other circumstances of a compelling nature which together with delay will, merit commutation.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Khair Vs. State 44 DLR (AD) 225.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 374—</strong><br/>Commutation of sentence— In the instant case there is an immediate voluntary confession. The accused could have taken a plea of innocence but being repentant he made rather an open breast of everything and may be asking for mercy of God. This aspect .of his character needs be kept in view and then the delay in hearing this reference had not been done by him but he had suffered the agony all these 6 years.<br/><strong><em>Abdur Rahman Syed Vs. State 44 DLR 556.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376—</strong><br/>Sentence—Commutation of death sentence—Delay of about two years or so in the disposal of the Death Reference cases and the Jail Appeal in the High Court Division, cannot by itself be a ground for awarding lesser sentence.<br/><strong><em>Abed Ali Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 171.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376—</strong><br/>There is nothing or record to show that there was (any real) love between the appellant and deceased Dilara. The appellant being not a jilted lover, it is difficult to commute the sentence of death to one of imprisonment for life.<br/>Further soon before the occurrence there was no provocation from the prosecution side and there was no occasion for the appellant to show any emotional imbalance and disequilibrium. On the contrary, the evidence on record shows that the appellant with a premeditated and pre—planned manner entered into the hut of the deceased with a dagger and killed her. The trial Court as also the High Court Division found no mitigating circumstances. Nor did we.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Quddus Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 234.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 376—</strong><br/>Death sentence, commutatation of—Death sentence not executed after more than four years from the date of confirmation of the sentence Appellant suffered a prolonged agony for laches of others. Death sentence commuted to one of life imprisonment.<br/><strong><em>Wajear Rahman Moral Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 25.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 401—</strong><br/>Empowers the Government to remit and suspend a sentence passed by a Court but for such remission and suspension of sentence the order of conviction is, not reversed. It remains in force, but the convict due to an order of remission and suspension passed under section 401 CrPC is not to serve out the period of sentence so suspended and is not to pay the fine so remitted.<br/><strong><em>Nasiruddin Miah Vs. State 40 DLR 244.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 401 and 423—</strong><br/>In case of an appeal from an order of acquittal, the Court may refuse the prayer of withdrawal of the appeal as it may find on hearing the appeal on merit that the order appealed is illegal and calls for an order of conviction.<br/><strong><em>Nasiruddjn Miah Vs. State 40 DLR 244.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 403—</strong><br/>Double Jeopardy—The accused is going to be prosecuted in respect of an offence which did not occur during the earlier transaction nor the present case arose out of the same fact and for the present o1fence he was not tried previously. In such a position the doctrine of autrefois acquits and autrefois convict or of the Code as to double jeopardy is not applicable in the present case.<br/><strong><em>HM Ershad Vs. State 45 DLR 534.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 403(2)—</strong><br/>Trial of an accused for one distinct offence will not stand in the way of his subsequent trial for the other distinct offence as specifically provided by sub-section (2) of section 403. The former trial for unauthorised possession of the firearms will not be a bar to the subsequent trial for the offence of robbery, even if the same firearms have been used while committing the robbery. The trial of the petitioners in this case is perfectly lawful.<br/><strong><em>Arfan Ali Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 22.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 408—</strong><br/>Appeal will lie to the Court of Sessions if the Assistant Sessions Judge deemed to be an Additional Sessions Judge passes a sentence of imprisonment for a term of five years or less. Section 408 has full force and application.<br/><strong><em>Nurul Huda Vs. Baharuddin 41 DLR 395.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 409—</strong><br/>An Assistant Sessions Judge deemed to be appointed as Additional Sessions judge has the limited power of passing higher sentences except a Death Sentence in those sessions cases which are now triable by him by deeming and treating him to be an Additional Sessions Judge, consequent upon changes brought. He shall not be deemed be an Additional Sessions Judge for all the under the Code, eg for hearing appeals revisions, references and reviews if they are  made over or transferred to him by the Judge. Under section 409 the session Judge can transfer the hearing of an appeal only to an Additional Sessions Judge and to  an Assistant Sessions Judge deemed been appointed as an Additional session Judge. The dismissal in the instant appeal by the Assistant Sessions Judge and refusal of interference by the High Court division are therefore illegal. The appeal against conviction is therefore allowed and it is directed that the Sessions Judge may himself dispose of the appeal or transfer it to an Additional Sessions Judge for disposal.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Kasham Vs. State 43 DLR (AD) 77.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 409, 410, 435, 436, 438 and 439A—</strong><br/>Under section 409 the Sessions Judge can transfer the hearing of an appeal only to an Additional Sessions Judge and not to an Assistant Sessions Judge. Section 410 has also full force and any person convicted on a trial held by a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge may appeal to the High Court Division. This section has no reference to an Assistant Sessions Judge deemed to have been appointed as an Additional Sessions Judge. The same applies to sections 435, 436, 438 and 439A.<br/><strong><em>Nurul Huda Vs. Baharuddin 41 DLR 395.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 410—</strong><br/>The High Court Division sitting in appeal was bound to give due weight to the opinion of the trial Court with regard to the credibility and demeanour of the witnesses.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Abdus Sattar 43 DLR (AD) 44.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 410—423 read with—Employment of Labour (Standing Orders) Act (VIII of 1965)—Section 26.</strong><br/>Order of sentence passed by the Labour Court under the provisions of Employment of Labour (Standing Orders) Act is not appealable to the appellate authority under the Code of Criminal Procedure as there is no provision for such appeal under the Employment of Labour (Standing Orders) Act.<br/><strong><em>Jagodish Chandra Dutta Vs. MH Azad 41 DLR 257.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417—</strong><br/>Review of evidence—The reason given by the Judges of the High Court Division to disregard the evidence of PWs 2, 3 &amp; 4 relying only upon the evidence of PW 7 is rather artificial. In an appeal by the State against acquittal it is quite open to the Court to review the evidence in order to see whether finding on which acquittal is based is perverse being in wanton disregard of good and unblemished evidence given by other witnesses.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Ashraf Ali 43 DLR (AD) 83.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417, 418 and 423—</strong><br/>Provisions under these sections give to the High Court Division full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal was founded—No limitation should be placed upon that power.<br/><strong><em>Shah Alam Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 31.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417 and 439(4)(5)—</strong><br/>Petitioner acquitted of the charge of dacoity by the trial Judge—Government had not preferred any appeal under section 417 CrPC—Section 439 CrPC does not authorise High Court Division to convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction. Held—the Rule issued suo motu by the High Court Division was without jurisdiction.<br/><strong><em>Jalal Uddin Vs. Mrs. Bilkis Rahman&amp; State 42 DLR 107.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417A—</strong><br/>Appeal by informatnt— Competency—The contention that an appeal at the instance of an informant from an inadequate sentence lies under section 417A has no substance. <br/><strong><em>Abdul Aziz Vs. State 44 DLR 594.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417A—</strong><br/>That all judgment, whether conviction or acquittal are appealable under section 30(1) Gf the Special Powers Act.Under sub-section (1) Of section 27, criminal cases coming within the ambit of the Special Powers Act can only be initiated on a report in writing made by a police officer not below the rank of Sub—Inspector So no private party has any right to initiate such cases. Section 30 seems to cover appeals by a State. Therefore this appeal is not maintainable under section 417(1) of CrPC.<br/><strong><em>State Vs. Wanur Rahman 40 DLR 346.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 417(1) (a)—</strong><br/>Maintainability of appeal by witness against order of acquittal— The State under section 417(1)(a) of the Code is authorised to present an appeal against an order of acquittal passed by the Court of Sessions. But in the present case, the appeal was not preferred by the State. The appeal was filed before the High Court Division by a witness who is also the petitioner in the present petition for leave to appeal. Hence this leave petition is not maintainable in law.<br/><strong><em>Fazar Ali alias Manik Chand Vs. Fazar Ali and others 43 DLR (AD) 129.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 423(1) (a) (b)—</strong><br/>A finding of acquittal can be converted into one of conviction only under clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 423 CrPC. The suo motu Rule is without jurisdiction.<br/><strong><em>Jalaluddin Vs. Mrs. Bilkis Rahman and State 42 DLR 107.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 423(1) (b)(2)—</strong><br/>Acquittal converted into conviction under section 423 CrPC—No interference in the absence of appeal against acquittal.<br/><strong><em>Mofizuddin Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 286</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 423(1)(b)(2)—</strong><br/>The Appellate Court has jurisdiction under section 423(1)(b) (2) of Code of the Criminal Procedure to reverse an order of acquittal purporting to ‘alter the finding” of conviction.<br/><strong><em>Mofizuddin Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 286.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 426—</strong><br/>Bail after conviction—The accused could obtain bail from the Appellate Court or from the High Court Division and not from the trial Court which became functus officio after the filing and disposal of appeal against conviction.<br/><strong><em>Dulal Vs. State 43 DLR 321.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 426—</strong><br/>Bail—Suspension of sentence pending appeal—Release of appellants on bail—Sentence being in excess of one year Sessions Judge was not competent to grant such bail.<br/><strong><em>Saidur Rahman Vs. State 40 DLR (AD) 281.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 426—</strong><br/>Bail—Condition for the bail is quite reasonable and can be complied with by the person seeking bail without any difficulty but payment of fine involving huge amount of money as a condition for bail may not be possible—Impugned order of payment of fine as a condition for the bail is not supportable either in law or on the principle of reasonableness.<br/><strong><em>Iqbal Vs. State 41 DLR (AD) 111</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 428—</strong><br/>Additional evidence— Section 428 may be resorted to when such evidence either was not available at the trial or the party concerned was prevented from producing it, either by circumstances beyond its control or by reason of misunderstanding or mistake.<br/><strong><em>Rajab Ali Zulfiqar Vs. State 45 DLR 705.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 432, 424 and 367(1)—</strong><br/>It is well— settled principle of law that for disposal of Criminal Appeal presence of an Advocate is not essential and the Appellate Court can dispose of the appeal on mere writing a judgment according to provisions of section 667(I) of CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Basher and others Vs. State 40 DLR 248.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 435—</strong><br/>Right of heirs of deceased complainant to proceed with the complainant’s case—The complainant in the criminal case under section 447 claimed ownership and possession of the land in question. On his death during the pendency of the revision case arising out of the matter his wife having stepped into his shoes so far as it relates to his properties, she is required to be brought on record to protect her interest in the land.<br/><strong><em>Dr. Md. Abdul Baten Vs. State 43 DLR 60.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435 and 436—</strong><br/>Sessions Judge called for records of the case triable under the provisions of the Special Powers Act from the Court of the Magistrate in exercise of his power under sections 435 and 436 CrPC and took cognizance of the offence after converting himself into a Special Tribunal—this is not contemplated by law.<br/><strong><em>Satya Ranjan Sarda Vs. State 42 DLR 142.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435 and 439—</strong><br/>Interpretation of Statute—The expression “if the accused is in confinement” in section 439 CrPC is used as a condition precedent to bail.<br/><strong><em>Abdus Samad Vs. State 41 DLR 291.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435 &amp; 439—</strong><br/>Revisional Power, scope of—Question whether the law laid down in section 5(l)(e) of the Act, 1947 and section 4 of the Anti—Corruption Act, 1957 is discriminatory and violative of the provisions of the Constitution is not within the scope of the present Rule to be determined.<br/><strong><em>HM Ershad Vs. State 45 DLR 533.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435 and 439—</strong><br/>To be released on bail a person must be in custody or in. some sort of confinement.<br/><strong><em>Abdus Samad Vs. State 41 DLR 291.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 435, 439 &amp; 561A—</strong><br/>Power under sections 439 and 561A is different in nature—Section 439 read with section 435 refers to inferior Court under High Court Division—Exercise of power under section 561A is not limited to the inferior Court only.<br/><strong><em>Jagodish Chandra Dutta Vs. MH Azad 41 DLR 257.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 436—</strong><br/>Sessions Judge’s power to order enquiry—The Sessions Judge commits no illegality in setting aside the order of discharge of the accused passed by the Magistrate and in directing the latter to send the case record to the Court of the Sessions Judge along with statements recorded by the police. The order is within the scope of section 436 CrPC. But the Sessions Judge’s further order giving direction to send the accused for trial being in excess of his jurisdiction cannot be sustained. The Magistrate is left with his absolute discretion in the matter of taking cognizance of the offence and sending the accused—petitioners to the Court of Sessions for trial after holding further enquiry according to law.<br/><strong><em>Motaleb Vs. State 43 DLR 519.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 436—</strong><br/>Sessions Judge’s power to order inquiry—The jurisdiction of the Sessions Judge is wide enough to direct further inquiry by a Magistrate. If the Sessions Judge directs to make further inquiry by the Magistrate by holding a judicial inquiry it is fully within the express power given to the Sessions Judge under section 436 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Farid Ahmed &amp; others Vs. State 44 DLR 30.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 436—</strong><br/>The Magistrate seemed to have acted within his jurisdiction to decide; on assessment of evidence on record, whether all or some of the accused are to be sent fr trial. The order of the Sessions Judge having the effect of directing the Magistrate to take cognizance of the 8 accused against whom the latter found no prima facie case is not within the scope of further inquiry contemplated under section 436 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Mohibar Rahman Vs.

When appellant clearly stated before High Court Division while obtaining the rule that she gave birth to a child just five ago and it would be injurious to her health as also to the baby if both were to be placed under any type of custody at that critical stage it was not a judicious and sound exercise of discretion to refuse the said stay.<br/><strong><em>Azima Vs.

In that view of the matter, the appellants will remain on bail already granted, till, disposal of the revision case.<br/><strong><em>Baneazuddin Ahmed Vs.

Jurisdiction under section 561 A CrPC is not ousted in the presence of the revisional jurisdiction of the Sessions Judge under section 439A of the Code. The only question will be, has any case been made out either under section 439 or 561A of the code? The answer will vary case to case.<br/><strong><em>Samirun Nessa Vs.

But it must be clearly borne in mind that the powers under section 561A being extraordinary in nature, should be exercised sparingly and where such exercise essential and justified by the tests specially laid down in the provision itself.<br/><strong><em>Aminul Islam Vs Mujibur Rahman 45 DLR (AD) 9.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Sections 439A &amp; 561A—</strong><br/>Revision jurisdiction of the High Court Division— Revision in a case arising out, of section 145 CrPC. A party who has been unsuccessful in revision under section 439A CrPC is not totally debarred from invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court Division under section 56lA. The opening words of this latter section—”Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent power of 1t High Court Division” repels any contention of such debarment.<br/><strong><em>Aminul Islam Vs.

In section 439 of the Code there is a bar, as sub-section (4) of the section provides to the effect that in an appealable case the party who has right to appeal cannot invoke section 439. But there is no such restriction in section 561A.<br/><strong><em>Khalilur Rhaman Vs.

In the present case there is no other material on record other than the FIR and mere allegations thereof. The court thus committed an error in refusing bail in this case.<br/><strong><em>AKM Mosharraf Hossain Vs.

In that circumstances the High Court Division ought to have exercised judicial discretion in the matter of granting bail to the appellants. The judicial discretion having not been properly exercised in the facts of the case the order is set aside and the appeal allowed.<br/><strong><em>Dhanu Mia Vs.

The police went to the residence of the petitioner to arrest him on the basis of a case started upon a newspaper report. He was a candidate for the National Assembly election. His political rivals and enemies were bent upon defeating him by putting him in confinement through the help of the police. In such circumstances, the prayer for anticipatory bail was granted.<br/><strong><em>Zulfiqur Ali Bhutto Vs.

It is also not right to say than an application for bail could not be filed before the Vacation Judge and that he had no jurisdiction to grant interim bail (when he was himself a party to the rejection of bail for the same accused earlier by the Division Bench). At the most, it may be said that it was indiscreet on the part of the Vacation Judge to grant bail in the facts of the case.<br/>In the application for bail before the Vacation Bench, it was not mentioned that prayers for bail had been refused earlier. For this suppression of fact alone the ad interim bail could have been cancelled.<br/><strong><em>MA Wahab Vs.

The Magistrate’s order is bad on this count also.<br/><strong><em>Sheikh MA Jabbar Vs. AKM Obaidul Hug 43 DLR 233.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 523(1)—</strong><br/>The act of the Investigating Officer to give custody of the property on the basis of the practice in vogue in the Police Department without any support of the statutory provisions of law to that effect in violation of section 523 CrPC is without any lawful authority and is illegal.<br/><strong><em>Siddique Ahmed Sawdagar Vs. State 40 DLR 268.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 526—</strong><br/>Transfer of case—Plea of bias—The question of admissibility or non—admissibility of evidence should be left to be agitated when the case is argued. Merely because a Court acted illegally in allowing some evidence to go into the record or disallowing some evidence as irrelevant or took a wrong view of the law in passing an order would not by itself be a ground for bias. (Per Anwarul Huq Chowdhury)<br/>Per Habibur Rahman Khan J (agreeing):In the present case the order refusing to grant adjournment having been passed by the Special Tribunal not in violation any mandatory provisions of law but in exercise Of his discretionary power, could not itself give rise to a ground for transfer as no prejudice could be shown to have been caused to the accused.<br/><strong><em>Hussain Mohammad Ershad Vs. State 43 DLR 347.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 526B—</strong><br/>Counter cases, trial of—It is desirable that counter case be tried by the same judge simultaneously——by such trial the court will get opportunity for looking to all the aspects of both the cases which is necessary for arriving at a correct decision and to avoid conflicting findings.<br/><strong><em>Lutfar Rahman Vs. Mosammnat Aleya Begum 45 DLR 57.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 533—</strong><br/>Any irregularity in recording the confession is curable under section 533 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Ratan Kha Vs. State 40 DLR 186.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 533—</strong><br/>Credibility of confessional statement—No substantial compliance would .cure the defect of noncompliance with the provisions of section 164 CrPC on material points. Confessional statement in a plain paper without the narration of questions and answers would not, by itself, make it inadmissible in evidence. Certificate given by the Magistrate, who had recorded the confessional statement, as to what had happened, how he warned and gave time for reflection to the person confessing, how yet he insisted on making confession and his admitting the same to be correct and the Magistrate’s believing the same to be voluntary ought to be treated as conclusive evidence of facts stated unless shown to be otherwise.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Hakim Vs. State 43 DLR 389. </em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong><br/>When sanction for prosecuting a government servant is invalid, the trial Court would not be a court of competent jurisdiction and a defect in the jurisdiction of the court can never be cured under sections 5 &amp; 7 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Abdul Hakim Vs. State 45 DLR</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong><br/>The remand order amounts to double jeopardy for the petitioners and offers chance to the prosecution to remedy its lacuna. Such a remand should not be made.<br/><strong><em>Fazal Vs. State 43 DLR 40.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong><br/>Cognizance—Scheduled and non—scheduled offence—When the very taking of cognizance of an offence, the framing of accusation and the trial upon charges of both scheduled and non—scheduled offences together suffered from complete lack of jurisdiction, this could not at all be considered to be a mere defect in the framing of charges which by aid of section 537 of the CrPC can be cured if prejudice is not caused to the accused. A mere defect in framing of charge by the Court having jurisdiction is one thing while framing of charge without having any jurisdiction is a completely different thing.<br/><strong><em>Mozammel (Md) Huq Vs. State 43 DLR 614.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong><br/>Adoption of a procedure prohibited by Code of Criminal Procedure is not curable by section 537 CrPC.<br/><strong><em>Lal Miah Vs. State 40 DLR 377</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 537—</strong><br/>Defect in framing of charge when not curable—a mere defect in framing of charge by a court having jurisdiction is one thing while the framing of charge without having any jurisdiction is a completely different thing. The contention that section 537 of the Code could be invoked to cure defect due to lack of jurisdiction cannot be accepted. Joinder of scheduled and non-scheduled offences and the trial of both these offences were illegal.<br/><strong><em>Mozammel Hoq Vs.State 42 DLR 527.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong><br/>Examining prosecution witnesses as Court witnesses—Magistrate has power to summon material witness whose relevance is disclosed in evidence, but he cannot examine them as Court witness— Magistrate’s order has been modified accordingly.<br/><strong><em>Helaluddin &amp; others Vs. State 40 DLR 352.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong><br/>Scope of section 540 consists of two parts—the first part is discretionary and the second part is obligatory.<br/><strong><em>Md. Jalaluddin Ahmed Vs. State 40 DLR 564.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong><br/>It is obligatory for the Court to allow the examination of witness if he thinks it essential for the just decision of the case. The accused will not be prejudiced if the witness is examined in the Court.<br/><strong><em>Md. JaIaluddin Ahmed Vs. State 40 DLR 564.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong><br/>The ends of justice has been negatived by the trial Court by refusing to recall certain witnesses for cross— examination by the appellant.<br/>The trial Court is not meant for only convicting or acquitting the accused persons but their duty is to administer justice. In the present case before us by refusing to recall certain witnesses for cross—examination by the appellant the ends of justice have been negatived by the trial Court. In such circumstances for ends of justice we are inclined to set aside the order dated 1.11.88 passed by the learned Tribunal and direct him for affording opportunity to the appellant to cross—examine the witnesses already examined by the prosecution. This is very much necessary for ends of justice.<br/><strong><em>Jamil Siddique Vs. State 41 DLR 30.</em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>Section 540—</strong><br/>Court’s power to examine witness not named in the FIR—the scope of the provision in CrPC in this connection .pears to be wide. It gives discretion to the court to examine such witness at any stage. It is imperative for the Court to examine such a witness if his evidence appears to be essential for a just decision.<br/><strong><em>Akhtar Jahan Vs.
