His failure to comply with direction to surrender would immediately attract the mischief of prosecution and consequent punishment. The offence would be complete on failure to surrender, subject however, to the defence of impossibility of performance which is a matter of fact to be decided on evidence. Section 7 (I) (b) is a punitive provision to come into play immediately after the lapse of time for surrender. The contention that the detention orders being illegal the detenu had not rightly surrendered has little substance. It is not the order of detention but it’ is the fact of detention itself that matters.
