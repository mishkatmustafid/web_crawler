If it is filed after an order of discharge it will in all probability be treated as a complaint by the Magistrate as in almost all such cases it will contain allegation of offence and the person filing the naraji petition will be examined by the Magistrate as a complainant under section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In case of discharge by the Magistrate the only course remaining open to the complainant is by way of approaching the Sessions Judge with an application for further investigation. But if the naraji petition is filed before an order of discharge has been passed, the Magistrate can take cognizance without examining the complainant if the intention appears only to draw the attention of the Magistrate by way of protest, or the Magistrate may treat it as a complaint and examine the complainant, as he thinks fit. <em>Abu Bakar and others vs State 46 DLR 684.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 4(I)(q)—</span></strong>The meaning assigned to the word "public" strongly indicates that a particular case may also be tried in a place other than the normal place where the sitting of the Court of Sessions takes place. <em>Sayeed Farook Rahman vs Sessions Judge of the Court of Sessions, Dhaka and others 49 DLR (AD) 157.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections  9,  17,  408  &amp; 409— </span></strong>Admission of appeal or revision do not fall in the category of urgent application as mentioned in sub-section (4) of section 17 of the Code.

If a police officer conducts a search within the limit of another police station, it may be presumed, unless otherwise proved, that reasons have been recorded by that officer that delay would have occasioned and evidence destroyed, if he had waited to have the place searched by police having jurisdiction of the place. <em>Kamruzzaman alias Babul Sikdar vs State 47 DLR 416.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 167—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Law did not provide for automatic stopping of further investigation and release of the accused after expiry of the time limit nor for stopping proceedings by the Sessions Judge or Special Tribunal on such ground. <em>Niamatullah @ Chand (Md) vs State and others 48 DLR 148.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 167—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">The provisions of section 167 CrPC being a procedural law, there being no express provisions for its prospective operation, shall operate retrospectively. <em>AKM Azizul islam and another vs State 49 DLR (AD) 115.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 167 &amp; 61</span></strong>—An accused cannot be detained in custody of the police for a longer period than under all the circumstances of the case is reasonable and such period must not, without an order of remand by a Magistrate, exceed 24 hours, exclusive of the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the Magistrate.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In the instant case before us, no incriminating articles, e.g. currency notes, soiled notes or stamps were recovered within the first 24 hours of arrest pursuant to any information given by accused Farook Mahajan, and so it cannot be said with an equal degree of certainty that the unlawful detention of the prisoner without any order of remand beyond 24 hours had no effect on the confession made by him. <em>Faruque Mahajan and 4 (four) others vs State 49 DLR 47</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 167(5)—</span></strong>Stopping of investigation being subject to order of Sessions Judge, no absolute right, not to speak of any vested right of release, could be created in favour of the accused with the passing of order stopping further investigation by the Magistrate on the expiry of specified or extended time for investigation.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In the case of Mohitullah vs State reported in 38 DLR (AD) 240 it has been held that an accused would be tried in accordance with procedure prevailing on the day trial commenced and if the procedure is changed by the time trial commenced the accused cannot claim vested right to be tried in accordance with the provisions of the repealed procedure. It is well settled that procedural law takes effect retrospectively.

We, therefore, find merit in this Rule. <em>Shajahan Ali Mondal vs Belayet Hossain and others 47 DLR 478.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 173—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">In the name of further investigation police cannot make reinvestigation of the case and discharge the accused person against whom chargesheet has already been submitted. <em>Moslemuddin and others vs State 47 DLR 420.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 173, 190</span></strong>—There is nothing either in section 173 or in section 190 of the Code providing for ejection or acceptance of a police report.

By openly, blatantly and consciously flouting Article Ill they have also put themselves within the ambit of steps to refer the matter to the Supreme Judicial Council. Yet we decide to follow the course to caution the learned Judges not to repeat the performance in future.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It will be useful for all to remember that as human beings are not infallible, the judgments of the Appellate Division are too not infallible. Yet in all disciplined and constitutional societies and governments, the pronouncements of the highest Court are given a finality and a binding effect for the simple reason that there must be a finality to litigation at some point and that there must be judicial discipline, the lower judicial hierarchy being bound by the decision of the higher judicial hierarchy. To allow or even to tolerate a breach of this time-honoured and constitutionally fixed duty is to invite judicial anarchy and judicial indiscipline. This will create confusion in the administration of justice and erode people's confidence in the orderly and disciplined dispensation of justice under the Constitution. We hope that the learned Judges will appreciate the merit of judicial restraint and will desist in future from the temptation of treading on a beaten path.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Per Latifur Rahman J (agreeing) : The pronouncement in respect of the power and jurisdiction of the High Court Division with regard to 561A of Code having been clearly stated in several decisions of this Division, it does not lie in the mouth of the High Court Division to take a contrary view of the same. The judgments of this Division as per the mandate of Article 111 of our Constitution is binding on the High Court Division. It is a clear violation of the Constitutional mandate by the learned Judges of the High Court Division. Is it not a violation of the oath of Office of a Judge to protect and preserve the Constitution of Bangladesh. <em>Sher Ali (Md) and others vs State and another 46 DLR (AD) 67.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 173(3A) &amp; (3B)—</span></strong>Before conclusion of trial the Investigating Officer may send futher report if new and important evidences are available which may be considered by the court during trial. <em>Rahmatullah vs State and another 48 DLR 158.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 173(3B)—</span></strong>By further investigation the police officer can bring to the notice of the Court additional facts and even prosecute persons against whom charge-sheet was not submitted earlier.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">But the police in the name of further investigation cannot exclude the persons against whom charge-sheet had already been submitted. In the present case supplementary charge-sheet having been filed against the FIR named accused persons excluded in the earlier charge-sheet we find no illegality in this case. <em>Ear Ali (Md) vs State 47 DLR 405.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 173(3B)—</span></strong>The police may make further investigation in respect of an offence after submission of a report and submit a further report or a supplementary charge-sheet in respect of any accused against whom evidence has  been collected  during further investigation, but the Magistrate has no power to direct further investigation in respect of accused persons against whom the police has once submitted a charge-sheet just to obtain a final report, nor can the police, after further investigation, submit final report in respect of a person against whom a charge-sheet was once submitted. <em>Golam Mostafa and others vs State 47 DLR 563.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 173(3B)—</span></strong>The CID committed no error of law in holding further investigation as per provision of section 173(3B) of the CrPC. Had further investigation been done after the case record was transmitted to the Senior Special Judge after taking cognizance of the offence or passing any order whatsoever then permission of the Special Judge would have been necessary. The police had the power to hold further investigation as per provision of section 173 (3B) of the Code as the provision of this section is in no way derogatory to the provision of sub-section 5(6) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958. <em>Abdus Samad Khan and 3 others vs State 50 DLR 143</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 173(3B)—</span></strong>The provision does not have any scope for the Sessions Judge to direct further investigation by the police. The order of the Sessions Judge directing further investigation on an application by the informant is without jurisdiction and is liable to be set aside<em>.

Since the cognizance of the case has been taken upon a petition by an order of the Government in accordance with section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the complaint case itself need not be quashed. In this view of ours we are fortified by the decision in the case of Ranjit vs Sm Parul Hore and another, reported in 1980 CrLJ Noc 57 (Cal); (1979)1 Cal HN 414. <em>Dr Taslima Nasrin vs Md Nurul Alam and another 48 DLR 280.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 190—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sessions Judge cannot take cognizance of a case against the accused sent up in the supplementary charge sheet without cognizance being taken by the Magistrate<em>.

It is neither the foundation stone nor a prerequisite of the proceeding nor a sine qua non of a valid trial in the Court. It is difficult for us to see why such an irregularity, i.e. investigation by an officer not authorised, should affect the proceeding in a court or prevent the court from taking cognizance of a non-cognizable offence under clause (a) or (b) of section 190(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the absence of a clear enactment, expressed or implied preventing the court from doing so. <em>Golam Moula Master and others vs State 46 DLR 140.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 190(1) &amp; 156(3)—</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The prayer made by the accused for holding further investigation against some other persons is, in fact, a prayer cancelling the charge-sheet filed against them. This is nothing but an indirect way of reopening the case by making reinvestigation but there is no provision of law for cancelling the charge-sheet once filed against some accused and accepted by the Magistrate. <em>Sukhil Kumar Sarkar vs Kazi Wazed Ali @ Subed and others 47 DLR 252.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 190(l)(b) &amp; 200</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">—It appears that the naraji petition has been filed on a complaint but as an application out of apprehension that the Magistrate might accept the recommendation of the Investigation Officer.

In the present case in view of the positive finding of the High Court Division and on the failure of the learned Advocate to show before us that, in fact, the allegedly fraudulent document was produced in Cr Case No.116 of 1983, the private complaint at the instance of the informant is not barred. <em>Shamsuddin Ahmed Chowdhury vs State and another 49 DLR (AD) 159.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 195 &amp; 561A</span></strong>—In a proceeding where a forged document has been used the Court concerned should make the complaint. The criminal court should not take cognizance on a private complaint. The want of complaint under section 195 is incurable and the lack of it vitiates the hole trial. <em>Wahida Khan vs Shakar oo Ziwar Sultan and State 48 DLR 186.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 195(l)(a)—</span></strong>If the officer to complain is the officer also to take cognizance then there is no necessity of filing a written complaint by the same officer to himself for taking cognizance of an offence against the accused persons. <em>Anwar Hossain &amp; others vs State &amp; others 48 DLR 89.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 195(l)(c)—</span></strong>Use of a photo copy of the forged document could not amount to the use of a forged document.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It would appear that the photocopy of the kabala which is said to be forged by the opposite party gave only a clue or inkling to the forgery. The action brought by the opposite party against the petitioner is an action independent of the filing of photocopy of the forged document in the court of Magistrate.

Moreover at the time of hearing under section 241A or under section 265C the court considers the record of the case, the documents submitted therewith and the submissions made by both parties. So, all necessary materials are before the court and as the order is passed on consideration of all such materials, there is no scope for passing any order for holding further inquiry. But there is scope for further enquiry when accused is discharged under the provision of sub-section (2B) of section 202 of the Code as the said order is made before taking of the cognizance. <em>Abdul Hai vs State 50 DLR 551.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 203, 204(3) &amp; 436</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">—The order of dismissal of the complaint passed under sections 203 and 204 (3) CrPC does not amount to discharge. So for a further enquiry in such a case no notice to the accused is necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The principle, that an order prejudicial to an accused should not be made, without giving him an opportunity to be heard has no application where the accused is not discharged. A revisional application before the learned Sessions Judge at the instance of an aggrieved complainant against an order of dismissal of a complaint by the Magistrate can be gone into without notice to the accused. <em>Sirajudullah and others vs State and others 48 DLR 76.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 203, 205(1) &amp; 436— </span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Neither the Sessions Judge nor the High Court Division is invested with any power to direct any Magistrate to take cognizance of a case.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Their power is strictly limited to directing a further enquiry into the petition of complaint. It will be for the Magistrate concerned to take or not to take cognizance after the result of further enquiry. After the dismissal of the petition of complaint under section 203 CrPC the informant-respondent's remedy was to approach the higher Court under section 436 CrPC for further enquiry into his petition of complaint. The penultimate order of the High Court Division in directing the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence and to issue process in accordance with section 205(1) CrPC is not sustainable. <em>Yusuf A Hossain vs KM Rezaul Ferdous 48 DLR (AD) 53.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 205—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Considering the hardship of the female accused in attending the Court at Nalchiti from  Jessore the Magistrate may consider their prayer for appearing in Court through lawyer. <em>Salam Mollick (Md) vs State 48 DLR 329</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 205C—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Under the newly added provisions of section 205C jurisdiction has been vested in the Magistrate to examine the police report or other materials on record and if it appears to the Magistrate that the offence as disclosed from such materials is triable exclusively by the court of Sessions he is empowered to send the case to such court<em>.

Yet in all disciplined and constitutional societies and governments, the pronouncements of the highest Court are given a finality and a binding effect for the simple reason that there must be a finality to litigation at some point and that there must be judicial discipline, the lower judicial hierarchy being bound by the decision of the higher judicial hierarchy. To allow or even to tolerate a breach of this time-honoured and constitutionally fixed duty is to invite judicial anarchy and judicial indiscipline. This will create confusion in the administration of justice and erode people's confidence in the orderly and disciplined dispensation of justice under the Constitution.

The judgments of this Division as per the mandate of Article 111 of our Constitution are binding on the High Court Division. It is a clear violation of the Constitutional mandate by the learned Judges of the High Court Division.

Moreover complainant has been given a limited right of appeal against an order of acquittal under the amended sub-section (2) of section 417 of the Code only on the ground of error of law.

It is neither the foundation stone nor a prerequisite of the proceeding nor a sine qua non of a valid trial in the Court.

The jurisdiction is not alternative or an additional one but it is a jurisdiction preserved in the interest of justice to redress grievances for which no other procedure is available nor has been provided in the Code itself<em>.

Then, in the memo of the appeal taken or in the submission no ground has been taken that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to try the case or that it arrived at absurd or preposterous conclusion from the evidence on record.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure has not given any new jurisdiction to the High Court to override other laws. It is easy to see that this Court cannot have any inherent jurisdiction to strike down the law of limitation. The law of limitation is so inexorable that a person loses his good title on account of law of limitation. It may be desirable that something is done for the redress of the accused who lost their right of appeal and has very good case in their defence, but it is for the legislature to do. <em>Mr Mohammad Ali vs State 46 DLR 175</em>.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 561A— </span></strong>There is nothing in law precluding a criminal case on account of a civil suit pending against the petitioners on the same facts.

If the same offence can be tried by a Special Tribunal under the Special Powers Act it cannot be said that the accused-petitioner has an exclusive right to be tried by a Drug Court only. As on the petitioner's own showing he has been charged only under section 25C(d) of the Special Powers Act by the Senior Special Tribunal, we do not find any illegality in the proceedings<em>.

This Court found that there was no "confession" at all as its maker did not implicate himself in the crime and further that this statement was not corroborated by any other evidence and consequently the conviction was based on 'no evidence' which could be quashed by the High Court Division in exercise of its inherent power under section 561 A. <em>Sher Ali (Md) and others vs State and another 46 DLR (AD) 67.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 561A- </span></strong>The inherent power may be invoked independent of powers conferred by any other provisions of the Code.

The "total bar" in section 439(4) of the Code, as spoken of by the learned Judges, is only against further revision—that is, revision under section 439(1) of the Code and not against the Court's inherent jurisdiction which is altogether different from any other jurisdiction under the Code. The High Court Division, on the one hand, wilfully disregarded this Court's decisions, and, on the other hand, flouted Article 111 of the Constitution.

The charge itself may be impugned but it is not the function of the trial Court while framing charge or the Court exercising jurisdiction under section 561A CrPC to examine the admissibility, relevance, propriety or sufficiency of materials.

But the usual and well-settled practice is that a criminal proceeding can only be quashed after cognizance has been taken and process issued thereupon subject to the fundamental principle that the power of quashing is and should be very sparingly exercised and only to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court. <em>Syed Mohammad Hashem vs State 48 DLR (AD) 87.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 561A— </span></strong>A Criminal Procee­ding cannot be quashed on the basis of defence materials which are still not part of the materials for prosecution.

In that view of the matter we find that the conviction and sentence imposed upon the appellant under section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1980 do not suffer from any illegality. We sustain the conviction and sentence not on the reasoning given by the learned Judges of the High Court Division in 40 DLR 360 but on the ground that the word "dowry" in section 4 is not to be read in terms of the definition of the word "dowry" in section 2 but in its ordinary sense. <em>Abul Basher Howlader vs State and another 46 DLR (AD) 169.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 2 &amp; 4—</span></strong> If dowry is demanded after the marriage then also the offence under section 4 will be attracted. <em>Salam Mollick (Md) vs State 48 DLR 329.</em></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>

Since the complainant petitioner did not disclose the nature of the document allegedly created the allegations made do not constitute the offence under section 465 of the Penal Code and as such the impugned proceeding is liable to be quashed.</p><p><strong><em>Syed Khalilulla Salik alias Juned vs Haji Md Rahmat Ullah vs State 49 DLR 16</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 34—</strong></p><p>The essence of joint liability is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the accused in the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention.</p><p>Before application of section 34 of the Penal Code to a case, it must be shown that (1) a criminal act was done by several persons, (2) all of them intended the commission of the criminal act and (3) the criminal act was done in furtherance of the common intention. In the instant case it is not clear that except accused appellant Abul Kalam Azad, the other accused had the intention of causing such bodily injury as was likely to cause the death of Abdul Wadud and even the participation of the other accused in causing death of the deceased is not free from doubt.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Kalam Azad vs State 47 DLR 317.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 34—</strong></p><p>This section does not create any distinct offence. It is intended to meet a case where the members of a party acted in furtherance of the common intention of all but it was difficult to prove exactly the part played by each of them.</p><p>In means that if two or more persons intentionally do a thing jointly, it is just the same as if each of them had done it individually, common intention within the meaning of this section pre-supposes a prior concert. There must be a prior meeting of the minds leading to a pre-arranged plan to commit an offence. The common intention to commit the offence invites the application of section 34 of the Penal Code. In offences involving physical violence, the presence of the accused at the scene of the occurrence renders him liable on the principle of joint liability but where the offence consists of diverse acts and it may be committed at different times, the presence of the accused at the scene of the occurrence is not necessary.</p><p><strong><em>State vs Tajul Islam 48 DLR 305.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 34—</strong></p><p>Unless there is meeting of minds between the accused as to the commission of crime of common intention, the application of section 34 of the Penal Code is improper.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Khaleque and others vs State 48 DLR 446.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 34, 109 &amp; 149—</strong></p><p>For application of section 34 some overt act by each of the accused is necessary in the commission of the crime by two or more persons but in the case of application of section 149, if one is found to be a member of the unlawful assembly for the commission of the crime, whether he takes active part in it or not, he comes within its mischief, and so far as section 109 is concerned, it is simply for abetment of the offence committed.</p><p>Now, in the instant case, according to the prosecution, all the accused planned to commit the murder of the victim and towards that end they started acting and then all together in a joint action with common intention caused the murder of the victim. So, in such circumstances, it is not understood why section 34 will not be attracted in this case, when allegation is to the effect that each one of the accused persons took part in the commission of the alleged crime of murder of the victim Kalam. The question is whether the prosecution has been able to prove the allegation by evidence is a different one. We, therefore find no illegality in framing the charge against the accused under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code apart from other sections of law.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Khayer and 3 others vs State 46 DLR 212.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 34 and 149—</strong></p><p>Section 34 of the Penal Code involves a direct overt act on the part of the accused sharing "a common intention" with others for the commission of an offence while section 149 is essentially a vicarious liability for being a member of an unlawful assembly with the "common object" of committing the offence. These two offences are of different nature.</p><p><strong><em>Abu Talukder vs State 51 DLR 188</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 96—</strong></p><p>The possession for exercising right of private defence must be a settled possession a peaceful possession for a pretty long time without any resistance. </p><p><strong><em>Sarwar Kamal and others vs State 48 DLR 61.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 96-104—</strong></p><p>The onus of proving right of private defence lies on the accused claiming exercise of such right.</p><p><strong><em>Sarwar Kamal and others vs State 48 DLR 61.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 96-106—</strong></p><p>The right of private defence of the body extends to the voluntary causing of death if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right is an assault which may reasonably cause the apprehension of either death or grievous hurt.</p><p><strong><em>Khandoker Saiful Islam vs State 50 DLR (AD) 126</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 100—</strong></p><p>Right of private defence—When the accused had scuffles with the deceased and the fear of retaliation from the deceased party overpowers the mind, it is not possible for him to weigh the position in golden scales. In such a situation when he is faced with assaults from his rival party it is not unnatural that he would strike a decisive blow to defend himself and to free himself from the clutches of his adversaries.</p><p>In the instant case, accused Ruhul Amin gave only one knife blow to deceased Moktar Ali and then ran away. The attending circumstances indicate that he gave the knife blow only to free himself from the grip of deceased Moktar Ali and ran away for safety. This conduct of the accused satisfies the legal requirement of the right of private defence. The accused cannot be said to have exceeded the right of self-defence.</p><p><strong><em>Ruhul Amin Mondal vs State 49 DLR 250</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 120B—</strong></p><p>Jobaida's jubilation might be the result of her moral support to the activities of her husband (leading to bloodshed and political change) but for that it cannot be said that she was in the conspiracy.</p><p><strong><em>Jobaida Rashid vs State, represented by the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka 49 DLR 373.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 147—</strong></p><p>All the accused persons assembled to attack the informant.

In view of other offenses committed, such as criminal trespass and assault, it is difficult to hold that all the appellants are consecutively liable under section 149 of the Code when Appellant No.l Abdus Sattar alone struck a Katra blow on the right side of the chest of deceased which proved fatal and, strictly speaking, section 149 of the Penal Code is not attracted in this case. There being overwhelming evidence of inflicting Katra blow on deceased Aminul Huq by Appellant No.l, the appeal in respect of Appellant No.l Abdus Sattar is dismissed and his conviction and sentence under sections 302/149 of the Penal Code is altered to section 302 of the Penal Code and his sentence of imprisonment for life is maintained.</p><p><strong><em>Abdus Sattar and others vs State 46 DLR (AD) 239.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 193—</strong></p><p>If a court finds that any witness committed an offence under section 193, the court is to proceed in accordance with the provisions of section 476 of the Code of Criminal Procedure because the offence under section 193 is included in section 195(l)(b) of the Code.</p><p><strong><em>Idris Miah (Md) vs State 50 DLR 629</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 201—</strong></p><p>Since both the condemned prisoners are sentenced to imprisonment for life there is no necessity for a separate sentence to be passed against them under section 201 of the Penal Code.</p><p><strong><em>State vs Hamida Khatun and another 50 DLR 547</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 202—</strong></p><p>The accused committed an offence punishable under section 202 of the Penal Code for not giving the information about the offence either to the nearest Magistrate or to the police station.</p><p><strong><em>State vs Md Bachchu Miah @ Abdul Mannan and 5 others 51 DLR 355</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 299 &amp; 300—</strong></p><p>When death is probable it is culpable homicide and when death is most probable it is murder.

Therefore, the offence as committed by accused Abdul Aziz Mina does not in any way attract the provision of Exception 4 of section 300 but attracts the provision of section 300 that it is a voluntary infliction of knife blows with the intention of causing death and as such accused Abdul Aziz Mina cannot escape the liability of causing homicide amounting to murder.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Aziz Mina and others vs State 48 DLR 382.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 302/34—</strong></p><p>Though the appellate Court including this court may enlarge a convict on bail for reasons to be recorded by it such a convict is not entitled to be released on bail if he is sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life.</p><p>Appellate Division in some cases opined /mat a convict may be enlarged on bail if there is no chance of disposal of the appeal within the period of his sentence.

The statute that holds good is the Penal Code. If the allegations are that of kidnapping of a minor girl, then for the purpose of her custody, the court has to proceed on the basis that she is a minor if she is under 16. If however the allegations are that of procuration of a minor girl, the court has to proceed on the basis that a girl is a minor who is under 18.</p><p><strong><em>Wahed Ali Dewan vs State and another 46 DLR (AD) 10.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 363 &amp; 366A—</strong></p><p>A minor to be taken out of the lawful custody of her guardian as under section 363 must be a minor under 16.

After the decision has been given that the girl is quite major above 18 years, can there be any purpose for a trial which is still pending?</p><p>The learned Judges should have made it very clear that the finding made by them as to the age of the girl was only for the purpose of deciding the present custody of the victim girl and the trial Court was free to take its own decision upon considering the evidence to be led in the case. That having not been done, it must be said that the impugned judgment suffers from at least impropriety having usurped the powers of the trial Court in a pending criminal case.</p><p><strong><em>Khairunnessa vs Illy Begum &amp; another 48 DLR (AD) 67.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 366A—Age of girl—Physi­cal appearance—Physical appearance</strong></p><p>may not always provide a correct guide for ascertaining the age of a girl child who is growing up.

The mother has a reasonable grievance to make against the judgment which does not seem to have been passed upon a proper appreciation of the materials on record and far less keeping in view the welfare of the victim girl alleged to be a minor.</p><p><strong><em>Khairunnessa vs Illy Begum and another 48 DLR (AD) 67.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 379 &amp; 447—</strong></p><p>When growing of the case crops by the complainant and the cutting and taking away of the same dishonestly by the accused are proved, the accused is guilty of theft.</p><p>When theft of the case crops by the accused by cutting and taking away of the same and damaging some crops in the process necessarily involves their entry into the case land and the accused are punished for theft and mischief, a separate conviction under section 447 Penal Code is unwarranted.</p><p><strong><em>Motaleb Sardar (Md) and others vs State and another 51 DLR 278.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 386, 387 &amp; 390—</strong></p><p>The distinguishing element between extortion and robbery or dacoity is not the presence of the offender but the presence of imminent fear and also the delivery of possession of goods to the offender, the actual delivery or possession of property by the person put in fear is the essence of the offence of extortion. Where a person through fear passively allows, his property to be taken away the offence committed will be robbery or dacoity and not extortion. The Special Tribunal had no jurisdiction to try this case as the offence alleged against does not come either under section 386 or section 387 of the Penal Code, but it is more in the nature of a robbery or a dacoity.</p><p><strong><em>Dulal Howlader and others vs State 48 DLR 269.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 396—</strong></p><p>Dacoity with murder—When a murder is not committed in the course of committing dacoity there can be no conviction under section 396 of the Penal Code.
