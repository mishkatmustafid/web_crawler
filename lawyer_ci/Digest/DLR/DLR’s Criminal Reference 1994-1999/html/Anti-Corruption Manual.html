Therefore the information asked for does not conform to section 94 of the Anti-Corruption Manual. The impugned order purported under section 94 of the Code and Articles 31/50 of the Anti-Corruption Manual is unauthorized and illegal as they do not confer any power to direct a person to give information.</p><p>The information asked for the purpose of inquiry was of a roving nature and was merely fishing for information. If we are to believe that the inquiry was in response to the information received by the anonymous letter then the wholesale information of all cases handled by the petitioner from 1-3-93 to 20-3-94 cannot be said to be connected with the alleged remittance of the sale proceeds of the house at Motijheel and Gulshan. The asking for such wholesale information of the cases handled by him for that period appears to us to be malafide, fishing for information only to harass the petitioner. <em>Imtiazur Rahman Farooqui (Md) (MI Farooqui) vs Bureau of Anti-Corruption and others 51 DLR 421 offence under this Special Law Sayed and 10 others vs State 48 DLR 489.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Section 11</strong>—When the Tribunal Judge ordered publication of notifica­tion in the daily newspapers as prescribed in the Act it indicated that the Judge was mentally satisfied that the accused persons had become absconders.
