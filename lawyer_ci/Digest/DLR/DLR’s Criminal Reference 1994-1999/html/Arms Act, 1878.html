The prosecution appears to have failed to prove that "Disco razor" or "Spring Knife" is "arms" within the definition of the Arms Act even if they are taken to be "daggers'. Saiful <em>Islam Milon and another vs State 50 DLR 529.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Sections 4, 13, &amp; 19(e)</strong>—No license is required to keep a dagger and consequently a person cannot be convicted if he is found in possession of dagger. <em>Mozammel Hossain  vs State DLR 614.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Sections 18 &amp; 26</strong>—The respondents having not filed any affidavit-in-opposition disclosing materials justifying retention of the petitioner's gun and licences in their possession, the impugned order is liable to be declared as having been issued without lawful authority and of no legal effect. <em>Major (Retd)  M Asaduzzaman  vs District Magistrate Jessore and others 51 DLR 471.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section 19A</strong>—The place of recovery being a public place, it cannot be said that the appellant was in exclusive possession of that place. That being so appellant cannot be held liable under section 19A of the Arms Act. <em>Abul Kashem vs State 50 DLR 356.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Section 19A(f)</strong>—Even if the incriminating articles were recovered from the thatched hut of the appellant such recovery ipso facto will not connect him with the offence under the Arms Act in the absence of any evidence to show that he had himself kept the same there or none else had any access to that place<em>. Nazrul Islam vs State 50 DLR 515.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Section 19A &amp; (f)</strong>—Accused cannot be convicted for constructive possession of arms and ammunition. He must have either exclusive or conscious possession or actual or effective control of the same.</p><p>It the court finds that the accused had neither exclusive nor conscious possession nor effective or actual control of any arms and ammunition the accused is not liable to be convicted. In the instant case we find that the accused had conscious possession and effective or actual control of the revolver and live bullets recovered from him. <em>Abul Bashar Shaikh vs State 51 DLR 252.</em></p><p> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 19(a) &amp; (f)</strong>—Mere knowledge of the accused that the arms or ammunition was lying at the spot pointed out by him, in the absence ofany evidence or circumstance to show that he had exclusive possession over the spot or that none else had access to it, cannot make him liable for conviction. When the First Information Report named and seizure list witnesses, who are the owners of shops and businesses concerns adjacent to the place of the occurrence, do not support the prosecution story of recovery of arms or ammunition from the possession of the accused, it is unsafe to base conviction on the evidence of police personnels interested in the prosecution case. <em>Iftekhar Hasan Choudhury vs State 47 DLR 451.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Sections 19A and (f)</strong>—When a place is not under the exclusive possession of the accused and the possibility of access of others to the place cannot be ruled out, he cannot be held guilty of offence under the Act. <em>Talebur Rahman alias Taleb and 2 others vs State 49 DLR 167.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Section 19(a) &amp; 19(f)</strong>—There may not be separate arms and ammunition in the possession of the two accused petitioners but when all of them were jointly together and the police party was receiving revolver shots and cocktails it cannot be said that the revolver and the cartridges recovered from Mokim Gazi were only in his exclusive possession. The law will ascribe joint possession in such circumstances. <em>Lutfar Rahman alias Arju and another Petitioners vs State 51 DLR (AD) 120.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Section 19(f)</strong>—To constitute offences under the aforesaid sections of law possession and control must mean conscious possession and actual control with necessary mens rea.</p><p>When incriminating articles involving offences under section 19(f) of the Arms Act and section 5 of the Explosive Substances Act are recovered from a place in the occupation or possession of more than one person and it is not possible to fix the liability of any particular individual, the head of the family cannot be held liable for the offences. <em>Kashem alias Md Abdul Kashem vs State 47 DLR 438.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Section 19F</strong>—The ammunition in question was kept by the accused persons in the ditch which was under their exclusive control and no approach was there by anyone else except that of the accused. In view of such facts and circumstances the impugned judgment and order of conviction is set aside. <em>Hanif Khan vs State 50 DLR 541.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Section 25</strong>—Since the arms were recovered at the instance of the accused, no search was necessary, invoking the application of the provisions provided in law for carrying out a search. No question of following the provisions of sections 103 and 165 of the Criminal Procedure Code and section 25 of the Arms Act therefore arises. <em>Kamruzzaman alias Babul Sikdar vs State 47 DLR 416.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Section 26</strong>—Only the Government is empowered to seize arms of any person and to detain the same for such time as it thinks necessary for the public safety.
