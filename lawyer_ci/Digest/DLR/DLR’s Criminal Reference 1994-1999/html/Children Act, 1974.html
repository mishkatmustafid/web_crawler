In fact he has been on bail. Therefore the passage of time did not stop for the purpose of computing the age of the appellant which means the appellant had already attained the age of 16 years. <em>Bimal Das vs State 46 DLR 460.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Sections 2(f) &amp; 6(1)</strong>—The trial of the minor accused-appellant together with adult accused is hit by want of jurisdiction and, as such, the trial was vitiated<em>. Kawsarun Nessa and another vs State 48 DLR 196.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Section 2(f), 6 &amp; 66</strong>—The trial Court failed to apply its judicial mind as to the age of appellant Shiplu, who appears to have been below the age of 16. This makes the order of conviction and sentence in respect of Shilpu liable to be set aside for want of jurisdiction. <em>Shiplu and another vs State 49 DLR 53.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Sections 2(f), 6(2)(f) &amp; 66</strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—In order to get the benefit of separate trial the accused must satisfy the trial Court that he is a child and court after consideration of the materials on record and bringing the accused before him shall come to a finding whether he is of the age of 16 or upwards. <em>Hossain and others vs State and another 50 DLR 494</em></span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Sections 3-5</strong>—The Sessions Judge may also, whether the situation demands it, exercise the power of a Juvenile Court, <em>Bimal Das vs State 46 DLR 460.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Section 6</strong>—Once a child offender crosses the age of 16 years and then charged with an offence or tried for the same, the statutory requirement of the child being tried by a Juvenile Court comes to an end. <em>Baktiar Hossain vs State 47 DLR 542</em>.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Sections 6 &amp; 66</strong>—A close scrutiny of the section will show that the age referred to therein relates to the age of the accused when he is "charged with or tried" or, "and not to the age when the offence has been committed". Once a child offender crosses the age of 16 years and then charged with an offence or tried for the same the requirement of the child being tried by a Juvenile Court comes to an end.</p><p>From the records it appears that the appellant has admitted that at the time of occurrence the appellant was 15 yeas 11 months and 10 days, only 20 days less than 16 years. We have already seen that by the time the appellant was charged with the offence he had reached the age of 16 years and thereby forfeiting his right to claim a trial by a Juvenile Court. In our view the appellant's interest has not been prejudiced by the failure of the Special Tribunal to give a finding on his age as under the circumstances it has become an unnecessary exercise on the part of the Special Tribunal<em>.
