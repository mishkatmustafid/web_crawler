The order limiting</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">the appointment of lawyer by each accused is absolutely without jurisdiction. Section 352 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the learned Judge of the court will consider the accommodation of the general public in the Court room. If one accused engages for himself one hundred lawyers, the lawyers are entitled to defend the accused and as regards sitting arrangement the Judge will control, but he cannot pass any order limiting the appointment of lawyer. <em>Hossain Mohammad Ershad [former President Lieutenant General (Rtd)] vs State 48 DLR 95.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Article 35(4)—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">In the enquiry the petitioners can very well controvert the allegations against them. It cannot be suggested that by mere issuance of notices the petitioners are compelled to give evidence against them. Article 35(4) therefore is of no avail to the petitioners. <em>Abdul Hafiz (Md) and others vs Director General, Bureau of Anti-Corruption, Government of Bangladesh 51 DLR 72.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Article 58(2) (now repealed)</span></strong><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">—The nature of the document of which the petitioner pleads protection and the related matters being in the facts of the case a mixed question of fact and law, it is not yet time to consider this constitutional question while the document is still not ready for observation with all its factual clothings.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The Indian cases relied upon by the petitioner are constitutional cases in which Article 74(1) of the Indian Constitution came up for repeated interpretation. Any interpretation of Article 58 (now repealed) of the Constitution by us while disposing of an application of this nature will not be on a par with the Indian decisions on the subject because our decision too will be tentative in nature and will not be binding on the trial Court. We therefore see no reason to grant leave to consider a question of constitutional importance when the occasion for such consideration has not arisen. <em>Moudud Ahmed vs State 48 DLR (AD) 42.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Article 58(2)—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Criminal trial— Constitutional protection—where the State does not take shelter of article 58(2) rather it produces through its machinery for procuring the documents by submitting the charge sheet, statement under section 161 CrPC and the police record, the protection of Article 58(2) is of no avail to the petitioner. <em>Moudud Ahmed vs State 48 DLR 108.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Article 58(2)</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—Unless it can be shown by a party that his claims of protection under Article 58(2) is on the basis of "Public interest" Article 58(2) hardly has any role to play. <em>Moudud Ahmed vs State 48 DLR 108.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Article 58(2)</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—The order made by the petitioner as a Minister being something more than his advice to the President, the Court's jurisdiction is not ousted from enquiry into the same by reason of Article 58(2).</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">On the first contention of constitutional embargo upon the Court to enquire into any advice given by the Ministers as contended under Article 58(2) to the President is concerned I am of the opinion that which constitute the advice can not be inquired into by any Court but the materials upon which that advice is given does not disentitle a court from examining the same<em>.  Moudud Ahmed vs State 48 DLR 108.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Article 78(3)—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">No member of the Legislature should be questioned or penalised by any Court for anything said within its four walls. <em>Cyril Sikdar vs Nazmul Huda 46 DLR 555.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Article 102</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—Inordinate delay renders Writ Petition liable to be rejected in that the remedy through such petition is to be sought without inordinate delay. <em>Mizan Howlader vs Bangladesh 48 DLR 91</em>.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Article 102</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—The authority can never justify an order of preventive detention by merely saying that the action was taken in the interest of public safety and public order. It has to satisfy the High Court Division which is an obligation cast upon the Court by the Constitution, that there were materials on record as would satisfy a reasonable person to justify the order of detention.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It must be made clear that the law which we have declared has never granted absolute power either to the Government or to the President to make an order of detention even in the circumstances mentioned in the judgment nor it is the law that the satisfaction upon which an order of detention is made is immune from challenge. The power of the Supreme Court in making scrutiny of executive acts never recedes to the background, as observed by the learned Judge, so long as the Constitution remains operative. The maintenance of law and order, public peace, public safety and security are undisputedly concerns of the State and the Government knows best how to preserve them, but the Court's concern in a case of preventive detention is to see whether the person is being detained without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner. Mostafizur Rahman vs Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary Ministry of Home Affairs and another 51 DLR 1</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Article 103—To suggest that a leave petition may be filed under Article 103 challenging the Sessions Judge's decision is itself tantamount to legislation against which the learned Judges have patronisingly cautioned. <em>Sher Ali (Md) and others vs State and another 46 DLR (AD) 67.</em></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
