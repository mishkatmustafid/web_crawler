These remarks certainly render the Judges contemptible in the eyes of the general public and undoubtedly casts aspersions on the courage and ability of the Judges and by no stretch of imagination can it be said that it is not written for scandalising the Judges or his authority and does not amount to contempt of court. The article was written malafide in a tone to undermine the judiciary and it tends to breed conflict between the two organs of the state—the legislature and the judiciary. <em>Judges of the High court Division vs Ashok Kumar Kamaker and others 48 DLR 179.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 2</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—Where the writings published are proved to be that of the particular writer a lenient view may be taken in case of the Editor, the printer and the Publisher for such news item or the article. <em>Judges of the High Court Division vs Ashok Kumar Karmaker and others 48 DLR 179.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 3</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—In the impugned statement there is nothing relating to any judgment or to a person acting as a judge—it is over the activity of the Chief Election Commissioner, not of a judge—it is with no motive to lower down the dignity of the Supreme Court and as such it constitutes no contempt. <em>Dr Ahmed Hussain, Senior Advocate vs Shamsul Huq Chowdhury Senior Advocate 48 DLR 155.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 3</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—In the impugned statement there in nothing relating to any judgment or to a person acting as a judge—it is over the activity of the Chief Election Commissioner, not of a judge—It is with no motive to lower down the degnity of the Supreme Court and as such it constitutes no contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mr Shamsul Huq Chowdhury made statements in zeal to protect the neutrality and independence of judiciary and it was not a criticism of any particular judge nor can it be termed as scandalisation of the Judges of the Superior Court or the Judiciary in any form. We feel that mentioning of the name of sitting Judge, Mr Abdur Rouf, in the statement is without any motive to lower down the honour, dignity, prestige and neutrality of the Supreme Court. <em>Dr Ahmed Hussain, Senior Advocate vs Shamsul Huq Chowdhury Senior Advocate 48 DLR 155.</em></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
