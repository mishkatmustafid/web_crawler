But in the above provision of section 2(b) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act "Body Corporate" has been used to mean corporation other than "Statutory Corporation". So Master Industries Limited is a body corporate as mentioned in the aforesaid provision of section 2(b) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1958. Therefore, we are of the view that the petitioner as Managing Director of Master Industries Limited is a "public servant<em>". Khorshed Alam vs Azizur Rahman and another 48 DLR 36.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 4(1)—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">There are authorities which have found it improper for an enquiry to be held against a person by a person belonging to the same department.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In the present case it cannot be said that the Special Judge has acted with sound discretion in asking the ASP to hold an enquiry when admittedly officers much above him have been made accused in the case. The Additional Attorney-General submitted that since the Deputy Commissioner and Superintendent of</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Police were already transferred there was no reason to apprehend that the ASP would not be able to hold an influence-free enquiry. It is difficult to accept the submission of the learned Additional Attorney-General, for, it is not necessary to be personally present to influence an enquiry. <em>Abdur Rahim @ (Md) Abdur Rahim vs State 49 DLR (AD) 51.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 4(1) and 6(5)</span></strong>—Clear intention of the law is that sanction will be required not for taking cognizance but for starting prosecution of the accused<em>. Abdur Gafur vs State 48 DLR 90</em>.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 5(1) and 6(5)</span></strong>—The case being exclusively triable by the Special Judge, any evidence taken by the Metropolitan Magistrate has no value in the eye of law. Such evidence should, therefore, be disregarded. <em>Mohor Ranjan Pal and others vs State 50 DLR 163</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 5(6)—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">The CID committed no error of law in holding further investigation as per provision of section 173(3B) of the CrPC. Had further investigation been done after the case record was transmitted to the Senior Special Judge after taking cognizance of the offence or passing any order whatsoever then permission of the Special Judge would have been necessary. The police had the power to hold further investigation as per provision of section 173 (3B) of the Code as the provision of this section is in no way derogatory to the provision of sub-section 5(6) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958. <em>Abdus Samad Khan and 3 others vs State 50 DLR 143.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 6(5)—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">The imperative language of the provision, "the Special Judge shall, immediately on receipt of the complaint", leaves no manner of doubt that before any step is taken the Special Judge has to address the Government in case of sanction not being accompanied with a petition of complaint.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is true that in a case under the Act a Special Judge may, where he deems if necessary, order an investigation by any officer in whose jurisdiction the offence was wholly or partly committed. This step also, however, cannot be taken without complying being that the Government may not give any sanction to prosecute at all. <em>Abdur Rahim @ (Md) Abdur Rahim vs State 49 DLR (AD) 51.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 6(5)—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Special Judge is required to solicit required Government sanction on the basis of the complaint petition before passing any order on the complaint petition.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Order dated 17-2-92 and all the subsequent orders passed by the learned Senior Special Judge and Sessions Judge Cox's Bazar, in Special Case No. l of 1992 are quashed. Learned Special Judge may solicit Government sanction as required under sub-section 5 of section 6 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, if he is satisfied with the allegations made in the complaint petition. <em>Tarani Mohan Gosh and 2 others vs State and another 50 DLR 575.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 6(5)—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Public Servant— Sanction for Prosecution— Every public servant who committed an offence under the Criminal Law Amendment Act enjoys a protection by way of sanction for prosecution. Since the Government in this case withheld sanction the Senior Special Judge rightly passed order refusing to take cognizance against the accused. <em>Fakir (Md) Tariqul Islam vs State and others 49 DLR 419.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 6(5)—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">No sanction for prosecution would be necessary when the accused ceased to be a public servant<em>. Saheb Ali Miah vs State 46 DLR 238.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 6(5)</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—If sanction as required under section 6(5) Criminal Law Amendment Act 1958 is not accorded by the government or is deemed not to have been so accorded as per proviso to sub-section 5 of section 6 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1958, the court shall have no jurisdiction to hold a trial against a public servant. <em>Niranjan Deb vs State 47 DLR 458.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 6(5)—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">In the present case petitioner No. l has not been accused of any offence committed in course of discharge of his duties as Government pleader but in respect of an offence in a different capacity as managing trustee of a public trust. So there is no question of obtaining sanction in respect of such an offence. <em>Santosh Bhusan Das and others vs State 47 DLR 519.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 6(5)—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">The question whether the public servant concerned should be prosecuted or not is entirely within the jurisdiction of the appropriate Government. The Special Judge has no say in the matter. It is not for him to decide whether a prima facie case has been made out against the public servant or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">For the present we find no contrary opinion to the requirement of complying with the proviso to section 6(5) if any petition of complaint is not accompanied by sanction as required. The imperative language of the proviso, "the Special Judge shall, immediately on receipt of the complaint" leaves no manner of doubt that before any step is taken the Special Judge has to address the Government in case of sanction not being accompanied with a petition of complaint<em>.

There are authorities which have found it improper to hold an enquiry against a person by a person belonging to the same department (29 CrLJ 1928, 1958). <em>Abdur Rahim @ Md Abdur Rahim vs State 48 DLR (AD) 167.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 9—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">In imposing fine of Taka 300.00 the Trying Court violated the mandatory provision of section 9 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 by imposing a token fine which is much less than the amount misappropriated. <em>Nizamuddin Dhali (Md) vs State 48 DLR 507.</em></span></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
