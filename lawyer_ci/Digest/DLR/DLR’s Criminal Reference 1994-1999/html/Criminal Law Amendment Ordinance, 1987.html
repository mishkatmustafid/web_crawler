The provisions of section 8 provided that trial of such cases must be concluded within two years from the date of commencement of the Ordinance. In the present case it appears that the case was revived on 17-2-87 and in view of the provision of section 8 the trial ought to have been concluded within 20-1-87. But the trial Court failed to conclude the trial within that period and when the petitioner approached the court for stopping the proceeding his prayer was rejected applying the section 339D(b). But in view of the above the provision of section 339D(b) has no manner of application. <em>Abdul Nur Mehedi vs State 46 DLR 303.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 8</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—The High Court Division rightly acquitted the accused in view of the provision of section 8 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act as the trial having not been concluded within the period of 2 years it was without jurisdiction. <em>State vs Md Minhazuddin Khan 51 DLR (AD) 142.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 8(a)</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—The proceeding before the Divisional Special Judge having not been concluded within the statutory period of 2 years from the date of commencement of the Act (20-1-87) further proceeding of the case be stopped and the petitioner released. <em>Sardar Abdul Haque vs The State 46 DLR 515.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 8(a)—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">When trial of the case did not commence as no charge was framed against the accused persons.
