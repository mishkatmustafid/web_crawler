The effect of repeal of the old provision followed by its reenactment will be that in the pending cases the new procedural law will apply because as a general rule alterations in the form of procedure are retrospective in character unless there is some contrary provision in the enactment. In our considered opinion the provision of sub-section (4) of section 339C of the Code of Criminal Procedure as amended by Act No.XLII of 1992 will be applicable to the pending cases. <em>Abdul Wadud vs State 48 DLR (AD) 6.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 2—</span></strong> The effect of the amendment is that the accused may be released on bail by the Magistrate or by the Sessions Judge in case of failure of the investigating officer to complete investigating within the specified period. <em>Amalendu Majumder vs State 49 DLR 204.</em></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
