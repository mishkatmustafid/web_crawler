It may either challenge the report on certain grounds and pray for its rejection or may pray for further action by the court and rejection of the report by reiterating the allegations made in the petition of complaint. When the naraji does not contain allegation of any offence but is more a protest petition it does not take the nature of a complaint and there is no question of examining the complainant and taking fresh cognizance of any offence.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The action upon the naraji petition by the Court depends on whether the naraji petition is made before or after the order of discharge has been passed by the Magistrate. If it is filed after an order of discharge it will in all probability be treated as a complaint by the Magistrate as in almost all such cases it will contain allegation of offence and the person filing the naraji petition will be examined by the Magistrate as a complainant under section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In case of discharge by the Magistrate the only course remaining open to the complainant is by way of approaching the Sessions Judge with an application for further investigation. But if the naraji petition is filed before an order of discharge has been passed, the Magistrate can take cognizance without examining the complainant if the intention appears only to draw the attention of the Magistrate by way of protest, or the Magistrate may treat it as a complaint and examine the complainant, as he thinks fit. <em>Abu Bakar and others vs State 46 DLR 684.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 4(I)(q)—</span></strong>The meaning assigned to the word "public" strongly indicates that a particular case may also be tried in a place other than the normal place where the sitting of the Court of Sessions takes place. <em>Sayeed Farook Rahman vs Sessions Judge of the Court of Sessions, Dhaka and others 49 DLR (AD) 157.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections  9,  17,  408  &amp; 409— </span></strong>Admission of appeal or revision do not fall in the category of urgent application as mentioned in sub-section (4) of section 17 of the Code.

On such facts it cannot be said that the accused was concealing himself from appearing in court and publication of notice in newspaper and commencing the trial was in clear violation of the mandatory provision of law. So the case is sent back on remand for re-trial giving opportunity to the petitioner for cross-examining the PWs already examined. <em>Balayet Howlader vs State 49 DLR 520.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 94</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—Section 94 CrPC speaks of production of any document or other thing but not of seizure by any police officer from any bank relating to bank's account.

Therefore the information asked for does not conform to section 94 of the Code. The impugned order purported under section 94 of the Code and Articles 31/50 of the Anti-Corruption Manual is unauthorised and illegal as they do not confer any power to direct a person to give information.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The information asked for the purpose of inquiry was of a roving nature and was merely fishing for information. If we are to believe that the inquiry was in response to the information received by the anonymous letter then the wholesale information of all cases handled by the petitioner from 1-3-93 to 20-3-94 cannot be said to be connected with the alleged remittance of the sale proceeds of the house at Motijheel and Gulshan. The asking for such wholesale information of the cases handled by him for that period appears to us to be malafide, fishing for information only to harass the petitioner. <em>Imtiazur Rahman Farooqui (Md) (MI Farooqui) vs Bureau of Anti-Corruption and others 51 DLR 421.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 99A</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—Forfeiture Notice— Forfeiture of a book is a preventive provision so that the author or the publisher of the book does not continue to commit the offence. Under the scheme of law forfeiture is provided and the remedy against the forfeiture having been provided under section 99B of the Code, the Government was not required to issue any notice to the author or publisher of the book giving him opportunity of being heard before passing the impugned order. <em>Sadaruddin Ahmed Chisty vs Government of Bangladesh and others 48 DLR 39.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 99A(l)(c)—</span></strong>To forfeit a publication the government is only required to state by notification in the official Gazette the grounds of its opinion, not its satisfaction for formation of opinion. <em>Sadaruddin Ahmed Chisty vs Bangladesh and others 50 DLR (AD) 119.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 100 &amp; 552</span></strong>—A Magistrate cannot detain a person unless he or she is an accused in a criminal case.

Here, we have found that there is no suggestion from the side of the defence that the informant and the Investigating Officer PW 13 had any enmity with or grudge against the accused persons for which they were falsely implicated in this case. The only suggestion given to the prosecution witness is that the accused persons were falsely implicated by the informant for his personal gain in his service. <em>Rana Madhar and others vs State 51 DLR 499.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 103 &amp; 165—</span></strong>Since the arms were recovered at the instance of the accused, no search was necessary, invoking the application of the provisions provided in law for carrying out a search.

The courts below have travelled beyond their jurisdiction in finding title of the parties which is not their business but the business of the civil Court. The impugned order accordingly needs to be modified by way of keeping properties in custody of the receiver till such time as the parties decide their respective title in a civil Court in accordance with section 146 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. <em>Abdul Jabbar vs Azizul Haque &amp; others 46 DLR 416.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 145 &amp; 146—</span></strong>When the receiver is a police officer he could not be dispossessed from the disputed property since he has authority to arrest anyone and send him to jail and also prosecute him for committing a congnizable offence or for violating law and order. <em>Abdul Karim vs Gousddin and others 51 DLR 259.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 145 &amp; 146—</span></strong>The Magis­trate is duty bound as the custodian of the disputed property to take over possession of the same from the 2nd party who is bound by the decree of the civil Court and to make over the same to the first-party. <em>Abdul Karim vs Gousddin and others 51 DLR 259.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 145 and 161</span></strong>—The GD Entry being the earliest in point of time containing facts of the murder though not signed by the information was in fact the First Information Report and the information recorded by the police later on the basis of statement of PW 1 could at best be related as one under section 161 CrPC. <em>Shahjahan vs State 46 DLR 575.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 145 &amp; 561A</span></strong>—Though two civil suits, instituted before the drawing up of the proceeding under section 145 CrPC, are pending, the civil Court has not passed any order regulating possession of the case land, nor a decree for possession or permanent injunction has been granted.
