If a police officer conducts a search within the limit of another police station, it may be presumed, unless otherwise proved, that reasons have been recorded by that officer that delay would have occasioned and evidence destroyed, if he had waited to have the place searched by police having jurisdiction of the place. <em>Kamruzzaman alias Babul Sikdar vs State 47 DLR 416.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 167—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Law did not provide for automatic stopping of further investigation and release of the accused after expiry of the time limit nor for stopping proceedings by the Sessions Judge or Special Tribunal on such ground. <em>Niamatullah @ Chand (Md) vs State and others 48 DLR 148.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 167—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">The provisions of section 167 CrPC being a procedural law, there being no express provisions for its prospective operation, shall operate retrospectively. <em>AKM Azizul islam and another vs State 49 DLR (AD) 115.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 167 &amp; 61</span></strong>—An accused cannot be detained in custody of the police for a longer period than under all the circumstances of the case is reasonable and such period must not, without an order of remand by a Magistrate, exceed 24 hours, exclusive of the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the Magistrate.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In the instant case before us, no incriminating articles, e.g. currency notes, soiled notes or stamps were recovered within the first 24 hours of arrest pursuant to any information given by accused Farook Mahajan, and so it cannot be said with an equal degree of certainty that the unlawful detention of the prisoner without any order of remand beyond 24 hours had no effect on the confession made by him. <em>Faruque Mahajan and 4 (four) others vs State 49 DLR 47</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 167(5)—</span></strong>Stopping of investigation being subject to order of Sessions Judge, no absolute right, not to speak of any vested right of release, could be created in favour of the accused with the passing of order stopping further investigation by the Magistrate on the expiry of specified or extended time for investigation.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In the case of Mohitullah vs State reported in 38 DLR (AD) 240 it has been held that an accused would be tried in accordance with procedure prevailing on the day trial commenced and if the procedure is changed by the time trial commenced the accused cannot claim vested right to be tried in accordance with the provisions of the repealed procedure. It is well settled that procedural law takes effect retrospectively. In this connection reference may be made to the case reported in (1994) 14 BLD (AD) 143 (State vs Ana Mia). <em>Sultan Ahmed and others vs State 47 DLR 196.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 167(5)—</span></strong>The effect of the amendment is that the accused may be released on bail by the Magistrate or by the Sessions Judge in case of failure of the investigating officer to complete investigating within the specified period. <em>Amalendu Majumder vs State 49 DLR 204</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 167(5)—</span></strong>In view of the proviso to this section the period spent awaiting sanction of the government for prosecution of the accused should be added to the statutory period for submission of charge sheet. <em>Saheb Ali Miah vs State 46 DLR 238.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 167(5)—</span></strong>At a time when the report to prosecute the petitioner was submitted there was no provision in section 167(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for stopping investigation of a case and releasing the accused because of non-completion of investigation within the statutory period and as such the proceeding cannot be stopped and the accused cannot be released<em>.

We, therefore, find merit in this Rule. <em>Shajahan Ali Mondal vs Belayet Hossain and others 47 DLR 478.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 173—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">In the name of further investigation police cannot make reinvestigation of the case and discharge the accused person against whom chargesheet has already been submitted. <em>Moslemuddin and others vs State 47 DLR 420.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 173, 190</span></strong>—There is nothing either in section 173 or in section 190 of the Code providing for ejection or acceptance of a police report. There is also nothing to show that such police report is binding upon a Magistrate. <em>Dilu alias Delwar Hossain vs State, represented by the Deputy Commissioner, 48 DLR 529</em>.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 173 &amp; 439A</span></strong>—So far as the direction by the Sessions Judge to hold further investigation into the case is concerned, it is quite lawful; but his direction to submit chargesheet is clearly without jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Per Mustafa Kamal J (agreeing) : By making absurd comments, uninformed criticisms and vituperative innuendos on the judgments of the Appellate Division the learned Judges have placed themselves well inside the perimeter of contempt of this court. By openly, blatantly and consciously flouting Article Ill they have also put themselves within the ambit of steps to refer the matter to the Supreme Judicial Council. Yet we decide to follow the course to caution the learned Judges not to repeat the performance in future.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It will be useful for all to remember that as human beings are not infallible, the judgments of the Appellate Division are too not infallible. Yet in all disciplined and constitutional societies and governments, the pronouncements of the highest Court are given a finality and a binding effect for the simple reason that there must be a finality to litigation at some point and that there must be judicial discipline, the lower judicial hierarchy being bound by the decision of the higher judicial hierarchy. To allow or even to tolerate a breach of this time-honoured and constitutionally fixed duty is to invite judicial anarchy and judicial indiscipline. This will create confusion in the administration of justice and erode people's confidence in the orderly and disciplined dispensation of justice under the Constitution. We hope that the learned Judges will appreciate the merit of judicial restraint and will desist in future from the temptation of treading on a beaten path.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Per Latifur Rahman J (agreeing) : The pronouncement in respect of the power and jurisdiction of the High Court Division with regard to 561A of Code having been clearly stated in several decisions of this Division, it does not lie in the mouth of the High Court Division to take a contrary view of the same. The judgments of this Division as per the mandate of Article 111 of our Constitution is binding on the High Court Division. It is a clear violation of the Constitutional mandate by the learned Judges of the High Court Division. Is it not a violation of the oath of Office of a Judge to protect and preserve the Constitution of Bangladesh. <em>Sher Ali (Md) and others vs State and another 46 DLR (AD) 67.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 173(3A) &amp; (3B)—</span></strong>Before conclusion of trial the Investigating Officer may send futher report if new and important evidences are available which may be considered by the court during trial. <em>Rahmatullah vs State and another 48 DLR 158.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 173(3B)—</span></strong>By further investigation the police officer can bring to the notice of the Court additional facts and even prosecute persons against whom charge-sheet was not submitted earlier.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">But the police in the name of further investigation cannot exclude the persons against whom charge-sheet had already been submitted. In the present case supplementary charge-sheet having been filed against the FIR named accused persons excluded in the earlier charge-sheet we find no illegality in this case. <em>Ear Ali (Md) vs State 47 DLR 405.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 173(3B)—</span></strong>The police may make further investigation in respect of an offence after submission of a report and submit a further report or a supplementary charge-sheet in respect of any accused against whom evidence has  been collected  during further investigation, but the Magistrate has no power to direct further investigation in respect of accused persons against whom the police has once submitted a charge-sheet just to obtain a final report, nor can the police, after further investigation, submit final report in respect of a person against whom a charge-sheet was once submitted. <em>Golam Mostafa and others vs State 47 DLR 563.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 173(3B)—</span></strong>The CID committed no error of law in holding further investigation as per provision of section 173(3B) of the CrPC. Had further investigation been done after the case record was transmitted to the Senior Special Judge after taking cognizance of the offence or passing any order whatsoever then permission of the Special Judge would have been necessary. The police had the power to hold further investigation as per provision of section 173 (3B) of the Code as the provision of this section is in no way derogatory to the provision of sub-section 5(6) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958. <em>Abdus Samad Khan and 3 others vs State 50 DLR 143</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 173(3B)—</span></strong>The provision does not have any scope for the Sessions Judge to direct further investigation by the police. The order of the Sessions Judge directing further investigation on an application by the informant is without jurisdiction and is liable to be set aside<em>. Abdul Malek vs Payer Ahmed Chowdhury and State 46 DLR 455.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 173(3b)—</span></strong>The Gover­nment's decision to withdraw a case from the Criminal Investigation Department after withdrawing the earlier order for investifation by the CID is not illegal<em>. Abu Talukder vs Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of Bangladesh and others 49 DLR (AD) 56.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 179(c)—</span></strong>Since in the sequel of the criminal acts of accused Nos. 3 and 4 by way of obtaining signatures of the complainant in blank papers at Jeddah money was withdrawn in Bangladesh, a Criminal Court of competent jurisdiction in Bangladesh can take cognizance in the case in accordance with illustration (c) of section 179 of the Code. <em>Abdus Sattar vs State and another 50 DLR (AD) 187</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 188 &amp; 196—</span></strong>The alleged offence having been committed in India, the trial of the case in question cannot be proceeded with without sanction of the Government for the purpose in view of the proviso to section 188 of the Criminal Procedure Code and sanction obtained in his case under section 196 of the Code cannot do away with the requirement of proviso to section 188.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">This sanction however can be accorded by the Government even after cognizance has been taken of the case if it is found desirable. Since the cognizance of the case has been taken upon a petition by an order of the Government in accordance with section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the complaint case itself need not be quashed. In this view of ours we are fortified by the decision in the case of Ranjit vs Sm Parul Hore and another, reported in 1980 CrLJ Noc 57 (Cal); (1979)1 Cal HN 414. <em>Dr Taslima Nasrin vs Md Nurul Alam and another 48 DLR 280.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 190—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sessions Judge cannot take cognizance of a case against the accused sent up in the supplementary charge sheet without cognizance being taken by the Magistrate<em>. Sultan Ahmed alias Sentu vs State 48 DLR 143.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 190, 155 &amp; 537</span></strong>—Non-cognizable offence—Mere irregularity like investigation by an officer not authorised to investigate a non-cognizable offence does not affect the legality of a proceeding of a court below.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Investigation by a police officer in the instant case is an antecedent proceeding. It is neither the foundation stone nor a prerequisite of the proceeding nor a sine qua non of a valid trial in the Court. It is difficult for us to see why such an irregularity, i.e. investigation by an officer not authorised, should affect the proceeding in a court or prevent the court from taking cognizance of a non-cognizable offence under clause (a) or (b) of section 190(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the absence of a clear enactment, expressed or implied preventing the court from doing so. <em>Golam Moula Master and others vs State 46 DLR 140.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 190(1) &amp; 156(3)—</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The prayer made by the accused for holding further investigation against some other persons is, in fact, a prayer cancelling the charge-sheet filed against them. This is nothing but an indirect way of reopening the case by making reinvestigation but there is no provision of law for cancelling the charge-sheet once filed against some accused and accepted by the Magistrate. <em>Sukhil Kumar Sarkar vs Kazi Wazed Ali @ Subed and others 47 DLR 252.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 190(l)(b) &amp; 200</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">—It appears that the naraji petition has been filed on a complaint but as an application out of apprehension that the Magistrate might accept the recommendation of the Investigation Officer. It is no more than an application to the Magistrate to be cautious and careful in considering the materials before him. <em>Shaban Ali Mia, Shukur Ali Khandaker vs State, Md Harmuz Ali Mollah 48 DLR 55.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 191—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">The Magistrate cannot proceed with the trial himself as the offence alleged is triable in the court of Sessions.

In the present case in view of the positive finding of the High Court Division and on the failure of the learned Advocate to show before us that, in fact, the allegedly fraudulent document was produced in Cr Case No.116 of 1983, the private complaint at the instance of the informant is not barred. <em>Shamsuddin Ahmed Chowdhury vs State and another 49 DLR (AD) 159.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 195 &amp; 561A</span></strong>—In a proceeding where a forged document has been used the Court concerned should make the complaint. The criminal court should not take cognizance on a private complaint. The want of complaint under section 195 is incurable and the lack of it vitiates the hole trial. <em>Wahida Khan vs Shakar oo Ziwar Sultan and State 48 DLR 186.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 195(l)(a)—</span></strong>If the officer to complain is the officer also to take cognizance then there is no necessity of filing a written complaint by the same officer to himself for taking cognizance of an offence against the accused persons. <em>Anwar Hossain &amp; others vs State &amp; others 48 DLR 89.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 195(l)(c)—</span></strong>Use of a photo copy of the forged document could not amount to the use of a forged document.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It would appear that the photocopy of the kabala which is said to be forged by the opposite party gave only a clue or inkling to the forgery. The action brought by the opposite party against the petitioner is an action independent of the filing of photocopy of the forged document in the court of Magistrate. Therefore, it is clear to see that we are not to depart from the views held by the superior courts including the Privy Council that when the original forged instrument is not used in the court section 195(l)(c) is no bar to a proceeding for forgery. <em>Moklesur Rahman Sharif vs State, Jamiruddin Sharif 47 DLR 229.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 197—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">After arrest at dead of night the victim was beaten to death on his way to the Singra Police Station.
