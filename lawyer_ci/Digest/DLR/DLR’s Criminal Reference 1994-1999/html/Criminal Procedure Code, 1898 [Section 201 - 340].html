Moreover at the time of hearing under section 241A or under section 265C the court considers the record of the case, the documents submitted therewith and the submissions made by both parties. So, all necessary materials are before the court and as the order is passed on consideration of all such materials, there is no scope for passing any order for holding further inquiry. But there is scope for further enquiry when accused is discharged under the provision of sub-section (2B) of section 202 of the Code as the said order is made before taking of the cognizance. <em>Abdul Hai vs State 50 DLR 551.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 203, 204(3) &amp; 436</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">—The order of dismissal of the complaint passed under sections 203 and 204 (3) CrPC does not amount to discharge. So for a further enquiry in such a case no notice to the accused is necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The principle, that an order prejudicial to an accused should not be made, without giving him an opportunity to be heard has no application where the accused is not discharged. A revisional application before the learned Sessions Judge at the instance of an aggrieved complainant against an order of dismissal of a complaint by the Magistrate can be gone into without notice to the accused. <em>Sirajudullah and others vs State and others 48 DLR 76.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 203, 205(1) &amp; 436— </span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Neither the Sessions Judge nor the High Court Division is invested with any power to direct any Magistrate to take cognizance of a case.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Their power is strictly limited to directing a further enquiry into the petition of complaint. It will be for the Magistrate concerned to take or not to take cognizance after the result of further enquiry. After the dismissal of the petition of complaint under section 203 CrPC the informant-respondent's remedy was to approach the higher Court under section 436 CrPC for further enquiry into his petition of complaint. The penultimate order of the High Court Division in directing the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence and to issue process in accordance with section 205(1) CrPC is not sustainable. <em>Yusuf A Hossain vs KM Rezaul Ferdous 48 DLR (AD) 53.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 205—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Considering the hardship of the female accused in attending the Court at Nalchiti from  Jessore the Magistrate may consider their prayer for appearing in Court through lawyer. <em>Salam Mollick (Md) vs State 48 DLR 329</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 205C—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Under the newly added provisions of section 205C jurisdiction has been vested in the Magistrate to examine the police report or other materials on record and if it appears to the Magistrate that the offence as disclosed from such materials is triable exclusively by the court of Sessions he is empowered to send the case to such court<em>.

These sections indicate that when an accused is brought for trial before a Court of law the Court upon hearing the parties and on consideration of the record of the case and the documents may discharge the accused. These sections have nothing to do with quashing of a proceeding. Section 561A is an independent inherent power of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court and this power can be exercised in case of abuse of process of Court and for securing the ends of justice and or to give effect to any order under the Code ref. <em>Latifa Akhter and others vs State and another 51 DLR (AD) 159</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 243 &amp; 537—</span></strong>The alleged admission of guilt was not recorded as nearly as possible in the words used by the accused.

So, all necessary materials are before the court and as the order is passed on consideration of all such materials, there is no scope for passing any order for holding further inquiry.
