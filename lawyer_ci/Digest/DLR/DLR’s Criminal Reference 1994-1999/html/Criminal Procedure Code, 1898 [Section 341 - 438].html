Bail granted to appellant-opposite-party Abdul Momin Sarder on 11-1-96 is cancelled and he is directed to surrender to his bail bond forthwith. <em>State vs Abdul Momin Sardar 50 DLR 588</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 428—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">The purpose of this section is to allow additional evidence at the appellate stage only and not to give an opportunity to the prosecution to fill up the lacuna in its case. <em>Bakul and others vs State 47 DLR 486.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 435</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">—A Court is undoubtedly inferior to another Court when an appeal lies from the former to the latter. <em>State vs Auranga @ KM Hemayatuddin 46 DLR 524.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 435/439</span></strong>—A second revisional application by the self-same party is not barred to challenge an illegal order after dismissal of his earlier revisional application for default and not on merit.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Learned Advocate for the petitioners did not argue on the question of merit of the impugned order. So his contention as to limitation in the facts and circumstances of the case does not appeal to us. In the above facts and circumstances were are of the view that revisional application filed beyond the period of limitation though should not be encouraged, cannot debar the Court from setting aside an illegal order of the subordinate Court in the interest of justice. <em>Anower Hossain and others vs Md Idrish Miah 48 DLR 295</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 435 &amp; 439A</span></strong>—The law should not be stretched too far so that big companies against whom serious allegation of foul play concerning national economy is being made can themselves overtake the law by ingenious contentions.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It is true that in criminal matters the accused should get all protection under the law but it is also important that the law should not be stretched too far so that big companies against whom serious allegation of foul play concerning national economy is being made before the Court by a statutory authority can themselves overtake the law by resourceful enterprise in raising ingenious contentions in order to frustrate the prosecution on the threshold. The Court must strike a balance. We are of the view that the learned Sessions Judge failed to maintain that balance which has been restored by the High Court Division. <em>Shinepukur Holdings Ltd &amp; others vs Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd and others 50 DLR (AD) 189</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 435, 438 &amp; 439A—</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The Sessions Judge would have been well-advised to reject the revision petitions upon the view that the objection as to alleged lack of authority should be raised before the Court taking cognizance. <em>Shinepukur Holdings Ltd &amp; others vs Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd and others 50 DLR (AD) 189</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 435, 438 &amp; 439A</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">—When the SEC was making a complaint of fraudulent acts against certain companies and their directors on the basis of an enquiry undertaken by an expert committee, a Court would be well-advised not to try to be more expert at the complaint stage because otherwise it will be an example of nipping the prosecution in the bud. <em>Shinepukur Holdings Ltd &amp; others vs Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd and others 50 DLR (AD) 189</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 436—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">There is also no force in the contention that once the accused has been made party in the revisional application he acquires a right to be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">As provision under section 436 only directs notice in a case where a person has been discharged and not in the case of an accused to whom no process has been issued under section 204 and when the complaint has been dismissed without a notice to him. <em>Sirajudullah and others vs State and others 48 DLR 76</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 436, 204(3) &amp; 203—-</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The order of dismissal of the complaint passed under sections 203 and 204 (3) CrPC does not amount to discharge.

A revisional application before the learned Sessions Judge at the instance of an aggrieved complainant against an order of dismissal of a complaint by the Magistrate can be gone into without notice to the accused. <strong>Sirajudullah and others vs State and others 48 DLR 76</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 436, 205(1) &amp; 203—</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Neither the Sessions Judge nor the High Court Division is invested with any power to direct any Magistrate to take cognizance of a case.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Their power is strictly limited to directing a further enquiry into the petition of complaint. It will be for the Magistrate concerned to take or not to take cognizance after the result of further enquiry. After the dismissal of the petition of complaint under section 203 CrPC the informant-respondent's remedy was to approach the higher Court under section 436 CrPC for further enquiry into his petition of complaint. The penultimate order of the High Court Division in directing the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence and to issue process in accordance with section 205(1) CrPC is not sustainable. <em>Yusuf A Hossain vs KM Rezaul Ferdous 48 DLR (AD) 53.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 436, 439A &amp; 561A— </span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Question raised in this Rule could very well be raised before the Sessions Judge and the Sessions Judge could set aside the order of the Magistrate framing charge against the petitioner if there was merit in the contention raised by the petitioner and after such discharge there was no scope for directing further enquiry under section 436 of the Code. Since this question was not noticed at the time of issuance of the Rule discharge of the same without considering merit of the same may cause undue hardship and unnecessary harassment to the petitioner. So this Court decided merit of the Rule which is otherwise not maintainable. <em>Abdul Hai vs State 50 DLR 551</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 438—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">When the Magistrate has only called for the case diary for his perusal upon allegations made in the naraji petition that the same will show a prima facie case against the accused, the reference prayed for against the step is premature. <em>Nurul Hoque vs Bazal Ahmed and 3 others 48 DLR 327</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 438 &amp; 439A—</span></strong>Though Sessions Judge has got power to make a reference to the High Court Division, it is not necessary now to make such a reference if the revisional application before him is to set aside any order of the Magistrate as he is competent enough to set aside such order. <em>Farhad Hossain vs Mainuddin Hossain Chowdhury 46 DLR 127.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 438, 439A &amp; 561A— </span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Reference—Since the petitioner could not make out a case of quashing of the proceedings and since no such power is vested in the Sessions Judge the impugned order refusing to make a reference to the High Court Division suffers from no illegality. <em>Farhad Hossain vs Mainuddin Hossain Chowdhury 46 DLR 127.</em></span></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
