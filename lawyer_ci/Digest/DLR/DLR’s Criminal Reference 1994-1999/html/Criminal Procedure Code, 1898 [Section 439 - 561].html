By openly, blatantly and consciously flouting Article. Ill they have also put themselves within the ambit of steps to refer the matter to the Supreme Judicial Council. Yet we decide to follow the course to caution the learned Judges not to repeat the performance in future.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It will be useful for all to remember that as human beings are not infallible, the judgments of the Appellate Division are too not infallible. Yet in all disciplined and constitutional societies and governments, the pronouncements of the highest Court are given a finality and a binding effect for the simple reason that there must be a finality to litigation at some point and that there must be judicial discipline, the lower judicial hierarchy being bound by the decision of the higher judicial hierarchy. To allow or even to tolerate a breach of this time-honoured and constitutionally fixed duty is to invite judicial anarchy and judicial indiscipline. This will create confusion in the administration of justice and erode people's confidence in the orderly and disciplined dispensation of justice under the Constitution. We hope that the learned Judges will appreciate the merit of judicial restraint and will desist in future from the temptation of treading on a beaten path.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Per Latifur Rahman J (agreeing): The pronouncement in respect of the power and jurisdiction of the High Court Division with regard to 561A of Code having been clearly stated in several decisions of this Division, it does not lie in the mouth of the High Court Division to take a contrary view of the same. The judgments of this Division as per the mandate of Article 111 of our Constitution are binding on the High Court Division. It is a clear violation of the Constitutional mandate by the learned Judges of the High Court Division. Is it not a violation of the oath of Office of a Judge to protect and preserve the Constitution of Bangladesh? <strong><em>Sher Ali (Md) and others vs State and another 46 DLR (AD) 67.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 439 &amp; 435—</span></strong>The Addi­tional Sessions Judge did not point out any illegality or irregularity in recording the evidence of witnesses examined by the prosecution or in the trial Court's refusal to examine any witness produced. In such circumstances there was no justification for the Judge to make order permitting to examine witnesses at the time of fresh trial on remand that was ordered. <em>Shamsul Huque Bhuiyan (Md) vs State 49 DLR 37</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 439 &amp; 561A—</span></strong>Session 561A has been put under Chapter XLVI of the Code as "Miscellaneous;" so an application under this section must be registered as a miscellaneous case and not as a revision case under section 439(1) or under both sections. <em>Sher Ali (Md) and others vs State and another 46 DLR (AD) 67.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 439A &amp; 561A—</span></strong>Sessions Judge acted illegally and without jurisdiction in quashing the proceeding of the case pending in the Court of Sadar Upazila Magistrate in exercise of his power under section 439A of the Code of Criminal Procedure because the power of quashing a proceeding is available only under section 561A CrPC <em>Zahurullah (Md) vs Nurul Islam and others 48 DLR 386</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 439(4) &amp; 439A—</span></strong>The idea of the High Court Division that both the courts—one under section 439(4), the other under section 439A—are equal in power and the judgment of one is the judgement of another, appears to be grotesque displaying perversity of thought. <em>Sher Ali (Md) and others vs State and another 46 DLR (AD) 67.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 439(4) &amp; 561A—</span></strong>As there is nothing in the impugned order requiring to prevent abuse of the process of the Court or to secure the ends of justice, the revisional application is barred under the amended provision of section 439(4) of the CrPC <em>Anower Hossain and others vs Md Idrish Miah 48 DLR 295.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 439(4)—</span></strong>Scope of a revision against an order of acquittal is very limited in view of the provision of sub­section (4) of section 439 of the Code and decisions of the higher courts. If the informant could prefer an appeal on the failure of the state to do so then the result could have been otherwise. Moreover complainant has been given a limited right of appeal against an order of acquittal under the amended sub-section (2) of section 417 of the Code only on the ground of error of law. In such circumstances informant should also be given right to prefer appeal like the complainant and both of them right of appeal on the grounds of error of fact as well<em>.

In this connection reference may be made to the case of Kumar Singh Chhayor vs Emperor reported in AIR 1946 (Privy Council) 169 (172) wherein the Privy Council held that "no court can claim inherent jurisdiction to exercise powers expressly taken away by legislation" The instant application is hit by both sections 439A(2) and 439A of the Code. <em>Abdul Jalil and six others vs State and another 47 DLR 167.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 439(4), 439A &amp; 561A—</span></strong>The Sessions Judge's decision is not final in relation to a person who has not filed the revisional application to the Sessions Judge but has been impleaded therein as opposite party.

But he cannot go to the High Court Division with another revisional application, as such an application—better known as second revision—is expressly barred by section 439.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Though the High Court Division cannot entertain any application under section 439(1) from a decision of the Sessions Judge under section 439A, still it can interfere with the Sessions Judge's order by invoking its inherent power for the limited purposes as set out in that, section namely, 'to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure ends of justice'. <em>Sher Ali (Md) and others vs State and another 46 DLR (AD) 67.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 440—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Under section 440 of the Code a party or his Advocate has no right to be heard by a court exercising revisional power and it is the discretion of the court to hear such a party or his advocate.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">If an Advocate fails to appear at the time of hearing of a criminal revision for whatever reason, this court cannot allow him to be heard by reopening the matter setting aside a judgment already pronounced and signed. <em>Serajul Islam and others vs Fazlul Hoque and others 47 DLR 480.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 476—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">A Tribunal constituted under section 26 of the Special Powers Act is also required to follow the provisions of section 476 of the Code of Criminal Procedure if it likes to proceed against any witness of a case for commission of offence under section 193 of the Penal Code<strong>.

The tern 'matters' has wider meaning than the term 'suit' and the former term definitely includes civil suits as well as criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings. And in spite of that, section 20 as quoted above appearing in the Pakistan law made specific provision for vesting the judges of the family Courts which the power under section 488 CrPC. <strong>Meher Negar vs Mojibur Rahman 47 DLR 18.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 488—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;"> Family Courts can entertain, try and dispose of any suit relating to or arising out of maintenance but as section 488 CrPC does not empower the Magistrate to entertain, try and dispose of any suit i.e. any matter of civil nature, power of Magistrate under section 488 CrPC has not been ousted consequent to the establishment of the Family Courts, <em>Rezaul Karim vs Rashida Begum and another 48 DLR 416</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 491— </span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">The girl's age at the time of occurrence may be relevant for the alleged offence committed but for the purpose of custody the girl's present age is more pertinent. <em>Nurunnahar Khatun vs State 46 DLR 112.</em></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 491—</span></strong><span style="line-height: 115%;"> When there has been a judgment and conviction passed by a Court, the High Court cannot interfere under section 491 on the ground of discovery of irregularities.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure could come into play only when there was an illegal detention by an Executive Order by private individuals or even by a Court if the Court had no jurisdiction to try the case.

The sooner these practices of issuing notices and/or allowing the accused to continue as before are discontinued it is better for speedy trial of the Sessions cases.

It is difficult for us to see why such an irregularity, i.e. investigation by an officer not authorised, should affect the proceeding in a court or prevent the court from taking cognizance of a non-cognizable offence under clause (a) or (b) of section 190(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the absence of a clear enactment, expressed or implied preventing the court from doing so. <strong>Golam Moula Master and others vs State 46 DLR 140. </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 537 &amp; 243—</span></strong> The alleged admission of guilt was not recorded as nearly as possible in the words used by the accused. Section 243 CrPC is mandatory, the violation of which causes prejudice to the accused and is not curable under section 537 CrPC.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The order of conviction and sentence as against the appellant on the basis of such so-called admission of guilt cannot therefore be sustained in law and the same should therefore be set aside in the interest of justice and the case should be sent back on remand to the trial Court to hold that trial afresh from the stage of framing the accusation or charge again after hearing the parties and considering the materials on record in accordance with the law in the light of the observations made above. <em>Saheb Ali Miah vs State 46 DLR 238.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 537 &amp; 342—</span></strong> When confessional statement is found to be true and voluntary and it gets corroboration from some other evidence, the appellant had not been prejudiced for non-mentioning of his confession in his examination under section 342 CrPC. This irregularity or omission is curable under section 537 CPC in the facts of the case and the same has not vitiated the trial<em>.

Such defect is not curable under section 537 of the Code. <em>Abu Jamal and others vs State 51 DLR 57</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 540—</span></strong> Power to summon material witness—Any party to a proceeding during the trial may point out the desirability of relevant evidence being taken and there is no limitation with regard to the state or the manner in which it is to be used. The only criterion is that the power to examine additional witness is to be used before the pronouncement of judgment and it is to be found necessary by the Court for doing justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">It appears that due to certain circumstances beyond the control of the prosecution the witnesses could not be produced and examined earlier but evidence is vitally important for the just and proper adjudication of the case. The learned Additional Sessions Judge having passed the order for the examination of the additional witness after due consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case invoking the aid of the provision of law being herself convinced that examination of the witness is necessary for proper adjudication of the case we do not find any illegality or impropriety in the order calling for interference in this revisional jurisdiction. <em>Hemayatuddin alias Aurango vs State 46 DLR 1.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 540—</span></strong> The section is expressed in the widest possible term— It cannot be said that the intention of the section is to limit its application to Court witnesses only. <em>Hemayatuddin @ Auranga vs State 46 DLR (AD) 186.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 540—</span></strong> There is absolutely no material to show that accused Ramizuddin had any knowledge about the proceeding ever since it was started against him, as at all material times he was abroad. In that view the discretion exercised by the Additional Sessions Judge allowing the accused's application for cross- examination of PWs affirmed by the High Court Division calls for no interference. <em>Nimar Ali vs Ramizuddin and another 50 DLR (AD) 162</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 552 &amp; 100—</span></strong> A Magistrate cannot detain a person unless he or she is an accused in a criminal case.
