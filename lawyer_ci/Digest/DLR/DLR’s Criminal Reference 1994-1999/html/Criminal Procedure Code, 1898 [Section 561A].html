The jurisdiction is not alternative or an additional one but it is a jurisdiction preserved in the interest of justice to redress grievances for which no other procedure is available nor has been provided in the Code itself<em>. Engineer Afsaruddin Ahmed vs State 46 DLR 496.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 561A— </span></strong>Inherent jurisdiction of court—Whether such jurisdiction is applicable in cases from which appeals are barred by limitation—Section 561A CrPC cannot be conceived to give the High Court Division jurisdiction to retrieve the cases from the moratorium after they have been barred by limitation. Then, in the memo of the appeal taken or in the submission no ground has been taken that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to try the case or that it arrived at absurd or preposterous conclusion from the evidence on record.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure has not given any new jurisdiction to the High Court to override other laws. It is easy to see that this Court cannot have any inherent jurisdiction to strike down the law of limitation. The law of limitation is so inexorable that a person loses his good title on account of law of limitation. It may be desirable that something is done for the redress of the accused who lost their right of appeal and has very good case in their defence, but it is for the legislature to do. <em>Mr Mohammad Ali vs State 46 DLR 175</em>.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 561A— </span></strong>There is nothing in law precluding a criminal case on account of a civil suit pending against the petitioners on the same facts. The criminal case stands for the offence, while the civil suit is for realisation of money, both can stand together. <em>Khondaker Mahatabuddin Ahmed and others vs State 49 DLR (AD) 132.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 561A— </span></strong>The complainant has the option to activate prosecution of the petitioners under the Immigration Act, 1982 as well, but if the allegations contain ingredients under the Penal Code, the complainant's case before the Magistrate cannot be stiffed by quashing<em>.

Taking of cognizance and framing of charge by the Tribunal under the Special Powers Act in respect of offences relating to possession of spurious medicine, are not illegal and the prosecuting thereof are liable to be quashed.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Ordinance No.VIII of 1982 has been promulgated not with a view to excluding all other trials on the same offence but as an additional forum for trying drug offences. If the same offence can be tried by a Special Tribunal under the Special Powers Act it cannot be said that the accused-petitioner has an exclusive right to be tried by a Drug Court only. As on the petitioner's own showing he has been charged only under section 25C(d) of the Special Powers Act by the Senior Special Tribunal, we do not find any illegality in the proceedings<em>.

It is to be seen whether the petitioner invokes this court's revisional jurisdiction under the garb of an application under section 561A CrPC.

Quashment of criminal proceeding before commencement of trial may amount to stifling the prosecution. <em>Abu Bakar and others vs State, 46 DLR 684.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Sections 561A, 438 &amp; 439A—</span></strong> Reference—Since the petitioner could not make out a case of quashing of the proceedings and since no such power is vested in the Sessions Judge the impugned order refusing to make a reference to the High Court Division suffers from no illegality. <em>Farhad Hossain vs Mainuddin Hossain Chowdhury 46 DLR 127.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 561A</span></strong>—In view of the complainant's case that he delivered goods in good faith on the accused's inducement of part-payment and promise to pay the balance price within 3 days but subsequently betrayed, it cannot be said there is no prima facie case against him—the High Court Division rightly refused to quash the proceeding. <em>Arifur Rahman alias Bablu vs Shantosh Kumar Sadhu and another 46 DLR (AD) 180.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 561A— </span></strong>The inherent jurisdiction of the High Court Division would be available even to a party who had lost in revision before the Sessions Judge.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In this connection this Court, however, referred to the limited scope of section 561A and observed that this inherent power is neither an additional power nor an alternative power of the Court, that this power is to be exercised very sparingly keeping itself within the bounds of this provision and that a revision petition cannot be brought in the camouflage of a petition under section 561A. <em>Sher Ali (Md) and others vs State and another 46 DLR (AD) 67.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 561A-</span></strong> The inherent power under section 561A can be invoked at any state of the proceeding, even after conclusion of trial, if it is necessary to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Appellant was convicted solely on the statement of a co-accused who, however, did not implicate himself in the crime but shifted the blame upon others including the appellant. This Court found that there was no "confession" at all as its maker did not implicate himself in the crime and further that this statement was not corroborated by any other evidence and consequently the conviction was based on 'no evidence' which could be quashed by the High Court Division in exercise of its inherent power under section 561 A. <em>Sher Ali (Md) and others vs State and another 46 DLR (AD) 67.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 561A- </span></strong>The inherent power may be invoked independent of powers conferred by any other provisions of the Code. This power is neither appellate power, nor revisional power, nor power of review and it is to be invoked for the limited purposes.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">This power may be exercised to quash a proceeding or even a conviction on conclusion of a trial if the Court concerned got no jurisdiction to hold the said trial or the facts alleged against the accused do not constitute any criminal offence, or the conviction has been based on 'no evidence' or otherwise to secure ends of justice. <em>Sher Ali (Md) and others vs State and another 46 DLR (AD) 67.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 561A- </span></strong>The decision of the judges that the application under section 561A is liable to be rejected for lack of jurisdiction is totally erroneous and it is held that the High Court Division has jurisdiction to entertain such an application but whether interference will be made in a particular case is altogether a different matter.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The general principle is that the power being extraordinary its exercise also will be rarity. The "total bar" in section 439(4) of the Code, as spoken of by the learned Judges, is only against further revision—that is, revision under section 439(1) of the Code and not against the Court's inherent jurisdiction which is altogether different from any other jurisdiction under the Code. The High Court Division, on the one hand, wilfully disregarded this Court's decisions, and, on the other hand, flouted Article 111 of the Constitution.

In this connection we like to mention that no complaint was made by the Public Prosecutor before the said Tribunal before passing of the said order that no trial was held culminating in pronouncement of judgment on 25-1-89 in open court acquitting the accused petitioner. In the above facts and circumstances we are of the view that the petitioner should not face any fresh trial for the negligence of the presiding officer. <em>Adhir Kumar Shaha vs State 48 DLR 87</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 561A— </span></strong>In view of existing legal position owing to the enactment of sections 265C &amp; 241A CrPC an accused can prefer an application under section 561A if he became unsuccessful in his application either under section 265C or section 241 A.

The charge itself may be impugned but it is not the function of the trial Court while framing charge or the Court exercising jurisdiction under section 561A CrPC to examine the admissibility, relevance, propriety or sufficiency of materials. For, all these questions, especially in a criminal trial, are mixed questions of fact and law which cannot be resolved in an abstract manner without the facts surfacing at the trial. <em>Moudud Ahmed vs State 48 DLR (AD) 42</em>.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 561A— </span></strong>A wide conclusion that after framing of charge no application under sections 561A CrPC lies should be read in the observation of the High Court Division—"I do not agree with the learned Counsel of the petitioner that at this stage, after framing of charge, the proceedings cannot be proceeded with<em>".

But the usual and well-settled practice is that a criminal proceeding can only be quashed after cognizance has been taken and process issued thereupon subject to the fundamental principle that the power of quashing is and should be very sparingly exercised and only to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court. <em>Syed Mohammad Hashem vs State 48 DLR (AD) 87.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 561A— </span></strong>A Criminal Procee­ding cannot be quashed on the basis of defence materials which are still not part of the materials for prosecution. The High Court Division deviated from a well-known norm of disposal of an application for quashing criminal proceeding by taking into account the defence version of the case. <em>Rehela Khatun vs Abul Hassan and others 48 DLR (AD) 213.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 561A— </span></strong>A careful reading of sections 29, 463 and 464 of the Penal Code together would clearly show that a false document must have been actually made and that mere taking of a signature on a blank paper without writing anything on that paper does not make it a document. Since the complainant petitioner did not disclose the nature of the document allegedly created the allegations made do not constitute the offence under section 465 of the Penal Code and as such the impugned proceeding is liable to be quashed<em>.
