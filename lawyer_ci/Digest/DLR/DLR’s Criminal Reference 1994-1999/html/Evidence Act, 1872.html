Their evidence must be tested in the same way as the evidence of the other interested witnesses by the application of diverse considerations which must vary from case to case.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In view of the attitude as aforesaid of the learned Tribunal Judge regarding the police witnesses, we are at the outset required to settle the point. There cannot be any rigid consideration in this respect. In assessing oral evidence Judges may call in aid their experience in life and test the evidence on the basis of probabilities. Thus in a proper case, the Court may look for independent corroboration when it is found not safe to dispense with. <em>Sirajul Islam (Md) vs State 48 DLR 301.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 5— </span></strong>An unreasonable delay in lodging the FIR inevitably gives rise to suspicion as to the trustworthiness or otherwise of the prosecution version of the case. <em>State vs Tajul Islam 48 DLR 305.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></em></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">Section 5— </span></strong>When the alleged eye­witnesses recognised the miscreants and disclosed their names to the informant before lodging the FIR and still then the informant does not mention their names in the FIR, the evidence of such witnesses must be kept out of consideration<em>.
