The Bengali word "bxwZ weMwn©Z" means in English "immoral and "disregardful of morality". The word "immoral" must be construed liberally and the court must adopt that construction which "suppresses the mischief and advances the remedy".</p><p>We ourselves have seen the two nude photographs. The nude photographs are shocking nature of crime and are indecent of the highest degree and also revolting. The photographs clearly manifest that the victims were helpless and were very much fearful. The acts squarely fall within "immoral' acts being the crime under section 9(ka) of the Ain of 1995k. The word "wb‡qvwRZ" of which English Translation is "employed" must not be construed strictly rather the same must be construed liberally and literal meaning is to be avoided to give effect to the manifest object and purpose of the Ain, the object being the punishment of the offenders of heinous crime affecting children and women.</p><p><strong><em>Al-Amin and 5 others vs State 51 DLR 154</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section 9(Kha)—</strong></p><p>An attempt to commit an offence of kidnapping of the informant for the purpose of compelling her to marry the petitioner against her will is no doubt an offence under some other law but not an offence under the Act.</p><p>From the provision of the Act it is not seen that making of attempt to commit one of the offences, except cases in sections 7 and 10(2) that have been enumerated in the Act has been made an offence and that punishment has been provided therefore. An attempt by a person to kidnap a woman to compel her to marry him if fails then accusation against him under section 9(kha) of the Act cannot be legally leveled.</p><p><strong><em>Younus Ali and 3 others vs State 51 DLR 121</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Sections 9 (Kha) &amp; 14—</strong></p><p>In the instant case offence as has been provided in clause (kha) of section 9 of the Act has not been committed and that being so, a charge under section 14 of the Act against petitioner Nos. 2-4 is not legal.</p><p><strong><em>Younus Ali and 3 others vs State 51 DLR 121.</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section 9(Ga)—</strong></p><p>Unless a woman is taken away by a person for the purposes mentioned in clauses (ka), (kha) and (ga) of section 9 of  the Ain and in case of clause (ga) by using force, allurement, temptation, cajoling or coaxing or flattering her irrespective of her age offence under that section will not be committed.</p><p>We have noticed in some cases that the provisions of this Ain providing for higher punishments for the offence against the children and women are being abused to harass the adversaries of the informants by bringing false charges under the said Ain. So the Courts trying such offences should remain alert to the menace of false charges and the accused should not be convicted unless the charge is proved by trustworthy evidence.</p><p><strong><em>Shafiqul Islam (Md) vs State 50 DLR 581</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section 11—</strong></p><p>Causing grievous hurt to a woman by her husband or his relation or anyone on his behalf over the demand of dowry would be an offence under section 11 of the said Ain even though there was no previous agreement to pay the same.</p><p><strong><em>Dipak Kumar Roy @ Kazal vs State 50 DLR 603</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section 17—</strong></p><p>No finding has been given by the Adalat that the FIR and the charge sheet and the examination of witnesses under section 161 CrPC do not disclose any offence against the petitioners under the Act or that even if those papers disclose an offence, there is no material to connect the petitioners with the offence alleged. Without such finding the Adalat cannot fail to take cognizance of the offence.</p><p><strong><em>Mohiuddin (Md) and others vs Md Motiur Rahman and another 50 DLR (AD) 4</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section 17—</strong></p><p>The police submitted final report and complainant filed naraji petition against, that the court taking cognizance upon such naraji petition cannot be said to have taken cognizance without jurisdiction.</p><p><strong><em>Nasiruddin (Md) vs State 51 DLR 124</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section 20—</strong></p><p>The Act does not provide for any consequence for failure of the trial Court to conclude the trial within one hundred and twenty days. This limitation of time for disposal of cases is merely directory and not mandatory in nature.</p><p><strong><em>Habibur Rahman Zakir and others vs State 49 DLR 367</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Sections 20(5) &amp; 23(1)—</strong></p><p>The trial Court without taking steps for ascertaining about the compliance of sections 87 and 88 of the Code directed publication of notice. On such facts it cannot be said that the accused was concealing himself from appearing in court and publication of notice in newspaper and commencing the trial was in clear violation of the mandatory provision of law. So the case is sent back on remand for re-trial giving opportunity to the petitioner for cross-examining the PWs already examined..</p><p><strong><em>Bolayet Howlader vs State 49 DLR 520.</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Section 22—</strong></p><p>On a reading of the provision contained in section 22 of the Ain, it is manifest that in the Ain there is no penal provision. In the absence of any penal provision, the conclusion of trial within 90 days cannot be treated as mandatory; rather the same is a mere directory.</p><p><strong><em>Al-Amin and 5 others vs State 51 DLR 154.</em></strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
