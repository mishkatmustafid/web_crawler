Since the complainant petitioner did not disclose the nature of the document allegedly created the allegations made do not constitute the offence under section 465 of the Penal Code and as such the impugned proceeding is liable to be quashed.</p><p><strong><em>Syed Khalilulla Salik alias Juned vs Haji Md Rahmat Ullah vs State 49 DLR 16</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 34—</strong></p><p>The essence of joint liability is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the accused in the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention.</p><p>Before application of section 34 of the Penal Code to a case, it must be shown that (1) a criminal act was done by several persons, (2) all of them intended the commission of the criminal act and (3) the criminal act was done in furtherance of the common intention. In the instant case it is not clear that except accused appellant Abul Kalam Azad, the other accused had the intention of causing such bodily injury as was likely to cause the death of Abdul Wadud and even the participation of the other accused in causing death of the deceased is not free from doubt.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Kalam Azad vs State 47 DLR 317.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 34—</strong></p><p>This section does not create any distinct offence. It is intended to meet a case where the members of a party acted in furtherance of the common intention of all but it was difficult to prove exactly the part played by each of them.</p><p>In means that if two or more persons intentionally do a thing jointly, it is just the same as if each of them had done it individually, common intention within the meaning of this section pre-supposes a prior concert. There must be a prior meeting of the minds leading to a pre-arranged plan to commit an offence. The common intention to commit the offence invites the application of section 34 of the Penal Code. In offences involving physical violence, the presence of the accused at the scene of the occurrence renders him liable on the principle of joint liability but where the offence consists of diverse acts and it may be committed at different times, the presence of the accused at the scene of the occurrence is not necessary.</p><p><strong><em>State vs Tajul Islam 48 DLR 305.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 34—</strong></p><p>Unless there is meeting of minds between the accused as to the commission of crime of common intention, the application of section 34 of the Penal Code is improper.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Khaleque and others vs State 48 DLR 446.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 34, 109 &amp; 149—</strong></p><p>For application of section 34 some overt act by each of the accused is necessary in the commission of the crime by two or more persons but in the case of application of section 149, if one is found to be a member of the unlawful assembly for the commission of the crime, whether he takes active part in it or not, he comes within its mischief, and so far as section 109 is concerned, it is simply for abetment of the offence committed.</p><p>Now, in the instant case, according to the prosecution, all the accused planned to commit the murder of the victim and towards that end they started acting and then all together in a joint action with common intention caused the murder of the victim. So, in such circumstances, it is not understood why section 34 will not be attracted in this case, when allegation is to the effect that each one of the accused persons took part in the commission of the alleged crime of murder of the victim Kalam. The question is whether the prosecution has been able to prove the allegation by evidence is a different one. We, therefore find no illegality in framing the charge against the accused under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code apart from other sections of law.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Khayer and 3 others vs State 46 DLR 212.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 34 and 149—</strong></p><p>Section 34 of the Penal Code involves a direct overt act on the part of the accused sharing "a common intention" with others for the commission of an offence while section 149 is essentially a vicarious liability for being a member of an unlawful assembly with the "common object" of committing the offence. These two offences are of different nature.</p><p><strong><em>Abu Talukder vs State 51 DLR 188</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 96—</strong></p><p>The possession for exercising right of private defence must be a settled possession a peaceful possession for a pretty long time without any resistance. </p><p><strong><em>Sarwar Kamal and others vs State 48 DLR 61.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 96-104—</strong></p><p>The onus of proving right of private defence lies on the accused claiming exercise of such right.</p><p><strong><em>Sarwar Kamal and others vs State 48 DLR 61.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 96-106—</strong></p><p>The right of private defence of the body extends to the voluntary causing of death if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right is an assault which may reasonably cause the apprehension of either death or grievous hurt.</p><p><strong><em>Khandoker Saiful Islam vs State 50 DLR (AD) 126</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 100—</strong></p><p>Right of private defence—When the accused had scuffles with the deceased and the fear of retaliation from the deceased party overpowers the mind, it is not possible for him to weigh the position in golden scales. In such a situation when he is faced with assaults from his rival party it is not unnatural that he would strike a decisive blow to defend himself and to free himself from the clutches of his adversaries.</p><p>In the instant case, accused Ruhul Amin gave only one knife blow to deceased Moktar Ali and then ran away. The attending circumstances indicate that he gave the knife blow only to free himself from the grip of deceased Moktar Ali and ran away for safety. This conduct of the accused satisfies the legal requirement of the right of private defence. The accused cannot be said to have exceeded the right of self-defence.</p><p><strong><em>Ruhul Amin Mondal vs State 49 DLR 250</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 120B—</strong></p><p>Jobaida's jubilation might be the result of her moral support to the activities of her husband (leading to bloodshed and political change) but for that it cannot be said that she was in the conspiracy.</p><p><strong><em>Jobaida Rashid vs State, represented by the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka 49 DLR 373.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 147—</strong></p><p>All the accused persons assembled to attack the informant. Though only one accused Abdul Khaleque attacked the informant, other accused are also guilty under section 147 because every member of an unlawful assembly is guilty irrespective of whether he had any overt act or not.</p><p><strong><em>Bazlur Rahman Howlader alias Jilu and 3 others vs State, represented by the Deputy Commissioner 51 DLR 457.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 148—</strong></p><p>If both parties are found to have committed offence under section 148 of the Penal Code none of them is entitled to be acquitted on the ground that the other is the aggressor and in this respect law spares none.</p><p><strong><em>Bachu Miah vs Samad Miah and others 50 DLR 564</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 149—</strong></p><p>The two accused had no premeditation to kill the victim and as such the application of section 149 for tagging them to face trial on murder charge appears to/be illegal.</p><p><strong><em>State vs Khalilur Rahman 48 DLR 184.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 149—</strong></p><p>When a particular offence is committed by an individual member of the unlawful assembly, which was neither done in prosecution of common object of the assembly nor other members of the assembly lenew that the offence would be committed, other members of the assembly/cannot be held liable for the offence.</p><p>The word "likely", in the later part of section 149 of the Code means some clear evidence that an unlawful assembly had such a knowledge. In view of other offenses committed, such as criminal trespass and assault, it is difficult to hold that all the appellants are consecutively liable under section 149 of the Code when Appellant No.l Abdus Sattar alone struck a Katra blow on the right side of the chest of deceased which proved fatal and, strictly speaking, section 149 of the Penal Code is not attracted in this case. There being overwhelming evidence of inflicting Katra blow on deceased Aminul Huq by Appellant No.l, the appeal in respect of Appellant No.l Abdus Sattar is dismissed and his conviction and sentence under sections 302/149 of the Penal Code is altered to section 302 of the Penal Code and his sentence of imprisonment for life is maintained.</p><p><strong><em>Abdus Sattar and others vs State 46 DLR (AD) 239.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 193—</strong></p><p>If a court finds that any witness committed an offence under section 193, the court is to proceed in accordance with the provisions of section 476 of the Code of Criminal Procedure because the offence under section 193 is included in section 195(l)(b) of the Code.</p><p><strong><em>Idris Miah (Md) vs State 50 DLR 629</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 201—</strong></p><p>Since both the condemned prisoners are sentenced to imprisonment for life there is no necessity for a separate sentence to be passed against them under section 201 of the Penal Code.</p><p><strong><em>State vs Hamida Khatun and another 50 DLR 547</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 202—</strong></p><p>The accused committed an offence punishable under section 202 of the Penal Code for not giving the information about the offence either to the nearest Magistrate or to the police station.</p><p><strong><em>State vs Md Bachchu Miah @ Abdul Mannan and 5 others 51 DLR 355</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 299 &amp; 300—</strong></p><p>When death is probable it is culpable homicide and when death is most probable it is murder. Mere killing of a person is not murder or culpable homicide, but it is so when caused with certain guilty intention.</p><p><strong><em>State, represented by the Solicitor to the Governemnt of the People's Republic of Bangladesh vs Ashraf Ali and others 46 DLR (AD) 241.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 300—</strong></p><p>When the victim went to bed with her husband and was found subsequently dead there, he bears a serious obligation to account for her death.</p><p><strong><em>Abdus Sukur Mia vs State 48 DLR 228.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 300—</strong></p><p>When all that the accused intended was to strike his wife and the strike by mistake hit their newly born baby which had led to the killing, such of the accused falls within the purview of exception I of section 300.</p><p><strong><em>State vs Abdul Howlader 48 DLR 257.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 300 &amp; 302—</strong></p><p>As there is a possibility that before the occurrence there might have been some sort of altercation between the accused and the deceased or loss of temper by the accused, it cannot be held that it was a premeditated murder.</p><p><strong><em>State vs Abdul Khaleque 46 DLR 353.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 300 &amp; 396—</strong></p><p>The word murder appearing in section 396 of the Penal Code and the word murder appearing in section 300 of the" Penal Code is not the same thing. In section 396 the liability of commission of murder is conjoint while commission of murder as defined under section 300 is absolutely an individual liability.</p><p><strong><em>Arzan @ Iman Ali vs State 48 DLR 287.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 302—</strong></p><p>Motive is not a necessary ingredient of an offence under section 302 of the Code. The Court will see if sufficient direct evidence is there or not. If not, motive may be a matter for consideration, especially when the case is based on circumstantial evidence.</p><p><strong><em>State, represented by the Solicitor, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh vs Giasuddin and others 51 DLR (AD) 103</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 302 &amp; 302/149—</strong></p><p>The High Court Division affirmed the order of conviction and sentence as passed by the trial Court forgetting altogether that the conviction of the appellant was recorded by the trial Court under section 302/149 of the Penal Code which is a completely different kind of conviction from one under section 302 directly where the liability is personal and in the former case the liability is vicarious.</p><p><strong><em>Altaf Hossain vs State 50 DLR (AD) 120.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 300 Explanation 4— </strong></p><p>Accused Abdul Aziz Mina has acted in a cruel and unusual manner and also took undue advantage in inflicting 4 knife blows on the person of victim Jalal which ultimately caused his death. Therefore, the offence as committed by accused Abdul Aziz Mina does not in any way attract the provision of Exception 4 of section 300 but attracts the provision of section 300 that it is a voluntary infliction of knife blows with the intention of causing death and as such accused Abdul Aziz Mina cannot escape the liability of causing homicide amounting to murder.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Aziz Mina and others vs State 48 DLR 382.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 302/34—</strong></p><p>Though the appellate Court including this court may enlarge a convict on bail for reasons to be recorded by it such a convict is not entitled to be released on bail if he is sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life.</p><p>Appellate Division in some cases opined /mat a convict may be enlarged on bail if there is no chance of disposal of the appeal within the period of his sentence. A convict who is sentenced to imprisonment for life does not fall within the pronouncement of the Appellate Division. Bail granted to appellant-opposite-party Abdul Momin Sarder on 11-1-96 is cancelled and he is directed to surrender to his bail bond forthwith.</p><p><strong><em>State vs Abdul Momin Sardar 50 DLR 588.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 302/149—</strong></p><p>Without a proper finding that the accused had a common object conviction with the aid of section 149 of the Penal Code is illegal.</p><p><strong><em>State vs Raisuddin and others 48 DLR 517.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 302/34—</strong></p><p>Though the appellate Court including this court may enlarge a convict on bail for reasons to be recorded by it such a convict is not entitled to be released on bail if he is sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life.</p><p><strong><em>State vs Abdul Momin Sardar 50 DLR 588</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 304 Part I—</strong></p><p>The accused was free to inflict as many blows as he liked—That he dealt merely one blow shows that he did not intend to kill the victim. The killing cannot be termed murder.</p><p><strong><em>State vs Khalilur Rahman 48 DLR 184.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 304 Part II—</strong></p><p>There was none to stop Rashid to deal repeated blows if he had the intention to kill—he merely had struck one blow which eliminates the intention to kill. Therefore, the intention to kill is lacking—It is not a case of culpable homicide amounting to murder but a culpable homicide not amounting to murder.</p><p><strong><em>Abdul Khaleque and otherrs vs State 48 DLR 446.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 302 &amp; 304—</strong></p><p>By inclusion of the offence of the above ordinance in the schedule to the Special Powers Act the jurisdiction of the Sessions Court has been ousted. Now, as the death is proved but not for demand of dowry, the present case is sent back to the Sessions Court for trial.</p><p><strong><em>Firoz Miah vs State 51 DLR 37</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 302 &amp; 304 Part II—</strong></p><p>The accused persons might have given the deceased a serious beating to effect divorce of his second wife and this resulted in his death. The offence committed by them does not attract sections 302/109, it attracts provision of section 304 Part II of the Penal Code.</p><p><strong><em>Shahajahan Talukder @ Manik and others vs State 47 DLR 198.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 302/34—</strong></p><p>Though the appellate Court including this court may enlarge a convict on bail for reasons to be recorded by it such a convict is not entitled to be released on bail if he is sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life.</p><p><strong><em>State vs Abdul Momin Sardar 50 DLR 588.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 302 &amp; 326—</strong></p><p>The injury inflicted did not cause instant death. The victim was alive for about 11/2 months at the hospital. This shows the injury inflicted was not likely to cause death, but it endangered the life and ultimately resulted in death. The appellant therefore is guilty under section 326 of the Penal Code.</p><p><strong><em>Humayun Matubbar vs State 51 DLR 433</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 320, 325 &amp; 326—</strong></p><p>There is no evidence that any of the injuries endangered the life of any of the victim. There was no fracture, the victims were discharged from the hospital after treatment of several days. There is no evidence to show that any of the victim suffered severe bodily pain for a period of 20 days or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits. So the conviction under sections 326 and 325 of the Penal Code is not proper and legal.</p><p><strong><em>Bazlur Rahman Howlader alias Jilu and 3 others vs State, represented by the Deputy Commissioner 51 DLR 457</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 326A—</strong></p><p>The offence of gouging out eyes falls with section 326A of the Penal Code.</p><p><strong><em>Dilu alias Delwar Hossain vs State, represented by the Deputy Commissioner, 48 DLR 529.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 342—</strong></p><p>An offence under section 342 of the Penal Code which is not included in the schedule of the Special Powers Act cannot be the basis of conviction as the same is a non-schedule offence.</p><p>Had the original offence charged been one under Penal Code then the learned Judges by application of section 238 of the Penal Code could come to a finding that the offence constitutes a minor offence and in that view could have convicted the appellant under a minor offence, but here the original offence charged was exclusively triable by the Special Tribunal and in that view the alteration of the conviction from a schedule offence to an offence which is only referable under Penal Code is not legally permissible.</p><p><strong><em>Abdur Rahman and others vs State 51 DLR (AD) 33</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 361, 363 &amp; 366A—</strong></p><p>Age of majority and guardianship—Decision as to custody of a minor pending criminal proceedings—Neither personal law nor Majority Act is relevant for the purpose. The statute that holds good is the Penal Code. If the allegations are that of kidnapping of a minor girl, then for the purpose of her custody, the court has to proceed on the basis that she is a minor if she is under 16. If however the allegations are that of procuration of a minor girl, the court has to proceed on the basis that a girl is a minor who is under 18.</p><p><strong><em>Wahed Ali Dewan vs State and another 46 DLR (AD) 10.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 363 &amp; 366A—</strong></p><p>A minor to be taken out of the lawful custody of her guardian as under section 363 must be a minor under 16. A minor under 18 would be referable to section 366A. She cannot be allowed to go whether she attains the age of 18 years.</p><p><strong><em>Dr Bimal Kanti Roy vs State and othrs 46 DLR 541.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 366A—</strong></p><p>The FIR was lodged under section 366A of the Penal Code. The offence under section 366A is related to a girl under the age of 18 years and not under the age of 16 years.</p><p><strong><em>Nurunnahar Khatun vs State 46 DLR 112.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 366A—</strong></p><p>In an interlocutory matter concerning custody of a girl, to give a final judgment on her age is to decide an aspect of the merit of the case which is decisive of the case itself. After the decision has been given that the girl is quite major above 18 years, can there be any purpose for a trial which is still pending?</p><p>The learned Judges should have made it very clear that the finding made by them as to the age of the girl was only for the purpose of deciding the present custody of the victim girl and the trial Court was free to take its own decision upon considering the evidence to be led in the case. That having not been done, it must be said that the impugned judgment suffers from at least impropriety having usurped the powers of the trial Court in a pending criminal case.</p><p><strong><em>Khairunnessa vs Illy Begum &amp; another 48 DLR (AD) 67.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 366A—Age of girl—Physi­cal appearance—Physical appearance</strong></p><p>may not always provide a correct guide for ascertaining the age of a girl child who is growing up. In some cases physical development may take place which may be regarded as precocious while in some other cases there may not be as much development as is natural with the passage of time.</p><p>Having regard to the fact that the available materials supported the claim of the mother that the girl was aged about 15/16 years except the statement of the girl herself, the High Court Division cannot be said to have acted judiciously in ingnoring the materials and relying on the statement of the girl and their own observation of the girl. The mother has a reasonable grievance to make against the judgment which does not seem to have been passed upon a proper appreciation of the materials on record and far less keeping in view the welfare of the victim girl alleged to be a minor.</p><p><strong><em>Khairunnessa vs Illy Begum and another 48 DLR (AD) 67.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 379 &amp; 447—</strong></p><p>When growing of the case crops by the complainant and the cutting and taking away of the same dishonestly by the accused are proved, the accused is guilty of theft.</p><p>When theft of the case crops by the accused by cutting and taking away of the same and damaging some crops in the process necessarily involves their entry into the case land and the accused are punished for theft and mischief, a separate conviction under section 447 Penal Code is unwarranted.</p><p><strong><em>Motaleb Sardar (Md) and others vs State and another 51 DLR 278.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 386, 387 &amp; 390—</strong></p><p>The distinguishing element between extortion and robbery or dacoity is not the presence of the offender but the presence of imminent fear and also the delivery of possession of goods to the offender, the actual delivery or possession of property by the person put in fear is the essence of the offence of extortion. Where a person through fear passively allows, his property to be taken away the offence committed will be robbery or dacoity and not extortion. The Special Tribunal had no jurisdiction to try this case as the offence alleged against does not come either under section 386 or section 387 of the Penal Code, but it is more in the nature of a robbery or a dacoity.</p><p><strong><em>Dulal Howlader and others vs State 48 DLR 269.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 396—</strong></p><p>Dacoity with murder—When a murder is not committed in the course of committing dacoity there can be no conviction under section 396 of the Penal Code. Since the prosecution has failed to prove the commission of dacoity and murder of victim Tajul by the condemned-prisoner and his associates by any cogent and reliable evidence the order of conviction is not sustainable in law.</p><p><strong><em>State vs Mesbahuddin 49 DLR 245.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Sections 406/420—</strong></p><p>Nothing was stated in the FIR that the accused denied that he would not pay the balance amount.

Execution of the subsequent kabala shows her intention to deprive the appellant of his right already acquired by his kabala which was found to be genuine. "Forgery" means making of a false document with certain intentions, such as to cause damage or injury to a person, to support any claim or title, to commit fraud.</p><p><strong><em>Amjad Molla vs Syeduzzaman Molla and others 46 DLR (AD) 17.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 464—</strong></p><p>Unless there is an element of fraud or intention to cause damage or injury to the public or any person the document or part thereof cannot be called as forged document.</p><p>Mere signing of the petitioner in another's name who did not give authority to sign without any intention to cause damage or injury to the public or any person and actually causing no injury or damage does not come within the definition of forgery.</p><p><strong><em>Abul Kashem Bhuiyan vs State 50 DLR 631</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 467—</strong></p><p>To secure a conviction for forgery in this case it must be specifically proved that the executant by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication or by reason of deception practiced upon him did not know the contents of the document and in such state he was made to execute the document by the accused.</p><p><strong><em>Showkat Hossain Akanda Chowdhury vs State 50 DLR (AD) 128</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 471—</strong></p><p>For the offence under section 471 of the Penal Code an accused can be punished as provided in section 465 of the Penal Code up to 2 years rigorous imprisonment or with fine or with both. The imposition of 4 years rigorous imprisonment under section 471 of the Penal Code is not sustainable in law.</p><p><strong><em>Abul Hossain Mollah alias Abu Mollah vs State 50 DLR (AD) 96</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 471—</strong></p><p>The High Court Division is palpably wrong in holding that when an accused is convicted and sentenced under section 466 he cannot again be convicted and sentenced under section 471 of the Penal Code. In the present case it has been proved that the recall order was used by Nurun Nahar Begum in getting Khijiruddin released from the Thana. The accused-petitioner was certainly an abettor in so far as section 471 of the Penal Code is concerned.</p><p><strong><em>Azizul Hoque (Md) vs State 51 DLR (AD) 216</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 493—</strong></p><p>The prosecution is required to prove that some form of marriage or an apology for conducting a marriage took place and as a result of which the woman had a belief in her mind that she was the lawfully married wife of the accused.</p><p>In the facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence on record, it is difficult to comprehend how such a grown up woman with sufficient worldly knowledge would bonafide believe that she was the legally married wife of accused Hanif on his mere promise to marry her in the future and on such fond belief she surrendered herself to the carnal desire of the accused petitioner, which eventually led to her conception.</p><p><strong><em>Hanif Sheikh (Md) vs Asia Begum 51 DLR 129</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 494—</strong></p><p>Marrying again during lifetime of wife—framing of charge under this section was wrong because the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance or any other law does not render second marriage, during the subsistence of the earlier marriage, void. A person can be charged under section 494 Penal Code only when such marriage is void. In is apparent that the Magistrate committed error of law in framing charge under section 494 of the Penal Code instead of under section 6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961. No doubt the accused petitioner pleaded guilty and the conviction is based upon that plea only. But the guilty pleading of an accused person cannot cure the inherent defect in the charge or in the conviction.</p><p><strong><em>Masud Ahmed vs Khushnehara Begum and another 46 DLR 664.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section  499,  8th Exception— </strong></p><p>Complaint made by the petitioners in good faith to the Hon'ble Chief Justice regarding the conduct of the complainant judicial officer is not defamation as the same is covered by exception.</p><p><strong><em>Abdur Noor and others vs State and another 50 DLR 456</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 500—</strong></p><p>Had the complainant sent a rejoinder to the petitioner and the same was not published then it could be said that the petitioner did not act in good faith and for public good.</p><p><strong><em>Shahadat Chowdhury vs Md Ataur Rahman 48 DLR 176.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Section 500—</strong></p><p>Further prolongation of the case against the accused, for publishing the alleged report which has not even been claimed to be entirely baseless in the petition of complaint will be an abuse of the process of the court.</p><p><strong><em>Shahadat Chowdhury vs Md Ataur Rahman 48 DLR 176.</em></strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
