That having not been said, the condition forexercise of authority under the sub-section was lacking and the satisfaction ofthe Government in the circumstances was only a mechanical one meant only toformalize the order of detention.

It has to satisfy the High Court Division which is anobligation cast upon the Court by the Constitution, that there were materialson record as would satisfy a reasonable person to justify the order ofdetention. It must be made clear that the law which we have declared has nevergranted absolute power either to the Government or to the President to make anorder of detention even in the circumstances mentioned in the judgment nor itis the law that the satisfaction upon which an order of detention is made isimmune from challenge. The power of the Supreme Court in making scrutiny ofexecutive acts never recedes to the background, as observed by the learnedJudge, so long as the Constitution remains operative. The maintenance of lawand order, public peace, public safety and security are undisputedly concerns ofthe State and the Government know best how to preserve them, but the Court'sconcern in a case of preventive detention is to see whether the person is beingdetained without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner.</p><p><b><i>Mostafizur Rahman vs Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary Ministryof Home Affairs and another 51 DLR 1</i></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Section 3—</b></p><p>Pendency of specific criminal cases and facts giving rise tosuch cases cannot be used as grounds of detention under this section. </p><p><b><i>Jahanara Begum vs State 46 DLR 107.</i></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Section 3—</b></p><p>An order of the District Magistrate for detention of aperson shall not remain in force for more than 30 days unless it is approved bythe Government.</p><p>An order of detention passed by the DistrictMagistrate/Additional District Magistrate for 30 days only does not requireapproval of the government.
