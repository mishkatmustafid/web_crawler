The entire episode appears, ex-facie, to be tainted with manipulation, distortion and falsity, although, the real and only beneficiary of the entire exercise is none other than the petitioner himself. The petitioner has prayed for a direction upon the respondents for implementation of the judgment passed by the Court of Settlement. Before endorsing the judgment in question, the Court should be satisfied that the said judgment is based upon sound legal foundation. It appears that a serious fraud has been committed by way of manipulation of the official file, distortion of documents and last, but not least, by making misleading, false and incorrect statements before the Court of law. Accordingly the Rule is discharged. <em>Taher Ahmed Siddiqu Vs. Government of Bangladesh and others, (Spl.

In view of the stated position of fact pourashava election of Cox's Bazar particularly Cox's Bazar Sadar, Teknaf, Moheshkhali and Chakaria was not held on 27.1.2011 with update (nvjbvMv`) revised electoral roll. However, proviso to section 11(1) of the Act No. 6 of 2009 says if the electoral roll is not revised as per clause (a),(b) and (c) the validity or continued operation of the electoral roll shall not thereby be affected. Said provision of law is not under challenge in the present Rules. As such even though electoral roll of 2007-2008 has not been updated the validity and the continued operation of the earlier electoral roll shall remain in force.Upon scrutinizing the information and excluding the false voters the Deputy Secretary (Election) fixed 21.03.2010 for hearing objection thereto in view of section 7(2) of the Act No. 6 of 2009. Ultimately upon hearing the objection on 21.03.2010 final voter list have been published on 09.09.2010. As such, allegation of the petitioners of holding pourashava election of Cox's Bazar district without publishing final electoral roll under section 7(4) of the Act No. 6 of 2009 falls through. Hence the pourashava election of Cox's Bazar Sadar, Teknaf, Moheshkhali and Chakaria, district Cox's Bazar held on 27.02.2011 is declared as valid and lawful in the eye law. <em>Kartic Das Gupta VS Election Commission and another, (Spl.

The fact remains that Petrobangla considered the EOI of BGP (Bangladesh) International as appropriate, and short listed the same as contractor, whereas the Review Panel-1 declared the said contractor as non responsive on the count that BGP Inc., CNPC being a separate entity cannot file RFP. The said decision has been given without giving opportunity to BGP (Bangladesh) International to represent their part of the case. No doubt, there is serious anomally over the ambiguity of the petitioner-company who filed RFP, which is still lying pending before the Evaluation Committee for consideration and above all as per ITC clause 5.1 filing RFP is limited to short list contractors only. As such, since BGP (Bangladesh) International has been declared non-responsive the said short-listed contractor is the appropriate aggrieved person to maintain this writ petition, not BGP Inc., CNPC. The respondent No. 8 being a "sub-contractor" it's right and interest lies with the short-listed contactor CGG veritas, France who does not appear to have authorized the said respondent to file complaint to the concern authority against BGP Inc., CNPC in order to oust BGP (Bangladesh) International without making it a party. Hence, has no locus standi to maintain the complaint before the Review Panel1, respondent No.3. In the present case, the Procuring Entity short listed 8 (eight) contractors and the RFP submitted by them are still lying pending for consideration before the Evaluation Committee, either to be declared responsive or non-responsive. Moreover, the allegation was against BGP (Bangladesh) International whose right to be declared responsive or non-responsive has been adjudicated and disposed of by the respondent no. 3 without making it a party and without issuing notice providing opportunity<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>to defend it's part of the case by adducing documents, which is a flagrant violation of the principle of natural justice.

It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that respondent No. 10, despite being informed by the petitioner's wife that she was unwell, acted in an irresponsible, rude and arrogant manner, causing serious mental agony and distress to her and embarrassment to the petitioner in public. Such action of respondent No. 10, Mr. Khan submits, is in clear violation of the provisions of The Police Act, 1861, Police Regulations Bengal, 1943 and The Dhaka Metropolitan Police Ordinance, 1976. The police, as the law enforcing agency of the State, are to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed and followed by the general public. It is, therefore, not only a matter of utmost regret, but also of grave concern, when such acts of violation are committed by the police themselves. It is also a sad reality that although police excess occur regularly, such incidents are rarely challenged in a Court of law. The facts stated in the writ petition, being uncontroverted, are, therefore, deemed to be correct in the eye of the law. Quite clearly, the conduct of respondent No. 10 not only falls within the ambit of the term 'misconduct', it is also violative of the other provisions quoted above. As such, the allegation of misconduct against respondent No. 10 has been established. The issuance of the impugned Charge Report dated 30.05.2001 is found to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect. Respondent No. 5 (Inspector General of Police, Bangladesh) and respondent No. 6 (Commissioner, Dhaka Metropolitan Police) are directed to initiate appropriate disciplinary action against respondent No. 10 in accordance with law. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><em>Brigadier (Retd.)
