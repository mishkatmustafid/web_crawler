Regulation 13(d) speaks about the powers and functions of the Governing Body and the Managing Committee.</p><p>Although the Chairman of the Managing Committee of the Madrasha is the Thana Nirbahi Officer and by the impugned order the said Thana Nirbahi Officer directed the principal of the Madrasha to allow the petitioner to join his post, the order so passed by the Thana Nirbahi Officer cannot be construed as an order of the Governing Body or the Managing Committee. The order passed by the Thana Nirbahi Officer not being an order of the Governing Body or the Managing Committee it clearly falls outside the purview of Regulation 13 and as such it has no legal force.</p><p>When an order is passed by an authority having no force of law the High Court Division acting under Article 102 of the constitution shall not direct the authority concerned to enforce such an order by an order of mandamus.</p><p><strong><em>Kazi Abdur Rouf Vs.
