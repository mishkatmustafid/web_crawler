The expression a dwelling house belonging to an undivided family is to be liberally construed. We have done so in Sree Jugal Kishori Sarker Vs. Azizur Rahman &amp; Ors. 40 DLR (AD) 150. A co-sharer’s prayer to buy up a stranger-purchaser may not be refused on a technical ground. [Para-10]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) There is no time limit for filing an application under section 4 of the Partition Act - The appellate Court’s finding that “That suit land is no doubt a homestead, but is not a dwelling house of an undivided family” is utterly misconceived. In the suit land an undivided dwelling house is situated. The defendant himself claimed to be residing in a portion there. The suit property never lost its character of an undivided homestead because there had admittedly been not partition by metes and bounds by any previous arrangement. The impartible character of the suit property remained undisturbed when the suit was filed in 1962. There is no time limit for filing an application under section 4 of the Partition Act. In the instant case, the plaintiffs claim cannot be called sale, [Para-11]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) To buy-out a stranger purchaser— Inordinate delay in filing application under S-4 of Partition Act from the date of purchase consequences—What involves a kind of forced sale for the stranger purchaser</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If an application under section 4 of the Partition Act is filed to buy out a stranger purchaser after an inordinate delay from the date of the purchase, then the applicant himself may suffer. When an applicant’s prayer is allowed under section 4 of the Partition Act, it involves a kind of forced sale for the stranger purchaser. And hence, the court would, in equity, determine the valuation of the transferred share on the date of the filing of the application for permission to purchase the share of the stranger purchaser.

The learned trial court decreed the suit in part with direction that the defendant may purchase .04 decimals of homestead having the dwelling hut and courtyard on it and the plaintiff will get .5212 decimals of land out of the jote —the lower appellate court reversing the judgment and decree of the trial court in the manner and on the finding that the plaintiff is a stranger in the suit land, if plaintiff is allotted shaham in the ejmali homestead and ejmali tank the members of the Hindu family cannot conveniently use the homestead and the tank which is a cartilage of their</p><p style="text-align: justify;">dwelling house, trial court ought to have allowed pre-emption in favour of the contesting defendant No. 1 in full—Held : It appears that the appellate court while reversing arrived at its own independent findings on the issues involved in the case -- rule is therefore discharged.

Amullya Roy Chowdhury &amp; Ors. </em>7 BLT (HCD)-80</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Exceptions: When all property need not be included</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The general rule that a partition suit should embrace all the joint properties Of the parties concerned is indeed a rule of convenience. If properties are left out in a partition suit it brooks further litigation. It is true that this rule is relaxable. But there are specific situations calling for relaxation. They are generally (a) where different portions of the property lie in different jurisdictions, or (b) when some portion of the property is at the time incapable of partition, or (c) when the property from its nature is impartible, or (d) when property is held jointly with strangers who cannot be joined as parties to a general suit for partition, or (e) where co-tenants, by mutual agreement, decide to make partition of a part of the joint property retaining the rest in common.

Rafiqul Ahmed 7 BLT (AD)-335</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>Civil Justice in respect of Partition</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a partition suit the rights of the parties are finally determined in the preliminary decree by which specific sahams are allotted. The final decree is lust a follow-up of the preliminary decree whereby actual partition of the ejmali property is effected through the Court in execution of the preliminary decree. In effecting partition by metes and bounds the existing possession of the parties is usually maintained as for practicable and in so far it is not inconsistent with the decree. Possession or no possession in a particular plot or plots of an ejmali property cannot therefore, be a ground to refuse a decree for partition once the plaintiffs title and possession is found in any portion of the suit property.
