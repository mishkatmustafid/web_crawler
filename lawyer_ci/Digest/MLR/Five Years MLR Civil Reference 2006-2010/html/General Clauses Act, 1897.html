The learned Judges of the High Court Division while delivering earlier judgment did not take into consideration two leading decisions wherein it has been held that where an Act repeals an earlier Act, and a different intention appears, the repeal shall not affect any liability incurred or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against any enactment so repealed and hence the earlier judgment of the High Court Division was given “per incuriam”.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abul Kalam Khan vs Reaz Morshed and another 5 BLC 528.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 6—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">From the savings clause in section 29 (2)(3) of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishes Bidhan) Am, 1995 there is nothing in the language from which it can be concluded that only the cases pending for trial before any Special Tribunal or pending investigation under the Cruelty to Women (Deterrent Punishment) Ordinance, 1983 in its restricted meaning have been saved. If such restricted interpretation is accepted then the accused persons who have committed offence under such repealed enactment will get premium without facing trial which could not be intention of the legislature. The repealing Act does not indicate any intention of destroying the liability or penalty incurred under the repealing Act. In the repealing Act, there is specific mention of only cases which were under investigation or under trial but it does not appear from the repealing Act that the offences, which were committed under the repealed Act which are covered by section 6(b)(c) and (d) of the General Clauses Act, would be deemed to have been destroyed. Section 6 of the General Clauses Act will be applicable unless the new legislation manifests an intention incompatible with or contrary to the provisions of the section. Such incompatibility would have to be ascertained from a consideration of all the relevant provisions of the new law.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Abul Kalam Khan vs Reaz Morshed and another 5 BLC 528.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><br/> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong>Section 6—</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">An accused is to be tried in accordance with procedure prevailing on the day trial commenced and if the procedure is changed by the time trial commenced the accused cannot claim vested right to be tried in accordance with the provisions of the repealed procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><em>Sultan Ahmed and others vs State 1 BLC 158.</em></strong></p><p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span></p></div></div>
