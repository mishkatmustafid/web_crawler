<p><em><strong>RE:     REPONSE ON THE COMMENTS OF DRAFT ACCOUNT AGREEMENT ON ACCOUNT OF X INTERNATIONAL LIMITED</strong></em></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Please find attached response to the comments on the draft Account Agreement in Schedule I.</p>
<p>The Borrower’s amendments will involve a change in the structure of the accounts of the Borrower under the draft Accounts Agreement; we will require IIDFC’s input for ascertaining the acceptance of the proposed amendments. We attach herewith the present structure of the accounts of the Borrower under the draft Accounts Agreement for your perusal which will be the basis of our discussion later.</p>
<p>Since the draft has already been approved by all lenders and their respective counsels. Any change to the draft will have to be approved by the lenders and their counsels again.</p>
<p>Proposed amendments will only acceptable if the Borrower due to practical reasons cannot achieve them, which can be justified to the lenders and their counsels.</p>
<p>Attached herewith is the Schedule I &amp; II.</p>
<p>Thanking you,</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
