<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sirs,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Re:      Vetting of Agreement to be executed between Bank 1 and Sales Representative/Agent. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter dated 01 April 2008 and your emails dated 07 April 2008 and 08 April 2008 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the draft Agreement to be executed between Bank 1 (the “Bank”) and Sales Representative/Agent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our comments on the draft agreement are as follows:</p>

<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="456">In the first line of Clause 6 (f) we suggest you to delete the word “payment” and replace it with “fee”.</td>

<p>i) The Sales Representative fails to achieve the minimum target in accordance with Clause 06 (a) for 3 (three) consecutive months; or</p>
