<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the above draft Agreement and our observations are as follows:</p>

<td valign="top" width="48">01</td>
<td valign="top" width="96">1.1</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="336">It is stated in this clause that the scope of services and description of the Supplies is specified in ‘Annexure 1’.The said Annexure was not referred to us. It is thereby advised to X Holding (X) to review the said Annexure before execution of this Agreement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="48">02</td>
<td valign="top" width="96">2.2</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="336">Under the terms of this clause,  Y shall be entitled to charge additional coX if the supply is not made by them within 30.10.2004 for any reason attributable to X.  As  such, if  the L/C is not opened on time X may have to pay additional charge. Please look in to the matter.</td>
</tr>

<td valign="top" width="48">03</td>
<td valign="top" width="96">3.2.2</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="336">Under  the terms of this clause, Acceptance shall take the form of signature in the Protocol. Whereas as per the terms of clause 3.2.1 any complaint must have to be recorded in the Protocol. If so, it will be deemed that the Acceptance is made notwithstanding the complaints. It is upon X whether to accept the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="48">04</td>
<td valign="top" width="96">3.3.1</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="336">Under this clause,  training of operating personnel has been shown as optional. As such, if X wants Y to train their personnel, it is advised to incorporate the same in the scope of services in ‘Annexure 1’.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="48">05</td>
<td valign="top" width="96">3.3.2</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="336">This clause is unreasonable, in that, it is stated that  if the installation work is not initiated in accordance with the terms of the contract then X shall compensate Y. The question is who is responsible for installation, it is Y.Further, it is stated that X shall be liable to compensate Y for any detriment sustained by Y due to failure to comply with the date of handover. The question is who will handover the Supplies, it is Y.
<p>It is thereby  advised to delete the entire clause.</p></td>

<td valign="top" width="96">5.2</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="336">This clause is advised to be deleted as unnecessary. L/C by itself secure the payment to Y, no other evidence is required.</td>

<td valign="top" width="48">09</td>
<td valign="top" width="96">5.3</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="336">As the payment shall be made by way of a confirmed L/C, there is no scope to fall any amount as arrears. The beneficiary of a L/C enjoys maximum protection against commercial risk since it is assured that the issuing bank will pay it even if the buyer defaults or is unable to meet its payment obligation. As such, this penalty clause being irrelevant is advised to be deleted.</td>

<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="336">Under this clause, the warranty period has been mentioned 12 months from the date the risk is transferred, which is vague.It is thereby advised to re-phrase the entire clause as follows:
<p>“Y warrants that it shall be liable for any defect, whether manufacturing or not,  in the Supplies for the period of 12(twelve) months from the date of Acceptance under these presents  and undertake to make replacement of the Supplies, if the defect is not at-all cureable. For any other defects Y shall repair the same and shall also  supply of spare parts in order to keep the Supplies in good order during warranty period.
