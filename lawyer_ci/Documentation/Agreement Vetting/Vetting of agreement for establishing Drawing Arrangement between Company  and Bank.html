<p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter No.__________________ dated 21 November 2006 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the draft deed of Agreement for establishing Drawing Arrangement between Company 1 (“Company 1”) and Bank 1, Dhaka (“the Bank”).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our comments are as follows:</p>

<td valign="top" width="163">Clause 1 (d)</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="351">“Confidential Information” should mean confidential information of both parties that is why we suggest that in line 1 of Clause 1 (d) the words “Company 1’s confidential business or technical information” be deleted and replaced with the words “confidential business or technical information of both parties”.</td>

<td valign="top" width="54"></td>
<td valign="top" width="163">Clause 2</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="351">Please note that according to this section, the Bank may not designate or authorize any other person or entity to provide Money transfer services and moreover, the Bank does not have the exclusive right to offer the Money Transfer Services within Bangladesh. Please confirm that the Bank agrees to these terms.</td>

<td valign="top" width="54"></td>
<td valign="top" width="163">Clause 3</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="351">Under this Clause the Bank is agreeing to only offer the Money Transfer Services and not offer any other Competing Service. This term is against the interest of the Bank because the Bank may already offer other competing money transfer services or may in future offer such services, if this term is included then the Bank will be bound only to offer Company 1 services. Please ensure whether the Bank agrees to such a restraining term.Even after termination of this Agreement the Bank for a period of sixty days will not be able to offer or sell any other Competing service from any branch from which the Company 1 services were offered. This term is very likely to contravene Section 28 of the Contract Act 1872 which states, “Every agreement by which any one is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind, is to that extent void.” Company 1 has stated in the clause that the term is reasonable and in the public interest (i.e. they claim that it falls under one of the exceptions to Section 28) because it will be protecting the general public from confusion and the passing off of other competing services. In our opinion, the term is not reasonable between the parties, it adversely effects the interests of the Bank, because the relevant branch of the Bank will in effect be stopped from providing remittance services for 2 months/sixty days after the termination of the Agreement which may drastically affect the bank’s business. So it is our opinion that this term should be deleted.</td>

<td valign="top" width="163">Clause 4</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="351">This confidentiality clause should apply to both parties and that is why in line 1 of Clause 4, we suggest that the word “Seller” should be replaced with “the parties”</td>

<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="351">According to this clause Company 1 has the right to immediately terminate the Bank’s right to initiate Transfer Sends upon written notice. In our opinion this term is against the interest of the Bank. As such we suggest that the first sentence of Clause 6 (b) be deleted and replaced with the following sentence:“Company 1 shall have the right to terminate Seller’s right to initiate Transfer Sends upon giving 15 days written notice.”</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="54"></td>
<td valign="top" width="163">Addition of Clause 19 (e)</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="351">We suggest that,  in order to protect the interest of the Bank, you should add a further sub-clause after Clause 19 (d) as follows:“(e) In the event Company 1 wishes to terminate this Agreement for any reason not covered by this Section 19 prior to the end of the Initial Term, or prior to the end of any successive term following the Initial Term, the Seller shall be entitled to damages for loss of future earnings during the reminder of the Initial Term or the then current term.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="54"></td>
<td valign="top" width="163">Clause 21 &amp; 22</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="351">According to Clause 21, the laws of England and Wales shall govern the agreement and any action or proceedings initiated pursuant to the agreement shall be maintained exclusively in the courts of England. On the other hand in Clause 22 (a) it is stated that any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of the agreement shall be settled by arbitration. Again in Clause 22 (b) it is stated that the parties may seek relief for any dispute, controversy or claim in the courts of the Territory i.e. Bangladesh. So according to Clause 21 and 22, the parties can go to the courts of England and Wales, the Courts of Bangladesh or refer to Arbitration; this is not legally possible. We draw your attention to Section 7 of Arbitration Act 2001, which states, “Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, where any of the parties to the arbitration agreement files a legal proceedings to a Court against the other party, no judicial authority shall hear any legal proceedings ….” The parties should select any one forum for the resolution of dispute. As this is an international agreement, we are of the opinion that arbitration should be selected.Accordingly we suggest that Clause 21 be deleted and replaced with the following:“<strong>21. Governing Law, Governing Language, Translations.</strong>This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with and shall be governed by, the laws of England and Wales, excluding its choice of laws rules that may otherwise require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. This Agreement has been prepared, and will be executed, in the English language, which shall be the governing language for all purposes. Any translation into a language other than English is solely for the convenience of the parties.”
<p>In clause 22 please delete sub-clause (b).</p></td>
