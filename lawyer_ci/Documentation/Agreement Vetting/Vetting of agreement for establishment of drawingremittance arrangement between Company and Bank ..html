<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Re: Vetting of agreement for establishment of drawing/remittance arrangement between Company 1., and Bank 1, </strong><strong>Dhaka</strong><strong>. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter No. PBL/PJ/ID/2007/273 dated May 16, 2007 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the draft deed of Agreement for establishing drawing/remittance arrangement between Company 1. (“Company 1”) and Bank 1, Dhaka (“the Bank”). Our comments on the draft agreement are given below.</p>

<td valign="top" width="127">General</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="444">The agreement has many vague terms, if not defined explicitly it will be difficult to identify the responsibility or breach of each of the parties thereto.As such, the following terms should be defined:
<p>“Beneficiary</p>
<p>Business Day</p>
<p>Calendar Month</p>
<p>Commission/Charges</p>
<p>FX Deals</p>
<p>“Know Your Customer” Procedure</p>
<p>Money Laundering</p>
<p>Payment Instructions</p>
<p>Reimburse</p>
<p>Remittance Facility</p>
<p>Remitter</p>
<p>Respective Currency Account</p>
<p>Security Measures</p>
<p>US$ currency Account”</p></td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="127">Preamble</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="444">In the third paragraph of the preamble it is stated that the agreement is on a non-exclusive basis. Which means that both Company 1 and the Bank shall have the right to establish drawing/remittance arrangements with other third parties. Please check whether the Bank agrees to this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="127">Clause 1.3</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="444">According to clause 1.3, the web based remittance application owned and controlled by Company 1 branded as CASH EXPRESS shall be the authentic and mutually accepted mean of transmission of payment instructions between the parties. Please check whether the Bank agrees to use this application owned by Company 1 or whether the Bank requires to use one of its own application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="127">Clause 3.2</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="444">According to this clause, the Bank undertakes to release execute payments according to the schedule contained in this clause. Please check whether the Bank agrees to comply with this payment schedule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="127">Clause 3.3</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="444">According to this clause the Bank undertakes to provide satisfactory evidence/proof of payment to the effect that each payment to the beneficiary has been executed according to the schedule contained in clause 3.2. In the event the Bank fails to provide satisfactory proof for payment, Company 1 shall not be obliged to reimburse the Bank for the transaction. Moreover, from this clause it is apparent that Company 1 shall reimburse the Bank <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after </span>theremittance transaction. Please check whether the Bank agrees to this clause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="127">Clause 4</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="444">In clause 4, reference is made to current account of Company 1 and US$ Account of Al Alsari. But no details have been given of these accounts. Please ensure that the accounts are clearly defined in the agreement.In clause 4.1 it is stated that the Bank shall release payment on all remittance transmitted to them by Company 1 within the scheduled time <span style="text-decoration: underline;">under debit to respective currency account of Company 1</span>. However, from clause 3.3 it is apparent that Company 1 shall reimburse the Bank <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after </span>the remittance transaction and so the Bank initially has to make the remittance payments at their own cost. These two clauses are conflicting. It is our opinion that, the procedure contained in clause 4.1 should be followed i.e. the Bank shall release payment on all remittance by debiting to respective currency account of Company 1.</td>

<td valign="top" width="127">Clause 6.1</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="444">According to this clause, the agreement shall remain in force until terminated by either Party by not less than one calendar month’s prior notice in writing. Please check whether the Bank agrees to this term.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="127">Clause 6.4</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="444">Please note that, according to Clause 6.4, the Agreement shall be governed by the laws of United Arab Emirates. We are of the opinion that as the laws of United Arab Emirates is not familiar to the Bank, the Bank may select the laws of Bangladesh or the Laws of England and Wales or any other neutral country instead.Moreover, according to this clause, in case of dispute, it is stated that such dispute shall be resolved mutually. But, there is no provision of referring the matter to court or to arbitration. We are of the opinion that as this is an international contractual agreement, disputes should be referred to arbitration. We suggest that existing clause 6.4 may be deleted, renumbered and replaced with the following:
<p>9.4. a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.</p>
<p>b)  All disputes, differences and claims whatsoever arising out of this Agreement or in relation thereof which cannot be settled by mutual discussion shall be referred to a sole arbitrator or in case of disagreement as to the appointment of the sole arbitrator to three arbitrators, one of whom will be appointed by each party and the third one will be appointed by the arbitrators. The place of arbitration shall be Dhaka. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Act, 2001 of Bangladesh.”</p></td>
