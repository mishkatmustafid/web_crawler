<h2>In view of the above we are of the opinion that the following documents/papers are still wanting:</h2>
<p>a)           R.S. 436 and P. S. Khatian 175.</p>
<p>b)           Up to date Non-encumbrance certificate.</p>
<p>c)           Municipal tax payment receipt, if applicable.</p>
<p>d)           Valuation certificate (optional).</p>
<p>Apart from the above observations, we draw your kind attention to the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earlier we were provided with the certified copy of title deed being Deed of Sale No. 528 dated 02.02.1993. Bank should obtain copy of the original Deed of Sale No. 528 dated 02.02.1993.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It appears from the schedule of the land in question that relevant B. S. Dags are 1702, 1703 and 1704. But land measuring 10 decimals has been mutated under Dag No. 1002 instead of 1702, 1703 or 1704. Please look into the matter and obtain rectified mutation parcha, if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subject to compliance of our opinion the Bank may accept the apartment as security of loan.</p>
<p>Should you have any further query please do not hesitate to revert back to us.</p>
<p>All papers/documents referred to us are returned herewith.</p>
<p>Thanking you.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
