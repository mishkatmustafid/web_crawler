<td valign="top" width="156"><strong>Opinion</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="18">:</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="390">Upon perusal of the documents/papers, we are of the opinion that present owners/landowners Mrs. B, Mr. C, Mr. D, Mr. E and Ms. F have acquired prima facie ownership over land in question. Bank should ascertain physical possession of the present owners over the said land and documents/papers referred in Clause 13 above should be obtained.From certified copy of Irrevocable General Power of Attorney No.11580 dated 25.08.02 (the ‘IGPA’) has been submitted from which it appears that the landowners have executed the power of attorney appointing Capital and Development Limited represented by its Advisor Mr. Mukarram Hossain (the ‘developer’) as their true and lawful attorney <em>inter alia</em> to construct multi-storied commercial building with two basement on the schedule property and to mortgage/sell any portion of the land and building to any financial institution/prospective buyers.
<p>Memo No. Rajuk/Estate/4174/Stha dated 07.12.03 issued by RAJUK accepting the said IGPA has been submitted. <strong>Please note that we have not provided with any Development Agreement executed between the landowners and developer showing their sharing arrangement in the project.</strong></p>
<p>Deed of Agreement dated 15.11.2005 has been submitted from which it appears that the developer entered into an agreement with Mr. W to sell Office Space measuring 3000 square feet on 5<sup>th</sup> floor and 03 car parking in the building proposed name ‘South Avenue Tower’ under construction on the schedule land at per the following price:</p>
<p>a.       3000 square feet floor space – Tk. 1,39,50,000.00 only @ Tk. 4650.00 per square feet</p>
<p>b.      03 car parking – Tk. 9,00,000.00 only @ Tk. 3,00,000.00 per unit</p>
<p>Summation of 3,000 square feet floor space and 03 car parking space is Tk. 1,48,50,000.00 (Taka one crore forty eight lac fifty thousand) only.</p>
<p>Tripartite Agreement executed on the year 2005 in between the developer and Mr. W and Prime Bank Limited has been submitted. This agreement was executed between the parties to meet up the amount agreed as the balance consideration of the floor space and car parking (the ‘property’). The tripartite agreement was executed as per the terms of the Sanction Letter dated 17.12.05 issued by the Prime Bank. It has been confirmed in the agreement <em>inter alia</em> that Prime Bank has provided credit facility of Tk. 100 lac to Mr. W who will create mortgage in favour of the lender upon registration of the property in his name.</p>
<p>Please note that we are not aware whether the title of the property has been transferred to Mr. W by any registered deed or he has created any mortgage in favour of Prime Bank.</p>
<p>In such situation Mr. A intends to purchase the property.</p>
<p>Please note that before purchase the property, permission from Rajuk is required to be obtained. A thorough search should be conducted with the Rajuk and concerned Sub-Registry to ensure the property is unencumbered.</p>
<p>We have provided this opinion on the basis of the documents/papers referred to us. We do not confirm the genuineness of the documents. The genuineness of submitted documents may be verified with the Rajuk and concerned Sub-registry Office.</p></td>
