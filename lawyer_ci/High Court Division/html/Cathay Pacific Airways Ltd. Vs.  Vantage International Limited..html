The words have been employed in a number of occasions under Part V of the Companies Act which begins with Section 234.

An ‘Official Receiver’ is required to be always attached to the Company Bench and, in absence of such “attached Official Receiver”, the Government may appoint a person as the “Official Receiver” for the purpose of attaching the said person to this Court and the said “attached Official Receiver” having been appointed as the “Official Liquidator” shall assist this Court in dealing with the winding-up matters. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">   </span>.......(6)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Company Act (XVIII of 1994)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Sections 255, 256 and 264</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Other than the “Official Receiver”, this Court may appoint any person/s competent to assist this Court in dealing with the actions/steps required to be taken after passing the Order of winding up of a company towards its dissolution. Usually, this Court opts to appoint either an Advocate or a Chartered Accountant or any director/employee of the company-in-liquidation as the “Official Liquidator” of the company. It is for this Court to decide as to who shall be appointed as the “Official Liquidator” (whether Official Receiver or any other person), how many (one or more) OL should be appointed and how much remuneration they will be paid. Section 264 of the Companies Act provides that any Official Liquidator (be it Official Receiver or any other person) may appoint an Advocate for assisting him in appearing before this Court, subject to the sanction of this Court. When the “Official Receiver” (OR) is appointed as the “Official Liquidator” (OL), there would be only one OL; no Assistant Official Liquidator (AOL) or Additional Liquidator (Additional OL) would be appointed by this Court. However, the Official Receiver (OR) may seek approval of this Court to appoint an Advocate on his behalf so that the said Advocate can represent the ‘OR-turned-OL’ before this Court. An Advocate is granted permission by the Court to perform the functions of an Advocate before this Court. In other words, an Advocate is allowed to appear before this Court only for carrying out the Court-related works, for example, making submissions, filing affidavits, applications, reports etc. But s/he is not permitted to deal with the Bank accounts or any other administrative functions. The Bank account must be opened and operated by the ‘OR-turned-OL’ himself; not by the appointed Advocate. It follows that when the ‘OR’ is appointed as the ‘OL’, there is no provision for appointing more than one ‘OL’ except taking assistance of an Advocate to send him in this Court. When an Advocate or Chartered Accountant or any Director/employee of the liquidated-company is appointed as the ‘OL’, this Court may consider for appointment of more than one ‘OL’. If more than one ‘OL’ are appointed, they all would be regarded as the ‘OLs’ as there is no provision in the Companies Act to name them Assistant/Additional ‘OL’. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">         </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                                    </span>.....(11, 13, 14 and 15)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Company Act (XVIII of 1994)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Section 256<u></u></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">The provisions regarding remunerations are also very much clear as provided in Section 256(3) of the Companies Act and Rule 131 of the Companies Rules, 2009. The remuneration may be a fixed-amount or a percentage of the amount of assets left over/saved after payments of all dues &amp; debts. When the ‘OL’ is the ‘OR’, the question of payment of salary does not arise at all, for, s/he is a Government Officer and the Government would pay the salary as per her/his scale. If an Advocate is appointed to assist the ‘OR-turned-OL’, her/his fees may be paid either from the Government Exchequer or from the Bank account opened and maintained by the ‘OR-turned-OL’ for the liquidated-company. If the fees of the Advocate (legal representative of the ‘OR-turned-OL’) is paid from the account of the liquidated-company, then the amount paid as the fees of the appointed-Advocate, if any, and as the salaries of the employees, if recruited on contract basis for the purpose of taking care and looking after the properties of the liquidated company, the same shall be deducted from the Government commission to be paid into the Government Exchequer at the time of dissolution of the company. The Government would be entitled to get the commission only in the event when there will be money available in the Bank account of the OL after payment of all debts, bills and other dues. The maximum commission the Government may get from the residue is its 5%. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                                                           </span>.....(16)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Company Act (XVIII of 1994)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Sections 251 and 264</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Since the work-force of a more or less 20 (twenty) persons of this office (AGOT) is almost sitting idle, appointment of an ‘Attached Person in the Company Bench’ as provided in Section 251(1) of the Companies Act may make the officials/employees busy with the works, if this Court allocates sufficient cases to the said “Attached Person”. Presently, this Court is allocating most of the cases in favour of individual Advocates appointing them as the ‘OL’ on the prayer of the petitioners, for, the petitioners are aware of the present non-functional status of this office. When an “Attached Person to the Company Bench” would be appointed from the categories of the people illustrated hereinbefore in para (i), this Court unhesitatingly would appoint “The Attached Person” in all the winding up cases as the ‘OL’ and, consequently, the aforesaid work-force of 20 (twenty) persons would find themselves busy with works. If the Secretary, Ministry of law is desirous to continue to perform the duty of ‘Attached Person of the Company Bench’ (Official Receiver ‘OR’-for the purpose of Company Bench) under the provisions of Section 251(1) of the Companies Act, he is at liberty to do so and, in that event, either he himself would remain present in this Court regularly, at least once a day for an hour, or he may appoint any Advocate on his behalf. But the Bank account of the wound-up companies must be opened and operated by the Secretary, Ministry of Law as the ‘OL’ and, further, he is required to obtain sanction from this Court to appoint an Advocate on behalf of the ‘OL’ for each case separately, as per the provisions of Section 264 of the Companies Act. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                                                           </span>.....(18)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Dr. Sharif Bhuiyan with </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Mr. Tanim Hussain Shawon, Advocate</span></p><p align="right" class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: right;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. . .</span></em></strong> <strong><em><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">For the Petitioner</span></u></em></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">No one appears</span></p><p align="right" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: right;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">. . .</span></em></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> For the Respondent</span></u></em></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Mr. M.

In Section 249(3) of the Companies Act, it is provided that where the Court makes an order for the winding up of a company, it shall, except where a liquidator is appointed simultaneously, forthwith cause intimation thereof to be sent to the ‘Official Receiver’. Now, a question arises, as to who is the Official Receiver?

However, the Official Receiver (OR) may seek approval of this Court to appoint an Advocate on his behalf so that the said Advocate can represent the ‘OR-turned-OL’ before this Court. An Advocate is granted permission by the Court to perform the functions of an Advocate before this Court. In other words, an Advocate is allowed to appear before this Court only for carrying out the Court-related works, for example, making submissions, filing affidavits, applications, reports etc. But s/he is not permitted to deal with the Bank accounts or any other administrative functions. The Bank account must be opened and operated by the ‘OR-turned-OL’ himself; not by the appointed Advocate. It follows that when the ‘OR’ is appointed as the ‘OL’, there is no provision for appointing more than one ‘OL’ except taking assistance of an Advocate to send him in this Court. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">16.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">When an Advocate or Chartered Accountant or any Director/employee of the liquidated-company is appointed as the ‘OL’, this Court may consider for appointment of more than one ‘OL’.

The remuneration may be a fixed-amount or a percentage of the amount of assets left over/saved after payments of all dues &amp; debts. When the ‘OL’ is the ‘OR’, the question of payment of salary does not arise at all, for, s/he is a Government Officer and the Government would pay the salary as per her/his scale. If an Advocate is appointed to assist the ‘OR-turned-OL’, her/his fees may be paid either from the Government Exchequer or from the Bank account opened and maintained by the ‘OR-turned-OL’ for the liquidated-company. If the fees of the Advocate (legal representative of the ‘OR-turned-OL’) is paid from the account of the liquidated-company, then the amount paid as the fees of the appointed-Advocate, if any, and as the salaries of the employees, if recruited on contract basis for the purpose of taking care and looking after the properties of the liquidated company, the same shall be deducted from the Government commission to be paid into the Government Exchequer at the time of dissolution of the company.

The sanction of this Court for appointment of any legal representative should be sought for by the ‘OR’ separately for each case in which this Court would appoint the ‘OR’ as the ‘OL’. Under the provisions of Section 264 of the Companies Act, the ‘OR-turned-OL’ is statutorily required to obtain approval of this Court to engage an Advocate on his behalf and it is, then, for the ‘OR-turned-OL’ to pay the legal fees either from the Bank Account opened and run for the company-in-liquidation, for whom the Advocate’s service was sanctioned by this Court, or to pay from the National Exchequer upon arranging funds from the Ministry of Finance. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">19.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Following the above examination of the law, I consider it useful to make some observations and also to pass some directions upon the concerned authority to ease their respective tasks and duties. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">(i)<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">                  </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">This Court has been informed that no ‘OR’ has been appointed under the Official Receivers Act, 1938. Under the circumstances, the Government, as per Section 251(1) of the Companies Act, is obliged to appoint, by publication in the Official Gazette, a person who shall remain attached to this Court. The Government may appoint any Judicial Officer or Advocate or a Chartered Accountant to perform the duty of the ‘OR’ who shall remain attached only to this Court and have an office room in the present office building of the ‘Official Receiver’. This Court is told that the Secretary of the Ministry of Law &amp; Justice has been performing the functions of the ‘OR’ for last many years. This Court takes the above information to be incorrect, for, ‘OR’ under the OR Act is a full-time Government civil post and there is no provision in the OR Act to depute a Government Officer in the post of ‘OR’ as in-charge. The scenario might be that the Government, by publication of Gazette Notification under Section 251(1) of the Companies Act, has appointed the Secretary, Ministry of law as the “attached person to the Company Bench”. Although no such Gazette has been produced by Mr. Moksadul Islam before this Court, I assume that the Secretary, Ministry of law, having been appointed as the “attached person to the Company Bench” through Gazette Notification, has been engaging Mr. Moksadul Islam as his legal representative. Since the Law Secretary remains overwhelmingly overburdened with the nationally important duties and assignments, it is very logical for him to appoint an Advocate on his behalf. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.3pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">(ii)<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">However, it would be a better course of action for the Government to appoint, by publication in the Gazette notification, a meritorious Judicial Officer from the District Judge/Additional District Judge level as ‘OR’ who will have the opportunity to prepare her/himself as the future Company-Judge.

It should be noted here that there is no legal basis for existence of such office given that “Enam Commission”; having been formed under a Martial Law Proclamation, has lost its legality and validity by the verdict of the Appellate Division passed in the Fifth Amendment Case. The net result is that currently there is neither any ‘Official Receiver’ nor any ‘Official Administrator’ nor any Official Trustee in the country. I am not interested in making any observation on whether the Government should take necessary steps to appoint an ‘Official Receiver’ and one or more ‘Deputy Official Receiver’ as per the mandate of Official Receivers Act, 1938. All that I wish to record here is that since the work-force of a more or less 20 (twenty) persons of this office (AGOT) is almost sitting idle, appointment of an ‘Attached Person in the Company Bench’ as provided in Section 251(1) of the Companies Act may make the officials/employees busy with the works, if this Court allocates sufficient cases to the said “Attached Person”. Presently, this Court is allocating most of the cases in favour of individual Advocates appointing them as the ‘OL’ on the prayer of the petitioners, for, the petitioners are aware of the present non-functional status of this office. When an “Attached Person to the Company Bench” would be appointed from the categories of the people illustrated hereinbefore in para (i), this Court unhesitatingly would appoint “The Attached Person” in all the winding up cases as the ‘OL’ and, consequently, the aforesaid work-force of 20 (twenty) persons would find themselves busy with works. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">(iv)<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">If the Secretary, Ministry of law is desirous to continue to perform the duty of ‘Attached Person of the Company Bench’ (Official Receiver ‘OR’-for the purpose of Company Bench) under the provisions of Section 251(1) of the Companies Act, he is at liberty to do so and, in that event, either he himself would remain present in this Court regularly, at least once a day for an hour, or he may appoint any Advocate on his behalf.

After consulting with the Hon’ble Law Minister about the reasons behind appointment of a meritorious Judicial Officer or Mr. Moksadul Islam, Bar-at-Law, as the “Attached Person to the Company Bench”, the GA Committee of the Supreme Court would be in a position to properly guide the Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice to do the needful for publication of the Official Gazette for the purpose of the aforesaid appointment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Before parting with this Judgment and Order, I find it pertinent to note here that this Court is usually reluctant to set out any guidelines for the Executives unless this Court finds that it would create a deadlock in the performance of the Judiciary if necessary guidelines are not laid down for a particular Division or Department of the Government. Given the fact that the Ministry of Law &amp; Justice is manned predominately by the Judicial Officers, this Court initially, after filing of this application on 13.05.2018, asked Md. Moksadul Islam to sit with the concerned officials of the aforesaid Ministry to resolve the issue. Probably, in October, 2018, Mr. Islam informed this Court that the Deputy Secretary (Admin) of the Ministry of Law &amp; Justice has opined that if this Court passes appropriate Order to pay off Mr. Islam’s salary, then, the Ministry will take necessary steps for payment of his salary. In the light of the fact that this Court cannot direct the Government to pay off Mr. Islam’s salary, this Court made some observation with regard to the remuneration of Mr. Islam as per the desire of the Law Ministry and Mr. Islam, in course of passing a Judicial Order in a different Company Matter. In the meanwhile, whenever Mr. Islam was appearing before this Court in other matters (which is quite significant in number) as the legal representative of the ‘OR-turned-OL’, Mr. Islam kept informing this Court that since he is not getting remuneration, it has become difficult for him to assist this Court and used to implore to find a permanent solution of this impasse. Again, on 08.04.2019, when Mr. Islam was asked by this Court to appear and assist in the Company Matter No. 105 of 2000, he informed this Court that he is present in the Court as per the Court’s verbal direction, but not to represent the Law Secretary. He goes on to state that he has met the Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice and had a long discussion for two hours but without any result. At this juncture, I told him that after consulting the issue with my brother-Judges, who previously served as the Law Secretary, an appropriate Order shall be passed on 23.05.2019 and directed Mr. Islam to keep trying to resolve the matter by placing the interpretation of the relevant legal provisions before the Hon’ble Law Minister and Law Secretary. Today, when the matter is taken up, I asked Mr. Islam as to whether he has shared the legal issues with the Hon’ble Law Minister and the Law Secretary with regard to regularization of his appointment in each of the Company cases as the ‘Legal Representative’ of the ‘Official Receiver’ upon appointing the ‘Official Receiver’ or, as the Legal Representative of the ‘Attached Person to the Company Bench’ if any one (the Law Secretary or any officer) has been so appointed by publication of the Gazette Notification. Mr. Islam, in reply thereto, beseeched this Court to pass a detailed Judgment on this issue upon framing some guidelines for the Ministry of law and Justice, so that all the concerned persons and authorities may be benefitted. It is under this circumstance that this Court carried out the above exercise.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">21.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">This Court, therefore, makes it clear that the aim of this exercise was to ease the works of the Law Ministry as well as the duty of this Court and I earnestly hope that the Ministry of Law and Justice would help this Court to resolve the dilemma it has been facing for decades. Also, Mr. M. Moksadul Islam, Bar-at-law, an Advocate of this Court, would no longer have to face the embarrassment which he has been enduring for long by this Court in answering the questions as to how and under what provisions of law his salary from this Court may be paid, as asked by this Court, whenever any new Judge is given the jurisdiction of the Company Bench.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">22.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">The Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice is directed to file an affidavit-of-compliance on or before 27<sup>th</sup> August, 2019 and the Registrar General of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh is directed to send this Order to the Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice so as to assist this Court towards expeditious resolution of the matter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">23.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Let the matter be posted in the daily cause list on 27.08.2019 under the column “For Order”.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 27.0pt; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 27.0pt; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Ed. </span></strong></p><div style="mso-element: footnote-list;"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><br clear="all"/><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><!--[endif]--><div id="ftn1" style="mso-element: footnote;"><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="file:///H:/Issue_November_19(2)/Issue%20__November__19(2)__Com.%20Mat.%20_43%20of%2007_M.%20Khurshid%20Alam%20Sarker,%20J.__4.doc#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1;" title=""><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Company Matter No. 43 of 2007</span></u></strong></a></p></div></div></div></div>
