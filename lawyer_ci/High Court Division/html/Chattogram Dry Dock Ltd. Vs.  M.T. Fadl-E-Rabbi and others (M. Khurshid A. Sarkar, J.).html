He argues that this applicant has purchased the vessel in auction from the custody of the Court as per auction notice published by the Court “as is where is basis”, in other words, as per the present condition of the vessel whatever and wherever it is </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: SutonnyMJ; mso-bidi-font-family: Mangal;">(‡hLv‡b †h Ae¯’vq †m Ae¯’vi wfwË‡Z),</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> and as such Section 18 of the Customs Act is not applicable in the instant case for the applicant. He submits that customs duty is primarily leviable on goods ‘imported’ into or exported from Bangladesh. In an effort to show the literal meaning of the word ‘importation’, Mr. Alam places its meaning from Black’s Law Dictionary, and submits that ‘importation’ is defined therein as ‘the act of bringing goods and merchandise into a country from a foreign country’ and ‘imported’ in general, has the same meaning in the tariff laws that its etymology shows, in porto, to carry in. That is to say, to ‘import’ is to bear or carry into, for, an imported article is one brought or carried into a country from abroad, Mr. Alam continues to submit. In support of his above arguments, he also refers to Wharton's Law Lexicon to show the meaning of the terminology 'import' and submits that the meaning of the word is 'goods or produce brought into a country from abroad'. Thereafter, Mr. Kamal-Ul Alam places before this Court the provisions of Section 2(c) of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1950 (shortly, Imports and Exports Act) and submits that the aforesaid law defines the terminology ‘import’ as ‘bringing into Bangladesh’. Mr. Alam professes that under Section 3(1) of the aforesaid Act, the Government by order declares Import Policy each year and under Section 3(2) thereof no goods can be ‘imported’ without a license to be issued by the Chief Controller or any other officer of the Government. Mr. Kamal-Ul Alam argues that when in compliance with the aforesaid provisions of law any goods is imported in Bangladesh, then, as per the requirements of the provisions of Section 43, 44 and 45 of the Customs Act, the conveyance bringing such goods in Bangladesh has to declare and file import manifest specifying all goods ‘imported’ in such conveyances to the Port Authorities. He contends that since it is an admitted position that the defendant no. 1-vessel has entered into Bangladesh as an ocean-going-liner-vessel carrying cargos from abroad, therefore, after discharging the cargo in the ordinary course, it would have left the Port area upon obtaining Port clearance under Sections 51, 52 and 53 of the Customs Act. He strenuously argues that the defendant no. 1-vessel has never been brought into Bangladesh as ‘imported goods’, as defined in the provisions of Sections 2(c), 3(1) and 3(2) of the Imports and Exports Act and as such Section18 of the Customs Act, under which customs duties is leviable on ‘imported goods’, has no manner of application whatsoever for imposition and assessment of customs duties on the defendant no. 1-vessel for not being an ‘imported goods’ and as such the auction<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>purchaser is not liable under any provision of law to pay any customs duty whatsoever on his auction-purchased defendant no. 1-vessel.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">            </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Mr. Alam, then, takes me through Section 79 of the Customs Act and submits that as per the aforesaid provision, a Bill of Entry must be submitted by the owner of any imported goods for home consumption or warehousing or for any other approved purpose by delivery to the appropriate officer, but since the vessel has not been imported by the auction purchaser, question of submitting of any Bill of Entry to the customs house does not arise and calculating any customs duty does not arise either. Therefore, as Mr. Kamal-Ul Alam continues to argue, the Assistant Commissioner of Customs, Chattogram was wholly wrong in law in asserting that non-filing of Bill of Entry under Section 79 of the Customs Act by the defendant no. 1-vessel prevented the customs authority on earlier occasions in determining and assessing the customs duties on the defendant no. 1-vessel inasmuch as under Section 79 of the Customs Act, a Bill of Entry is required to be delivered to the appropriate officer of customs by the owner of any ‘imported goods’, and in view of the admitted fact that the defendant no. 1-vessel has not been brought into Bangladesh as goods or scrap-vessel, the requirement of Section 79 of the Customs Act for filing Bill of Entry for the ‘imported goods’ has no manner of application in the case of defendant no. 1-vessel.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">10.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">He next submits that the H.S.

Fadl-E-Rabbi. He argues that since the auction purchaser is not importer of any vessel, rather purchaser of a vessel from the home market, as such he is not liable to pay any import duty.

Before incorporation of this provision in the Act of Parliament, namely, the Evidence Act, 1872, the doctrine of estoppels was evolved by the Courts on the principles of equity in order to avoid injustice so that where one party by his words/conducts enticed another party to do something, that conducts/words would be binding upon the former who would not be entitled to go back from it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">17.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Black’s Law Dictionary provides the following meaning of the word ‘estoppel’.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .75in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">“A bar that prevents one from asserting a claim or right that contradicts what one has said or done before or that has been legally established as true.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">18.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Thus, the meaning of estoppel that this Court finds from the statute book and Black’s Law Dictionary is that a party is prevented by his own acts from claiming a right to the detriment of the other party who was entitled to rely on such conduct and has acted accordingly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">19.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Now, it is to be seen by me whether the Chattogram Customs Authority had previously made any representation to the auction-purchaser and whether the auction-purchaser has acted on the basis of the said representation. Upon making a thorough scrutiny of the Order-sheets together with the administrative file of this suit, it transpires that the formats of the notice of auction in Bengali and English were prepared by the Marshall on 08.05.2018. The said format contains two parts; one part is auction notice for publication in the daily newspapers and the other part is under the heading of “Further Conditions” which is for information of the participants who are present in the auction-room. As many as five “Further Conditions” have been stipulated and condition no. 3 reads as follows: <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“Bidding money offered for the purchase of the ship will be exclusive of outstanding Port dues, Customs duties, Sale tax and other charges payable to the Government. Those dues, duty, tax and other charges shall be paid by the purchaser”</em>. On a query by me to the team of Marshall, it was confirmed by them that before receiving the auction-bids (proposals) from the bidders, a copy of the “Further Conditions” was disseminated among them. Moreover, the conditions were read out loudly in the auction-room. The concerned officials informed me that the practice of non-mentioning the above-mentioned conditions in the auction-notice published in the newspapers is being followed since time immemorial i.e. from the date of establishment of the Admiralty Court. The above contention of the office of the Marshall appears to me to be true for the reason that although there is no mentioning about the payment of Port-dues, sale tax and other charges in the auction-notice published in the Daily Financial Express and the Daily Purbakon on 26.05.2018, the auction-purchaser after becoming the highest bidder in the auction held on 29.05.2018 paid Port dues, sale tax, watchmen’s charge etc. But the auction-purchaser is not willing to pay the customs duties on the plea that there was no mentioning about the payment of customs duties in the auction notice published in the newspapers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The logical question that arises in this circumstance is that if the auction-purchaser wants to employ the doctrine of estoppels as a shield on the ground of non-mentioning of the payment of customs duties in the auction notice, then, resorting to the same doctrine, he should not have paid off all other dues, taxes and charges, such as sale tax, Port dues and wage men’s charges which were also not mentioned in the auction notice published in the newspapers. The true scenario, as surfaces from the conducts of the auction-purchaser and from the explanations received from the team of Marshall, is that it was notified to all the bidders that they were at liberty either to submit their proposal agreeing with these “Further Conditions” or they might abstain from submitting their proposals. Therefore, it is amply clear to me that upon accepting the above conditions, all the bidders have participated in the bid and this applicant became the highest bidder upon agreeing with and accepting the condition that customs duties and other Government dues are to be paid off on top of his offer of Taka 8,50,00,000/-. More so, on 10.07.2018, since the offer of the highest bidder was accepted and confirmed by this Court subject to the payment of all the Government tax, duties and charges, and given the fact that the auction-purchaser (applicant) received this Court’s aforesaid Order dated 10.07.2018 without raising any objection thereto, the auction-purchaser evidently had reconfirmed his position that he was purchasing the vessel upon agreeing with the conditions of payment of all the Government dues and, that is how, he had waived his right to question about payment of Government dues, which includes customs duties.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">21.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">So, clearly it is not the scenario that the auction-purchaser has acted (i.e. participated in the auction and, later on, accepted this Court’s Order dated 30.07.2018) on a representation which was not disclosed/notified to him. The true fact is that the auction-purchaser is taking a chance of the wordings employed by a novice Customs Officer of the rank of Assistant Commissioner (Assistant Commissioner is the entry post of the BCS-Customs) who wrote to the Marshall twice (firstly on 09.11.2019 following the first auction and, second time, on 23.07.2018 following the second auction) in the following words </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: SutonnyMJ; mso-bidi-font-family: Mangal;">ÔÔ........... †h‡nZy GB RvnvRwU ïéYq‡bi Rb¨ GB `ß‡i `vwLj Kiv nqwb weavq G ch©v‡q ïé Kivw` Av`v‡qi †Kvb my‡hvM/cvIbv bvB ..........ÕÕ,</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> plain meaning of which is that since the vessel has not been presented before the customs office (i.e. since no Bill of Entry has been submitted), at this stage there is no scope for the customs authority to make assessment of the customs duties. The tenderfoot having been under an impression that without receiving a Bill of Entry, she is not in a position to assess the customs duties. In any event, no one with ordinary prudence would interpret the afore-quoted Bengali sentences that there is no requirement of payment of customs duties or there is no claim of customs duties against the vessel. If the auction-purchaser wants to capitalize the expression “cvIbv bvB” (there is no dues) embodied in the aforesaid letter, it is my view that since the phraseology was employed after the mark of slash (/), it does not make any sense. The wordings might have been inserted by the novice officer herself at the request of the auction-purchaser or by the concerned clerk at the behest of the auction-purchaser with an ill motive of taking undue advantage thereof. Whatever the case may be, subsequently when the aforesaid junior customs officer herself comes up with proper explanations about her own letter, there cannot be any debate on the meaning of the wordings employed by her. It is my considered view that since the aforesaid letters were not written before the holding of the auction, and since the letters were not addressed/written to the auction-purchaser by the customs authority but was rather written specifically addressing the Marshall, therefore, no sensible person would argue that the auction-purchaser had made the offer on the basis of the aforesaid letters.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">22.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Two cases, namely, Collector of Customs, Chattogram Vs A.

In the cited Indian case, when Guzrat Estate Financial Corporation, being a statutory body, declined to disburse loan-money to Messrs Lotus Hotel Private Ltd despite execution of mortgage documents by the latter in favour of the former resulting in stoppage of construction of a 4-star hotel in the mid-path causing huge financial loss, the Indian Supreme Court held that principle of promissory estoppel shall stop the Corporation from backing out of its obligation. In the cited landmark case of our jurisdiction (A. Hannan’s case), the Government by publishing Gazette Notification declared that if the importers open their L/Cs for importation of sugar within 31.10.1984 and the ship arrived within 30.11.1984, they shall enjoy certain amount of exemption in paying customs duty and sales tax. Subsequently, the Government withdrew the facility on 06.11.1984. Although the importer (A. Hannan) opened his L/C within time and the vessel carrying sugar arrived on 24.11.1984, the customs authority declined to grant the exemption to the importer. The Appellate Division in the circumstances held that since the importer acted upon the Government’s assurance, the Government cannot retrace its steps.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">23.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">While <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ratio</em> laid down in the case of Indian Supreme Court has only persuasive value in adjudicating upon any case by the Courts of Bangladesh, the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ratio</em> laid down in the celebrated case of A.

All that it require is that the goods must be imported, and the meaning of the words ‘import’ or ‘importation’ given in the Black’s Law Dictionary, Wharton’s Law Lexicon and in Section 2(c) of the Imports and Exports Act is that when any goods/produce is brought into the country from a foreign country, it would be called ‘import’/ ‘importation’.

From a careful examination of the relevant provisions of the Customs Act, namely, Sections 18, 23, 43, 44, 45, 51, 52, 53 and 79 and relevant provisions of the Import and Export Act, it leads me to hold that when any foreign thing, object, goods, which would include a foreign vessel, is brought into or comes in Bangladesh, be it without or with Bills of Entry, it is dutiable, as per the prevailing rate prescribed in the Bangladesh Customs Tariff, if the same is picked up/collected/arrested for the purpose of home consumption, warehousing, selling to local or foreign national/country or for any other lawful purpose.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">30.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">I find it pertinent to record here that, initially, the learned Advocate Mr. Golam Arshed was trying his best to make out a case in his favour showing an obsolete Bangladesh Customs Tariff containing 0% duties on this item. But when this Court, upon obtaining an updated/appropriate copy of the Bangladesh Customs Tariff, suggested him to pay the customs duties claimed by the customs authority and, thereby, take the delivery of the vessel without wasting this Court’s valuable time on this issue, few days later, he engaged Mr. Kamal-Ul Alam as the Senior Counsel in this matter. Mr. Alam, then, put his best effort to demonstrate the advocacy of the stature of a true Senior Counsel by presenting some legal issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However, after concluding the hearing of the instant application at length, this Court expressed its views in open Court to the filing-lawyer Mr. Golam Arshed (Mr. Kamal-Ul Alam was not present at that point of time) that this Court does not find any substance in this application and the learned Advocate may non-prosecute the application to assist this Court in saving its valuable hours which would require delivering a full-fledged Judgment. I reminded him that since the issue raised by him has been finally settled by the Apex Court of our jurisdiction in the case of Bashiruddin Ahmed Vs Secretary, Bangladesh Government, 3 BLC(AD) 179, there is no point of insisting upon this Court to deliver a detailed Judgment on the same issue.

It is to be borne in mind by the learned Advocates that since the number of Judges of this country are very negligible in comparison to the case-load, it has become very difficult for the learned Judges of this country to dispose of the substantive suit/matters and, therefore, the learned Advocates should not expect detailed Judgment on the side-issue of a suit/matter, which is already well-settled by the Apex Court of our jurisdiction.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">32.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">33.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In the result, the Rule issued by this Court in this application is discharged, however, without any order as to costs.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">34.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The auction-purchaser is hereby directed to take delivery of the vessel upon payment of the customs duties and other dues to the Government, if incurred any in the meanwhile.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 27.0pt; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 27.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Ed.</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 27.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></strong></p><div style="mso-element: footnote-list;"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><br clear="all"/><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><!--[endif]--><div id="ftn1" style="mso-element: footnote;"><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="file:///C:/Users/Hp/Downloads/masum/Issue_January_2020(1)/Issue%20__January__2020(1)_Admiralty%20Suit%20No.92%20of%2016_M.%20Khurshid%20Alam%20Sarker,%20J.__3.doc#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1;" title=""><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Admiralty Suit No. 92 of 2016</span></u></strong></a></p></div></div></div></div>
