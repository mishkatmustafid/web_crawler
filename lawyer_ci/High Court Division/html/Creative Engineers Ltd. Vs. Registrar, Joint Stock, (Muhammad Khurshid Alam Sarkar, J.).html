On the other hand, for giving relief under Section 396 relieving the accused person from fine, carrying out inquiry by this Court as to whether the accused person “acted honestly and reasonably” is also not a easy business for this Court given that since it has not been possible for the Legislature to provide particular set of facts or circumstances based on which it can be said that the accused person acted honestly or reasonably, therefore, this Court also can not set out any guideline for determining “the honest and reasonable action” of the accused person. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">17.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">Nonetheless, from the maxim of equity <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“He who comes into equity must come with clean hands”</em>, it has by now become a well-settled principle of our jurisdiction that if an applicant comes to the Court with clean hands, he deserves mercy of, and remedy from, the Court. For example, when a company who for the first time has defaulted in complying with the provisions of Section 151 (1) of the Companies Act either because of ignorance of law as to the company’s legal obligation of filing Shares Allotment Return to the RJSC within sixty days or the company was aware of its legal obligation, but due to some bonafide mistake the document was not filed within the prescribed time, the company may claim that it has come before this Court with clean hands. In ascertaining as to whether the company’s concerned responsible person ‘acted honestly and reasonably,’ the Court may inquire into the past history of the said accused person/s in dealing with such matter on top of taking into consideration the knowledge, experience and financial condition of the accused person. Upon examining the statements made in the petition if the Court is of the view that the company has the past record of non-compliance of the provisions of the Companies Act or the delay in filing the Return of the Allotment of Shares is aimed at gaining unlawful advantage from share-holders or debtors or contributors, in that case, the Court may decline to relieve the delinquents person/s of the company from the fine incurred for every day during which period the default continued.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">18.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">Thus, in a matter under Section 151 read with Section 396 of the Companies Act, the first issue requires to be adjudicated upon by this Court is whether the petitioner-company has been able to make out a case to “satisfy” this Court that the failure to file the document within the statutory period of sixty days was not deliberate and the petitioner-company is not a habitual defaulter in filing any such document with the RJSC and, in order to satisfy this Court, the petitioner must make a full disclosure about such omission, including any delay which had happened in the past in filing any type of ‘Return’ together with producing a letter from the RJSC stating as to whether the petitioner is a first-time defaulter or a habitual defaulter. In laying down this <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ratio</em>, I am heavily relying on the observations made by his Lordship Justice H. Rahman in the case of Elahee<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Baksh &amp; Co. Ltd 10 DLR 179 (Para-12). In other words, the first issue to be considered by this Court in a matter under Section 151 read with Section 396 of the Companies Act is whether the petitioner approached this Court bonafide without having any ulterior motive, as was held in the case of Anwar Jute Baling Limited 21 DLR 412.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The second issue to be considered is whether any one would be prejudiced if the time is not extended to file the document and, finally, whether the facts and circumstances suggest to extend time for filing the documents by relieving the delinquents from the fine on just and equitable grounds, if the proceeding for slapping fine has not been already started by the office of the RJSC. If the proceeding for penalizing the company’s delinquent has already been commenced and it is pending before the competent Magistrate, in that scenario, this<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Court, after adjudicating upon the issue of extension of time for filing the document, may inform the concerned Magistrate Court that it shall be at liberty to proceed with the proceeding of fine. The above principle has been laid down in the case of Gilt Edge Safety Glass Ltd, LR 1940 (1) Chancery Division 495. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">19.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Let me see whether the petitioner’s facts and circumstances of this case pass the above thresholds towards being remedied by this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Upon admission of the matter on 11<sup>th</sup> June, 2018, the usual notices were published in two daily national newspapers, namely, “The Bangladesh Protidin” and “The Daily New Age” on 25.06.2018 and an affidavit-in-compliance was duly filed on 01.07.2018, as evident from annexures, F-2 and F-3 to the said affidavit-in-compliance. It further transpires from the administrative file that the postal notices were also served upon the RJSC and, thereafter, the matter appeared in the daily cause list for hearing. Despite publication of the presentation of this application and serving of postal notices, as noted above, no one from the office of the RJSC appears to oppose the instant application which indicates that the RJSC does not have any adverse record about the petitioner-company to show to this Court that the petitioner-company is a habitual defaulter in filing the Statutory Report/Form.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">21.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Upon hearing the learned Advocate for the petitioner-company, perusing the petition along with the documentary evidence annexed therewith and also reading the relevant provisions of law, it appears to this Court that the reasons stated for the cause of delay in the application for extension of time for filing Return of Shares Allotment with the RJSC are satisfactory, as there is no willful laches on the part of the petitioner-company and, secondly, the RJSC has not come up with any affidavit to allege that the petitioner is a habitual defaulter in complying with the provisions of the Companies Act and, finally, since the bonus shares have been allotted to all the present share-holders, it suggests that no cunning device has been applied in allotting the bonus shares and, as such, there is no malafides behind the delay in filing the Shares Allotment Return. This Court, thus, finds that the delay has been caused due to the bonafide mistake of the petitioner-company. Thus, if the petition is not allowed, the Managing Director of the petitioner-company shall suffer serious loss inasmuch as he shall be subjected to huge penalty for not filing the said Return of Shares Allotment to the RJSC within time. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">22.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">Considering the interest of the shareholders of the company as well as the fact that the omission to file the Form XV within sixty days was a bonafide mistake, this Court is inclined to condone the entire period of delay that has occurred in filing the Return of Shares Allotment with the respondent No. 1, RJSC and extend the time for filing the Return of Shares Allotment with the RJSC. Further, since no proceeding for slapping fine upon the concerned responsible person of the company has been started, as has been confirmed by the learned Advocate for the petitioner, and in view of my finding that there is no past record of non-compliance of any provisions of the Company law, the Managing Director of the company, who himself has admitted his fault as to non-submission of the Shares Allotment Return, may be relieved from the fine that has incurred for 100 (hundred) days.</span></p><div style="text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">23.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In the result the petition is allowed, but there will be no order as to costs.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">24.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Accordingly, the entire period of delay that has occurred in filing the Return of Allotment of Share in respect of 4,00,000 (four lac) Bonus shares (value Tk. 100/- each share) is hereby condoned and the time to file the Return of Allotment in respect of these 4,00,000 (four lac) bonus shares, is hereby extended till 13.11.2018 and the Managing Director of the company or any other person of the company who were liable to pay fine of Taka 1000 (one thousand) for each  day’s delay are relieved/exonerated from paying the said fine.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">25.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms shall do the needful accordingly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">26.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The petitioner company is directed to approach the RJSC within 15 days from the date of drawing up of this Order.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">27.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">This order will be effective subject to <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">compliance with the direction given hereinbelow.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">28.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The petitioner-company will donate Taka 1,00,000/- (One Lac) only to Fulchari Haji Satter Trust, Upazila Road, Kalirbazar, Fulchari, Gaibandha by depositing in the following Bank Account; Fulchari Haji Satter Trust, Bank Account No. 1021012799, Janata Bank, Kalirbazar Branch (Code No. 0959), Fulchari, Gaibandha, (contact numbers of Branch - 01716023277, 0542256109, e-Mail: jb0959@janatabank-bd.com).
