In this connection, it may be recalled that the Loan Negotiation Documents for the SASEC Road Connectivity Project-II is based upon the User’s Guide to Procurement of Works. The User’s Guide to Procurement of Works issued by the ADB in December, 2016 is meant for the user, that is to say, the Roads and Highways Department in this case. Section 1.02 of Article 1 of the Loan Negotiation Document provides that wherever used in this Loan Agreement, the several terms defined in the Loan Regulations have the respective meanings therein set forth unless modified herein or the context otherwise requires and additional terms used in this Loan Agreement have the meaning of “procurement Guidelines” means ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2015), as amended from time to time. So it is seen that with regard to the SASEC Road Connectivity Project-II, instead of the PPA of 2006 and the PPR of 2008, the Procurement Guidelines of the ADB, 2015 (as amended from time to time) will be applicable. Again in the ADB’s Procurement Guidelines of 2015, it has been clearly, categorically and unequivocally stated under the sub-caption “Purpose” of the caption “Introduction” that “the rights and obligations of the borrower and the providers of goods and works for the project are governed by the bidding documents, and by the contracts signed by the borrower with the providers of goods and works, and not by these Guidelines or the financing agreements”. So it is ex-facie clear that the right and obligations of the borrower and the providers of goods and works for the project shall be governed by the bidding documents as well as by the contracts entered into between the borrower and the providers of goods and works. Precisely speaking, in the absence of any contract signed between the borrower and any of the bidders, the bidding document shall come into play and consequentially it will play a pivotal role in the bidding process. What we are driving at boils down to this; the ADB’s Procurement Guideline of 2015 have opted for self-exclusion and self-effacement in view of the “Purpose” set forth therein. In a mega development project, the High Court Division is often confronted with public interest vis-à-vis private interest of the writ petitioner. The petitioner-company has a private interest in the matter of execution of the project, if eventually the contract is awarded thereto. Regard being had to the public interest in general, can the Court disregard the private interest of the petitioner-company? According to us, in a case of this nature, the High Court Division is required to strike a balance between public interest and private interest. It goes without saying that the public interest involved in the case mega project far outweighs the private interest of the petitioner-company. Where the public interest is predominant, the private interest <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>of the petitioner-company takes a back seat. There cannot be any iota of doubt thereabout. It is admitted on all hands that our local construction companies do not have much skill, expertise and technical know-how in carrying out such mega development projects like the SASEC Road Connectivity Project-II. So the skill, expertise and technical know-how of the local construction companies including the petitioner-company must be raised to an international standard. In this regard, both the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and various development partners including the ADB have a stake. Unless the local construction companies acquire the competence of the international standard as enumerated above, they will lag far behind the foreign companies in the execution of massive development projects. In such a situation, we think, a duty is cast upon the Government and the development partners to ensure that the interest of the local companies is protected and their skill, expertise and technical know-how are enhanced to the international level facilitating them to submit international bids single-handed for such large-scale procurement works. However, from the materials on record, we do not find any mala fides or bad faith in the matter of issuance of the impugned clarification dated 05.09.2017 and as such the same can not be dubbed mala fide as argued by Mr. Mahbub </span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman Bold',serif; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Shafique.

However, the respondent no. 4 vide Memo No. 35.RHD.0000.PDSASEC-II.07.004.2017-50 dated 20.07.2017 published an Invitation For Bids for ICB No. SASEC-II/ICB/MP-1/WP 05 (LOT 1) and ICB No. SASEC-II/ICB/MP-1/WP 06 (LOT 2) under Project No. 40540-BAN: South Asia Sub-regional Economic Co-operation (SASEC) Dhaka-Northwest Corridor Road Project, Phase 2. On 16.08.2017, the petitioner-company, that is to say, DIENCO LIMITED entered into two separate Joint Venture (JV) Agreements with HALLA Corporation of 289, Olympic-ro, Songpa-gu, Seoul, South Korea under the name and style HALLA-DIENCO JV in order to participate in the aforementioned two bids. Thereafter the HALLA-DIENCO JV vide two separate Powers of Attorney dated 16.08.2017 authorized the petitioner’s Managing Director Mr. S. M. Khorshed Alam to carry out all the works under the project. In due course, the HALLA-DIENCO JV purchased the bid documents by depositing the required amount of money. There is a Clause being No. 2.4.1 (Contracts of Similar Size and Nature) Evaluation and Qualification Criteria, Section 3, Volume 1 of 5 of the Bidding Document For WP 05 and WP 06 concerning previous work experience. A pre-bid meeting was held on 23.08.2017 at the office of the respondent no. 3 where all sorts of questions and queries were thrashed out regarding the bids. The petitioner’s Managing Director being the authorized person of HALLA-DIENCO JV participated in the pre-bid meeting. Although in the pre-bid meeting held on 23.08.2017, there was no discussion whatsoever regarding the Clause 2.4.1 (Contracts of Similar Size and Nature) Evaluation and Qualification Criteria; yet the respondent no. 4 most illegally and with a mala fide intention, by the impugned Memo No. 35.RHD.0000.PDSASEC-II.14.001.2017-219 dated 05.09.2017, provided a clarification on the said Clause 2.4.1 in contravention of Rule 54(4) of the Public Procurement Rules, 2008 (hereinafter referred to as the PPR of 2008) and thereby restricted the scope for local contractors to participate in the bids. Anyway, the petitioner by two representations dated 06.09.2017 addressed to the respondent nos. 3 and 4 respectively and by another representation dated 07.09.2017 addressed to the respondent no. 2 requested them to consider the experience of any partner of the JV as 100%, not on the basis of its share in the JV. But the respondents did not pay any heed thereto. In view of the provisions of Rule 54(4) of the PPR of 2008, the petitioner is eligible to get full experience irrespective of its share in the JV, even then the respondent no. 4 by the impugned clarification dated 05.09.2017 unlawfully stated that only the respective share of the JV partner would be considered in assessing the previous experience.

In another similar project named Western Bangladesh Bridge Improvement Project (WBBIP) under the respondent no. 1, the prospective bidder was required to have a minimum number of 2 similar contracts that had been satisfactorily completed as a prime contractor (single entity or JV member) and it was stated in the Bidding Document that for contracts under which the applicant participated as a JV member, the applicant would be eligible to get full experience of contracts regardless of the JV share in assessing the Specific Construction Experience 4.2. So in all fairness, in the present SASEC Road Connectivity Project-II, the experience of the petitioner should have been assessed as 100% experience in the JV irrespective of its share. The impugned clarification dated 05.09.2017 is a material departure in this regard.

After <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">holding of the pre-bid meeting on 23.08.2017,</span> no new condition/stipulation can be attached so that any of the bidders may become non-responsive. The impugned clarification dated 05.09.2017 has virtually curtailed the right of the petitioner-company to participate in the bidding process in the JV. In the impugned clarification, the expression “Bidder’s Participation” has wrongly been interpreted. The value of the bidder’s participation means the value of the total work. But in the impugned clarification, the value of the bidder’s participation has been defined as value of the share of the JV partners which is clearly misleading and untenable. Experience is a qualitative issue and it is not to be quantified. This impugned clarification is not a part of the ADB Guidelines. It is a mere clarification given by some individuals in order to gratify their evil desire. If the impugned clarification dated 05.09.2017 remains in <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">force, no skilful and experienced contractors</span> will be groomed in this country.

As the Clause 2.4.1 was not clarified in the pre-bid meeting, the employer can clarify it at any time before submission of bids. Instruction to Bidders (ITB) 8.1 provides that at any time prior to the deadline for submission of bids, the employer may amend the bidding documents by issuing addenda. So the employer rightly clarified the Clause 2.4.1 (Contracts of Similar Size and Nature) Evaluation and Qualification Criteria. Furthermore, the PPR of 2008 are not applicable to the instant case and as such there is no question of violation of Rule 54(4) of the PPR of 2008. The petitioner requested the respondent nos. 3 and 4 to reconsider the experiences of the partners of the JV as 100%. The ADB is only the forum to review this issue. The respondent nos. 3 and 4 have no authority to review the same. In the present case, only the ADB’s Procurement Guidelines are applicable and that being so, the petitioner can not claim full experience irrespective of its share in the JV. The CPTU has been established by the Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division of the Ministry of Planning for carrying out the purpose of the PPA of 2006 and the PPR of 2008. As the PPA of 2006 and the PPR of 2008 are not applicable to the instant case, the opinion of the CPTU is immaterial and irrelevant. The ADB reserves the right to change its policy which can not be challenged under the law of the land. According to the impugned clarification dated 05.09.2017, there is no scope to give 100% experience to the lead partner (petitioner-company) and only the respective share of the partner will be considered. As per Clause “u” of Section 1.02 of Article 1 of the Loan Negotiation Document dated 12.07.2017 executed between the representative of the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and the ADB, “Procurement Guidelines” means the ADB’s Procurement Guidelines of 2015, as amended from time to time. Schedule 4 of the Loan Negotiation Document provides that the procurement of goods, works and consulting services shall be subject to and governed by the Procurement Guidelines and the Consulting Guidelines respectively. Except as the ADB may otherwise agree, goods and works shall be procured and consulting services shall be selected and engaged only on the basis of the procurement method(s) and the selection methods set forth in that Schedule 4. These methods are subject to, among other things, the detailed arrangements and threshold values mentioned in the procurement plan. The borrower may only modify the procurement and selection methods or threshold values with the prior agreement with the ADB and the modifications must be set out in the updates to the procurement plan. All terms used in the Schedule 4 and not otherwise defined in the Loan Negotiation Document have the meanings provided in the Procurement Guidelines and/or the Consulting Guidelines, as the case may be. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level7 lfo1; tab-stops: .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .25in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">(ii)<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">   </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and the ADB entered into an agreement for proposed Multitranche Financing Facility (MFF) for South Asia Sub-regional Economic Co-operation (SASEC) Dhaka-Northwest Corridor Road Project, Phase 2 and Tranche 1 (Project) on 12.07.2017. The maximum financing amount available under the Facility is one billion two hundred million US dollar. Each individual tranche will be for an amount of not less than fifty million US dollar or its equivalent. The respondent no. 4 (Project Director) invited bids on 20.07.2017 for Project No. 40540-BAN: South Asia Sub-regional Economic Co-operation (SASEC) Dhaka-Northwest Corridor Road Project, Phase 2. ICB No. and Title: SASEC-II/ICB/MP-1/WP 05 (LOT 1) and SASEC-II/ICB/MP-1/WP 06 (LOT 2); SASEC Road Connectivity Project-II for Improvement of Elenga-Hatikamrul-Rangpur Road to a 4-Lane Highway. The ADB endorsed the impugned clarification dated 05.09.2017 and as per the directive of the ADB, the Project Director informed all the bidders of the clarification. The ADB is the only body to give necessary clarification on any clause in the bidding document. In response to a query from one of the bidders, namely, Infratech Construction Company Limited, the ADB provided the clarification; but in the instant Writ Petition, the ADB has not been made a party. On 06.09.2017, the petitioner-company made a representation to the Country Director of the ADB for review of the clarification dated 05.09.2017; but without waiting for a reasonable time for the disposal of the review application by the ADB, the petitioner has filed the Writ Petition hurriedly. However, in view of the proviso to Section 3(2)(gha) of the PPA of 2006, the PPA of 2006 and the PPR of 2008 are not applicable to the SASEC Road Connectivity Project-II. In this respect, the Procurement Guidelines of the ADB hold the field. Accordingly the impugned clarification dated 05.09.2017 was given by the ADB following its Procurement Guidelines of 2015. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level7 lfo1; tab-stops: .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .25in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">(iii) </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Both the respondent nos. 1 and 3 have filed separate Supplementary Affidavits-in-Opposition wherein they have stated that in this case, the Conditions of the Loan Negotiation Document, the Procurement Guidelines of the ADB, the User’s Guide to Procurement of Works and the Bidding Document are relevant for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties. The petitioner challenged the clarification of the Clause 2.4.1 (Contracts of Similar Size and Nature) Evaluation and Qualification Criteria by filing this Writ Petition and obtained a Rule Nisi along with an interim order of stay. As against the interim order of stay, the respondent no. 3 preferred Civil Petition For Leave To Appeal No. 3547 of 2017 before the Appellate Division and the Appellate Division stayed the operation of the order of stay granted by the High Court Division; but in the meantime, that is to say, during the subsistence of the stay order passed by the Appellate Division, the respondents completed the technical evaluation of the bids. On 06.11.2017, the respondents sent the technical evaluation report to the Chief Engineer of the Roads and Highways Department (Head of the Procuring Entity) who duly transmitted the same to the ADB on 08.11.2017 for its concurrence.

So it is ex-facie clear that the rights and obligations of the borrower and the providers of goods and works for the project shall be governed by the bidding documents as well as by the contracts entered into between the borrower and the providers of goods and works. Precisely speaking, in the absence of any contract signed between the borrower and any of the bidders, the bidding document shall come into play and consequentially it will play a pivotal role in the bidding process.

In the matter of issuance of the impugned clarification dated 05.09.2017 as evidenced by Annexure-‘F’ to the Writ Petition, the Procuring Entity did not act of its own accord; rather the Procuring Entity was directed to issue the impugned clarification on the basis of a reference made to the ADB by the Procuring Entity at the instance of the local company, that is to say, Infratech Construction Company Limited. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 0in 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">39.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">In the “Preface” to the Bidding Document of the project, it has been stated in unmistakable terms that the bidding document for the procurement of work has been prepared by the Roads and Highways Department, Road, Transport and Highways Division, Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and is based on the Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of Works (SBD Works) issued by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) dated December, 2016. So it leaves no room for doubt that the Bidding Document of the present project is based on the Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of Works issued by the ADB. As we have found that the various provisions of the Bidding Document are applicable to the instant SASEC Road Connectivity Project-II, the question of application of the provisions of Section 3(2)(gha) and Section 4 of the PPA of 2006 and Rule 54(4) of the PPR of 2008 does not arise at all. This necessarily leads us to hold that the contention of Mr. M.

The requirement for Contracts of Similar Size and Nature clearly refers to the Bidder’s Participation. Therefore, if the participation was in the form of any JV, only the respective share must be considered. All the learned Advocates on behalf of the petitioner, namely, Mr. Shafique Ahmed, Mr. M. Shamsul Haque and Mr. Mahbub Shafique have objected to the Bidder’s Participation to the extent of their respective shares in the form of any JV. According to them, the local bidders including the petitioner-company have been greatly inconvenienced and prejudiced by this clarification dated 05.09.2017. Undeniably in the earlier two <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">projects, namely, the SASEC Road Connectivity</span> Project: Improvement of Joydebpur-Chandra-Tangail-Elenga Road (N-4) to a 4-Lane Highway having ICB No. SASEC-RCP/ICB/WP-02, LOT No. WP-04 and the Western Bangladesh Bridge Improvement Project (WBBIP) under the respondent no. 1, the work experience of any JV partner was accepted as 100% experience irrespective of its share in the JV.

This is the biggest project ever undertaken by the Government of Bangladesh in collaboration with the ADB. As every project is a class by itself, the reference to those two earlier projects, according to us, does not appear to be of any avail to the learned Advocates for the petitioner.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 0in 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">43.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">ITB 7.1 provides that a prospective Bidder requiring any clarification on the Bidding Document shall contact the Employer in writing at the Employer’s address indicated in the BDS or raise his inquires during the pre-bid meeting if provided for in accordance with ITB 7.4.

While the review application was pending before the ADB, the petitioner filed the instant Writ Petition in this Court under Article 102 of the Constitution and obtained the Rule Nisi along with the interim order of stay on 12.09.2017. So it is evident that the petitioner-company only waited for 5(five) days for review of its application by the ADB. Anyway, according to the petitioner-company, it is the urgency of the matter which impelled it to file the Writ Petition in a great hurry so that its interest was not jeopardized in any manner. Yes, we agree that the matter was very urgent and having found no response from the ADB within 5(five) days, the petitioner-company filed the Writ Petition. The interim order dated 12.09.2017 staying the operation of the impugned clarification dated 05.09.2017 was stayed by the Appellate Division in Civil Petition For Leave To Appeal No. 3547 of 2017 and while the stay order of the Appellate Division was in force, the Tender Evaluation Committee was at liberty to evaluate the technical bids and accordingly the said Committee evaluated the technical bids and submitted a technical evaluation report on 06.11.2017 which was sent to the ADB on 08.11.2017 for its concurrence. Although the ADB called the shots in the matter of issuance of the impugned clarification dated 05.09.2017; yet curiously enough, the ADB has not been impleaded as a respondent.
