Subsequently; for arrear of rent the landlord instituted a rent suit against the tenant Ram Chandra Das being Rent Suit No.670 of 1911 in the 3<sup>rd</sup> Court of the then Munsif, Jessore, which was decreed and in Decree Execution Case No.785 of 1914 one Nistarini Dasi auction purchased the land on 20.09.1914 and the auction-purchaser got delivery of possession through court. At the time of Cadastral Survey settlement, the said <em>joma</em> was split up into three plots being No.301, 302 and 302/329, on which the auction-purchaser Nistarini Dasi erected her homestead in one compact block and started to reside therein. At the time of record, the C.S.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>plot No.301 and 302 were correctly recorded in the name of Nistarini Dasi but the disputed C.S. plot No.302/329 was wrongly recorded in the name of defendant No.1, Jessore Municipality. Subsequently, during S.A. record of right the said plot again was also wrongly recorded in the name of defendant No.1. Nistarini Dasi died subsequently leaving behind her only daughter Horidasi Dashya. Horidasi died leaving behind the plaintiffs as son and grandsons. The plaintiffs since their predecessor continuing their possession in the suit property which is the dwelling hut of them since 1914 A.D. which is more than 70 (seventy) years by asserting hostile title against the defendants and others and in this way the plaintiffs have acquired their valid right, title, interest and possession by way of adverse possession for more than 70 years in the suit land. The defendants on the basis of wrong record denied the title of the plaintiffs on 26.11.1982, which constrained the plaintiffs to institute the original suit.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">The contrary case of the contesting defendant No.1, Jessore Municipality in short is thus that the suit land belonged to Jessore Municipality and the C.S. and S.A. khatian of the suit land have been correctly prepared in the name of the defendant No.1.

The learned Advocate further submits that during disposal of the appeal the learned Sub-ordinate Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Jessore totally failed to assess and consider the evidence on record in its true perspective and also failed to appreciate the actual proposition of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. The learned Advocate also submits that on an application of the plaintiffs the trial court allowed the same for holding local investigation for ascertaining the suit land and the learned trail court appointed one Mr. Gazi Abul Abbas a learned survey knowing lawyer for holding local investigation. The learned Advocate Commissioner accordingly under the direction given upon him on the basis of a writ went to the locality and after thorough investigation submitted his report and this report supports the contention of the plaintiffs in respect of the identity and specification of the suit property which is still prevailing, but that material evidence was also ignored by the learned Appellate Court illegally. The learned Advocate submits that, the positive contention of the plaintiffs is such that the plaintiffs are possessing the suit property since 1914 A.D. openly and adversely within the knowledge of everybody including Jessore Municipality in whose name the C.S. and S.A. khatian were prepared and on the basis of which the defendant No.1, Jessore Municipality denied the title of the plaintiffs. The learned Advocate argued that the witnesses adduced from the side of the plaintiffs successfully proved that the plaintiffs are possessing the suit property for more than 70 years which is their homestead and they are residing therein and on the contrary, the defendants have hopelessly failed to falsify the case of the plaintiffs by any tangible evidence which is also not considered properly by the learned Appellate Court and the Appellate Court without rebutting the findings of the trial court, adverting evidence on records reversed the judgment and decree passed by the learned Trial Court, which is apparently illegal in the eye of law. The plaintiff’s homestead is situated on the disputed plot No.302/329 along with the undisputed plot No.301 and 302 which is the integral part of foundation of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">pukka building</span> and that building is being used by the plaintiffs since their predecessor as of their homestead continuously for more than 70 (seventy) years and the learned Appellate Court was totally misconceived in grasping the actual facts and evidence of the case and the relevant proposition of law and thereby arrived at an erroneous decision at the time of disposal of the appeal on merit. The learned Advocate lastly submits that the defendant-opposite party Jessore Municipality admitting the plaintiff tenancy under the Government and their possession therein after receiving municipality tax granted receipts and that very fact is admitted by the defendant’s witnesses and all these papers has been marked as Exhibit-5 series and as such the defendant-opposite party No. 01, Jessore Municipality is barred by the law of <em>estoppel</em> to deny the claim of the plaintiff’s which is also not considered by the learned Appellate Court and as such the impugned judgment and decree is liable to be <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">interfered with. The learned Advocate in support</span> of his contention referred some decisions reported in 44 DLR(AD) 100, 42 DLR (AD) 152, 35 DLR (AD) 216, 28 DLR (AD) 61, 64 DLR (AD) 127 and VIII BLD (1988) 497. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">As against the aforesaid submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioners the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite party No.1 opposing the Rule submits that the learned Appellate Court during disposal of the appeal committed no illegality or irregularity. The learned Advocate further submits that admittedly the C.S. and S.A. record of right has been prepared in the name of defendant-opposite party No.1, Jessore Municipality, which has got a presumptive value of correctness. The learned Advocate also submits that the predecessor of the plaintiffs, Nistarini Dasi did not reside in the suit homestead which is in C. S. plot No.302/329 and the homestead of Nistarini and after her death the plaintiffs, is situated in the adjacent plots of suit plot No.302/329, but the plaintiffs only to grab the property of Jessore Municipality on false allegation filed the suit. The learned Advocate further submits that the Advocate Commissioner according to the law of commission did not act and without holding local investigation properly submitted has report which was not acceptable in the eye of law. The learned Advocate also submits that the land of ‘<em>boynama’</em> in the name of Nistarini is not identical with the suit land, but the learned Advocate Commissioner without proper investigation submitted his report supporting the case of the plaintiffs and as such the learned Appellate Court rightly disbelieved and discarded the report of the commissioner in the impugned judgment and decree. The learned Advocate argued that, the trial court at the time of decreeing the suit without considering the evidence on records properly, decided the merit of the suit in favour of the plaintiffs and for that reason the learned Appellate Court during disposal of the appeal reversed the findings of the trial court relying upon the evidence led from the sides of the respective parties inasmuch as the plaintiffs to the suit have failed to prove their case by sufficient evidence. The learned Advocate lastly submits that, there is no misreading or non-reading of evidence and non-consideration of material facts resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice by which the impugned judgment and decree can be interfered with.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">10.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">In order to appreciate the arguments advanced from the sides<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>of the learned counsels for the respective parties I have perused the original plaint along with the subsequent amendment of the plaint, the written statement of the contesting defendant No.1, the evidence adduced from the sides of the respective parties and all other connected papers including the case records.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">11.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">On perusal of the papers it transpires that admittedly the suit property is situated within Jessore Municipality area appertaining to Mouza “Ghop” under Kotwali police station and the original landlord was one Beni Madhob Mishra under whom Ram Chandra Das was a tenant.
