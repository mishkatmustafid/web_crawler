By virtue of the inherent power a Court of law possesses, it is competent to examine the ‘just and fair’ aspect of a remedy sought for by the petitioner in course of dealing with any type of case. When the listed-company would show the Court that despite taking all the steps to ensure sending of notices to all the shareholders through e-Mail, mobile message, registered post in addition to publishing the notice of the AGM/EGM in two widely circulated national newspapers, the turn-up of the general shareholders in the AGM/EGM for approval of the Scheme of Amalgamation was less than three-fourths, in that scenario, the petitioner-companies may legitimately make a prayer before this Court to pass an Order to the effect that the Scheme shall be binding upon all the shareholders and other stakeholders. And if this Court finds the contentions of the petitioner-companies to be reasonable, fair, just and overall in favour of public interest, it may sanction the Scheme. At the time of sanctioning a Scheme of Amalgamation, while this Court is competent to sanction a Scheme despite the same being not approved by “the majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the shareholders and/creditors”, this Court is also empowered to decline sanctioning of a Scheme despite being approved by the three-fourths shareholders and/creditors if it is found to be against public interest. In other words, while this Court should not act merely as a rubber stamp to simply endorse the ipse dixit of the majority of the shareholders or creditors inasmuch it is the solemn duty of this Court to find out whether the big shareholders/creditors have voted for the Scheme for the benefit of the company or only for their personal gain by depriving the 1/4th shareholders/creditors and, at the same time, this Court also should not mechanically refuse the sanctioning of a Scheme merely on the ground of non-approval of the same by the 3/4th of the shareholders and/creditors without delving deep into the matter by carrying out an investigation as to whether the petitioner-companies have put their best effort to ensure the presence of 3/4th shareholders.

For making out a case to the Legislators in favour of incorporation of the above provisions in the Section 233 of the Companies Act, the BSEC must carry out investigations into the affairs of the companies who are currently under the ‘Z’ category with an aim to find out as to (i) whether the defaulting-company had furnished any false information at the time of obtaining accord from the BSEC for getting enlisted in the stock market, (ii) whether the defaulting-company were preparing its Financial Reports in connivance with its auditor or any other unscrupulous Chartered Accountancy Firm and (iii) whether the AGMs of the defaulting-company were being attended by the genuine shareholders or by the AGM syndicate, group of outsiders hired to show the attendance in the ‘Attendance Register’ and in the ‘Audio Visual Record’. Till the time the Legislature incorporates the aforesaid provision in Section 233 of the Companies Act and till the time the DSE incorporates the provision for buying back the shares by the directors of the defaulting-listed-company from the intending shareholders, if the BSEC can successfully satisfy this Court that despite finding out serious illegalities and anomalies in the affairs of the defaulting-company, it lacks power to appoint administrator or to direct the sponsor-directors to buy back the shares from the public shareholders who intend to sell, in that scenario this Court might be in a position to extend standing of the petitioner of a Section-233-application in favour of the BSEC. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">          </span>. . .

Later on, it also commenced the business of packaging of Pesticide as Unit-3 and CNG Station as Unit-4. In the Year 2011, the Extruder Machine of Unit-1 collapsed and needed replacement, but due to the manufacturer’s stoppage of production of the machine, the same could not be replaced and, further, due to the decline in the demand of Dry Cell Batteries and Alkatra, and lack of distribution channels, the transferee-company had to shut down the Unit-1, the Unit-2 and the Unit-3. Currently, only the Unit-4 (the CNG Station) of the transferee-company is in operation. The factory of the transferee-company is located in Dhakkinpara, Dhamrai, Dhaka. It was listed with the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) on 09.09.1996 and with the Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE) on 20.06.1997.

He further contends that as the valuation report for determination of exchange ratio has been prepared based on the aforesaid audited financial statements, the auditor has not expressed any qualified opinion in this regard. He draws this Court’s notice to ‘Note 20’ of the Financial Statements of the transferor-company for the year ended on 31 December 2017 under related party transaction, and contends that only net basis of related party transaction has been cited, but total transaction of related party has not been disclosed.

He argues that r<u>i</u>ghts on intangible asset of a company should be identifiable and separable having a sale/resale value but since the transferor-company does not have any trademark or registration for patent of their software (intangible assets) as per their report, the value shown under intangible asset has no resale value or recoverable value, Mr. Masum argues. He alleges that an irrational and unacceptable valuation of the assets and property of the transferor-company has been done by the auditor at the behest of the common directors of these two companies with an ill motive of grabbing a huge number of transferee-company’s shares so that the common directors may get the maximum portion of the valuable landed property of the transferee-company in the event of its dissolution.

By referring to a catena of cases of our jurisdiction and foreign jurisdictions, he submits that it has now become a mandatory requirement for the Company Bench to look into the public interest aspect in any application for amalgamation/merger. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">27.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">By taking me through S</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;">ection 2A(2) of the Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969, Mr. Masum submits that issuance of a huge amount of further shares, in favour of the shareholders of the transferor-company at the determined exchange ratio: 2.08:1, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">without any further application, act, instrument or deed,</span> as proposed in clause 14 of the Scheme, would be an absolute violation of the provisions of Section 2A(2) of the Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969, inasmuch as no company without the consent of the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission is competent to make an issue of capital in Bangladesh. </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">He seeks to draw notice of this Court to the fact that, in India, in order to safeguard the rights of the investors, it has been made mandatory for the listed-companies to obtain ‘No Objection Certificate’ (NOC) to the Scheme of Amalgamation from the regulatory body prior to filing it before the High Court.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">28.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-language: BN-BD;">Then, Mr. Masum takes me through the Bangladesh Security Exchange Commission's Notification No. SEC/CMRRCD/2009-193/119/ Admin/34 dated November 22, 2011 and, side by side, the monthly shareholding report of the transferee-company and submits that the transferee-company is an unrelenting violator of the law of the land inasmuch as the law requires that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">all the sponsors/promoters and directors of a company listed with any stock exchange shall at all times jointly hold minimum 30% shares of the paid-up capital of the company, whereas </span>the sponsors and the directors of the transferee-company hold <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">only 24% of the paid-up capital of the company</span>.

On such an application, the Court would issue directions for convening of separate meetings of the members and/or creditors or different classes of members and/or creditors, as the case may be. In the said meetings of the members and/or creditors, the Scheme of Amalgamation is required to be approved by majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors or members or class of members, as the case may be. After the Scheme is approved by all concerned in their respective meetings, a separate petition then would be presented to the Court for sanctioning of the Scheme of Amalgamation. However, if the prayer for sanctioning of the Scheme of Amalgamation has already been made in the original application, there is no need to file a separate application, but in that event, the fact as to the approval by the three-fourths in value of the members/creditors should be brought to the notice of this Court by way of filing a supplementary affidavit. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">41.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Sub-Section (2) of the Section 228 of the Companies Act is about making the decision of amalgamation binding upon the all concerned.

The aforesaid provision, however, does not specifically state that if the Scheme of Amalgamation is approved by the shareholders/creditors less than “majority in number representing three-fourths in value of members/creditors”, it would be invalid; it simply says that it shall not be binding upon the members, creditors and the company. Here, the Legislature has put two concurrent conditions; one is majority in number and the second condition is that the value of shares/credits of the said majority in number should be three-fourths. The Legislature’s intention for, and the purpose behind, imposing the condition of majority in number representing three-fourths in value<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>is to ensure the fairness and transparency in dealing with the merger of companies by the directors.

It follows that until and unless the three-fourths of the entire shareholders remains present in the AGM/EGM and approves the Scheme of Amalgamation, the requirements envisaged in Section 228(2) of the Companies Act are not fulfilled. An argument is advanced before this Court that since the shareholders of the listed-company are trading their shares every day in the stock market, it is an impossible task for the listed-company to ensure the presence of the three-fourths shareholders in number in the AGM/EGM to be held for approval of the Scheme of Amalgamation. Since the stock market is now digitized and the CDBL keeps the record of the latest transferees of the shares of the listed-companies, it is not a difficult task for the listed-companies to notify their general shareholders by sending notice through e-Mails, message or registered post. In any event, no provision of law can be interpreted taking into consideration the convenience or inconvenience of the stakeholders of the said law. In other words, any arrangement (be it merger or something else) must be approved by the three-fourths number of the shareholders/creditors and, at the same time, it should also be at least three-fourths from the perspective of value of the company’s shares/credits. Therefore, any Scheme would not be approved by the Court, if the resolution granting approval to the Scheme of arrangement is passed by more than three-fourths in value of the shareholders/creditors but, is not carried by the majority in number of the creditors and/or members. Similarly, no Scheme would be approved by this Court when a resolution is passed by the majority in number of shareholders and/or creditors, for example, more than 75% of the entire shareholders/creditors in number favoured the Scheme, but the value of the 75% shares/credits is less than three-fourths of the entire shares/credits. While the purpose of providing majority in number of the creditors and members in the Section is to safeguard the interests of the large number of small creditors and/or shareholders whose voice is often lost amongst small number of big shareholders/<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>creditors, the reason behind putting the condition of three-fourths in value is that a company should not bow down to any unlawful, unethical and unfair demand by the majority in number at the cost of jeopardizing the interest of the shareholders/creditors who possess three-fourths in value of the shares/ credits in the company. Thus, the conditions of approval by the majority in number and three-fourths in value of share/credit are cumulative.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">43.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">However, this Court by exercising its discretionary power may pass a direction that the Scheme shall be binding upon all concerned inspite of the poor turn-over of the shareholders in the AGM/EGM held for approval of the Scheme, if the Court finds that it is not contrary to any provisions of law and it does not violate any public policy and is satisfied that the Scheme is reasonable, just, fair and not prejudicial to the interests of the members or class or members or creditors or a class of creditors, as the case may be. By virtue of the inherent power a Court of law possesses, it is competent to examine the ‘just and fair’ aspect of a remedy sought for by the petitioner in course of dealing with any type of case. This Court, therefore, is required to consider the pros and cons of the Scheme to see whether the Scheme is in favour of public interest. When the listed-company would show the Court that despite taking all the steps to ensure sending of notices to all the shareholders through e-Mail, mobile message, registered post in addition to publishing the notice of the AGM/EGM in two widely circulated national newspapers, the turn-up of the general shareholders in the AGM/EGM for approval of the Scheme of Amalgamation was less than three-fourths, in that scenario, the petitioner-companies may legitimately make a prayer before this Court to pass an Order to the effect that the Scheme shall be binding upon all the shareholders and other stakeholders. And if this Court finds the contentions of the petitioner-companies to be reasonable, fair, just and overall in favour of public interest, it may sanction the Scheme. Therefore, it is my considered view that at the time of sanctioning a Scheme of Amalgamation, while this Court is competent to sanction a Scheme despite the same being not approved by “the majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the shareholders and/creditors”, this Court is also empowered to decline sanctioning of a Scheme despite being approved by the three-fourths shareholders and/creditors if it is found to be against public interest. In other words, while this Court should not act merely as a rubber stamp to simply endorse the ipse dixit of the majority of the shareholders or creditors inasmuch it is the solemn duty of this Court to find out whether the big shareholders/creditors have voted for the Scheme for the benefit of the company or only for their personal gain by depriving the 1/4th shareholders/creditors and, at the same time, this Court also should not mechanically refuse the sanctioning of a Scheme merely on the ground of non-approval of the same by the 3/4th of the shareholders and/creditors without delving deep into the matter by carrying out an investigation as to whether the petitioner-companies have put their best effort to ensure the presence of 3/4th shareholders. In both the situations, this Court is under an obligation to take into consideration the public interest upon embarking on the issues as to (i) whether the Scheme of Amalgamation is undertaken by the companies violating any law or public policy, (ii)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span>whether the interest of all types of shareholders, creditors, employees and public at large are well protected, (iii) whether it is designed to benefit only the directors of the companies and (iv) whether the Scheme has been prepared for the purpose of dodging the Government revenue or with an ill-motive of evading any Government or non-Government dues or depriving any individual/group of individuals. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">44.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Let me now carry out a scrutiny as to whether these petitioner-companies have complied with the procedures laid down in Section 228 of the Companies Act. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">45.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Upon admission of the matter on 12.08.2018, this Court directed the transferee-company and the transferor-company to call and hold meetings with their respective shareholders and creditors separately.

Since the transferor-company’s 100% shareholders as well as the 100% creditors have extended their support towards the Scheme, it has evidently fulfilled the above condition. I am, therefore, only required to examine the above legal requirement for the transferee-company. None of the creditors of the transferee-company has raised any objection to the Scheme and, hence, there is no point is examining the issue whether the ‘majority in number representing three-fourths in value’ of the creditors of the transferee-company voted for the Scheme.

It is contended by the BSEC that in the AGM or EGM of the listed-companies, the BoD of a listed-company usually hires a group of persons to show the attendance in the AGM/EGM in the attendance-sheet as well as in the recorded video and, therefore, it is their claim that although 76% of the general shares of this transferee-company are being held by the people in the open stock market, they are not aware of this Scheme. In an effort to controvert the above allegation, the transferee-company produced the voluminous attendance-sheet of the general shareholders in the form of a bound book before this Court and claimed that a copy of the same together with the audio-visual recording of the EGM have been filed with the BSEC. From the above-mentioned attendance-sheet, it transpires that 158 (one hundred and fifty eight) general shareholders are present and there is hardly any scope for this Court to know whether the attendance-sheet is a manufactured one, and unless the BSEC carries out any investigation thereto, this Court would not be in a position to embark upon examination of the fact as to whether the attendance-sheet is genuine or fake. Given the fact that the BSEC has not done any investigation as to the authenticity of the attendance-sheet, it cannot dispute its veracity. Moreover, the BSEC also did not show this Court as to what was the quantity/number of shareholders of the transferee-company on the date of holding the EGM on 17.10.2018, as per the record of the Central Depository Bangladesh Limited (CDBL). Also, the value of the shares held by the general shareholders who attended the EGM of the transferee-company could not be ascertained by this Court due to non-submission of any report from the CDBL. Under the circumstances, this Court assumes that three-fourths of the shareholders of the transferee-company, value of which is also three-fourths of the transferee-company’s entire share, were present in the EGM and none of them opposed the Scheme.

In order to examine the public interest aspect, I would prefer to dwell on the following issues; (i) whether any special method is to be applied or procedures to be followed by this Court for valuation of shares of the petitioner-companies, in view of the fact that in this case, a private company is intending to get merged into a listed-public company, (ii) whether the valuation of the transferor-company has been done at an inflated rate, (iii) whether non-submission of the previous years’ Financial Reports of the transferor-company before this Court to substantiate its profit shown in the audit report and, also, non-submission of the tax-papers showing the paid up capital of the shareholders of the transferor-company would make the valuation report of the transferor-company unacceptable/invalid, (iv) whether this Court should direct the petitioner-companies to determine valuation of the shares by conducting audit through a reputed Chartered Accountancy Firm, (v) whether, before sanctioning the Scheme or after sanctioning the Scheme, the National Board of Revenue should be directed to investigate into the tax file of the directors of the transferor-company for the purpose of tallying the amount of money shown to have been paid off against their respective shares, (vi) whether the amalgamated-company’s sponsors/directors should be compelled to jointly hold 30% shares before sanctioning the Scheme or after sanctioning the Scheme and (vii) whether the directors-shareholders of the transferor-company and the transferee-company should be inhibited to sell their respective shares, which would be allotted in their favour in the amalgamated-company on top of the shares they are currently holding, for a limited period after amalgamation.

Because, when this Court doubts about the valuation of the assets of any company presented before it, the Court may consider it to be proper to ascertain the real value of the assets of the transferee-company and/or transferor-company for the purpose of protecting the interests of the ordinary shareholders or of any particular class of shareholders and/or of the creditors towards upholding the overall public interest by appointing either a reputed C/A Firm of its choice with direction to carry out certain specific works, such as, finding out the present market price of the landed property, current value of the intangible assets if any, the resale value of the machineries and other movable properties or, in the alternative, the Court may ask the concerned Sub-Registry Office to submit a valuation report of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>the landed property of the company, appoint any qualified person to assess the value of the intangible assets and direct the concerned manufacturers of the machines and other equipments, including different tools, computer, electronic goods, vehicles, etc. to submit report of the present market price wherefrom the resale value of the aforesaid movable properties could be assessed.

In the case in hand, if this Court would have directed a C/A Firm of its choice to conduct an independent audit on the financial position of the transferor-company, there was no guarantee that the valuation would have been lesser than the one presented by the transferor-company. On the other hand, if this Court would have directed the C/A Firms who have worked for the transferor-company in preparing the present financial reports, it was highly likely that they would have come up with some explanations suited to the displayed circumstances of the companies and, in the event that this Court would have disagreed with their explanations and had any anomalies been pointed out by this Court in preparation of these financial reports, this Court would have referred the matter to the FRC established under the FR Act for investigating into the apparent malpractice of these C/A Firms.

In my opinion, the first direction shall be upon the amalgamated-company’s directors (all the directors of the transferor-company and the transferee-company) to inhibit them from selling/transferring their shares they would hold in the amalgamated-company for, at least, one year so that they cannot manipulate the stock market immediately after getting allotment of these huge number of shares and, after the said period, further restrictions on the sale-price of their shares for a fixed period shall be imposed upon them so that the concern of the BSEC, that there is a hidden agenda of the directors of these two companies to swindle money by selling their huge number of shares at a hiked price by maneuvering the stock market, is alleviated. They shall be further directed to retain 30% of the shares in the amalgamated-company for all the time in order to compel them to abide by the law. Finally, in order to give effect to the above directions, the BSEC, the RJSC, the CDBL, the DSE and the CSE shall also be directed to ensure compliance with this Court’s Order/Directions. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">57.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Given that inspite of the apparent over-pricing of the shares of the transferor-company, the Share Exchange Ratio is conceded by this Court, the directors would not be prejudiced if, for two years after the expiry of one year lock-in-period, their share-price is fixed at the NAV per share in the event that they wish to sell their shares within the aforesaid two years. In fact, this Court is assuming that the directors of these two companies shall not sell their shares in near future in the backdrop of their bold contentions made before this Court that the purpose of this amalgamation is to make the company an A-category company. And, if that is their true intention, no sensible director would opt to sell their shares when they would get a 10%-dividend each year. Moreover, had the directors of the amalgamated-company gone for issuance of capital upon setting up a new listed-company, there would have been a lock-in-period for 3 (three) years on the sale of their shares under Rule 6A of the Securities and Exchange Commission (Issue of Capital) Rules, 2001, or had the transferee-company been a solvent one and would have opted for raising capital by allotment of new shares (rights shares) under Rule 14 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (Rights Issue) Rules, 2006, there would have been a lock-in-period of 3 (three) years, or had the transferee-company, after making itself a profitable one, decided to issue shares through public offer, under Rule 10 of the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (Public Issue) Rules, 2015, the shareholder-directors would not have been allowed to sell their shares for three years. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">58.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Therefore, compared to the above legal restrictions, this Court’s opinion as to keeping provisions for lock-in-period on the sale of shares of the directors for one year and, thereafter, fixation of price for selling their shares for two years are very reasonable and rational.

To construe the expression ‘public interest’, one should not only consider the interest of promoters, directors and general investors of the incorporated companies, but also the interest of the Banks and Financial Institutions who extend loan facilities to the companies and other numerous bodies interconnected with the stock market. In fact, the finance and commerce of our country being greatly interlinked with the stock market, the BSEC has been bestowed with the pivotal statutory duty to protect the public interest, not only by enforcing the Acts of Parliament, but, if needed, the power of framing Rules, Regulations and issuance of Orders for the said purpose have also been vested. If the BSEC feels that there is no clear power in the law, they must approach the Government with a request to enact the necessary law in the Parliament.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">61.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The learned Advocate for the BSEC pointed out the fact that although the Dhaka Stock Exchange (Listing) Regulations, 2015 (DSE Regulations) contain provisions for delisting the companies on the ground of non-payment of dividends for five years or for not holding AGMs for consecutive three years, but there is no provisions for the directors in the said Regulations that they shall be bound to buy back the shares from the market by their personal money. Because of absence of such provision in the DSE Regulations, when the company would be delisted, although the public shareholders shall be financially loser, the directors of the company will be happier inasmuch as they shall not have any legal obligation to comply with the statutory Rules and Regulations with regard to their stocks. It is, therefore, the opinion of this Court that the DSE shall, at its earliest convenience, incorporate the provisions that pursuant to <span style="color: red;">compulsory delisting of a company, the sponsors and directors shall</span> be liable to buy back the shares from the public, who wish to sell the shares within a specified time at a price of “last three years average market price”. However, no share shall be bought in the name of the company, as there is a prohibitory provision in Section 58 of the Companies Act to buy the company’s own share out of the company’s fund. Moreover, the BSEC is competent to impose condition upon the listed companies by virtue of its power under Section 2CC of the Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969 that the directors of the company shall not be entitled to any remuneration of any kind and they shall be debarred from using the vehicles of the company, if they fail to pay dividend for consecutive three years and such other provisions with an aim to save the company’s administrative costs and expenses during its recession, for, when the public shareholders would not be able to enjoy fruits from their portions of shares, the shareholders who are at the helm of the affairs of the company should refrain from taking any benefit from the company. Usually, this Court appoints an administrator to run a company when this Court, at the instance of 10% shareholders, finds the directors of the company to be extravagant at the cost of deprivation of dividend to the majority shareholders. Given the lack of knowledge about the legal rights of the public shareholders of the listed-company, the BSEC should approach the Government to incorporate a provision in Section 233 of the Companies Act that, like the 10% shareholders, the BSEC should be eligible to approach the Company Bench for obtaining necessary and appropriate Order/s to run the defaulting-company (a company, which is not declaring dividends for five years or not holding AGMs for three years) by an administrator and, also, seeking any other appropriate relief from the Court. For making out a case to the Legislators in favour of incorporation of the above provisions in the Section 233 of the Companies Act, the BSEC must carry out investigations into the affairs of the companies who are currently under the ‘Z’ category with an aim to find out as to (i) whether the defaulting-company had furnished any false information at the time of obtaining accord from the BSEC for getting enlisted in the stock market, (ii) whether the defaulting-company were preparing its Financial Reports in connivance with its auditor or any other unscrupulous Chartered Accountancy Firm and (iii) whether the AGMs of the defaulting-company were being attended by the genuine shareholders or by the AGM syndicate, group of outsiders hired to show the attendance in the ‘Attendance Register’ and in the ‘Audio Visual Record’. Till the time the Legislature incorporates the aforesaid provision in Section 233 of the Companies Act and till the time the DSE incorporates the provision for buying back the shares by the directors of the defaulting-listed-company from the intending shareholders, if the BSEC can successfully satisfy this Court that despite finding out serious illegalities and anomalies in the affairs of the defaulting-company, it lacks power to appoint administrator or to direct the sponsor-directors to buy back the shares from the public shareholders who intend to sell, in that scenario this Court might be in a position to extend standing of the petitioner of a Section-233-application in favour of the BSEC.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">62.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In this case, it has come to the notice of this Court that BSEC did not issue a single notice to the transferee-company which was not paying dividend since the year 2010.

Further, the BSEC should have taken an initiative to send a representative from the BSEC to remain present in all the AGMs of the transferee-company to share and disclose the ins and outs of the transferee-company to the public-shareholders and warn them not to trade the shares over the value of NAV per share reminding them that if the transferee-company is dissolved for its non-operation or on the ground of being unable to pay its debt, the shareholders may not get from the asset of the transferee-company of the worth more than the NAV per share. Also, the BSEC ought to have carried out investigation against this company as to whether the presentees in the AGMs shown to have attended by the shareholders are genuine or were attended by the AGM Syndicate by tallying the signatures of the presentees with the signatures of the B/O Account holders and also by matching the faces of presentees with the photos of shareholders kept by the Stock Brokers’ Offices.

Rather, if the assertions made by the learned Advocate for the petitioner-companies turn out to be true, then, it would be beneficial to all the concerns of the transferee and transferor companies to some extent, if not to a great extent, inasmuch as since<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"> the transferee-company, which was a Z-category company since 2010 and after paying off 5% cash dividend to its shareholders, </span>has already been upgraded to B-category and, eventually, it may elevate itself to the status of A-category company if the directors put their best efforts in true sense.

It is further expected by this Court that by efficient and more productive utilization of employees and other resources, the business of the transferee and transferor companies would be carried out more economically and profitably.
