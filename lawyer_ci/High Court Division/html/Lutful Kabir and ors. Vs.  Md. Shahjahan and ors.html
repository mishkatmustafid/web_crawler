The company is engaged in running the business of hotel and resort, currently at only one spot, at Plot 492, Kolatoli, Marine Drive Road, Cox's Bazar, where a multistoried building had already been constructed with more than 100 (one hundred) studio apartments with facilities of a hotel and resort by Khettra Architects Limited, a Developer-company, in which the petitioner nos. 1 and 2 are the Managing Director and the Chairman respectively. The name of this iconic building was given ‘Neeshorgo’. While the landowner was owning 60% of the spaces/flats of the said iconic building and the Developer-company was owning 40% of its spaces/flats, they sold the bulk of their respective proportions to the present flat owners, and till now the landowner and the Developer-company own a considerable part of the ‘Neeshorgo’. The flat owners, which include the Managing Director and the Chairman of the Developer-company, of ‘Neeshorgo’ and members of their families purchased the shares of the company and as such all the shareholders of the company are either flat owners of the ‘Neeshorgo’ or their family-members. The company was incorporated with an authorized share capital of Taka 10,0000000/- (ten crore) divided into 1,000000/- (one crore) ordinary shares of Taka 10/- (ten) each and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>27 shareholders were issued 30,00,000 (thirty lacs) shares of Taka 10 (ten) each and, out of the above shares, in the name of petitioner nos. 1 &amp; 2, 4,00,000/- (four lacs) shares of Taka 10 (ten) each were issued. As per Article 21 of the Articles of Association (AoA) of the company, the company has 21 Directors. The petitioner no. 1 was nominated as the first Chairman and the petitioner no. 2 was appointed as the first Managing Director of the company for a period of 5 years and the respondent nos. 2 to 15 were nominated shareholder-Directors of the company.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It is stated that the company could not hold its first Annual General Meeting (AGM) since its incorporation due to not being able to complete its financial accounts properly, for which the company formed a committee which gave its report on 04.07.2017. The Bank accounts of the company were being operated under the joint signatures of the petitioner nos. 1 and 2 along with another Director Mr. Mijanur Rahman. But due to the temporary absence of the said Mijanur Rahman, the cheques of the company were being signed by the petitioners and when objection was raised regarding withdrawal of money without the signature of Mr. Mijanur Rahman, in the 10<sup>th</sup> Board Meeting of the company held on 29.09.2017, it was unanimously decided that another Director, Dr. Md. Tajul Islam, should also be included as a co-signatory, whose signature shall be mandatory. Thereafter, the respondent nos. 2 to 15 served a Legal Notice dated 26.11.2017 upon the petitioners seeking explanations on certain matters and, eventually, also issued a requisition notice dated 31.01.2018 upon the Board of Directors of the company to hold an EGM of the company with the agenda of appointment of a new Managing Director and Chairman of the company and the matters relating to the present state of affairs and management of the company. Thereafter, the respondent nos. 2 to 15 held an EGM of the company on 20.04.2018 wherein resolutions were taken to remove the petitioners from the position of the Chairman and the Managing Director, and the respondent nos. 12 and 8 were appointed as the new Chairman and the Managing Director of the company.

The petitioner nos. 1 and 2 submitted a letter dated 06.03.2016 to the Social Islami Bank Limited (the Bank), in which the company maintains a Bank account, requesting to change the operating instructions of the Bank account so that cheques are honoured with the signatures of the petitioner nos. 1 and 2 only, altering the instruction pursuant to the 1st Board resolution dated 05.0<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">2.2</span>016, which required another Director’s (Mr. ATM Mijanur Rahman's) signature mandatorily for signing of the cheques with signature of either the petitioner no. 1 or 2. In the said letter, the petitioner nos. 1 and 2 mentioned that a Board meeting was held on 05.03<em>.</em>2016 and included an extract of the minutes of the said Board meeting quoting that it was resolved in the said Board meeting that a decision of agenda no. 7 of the meeting held on 05.02.2016 has been reviewed and discussed elaborately and for smooth functioning of the company, it has been decided that the account will henceforth be operated by any two of the three Directors namely, petitioner nos. 1 and 2 and ATM Mijanur Rahman. It is alleged that no such Board meeting was ever held and as such the contents of the letter dated 06.03.2016 are utterly false and the extracts of the Board meeting incorporated are wholly fictitious. The petitioner nos. 1 and 2 admitted the aforesaid allegation in the 10<sup>th</sup> Board meeting and also in the reply to the Legal Notice dated 05.12.2017.

This iconic plaza has been named ‘Neeshorgo’ by the Developer-company. The petitioners and all the respondents are the owners of the flats of the ‘Neeshorgo’. They have purchased their flats either from the land owner’s portion of 60% or from the Developer-company’s portion of 40% and, still now, the land owner and the Developer-company own some open spaces/flats, including the open space at first floor which is now being used as the restaurant (Marine Drive Restaurant), even after selling out the significant number of flats from their respective portions. The Managing Director and the Chairman of the Developer-company, eventually in the year 2016, came out with an idea that the flats and the restaurant may be rented out to a company with a view to getting the rents of the flats and restaurant without any hassle. Although it was possible to rent the flats to one company/individual, and the restaurant to a separate company/individual, they decided to manage all these assets by one company and, for the aforesaid purpose, most of the flat owners and owners of the restaurant-space at first floor (who are the Managing Director and Chairman of the Developer-company) formed a company having it incorporated as the ‘Neeshorgo Hotel and Resort Ltd’ on 27.01.2016. Thus, it appears to me that the company is not the owner of any flat or open space of this plaza named ‘Neeshorgo’. The company has simply taken lease/rent of the spaces/flats of this building. From the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Assocaition of the company, it transpires that the aim and object of the company is to run hotel and resort business, either by purchasing the flats, open space or by taking rent from the flat owners and building owners not only of this single premise (the Neeshorgo), but by purchasing and taking rent of other properties from all over Bangladesh and, simultaneously, to expand the business outside Bangladesh. In other words, the object of the company is not to keep its activities limited only within the periphery of a single spot at the Plot No. 492, Kolatoli, Marine Drive Road, Cox’s Bazar, but also to spread its business in some other suitable places of Bangladesh and abroad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">23.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Apparently, it was a noble initiative by the Managing Director and the Chairman of the Developer-company to show the flat owners a dream of making them the owners/shareholders of an incorporated company, in addition to getting rent of their respective flats and space and also to enjoy dividends, if the company flourishes. In other words, the flat owners who would become the shareholders of the company would hold two statuses, and financially they would be benefitted in two ways. Their first status is that they are the flat/space owners of the plaza named ‘Neeshorgo’ and their second status is that they are the owners of a company engaged in hotel and resort business named ‘Neeshorgo Hotel and Resort Ltd’. And, from the perspective of financial benefit, while on the one hand, they shall get rent of their respective flats/spaces from the company, on the other hand, if the company can make profit, they would get dividends. Thus, the flat owners of this edifice ‘Neeshorgo’ hold separate and distinct entity from having their entity as the shareholders of the company (Neeshogro Hotel and Resort Ltd). While the flat owners who have not become the shareholders of the company are free to rent out their flats either to the company or to any person or they themselves may live therein, similarly, the flat owners who have become the shareholders of the company are also at liberty to rent out their respective flats either to their company or to other person/company or they themselves may stay therein and if the shareholder-cum-flat owners rent out the flats to the company, they will get the rents for the flats like the other general flat owners. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">So, whether the flat owners would rent out their flats to the company or to the newly formed Partnership Firm or they themselves would manage their flats/space is a matter, out of the touch and reach of this Company Matter No. 295 of 2018. Therefore, the flat owners who are not the shareholders of the company, such as the respondent nos. 11-48, have nothing to do in these cases, and the petitioners rightly had not impleaded them as the respondents of this Company Matter. But, for the reason best known to them, they filed an application for addition of party in this Company Matter No. 295 of 2018. Although this Court was reluctant to allow their application for addition of party, however, on the persistent insistence of the learned Advocates for the respondent nos. 2-6 &amp; 11-48, they were added as the proper party; not as the necessary party. However, had the application for addition of party been strictly considered by this Court, their status would have been found to be one, which does not even come within the ambit of the proper party. But, since there was a direction by the Hon’ble Appellate Division upon this Court to give final verdicts on these two Company Matters (Company Matter No. 151 of 2019 and Company Matter No. 295 of 2019) on or before 09.05.2019, this Court considered it prudent not to create an opportunity for the respondents of the Company Matter No. 295 of 2019 to take the matter again before the Appellate Division against the Order of rejection of their application for addition of party towards squandering further time in disposing of two substantive Company Matters.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In the light of the position of the added respondent nos. 11-48 that, as the flat owners of this mega building, they are always at liberty either to live in their respective flats or to rent out to the company or to rent out to the newly formed Partneship Firm or to any other individual or proprietorship businesses or partnership business or company and, further, given the nature of their legal relationship with the petitioners, the issue as to whether they are still with the company or they have terminated their contracts with the company, or whether they are currently with the newly formed Partnership Firm, is not the subject matter of the present application under Section 233 of the Companies Act.

Apparently, the respondent nos. 2-6 have raised the maintainability issue on the grounds that (i) no specific allegation has been brought against them, (ii) whatever the allegations they have brought, those can not be resolved in the Company Bench, for, oral evidence would require adjudication of the allegations and (iii) the issue as to whether the contracts of the respondent nos. 11 to 48 with the company have been terminated or not, can not be adjudicated upon in a Company Matter. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">30.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Let me see whether there is substance in the aforesaid arguments made by the learned Advocates for the respondent nos. 2-6 on the ground of maintainability of the Company Matter No. 295 of 2018. The first ground is that no specific allegation has been brought by the petitioners against the respondents (the majority shareholders). In the light of the admitted fact that since the respondent nos. 2-6 &amp; 8-9 collectively are the majority shareholders, and since the respondent nos. 8 &amp; 9 as the Managing Director &amp; the Chairman and the respondent nos. 2-6 as the Directors of the company were not taking necessary steps for conducting the audit of the company, nor were they holding the AGM of the company, and since all of the respondent nos. 2-6 directly and the respondent nos. 8 &amp; 9 as abettors were blamed to have formed a parallel rival business, there is no scope for the respondents to say that no specific allegation has been brought against them. As per clause (a) of Section 233 (1) of the Companies Act, the petitioners are simply required to bring to the notice of this Court that <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">the affairs of the company are being conducted or the powers of the directors are being exercised in a manner prejudicial to one or more of its members or debenture </span>holders or in disregard of his or their interest. From the above admitted facts as to not conducting the audit of the company and non-holding of the AGMs of the company, it is vividly evident that <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">‘the affairs of the company are being conducted ……….. in a manner prejudicial to one on more of its members’</em> and, thus, I find that the petitioners having flawlessly brought to the notice of this Court the said admitted affairs of the company in a specific manner, there is no scope for the respondents to question the maintainability of this petition on the ground that no specific allegation has been brought against the respondents. In other words, while the petitioners have perfectly satisfied this Court about the requirement of Section 233(1)(a) of the Companies Act, the submissions of the learned Advocate for the respondent nos. 2-6 have no legs to stand upon and, accordingly, the same are repelled by the Court.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">31.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Although there are some other allegations of not running the affairs of the company in a beneficial manner (a) by not operating the Bank account with the signatures of the authorized Directors, (b) by running a parallel rivalry business at the same site, (c) by not signing the further agreements with the flat owners, (d) by not paying the rents to the flat owners regularly and so on, however, I would not go for examination of each of the aforesaid allegations, for, when the allegations of not conducting the audit and not holding the AGM are the admitted facts by all the respondents, and the allegation of commencing a new parallel business is also admitted by the respondent nos. 2-6, which sufficientty attracts the provisions of clause (a) of Section 233 (1) of the Companies Act, there is no need to deal with other factual issues by this Court. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">32.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The second ground of maintainability is that this Court is legally not empowered to adjudicate upon the factual issues involved in this case. There are two types of factual issues in any case, namely, admitted facts and disputed facts. When the facts contended by the plaintiff/petitioner are admitted by the defendants/respondents, question of taking any oral or documentary evidence becomes redundant. And, if any fact stated by the petitioner is disputed, not only by raising mere objection but also by attempting to substantiate the objection through credible written statements/affidavit and upon adducing the relevant document/paper, if any, in that scenario, the Courts are required to take oral evidence in an effort to discover and assess the truth. Now, the pertinent question that crops up for consideration is whether this Court is empowered to take oral evidence, if needed, for finding out the truth to arrive at the appropriate conclusion. In reply thereto, my humble understanding of the scheme of the Companies Act is that the Legislature intended to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>resolve all types of disputes or grievances arising out of the Companies Act expeditiously through a higher rank of Court i. e. either the District Court or the High Court Division, in a summary manner so as to help smoothly flourish the business and commerce without experiencing protracted, time-consuming and complex procedures which are required to be followed/observed/applied by the Civil Courts and, therefore, most of the Company Matters relating to/arising out of/in connection with the grievance of any members of the company or debenture holder of the company are tried/adjudicated upon without taking any oral evidence. However, it does not necessarily mean that the Company Court is not competent to dispose of a company case by taking oral evidance, because there is no provision within the four corners of the Companies Act prohibiting the Company Court to take oral evidence. Rather, the expressions employed in Section 233(3) of the Companies Act, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“If after hearing the parties present on the date……”,</em> implies that there may be petitioner witness/es (PW/s) or respondent witness/es (RW/s) or the Court witnesses/es (CW/s) if the facts and circumstances so warrant, inasmuch as this Court requires to form an opinion <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“If the Court is of the opinion”, </em>(the wordings of Section 233 (3) of the Companies Act) for passing necessary Order and/or Direction. Thus, I hold that since the Company Court is competent to frame any issue for trial, any complicated question of facts can be adjudicated upon by it through taking documentary and oral evidence towards passing an appropriate Order and Direction. Therefore, the ground taken by the learned Advocates for the respondents gets repelled. Even for the sake of argument if it is held, without being prejudiced, that the Company Court does not have the power to adjudicate upon the cases by taking oral evidence, in that event also, the ground taken by the learned Advocate for the respondents will not stand, for, the allegations of (i) not conducting the audit of the company, (ii) not holding the AGM of the company and (iii) running a rival business in the same building being admitted facts, there is no need of taking any oral evidence on these factual issues. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">33.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The last ground is that, since the issue as to whether valid contracts exist between the company and the flat owners can not be adjudicated upon here in this case, the petition under Section 233 of the Companies Act is not maintainable. This Court is fully in agreement with the above proposition. This Court’s clear opinion is that whether the respondent nos. 2-6 or 11-48 have got any contractual relationship with the company as the tenant and landlord, is a matter to be adjudicated upon by the Civil Court. Given the fact that the petitioners have not sought for adjudication of an issue of this sort here in this Company Matter, therefore, I find it to be a completely irrelevant ground for attacking this case, on the issue of maintainability of this case. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">34.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The above examen on the issue of maintainability of this application under Section 233 of the Companies Act leads me to hold that there is no substance in the arguments advanced by the learned Advocate for the respondent nos. 2-6 for rejection of this application on the ground of maintainability of this application under Section 233 of the Companies Act.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">35.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Now, let me take up the substantive issue as to whether the respondent nos. 2-6 deserve to remain as the Directors of the company.

From a minute perusal of the entire provisions relating to Directors in the Companies Act, as enshrined in Sections 90 to 110, my humble understanding about the terminology “Director” is that a Director is a person who is elected by the majority members entrusting upon him/her day-to-day business activities and finances and, also, to ensure that all statutory filing obligations are met. Thus, the Directors of the company in true sense are the ‘trustees’ of the company as defined in the Black’s Law Dictionary. The shareholders /members of the company keep a trust upon the Directors that they shall do everything for the welfare and benefit of the company and its members and, therefore, there exists a fiduciary relationship between the Directors and others members of the company. Once this fiduciary relationship is broken, a Director must no longer hold the position of a Director of the company.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">38.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Having laid down the above dictum on the term “Director”, I need to see now whether the respondent nos. 2-6 have lost the trust of the shareholders (members) of the company resulting in breaking up the fiduciary relationship between them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">         </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">39.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It is an admitted fact that the respondent nos. 2-6 have created a Partnership Firm under the name and style of ‘Neeshorgo Management Enterprise’ which has been impleaded in this petition as respondent no.7. It is also an admitted position that the respondent nos. 2-6 while performing functions as the Directors of this company did not take any consent from the company to form another parallel business during the existence of this company. If the respondent nos. 2-6 were eager to run a separate business of the same nature at the same spot under the same roof, it was the duty of these Directors of this company to, at least, discuss the issue in the Board meeting, let alone taking approval from the Board of the company and, thereafter, they could have opted to undertake a separate business under the same roof. Anyone with ordinary prudence would be of the view that if a parallel business is run under the same roof by the Directors of the existing company, the interest of the company as well as its shareholders would inevitably be jeopardised. And, particularly when it is admitted by these respondents that due to providing a better service by their newly formed Enterprise, the flat owners of the plaza ‘Neeshorgo’ are becoming interested to sever their ties with the company, it is crystal clear to this Court that the activities of the respondent nos. 2-6 are crippling the business of the company and, hence, there is no reason for the members of the company to trust them any longer as the trustees (Directors) of the company. Therefore, this Court is of the view that the respondent nos. 2-6, having acted against the interest of the company as well as the interest of the shareholders of the company, are not competent to perform their duty as the Directors of the company. In augmenting my above conclusion, I find it pertinent to state that when the majority members of a cricket team lose faith in some players because of the latter’s involvment in “match fixing” to help win the opponent team, like the respondent nos. 2-6, they should not be in the team any longer. Likewise, when an ocean-going ship is drifting in the middle of the sea and, eventually upon finding another boat/ship, a few of crew members selfishly escape by boarding therein, they lose their right to remain as the crew member of the ship.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">40.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Now, a pertinent question may crop up as to under what provisions of law this Court is going to declare these Directors incompetent and expel them from the Board of Directors of the company. The answer thereto is that when the Court is of the opinion that the interest of the petitioner of a Section-233 application is being prejudicially affected, it may pass any Order it deems fit, as mandated by the Legislature in Section 233(3) of the Companies Act. Accordingly, in exercising the power vested in this Court under Section 233(3) of the Companies Act, this Court is well empowered to pass an Order decreeing that the respondent nos. 2-6 are hereby declared to be ‘disqualified’ or the offices of the respondent nos. 2-6 are hereby declared to have been ‘vacated’, but, for the reasons to be known hereinafter, I prefer not to use the legal terminologies ‘disqualified’ or ‘vacated’ in declaring them incompetent to be the members of the Board of the company.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">41.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However, because of not using the above-mentioned terminologies, there should not be any confusion that this Court can not declare any Director of the company to be ‘disqualified’ until a Director’s case falls within the ambit of Section 94 of the Companies Act or the office of a Director shall not be ‘vacated’ until a Director’s circumstance attracts the provisions of Section 108 of the Companies Act or a Director cannot be ‘removed’ without passing an extraordinary resolution under Section 106 of the Companies Act, inasmuch as the powers invested in the Court under Section 233(3) of the Companies Act is wider and superior than the power given to the Court by any other provisions of the Companies Act. By virtue of the power under Section 233(3) of the Companies Act, the Court is competent to order the company to conduct its audit, to appoint an Independent Auditor and to fix the remuneration of the Auditor, to direct the company for calling and holding any meeting (which may be Board meeting, EGM or AGM) and to make any necessary Order/Directions <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">‘to regulate the conduct of the company’s affairs’</em> (the expression engraved in Section 233(3)(b) of the Companies Act).

However, in my view, it would be a prudent exercise if this Court gives these respondents an opportunity to think over their actions so far taken by them in running a rivalry business and consider as to whether they can unitedly run the company, like the respondent nos. 8 &amp; 9, in a dream of making the company a reputed chain Hotel and Resort Company. For this to happen, the declaration made by this Court hereinbefore as to becoming or remaining incompetent as the Directors of the company is temporarily kept in abeyance till the date of holding the first Board meeting of the company, in an expectation by this Court that the respondent nos. 2-6 upon attending the Board meeting of the company will inform the Board about the closure of their Enterprise. If they do not turn up in the aforesaid Board meeting or if they do not agree to shut down the Enterprise, the company shall be competent to remove them from their directorship under Section 106 of the Companies Act.

From a careful reading of all the prayers made in this case, I did not find any prayer seeking a declaration that formation of the Partnership Firm named ‘Neeshorgo Management Enterprise’ was illegal.

The incident of opening up a new business by the influential Directors of the company or the whimsical decision of some landlords as to deserting the company or the financial stutus of the company as to not possessing any fund - can not lead this Court to go for a declaration that the company does no more exist, in this application under Section 233 of the Companies Act.
