The aforesaid owners of the land sold their land in favour of one Abdul Hakim Shorif, Abdul Latif Shorif and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Abdur Rob Shoirf. The said purchasers of the land subsequently sold the same in favour of the petitioner and the opposite parties No. 2 &amp; 3. The opposite party No. 02 is the brother of the petitioner, who sold out 17 decimals of land in favour of opposite party No. 01 by a registered sub-kabala deed dated 24.10.2000 at a consideration of taka 60,000/=. The further case of the petitioner is such that the petitioner is a co-sharer by purchase in the case <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">jote</em> and no notice of transfer under Section 89 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 was served upon the co-sharers of the case <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">jote</em> prior to sale of the case land. The further case of the pre-emptor-petitioner is such that the purchaser-opposite party No. 01 did not possess the case land and the petitioner for the 1<sup>st</sup> time came to know about the case kababla on 25.10.2000 from one Abdul Malek Bepari in presence of one Abdur Rob Hawlader. Therafter, the petitioner obtaining the certified copy of the case kabala came to know finally about the transfer deed and filed the original case for pre-emption. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt list .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The contrary case of the Purchaser-Pre-emptee-Opposite party No. 01 is such that the pre-emptor-petitioner was fully aware about the transfer since he was the full brother of the vendor-opposite party No. 02.

The learned Advocate also submits that there is no cogent evidence from the side of the pre-emptee that he has made any development work at a cost of taka 80,000-90,000/= and the learned courts below rightly in their observation and findings held that the pre-emptee-purchaser-opposite party No. 01 failed to prove his case and also failed to prove that notice for transfer under Section 89 of the State Acquisition<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>and Tenancy Act, 1950 was served and it is also not proved that the pre-emptor was ever tendered to purchase the case land prior to transfer. The learned Advocate lastly submits that, there is no illegality or infirmity in the findings and decision of the learned Appellate Court by which it can be held that there has been any wrong resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice by which the impugned judgment and order can be interfered with. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt list .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">10.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In order to appreciate the submission of the learned Advocates for the parties to the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>case, I have perused the judgment and order passed by the trial court in Pre-emption Miscellaneous Case No. 01 of 2001 and the impugned judgment and order passed in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 11 of 2008 along with the evidence on record with all other relevant papers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt list .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">11.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Having gone through the case records it transpires that the pre-emptor to the original case filed the Miscellaneous Case No. 01 of 2001 on 04.01.2001 under Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 alleging that the opposite party No. 02 who is a co-sharer of the pre-emptor, transferred the case land in favour of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>stranger opposite party No. 01 behind the back of the pre-emptor on 24.10.2000 and prior to transfer no notice under Section 89 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 was served upon the co-sharers of the case holding.

The only question which was raised from the side of the present-petitioner is such that the case is barred by the principle of estopple, waiver and acquiescence, inasmuch as; the pre-emptor was asked to purchase the case land prior to transfer and at his refusal; the case land was transferred in favour of the purchaser-opposite party No. 01by the vendor-opposite party No. 02. The other point which is raised at this stage is such that neither the trial court nor the appellate court in their observation and findings decided the matter of estopple, which is an apparent illegality on the face of the record since the purchaser-opposite party in his written objection clearly stated that. In his context, on perusal of the judgment and findings of both the courts below I find that the trial court in his observation and findings at the time of disposal of the points for determination number 1 &amp; 5 which are, as to whether the petitioner is a co-sharer in the disputed holding and as to the whether the petitioner is entitled to get an order of pre-emption, opined at a stage that the pre-emptee-opposite party No. 01, who was only the contesting opposite party to the case, failed to prove that notice<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>under section 89 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 was issued upon the petitioner and Secondly, failed to prove that the petitioner was told to buy the case land prior to the case kabla.
