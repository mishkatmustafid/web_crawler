From the trend of decisions in this respect, it is obvious that, a contempt matter, being quasi criminal in nature, there is no period of limitation for filing a contempt petition or to issue a suo-motu Rule, although it rests within the sole discretion of this Court if the Court should or should not entertain a delayed application or issue a suo-motu Rule, depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. However, the cause of delay should either be explained or be apparent from the facts and circumstances of the case. If a petition is found to be a vexatious, frivolous or infractuous one, then the Court should be loathe to accept such petition. On the contrary, if it is found that the petitioner or this Court was deterred by any situation that had patently or latently threatened or might have threaten the independent exercise of the Court’s contempt jurisdiction even in a fit case, or if issuing a contempt Rule, even in a patently appropriate case, may lead the Court<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>to face uncalled for resistance or confrontation with any other organ or may lead the Court to a situation that the Court alone is left to handle, then this Court may be reluctant to initiate a contempt proceeding or to issue a contempt Rule immediately.

Kamrul Alam has appeared on behalf of the contempt-petitioner. He submits that the contemner-respondent No. 1 was the then Chairman and contemner-respondent No. 2 was the then Vice-Chairman and that these contemners and other directors did not comply with the judgment and order dated 16.11.2014 passed in Company Matter No. 61 of 2012, in not holding any AGM in accordance with the provisions of law, and in not sending CV of 3 persons to Bangladesh Bank for appointment to the vacant position of the Managing Director of the Jubilee Bank Limited (JBL), as ordered by this Court. He also submits that the contemner-respondents have created a lot of fake and fabricated documents and presented a reply before this Court showing that they have held 96<sup>th</sup> to 101<sup>st</sup> AGMs, but these are only mere paper transactions and are fake minutes of 96<sup>th</sup> to 101<sup>st</sup> AGM, since, no AGM was held and no notice has been served upon any shareholders, including the petitioner. As regards the letter of the Bangladesh Bank seeking clarification regarding appointment of the Managing Director, the learned Advocate submits that, these are discrete conduct of the contemner-respondents to avoid compliance of this Court’s direction to appoint a Managing Director for the Bank (JBL) and that this order of the Court is very clear and it does not require any clarification from the Bangladesh Bank. He asserted that, once this Court has passed an order, Bangladesh Bank cannot arrogate to itself the task to interpret or clarify the order of this Court. He, therefore, concludes that, by their aforesaid conducts, the contemner-respondents have committed contempt of this Court as well as practiced fraud with the Court by creating and submitting fabricated minutes and other documents. Hence, the petitioner had to file another petition seeking condonation of delay for holding those outstanding AGM afresh, which has been registered as Company Mater No. 315 of 2017. He submits that unless these contemner-respondents are punished for such deliberate violation of the Court’s order and the deception made, then these types of practices will be continued by other unscrupulous persons by abusing their power and position and this will invite disasters, particularly in banking sector, and that will wholly frustrate the rules of law and shall render the judgments and orders a total nullity, which is a clear case of disrespect to the authority, dignity and majesty of this Court. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 0in left 25.65pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">11.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Learned Advocate Mr. Imam Hossain has appeared on behalf of the contemner-respondent Nos. 1,2,6,7 and 8.

The learned Advocate further submits that, because of a clique of the petitioner and his associates, the bank could not run smoothly since he and others had created a fake board of directors and there are lot of anomalies in respect of shareholding position of the bank. The learned Advocate also submits that, the petitioner, with intent to grab the control of the bank, has addressed several letters to various departments like Ministries, Bangladesh Bank, RJSC and the law enforcing agencies, but all these allegations (made by the petitioner and others) were found false and baseless. He then submits that, as regards the direction to send CV of 3 persons, as given in the judgment and order dated 16.11.2014 for appointment of Managing Director in JBL, the contemner-respondent No. 1 had sent a letter to the Bangladesh Bank for clarification, but the contemner-respondents did not receive any clarification. Hence, they could not comply with the said direction and that non-compliance was unintentional.
