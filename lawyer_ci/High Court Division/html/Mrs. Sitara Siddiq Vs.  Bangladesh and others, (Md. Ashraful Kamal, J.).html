However, the extraordinary this Court may be, it cannot verify the documents and truthfulness of the documents. The annexure annexed to the writ petition require elaborate investigation which is not the function of this Court and there being a forum namely the Court of Settlement set up to investigate into the facts of the case. In the light of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we are of the view that the petitioner Mrs. Sitara Siddiq fabricated some papers and documents with the aid of some unscrupulous people to grab the abandoned property in question illegally. Since the original allotee was not found in the house in question after the liberation war, the Govt. rightly declared the house as an abandoned property and included it in the ‘kha’ list.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">  </span>. . .

After liberation his house was vacant and accordingly the properties were declared abandoned as per law. The respondent No 1. further stated that the so-called mortgage- deeds and documents are fake and collusive which has been created by the petitioner for grabbing the properties in question and the petitioner had prior knowledge about the abandoned list. Moreover, the SDO did not issue any release order/exclusion of the properties from abandoned list. The respondent issued notice upon the dweller of the said house, but as per direction of the notice the petitioner or anybody did not appear before the authority concerned with the documents, if any.  H.R. Rehman was never a citizen of Bangladesh and all documents using his name are also false and fake documents. An illegal claimer has no right to get any protection from the state. Although the property was in the abandoned property list H.A. Rehman i.e. allottee transferred the property to Mr. A.B. Siddiq and on 19.11.1975 the wife of A.B.

He also submits that as per provision of Article 4 of P.O. of 1972, the control, management and disposal of abandoned properties vested in the government and accordingly the government is discharging its duty in that regard.  The case land is under their control and management.

In such a situation if a person claiming right title and interest therein intends to take the property out of the list of the abandoned building or seeks any other relief’s as provided in section 7 of the Ordinance he is required to apply to the Court of Settlement established under section 7 of the Ordinance and there he is required to establish that the property is not an abandoned property and that has not vested in the Government. </span></em></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">13. The provisions as are in section 5(2) and section 7 of the Ordinance clearly show that onus of rebutting the presumption. i. e. the property is an abandoned property and has vested in the Government or in other words establishing the fact that the property is not an abandoned property and has not vested in the Government is totally on the person who challenges the presumption or in other words claiming the property and intends to take such property out of the list of the abandoned property ;published in the official Gazette or for any other relief as are in section 7 of the Ordinance. In this connection reference may be made to the case of Government of Bangladesh Vs. Md. Jalil and others reported in 48 DLR (AD) 10 wherein it has been held “section 5(2) of the Ordinance clearly provides that the list published under sub-section (1) shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that the buildings included therein are abandoned property and have vested in the Government as such. Section 7 says that a person claiming any right or interest in any such building may make an application to the Court of Settlement for exclusion of the building from such list etc. on the ground that the building is not an abandoned building and has not vested in the Government under President’s Order No. 16 of 1972 or that his right or interest in the building has not been affected by the provisions of that Order. The onus, therefore, is squarely on the claimant of the building to prove that the building is not an abandoned property. The Government has no obligation either to deny the facts alleged by the claimant or to disclose the basis of treating the property as abandoned property merely because the same is disputed by the claimant”. Similar view has been expressed in the case of Hazerullah and another vs. Chairman, 1<sup>st</sup> Court of Settlement and another reported in (1998) 3 BLC (AD), 42. Therein it has been held “that the onus lies upon the claimant of the building to prove that the building is not an abandoned property” and that the onus lies upon the claimant of the property and that any other person claiming through the original owner to prove to establish the fact that the owner of the property or any other person claiming through the owner “had been present in Bangladesh or had been occupying, supervising or managing in person the disputed property” when on 28 February, 1972 president’s Order No. 16 of 1972 came into operation. This Division in the case of Government of Bangladesh vs. Ashraf Ali and another reported in 49 DLR (AD), 161 has held “that the enlistment of a building under section 5(1) of Ordinance 54 of 1985 raises a presumption in law that the property is an abandoned property under section 5(2) of the Ordinance. The presumption is, of course, a rebuttable presumption but respondent No. 1 failed to rebut this presumption”. In the case of Bangladesh vs. Md. Shajahan reported in (2000) 20 BLD (AD), 166 it has been held “Thus, section 7 enjoins upon the claimant before the Court of Settlement to prove that the property is not an abandoned property, in a like manner the plaintiff is to prove his case and the Government, like that of a defendant, is under no legal obligation to prove that the property is an abandoned property or to disclose the basis of treating the property as an abandoned property”. In the case of Asma Begum vs. Bangladesh and others reported in (2001) 21 BLD (AD), 134 it has been held that the onus lies on the claimant of the property ‘ to rebut the conclusive evidence as provided in section 5(2) of the Ordinance”. The High Court Division in disregard of the provisions as are in sections 5(2) and of the Ordinance encumbered the appellants to establish that the property in question is not an abandoned property and has not vested in the Government or that to establish the facts in the presence whereof the property can be listed as abandoned property and vests in the Government. This approach of the High Court Division was erroneous and as the High Court Division thereupon interfered with the judgment of the Court of Settlement, the judgment under appeal is not sustainable. </span></em></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">14. The Court of Settlement on consideration of the materials brought on record by the claimant of the property for having the property delisted from list of abandoned buildings arrived at the finding that the allottee of the property (to whom the property in question belonged and who gifted the same to her daughter and from whom Respondent No. 1 is claiming by purchase in October, 1979) was not present in Bangladesh and whereabouts of the allottee were not known at the time when President’s Order No. 16 of 1972 came into operation i.e. on February 28, 1972. It may be mentioned the consistent case of the Government is that the allottee of the property Sahera Khatun was not present in Bangladesh at the time of emergence of Bangladesh and thereafter her whereabouts were not known and also on the date when P.O. 16 of 1972 came into operation. From claimant’s side no oral or documentary evidence was led to show that Sahera Khatun was present in Bangladesh and her whereabouts were known when P.O. 16 of 1972 came into operation. The Respondent No. 1 tried to establish that Sahera Khatun was very much in Bangladesh by producing the affidavit affirmed on 14.07.1973 before the Magistrate in confirmation of the oral gift said to have been made by Sahera Khatun in favour of her daughter Anwari Khatun on 16.04.1973. The property said to have been gifted at a time when in the background of the assertion of the appellants the property has become abandoned property. The Court of Settlement in the background of the facts and circumstances of the case held that the alleged oral gift was not formally proved since the person in whose presence  as mentioned in the affidavit were not examined and thereupon arrived at the finding that it has not been established that Sahera Khatun was present in Bangladesh and her whereabouts were known when P.O. 16 of 1972 came into operation. It is seen from the judgment of the High Court Division that the said Division discarded the aforesaid finding of the Court of Settlement placing reliance upon the affidavit affirmed by Sahera Khatun and the recitals therein as well as the recitals in the kabala executed by the donee Anwari Khatun (daughter of Sahera Khatun) and finally arrived at conclusion that Sahera Khatun was very much in Bangladesh and as such the property is not an abandoned property. The Respondent No. 1 has not led evidence or brought  materials on record to discharge the onus of rebutting the presumption that the property is not an abandoned property and that has also not established that the property is not an abandoned property. This being the position High Court Division was in error in interfering with the judgment of the Court of Settlement. </span></em></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">15. The High Court Division while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 102(2) of the Constitution in respect of the judgment of a tribunal or in other words exercises its jurisdiction in certiorari is certainly not acting as a Court of appeal and to reassess the evidence and finally to arrive at a view different from the tribunal in the absence of arriving at a finding that the view taken by the tribunal in the background of the materials noticed by it is not legally tenable or logically not well founded e.g. the case as the instant one. The High Court Division while examining the correctness of the judgment of the subordinate tribunal does not act as the Court of appeal and this has been held in the case of Government of Bangladesh Vs. Md. Jalil and others reported in 48 DLR (AD) 10 “The High Court Division was not a Court of appeal required to make determination of facts on its own. It could interfere with the findings of a tribunal of fact under its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 102 only if it could be shown that the tribunal had acted without jurisdiction or made any finding upon no evidence or not considering any material evidence / facts causing prejudice to the complaining party or that it had acted mala fide or in violation of any principle of natural justice. In the absence of any of these conditions the interference by the High Court Division will itself be an act of without jurisdiction”. It may be mentioned in the instant case there is absence of any one of the aforesaid matters or situations. In the case of Government of Bangladesh Vs. Ashraf Ali reported in 49 DLR(AD), 161 it has been held that the High Court Division while exercising its power under certiorari in connection with the judgment of an interior tribunal is not within its jurisdiction if it act in a manner or that considering the materials on record in the manner “in which a Court of appeal disposes of an appeal”. In the instant case the High Court Division did this error in considering the materials on record in the manner as if it sat as a Court of appeal over the judgment of the  Court of Settlement. In the case of Mostafa Kamal vs. First Court of Settlement and others reported in 48 DLR (AD) 61 it has been held that the High Court Division in exercise of its writ jurisdiction in connection with the judgment of the Court of Settlement “cannot sit as a Court of Appeal over the judgment of the Court of Settlement for re-setting questions of fact”. The High Court Division in fact did that i.e. without arriving at a finding that the Court of Settlement committed any procedural error or that Court of Settlement had arrived at the finding as regard the material fact that Sahera Khatun was not present in Bangladesh and her whereabouts were not known when P.O. 16 of 1972 came into operation and that oral gift made by Sahera Khatun in favour of her daughter Anwari Khatun has not been proved by calling the persons in whose presence the gift said to have been made upon ignoring any material or any material fact having the bearing in making the decision in the aforesaid matter was left out of consideration. In fact the High Court Division on fresh assessment of the fact of its own resettled the question of fact upon sitting over the judgment of the Court of Settlement like the Court of appeal.” </span></em></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">19.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In the case of Mohammad Abdul Alim Vs.
