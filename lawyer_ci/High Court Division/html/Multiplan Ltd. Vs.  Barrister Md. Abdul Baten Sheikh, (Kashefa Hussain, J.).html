Case must be filed under Section 7(ka) for praying ad-interim relief under the Act. He elaborates his submissions upon contention that in this case the present opposite party No. 1 filed the application under Section 7(ka) of the Arbitration Misc. Case No. 260 of 2016 filed earlier under Section 12 of the Arbitration Act 2001 for appointment of Arbitrator. He submits that an application under Section 7(ka) of the Arbitration Act, 2001 is an independent proceeding which confers jurisdiction on the District Judge only when an independent Arbitration Miscellaneous Case is filed under Section 7(ka) of the Arbitration act, 2001. He contends that as per the listed serial No. 38 of Rule – 774 of Civil Rule and Orders (C.R.O) Volume I a separate and independent Arbitration Miscellaneous Case must be filed following the provisions of the C.R.O. He further agitates that the dispute is not a subject of Arbitration any more since the sale deed over the subject matter has been executed and the flat has been duly transferred to the purchase owner. He assails that since possession has also been taken over and the sale deed has been completed therefore the arbitration clause No. 50 mentioned in the agreement ceased to be enforceable and that there is no existence of any arbitration agreement any made within the definition of the Arbitration Act, 2001. He contends that once the sale deed is executed and completed and the other requirements have been complied with, the clauses in the agreement with Arbitration Act, 2001 does not exist. He further argues that the trial court below passed an erroneous order confusing the petitioner’s “common space” with the “undivided and undemarcated portion of land” as described in the schedule of the sale deed. He agitates that the registered sale deed are for apartments on level-5 but yet the trial court erroneously passed an order of status-quo upon possession and transfer of level-4 space at Meghna Bhabon and which is beyond the ambit of the Deed of Agreement of the sale deed since the schedule Gha is not included in it. He assails that the claim of Community Hall, Mosque and Gym as a common space being in schedule Gha is not supported in the sale deed. He also tries to impress upon us that the opposite party No. 1 (petitioner in the arbitration case) actually did not constitute any flat owner Samitee and hence he has no locus-standi to file the Arbitration Miscellaneous case since there is no existence of any such Samitee which he supposedly represented in the arbitration Misc. case. In support of his submissions regarding non existence of the arbitration agreement after the sale deed is executed, he cited a decision of our Apex court in the case of Rafiqul Islam Vs. Mir Abdul Ali reported in 44 DLR(AD)(1992) 176 along with an unreported judgment passed in Civil Revision No. 1000 of 2016 in the case of Multiplan Limited Represented by its Chairman and CEO Engineer Syed Munsif Ali and another Vs.

On the other hand he submits that the trial court correctly passed the order of ad-interim injunction in the Arbitration Misc. Case under Section 7(ka) of the Arbitration Act, 2001. He takes us to clause 50 of the agreement which is marked as Annexure 1 in the counter Affidavit filed on behalf of the opposite party No.1 wherefrom he draws our attention to the same clause and persuades that Clause 50 of the Agreement comprises of the Arbitration Clause and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>contemplates that any dispute arising between the purchaser and the company either directly or indirectly under the agreement shall be referred to arbitration in the event of failure to settle the dispute through amicable settlement.

He further focuses our attention to Clause 50 of the agreement putting emphasis on the terms that any disagreement dispute or difference arising either “directly or indirectly” between the parties under the agreement. In this context he persuaded that therefore it is express enough in the agreement itself that any dispute arising subsequently to the agreement either “directly or indirectly” at whatever stage shall be settled through arbitration once other resorts to resolve the dispute have failed. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Regarding the legality of filing an application praying for an ad-interim injunction under Section 7(ka) in the Arbitration Misc. Case filed under Section 12 of the Arbitration Act, 2001, the learned Senior Advocate submits that there is no bar against filing an application under Section 7(ka) under the umbrella of Section 12 of the Arbitration Act. He contends that nowhere in the Arbitration Act, 2001 has it been mentioned or otherwise implied that subsequent to filing a case under Section 12 of Arbitration Act, 2001, thereafter a separate case and/or proceeding must be initiated under Section 7 ka of Arbitration Act 2001 for obtaining relief under Section 7 ka. He also assails in his argument a number of factual issues regarding the non compliance with the terms of the Arbitration agreement by the developer petitioner particularly on the issue of reserve space for community hall, mosque etc. being given to outsiders or being otherwise isolated from the possession of the flat owners. On issues of maintainability of the Arbitration Case itself, he asserts that maintainability of a case or suit whatsoever cannot be heard neither can any findings on maintainability be decided upon in an application for injunction. He persuades us that issues of maintainability can only be decided during trial or hearing of the suit or case whatsoever. In support of his submissions the learned Senior Advocate cited some decisions in the case of Dacca Match Factory Ltd. Vs. Bangladesh Match Company Ltd. reported in 30 DLR (1978) 244, in the case of Molla Mahjenul Islam Vs. State and ors. reported in 53 DLR (2001) 552, in the case of Jamalpur Fishermen’s Co-operative Society Ltd. reported in 47 DLR (1995) 573, in the case of Nasir Miah, Malik Nasir Soap Factory Vs. Md.

Case 260 of 2016 by the present opposite party No. 1 purchaser flat owner, the present petitioner filed a Civil Revision being No. 3515 of 2016 against appointment of Arbitrator. In that Civil Revisional Application No.3515 of 2010 Rule was issued but in which Rule was ultimately discharged upon hearing and there is nothing on record to show that the instant petitioner took any steps against this judgment discharging the Rule in Civil Revision No. 3515 of 2016. It is therefore evident that the instant petitioner did not go to the Appellate Division challenging the judgment. However in the said judgment this division had given observation that “the present petitioners still have the scope to raise the objections before the Court below if they so desire. Hence, the instant revisional application is pre-mature. We do not find any illegality in the impugned order.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However, it is our considered view that the issue of arbitrability of the dispute pursuant to the sale deed cannot be raised any more. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">11.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-ansi-language: EN;">But for our purpose we are here anxious over the other issues raised by the learned Advocate for the petitioner. The learned Advocate for the petitioner agitated that the Arbitration Misc. Case No. 260 of 2016 is in limine not maintainable given that in the instant case sale deed between the contending parties have already been executed. He persuaded that once sale deed has been executed the agreement has also been exhausted and does not exist anymore<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>and since the property is also registered agreement hence any issue including the arbitration clause on issue of arbitration cannot be a subject matter or be relied upon in any further dispute between the parties. The learned Advocate even took us to the agreement itself (marked as Annexure 1 in the counter Affidavit filed by the opposite party No. 1) particularly clause 50 of the agreement which comprises of the provision of referring disputed matters to arbitrator in the event of failure to resolve the dispute by amicable settlement. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">12.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Upon perusal of Clause 50 of the agreement and relying upon general principles of law, we cannot however agree with the contentions made by the learned Advocate for the petitioner. Regarding the sale deed and the argument of the petitioner pertaining to the non existence of the arbitration agreement pursuant to sale deed, it is our considered view that a sale deed is a conclusive evidence of the sale itself but none the less it is not a conclusive evidence that all the terms relating to the agreement followed up by the sale deed have been complied with. There is nothing in the sale deed to show that all the terms of the agreement have been complied with. One of the issues agitated by the learned Advocate for the petitioner is that pursuant to the sale deed the arbitration agreement also ceases to exist. As mentioned above, we have read Clause 50 of the agreement. We cannot agree with the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioner. In this particular case from a reading of Clause 50 of the agreement which clause consists of the arbitration clause, we cannot interpret any terms from it which may indicate that the arbitration clause shall cease to exist pursuant to the sale deed. Clause 50 of the agreement consists the arbitration clause reads which as hereunder: </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong><em><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-ansi-language: EN;">“In case any disagreement, dispute, or difference arises between the ALLOTTEE and the COMPANY hereto either directly or indirectly under this Agreement in such case the same shall be settled amicably through mutual discussion and on failure of which the same shall be referred to the arbitration of two Arbitrators one to be appointed by each party whose decision shall be final and binding on both the parties.“</span></em></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-ansi-language: EN;"> Clause 50 of the agreement includes the term “directly or indirectly” under this agreement from which we may safely conclude that any dispute arising at any stage in the event of failure to settle the matter amicably shall be referred to arbitration by the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">13.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-ansi-language: EN;">In the context of the conclusive effect of a sale deed he places before us a decision of our Apex court reported in 44 DLR(AD)(1992) 176 in the case of Rafiqul Islam Vs.

We are also in agreement with the principle of these judgments cited by the opposite party No.1. But as mentioned herein before in this judgment the main contention in this case being the legality of the impugned order No. 15 dated 07.02.2017, we do not find it necessary or relevant to dwell upon other issues. The learned Counsels from both sides had also agitated over several factual issues and which are disputed matters of fact and which sitting in Revision here we are not in a position to adjudicate upon. These factual issues may be placed by the parties before the appropriate forum. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">18.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Therefore under the foregoing facts and circumstances and upon perusal of the application and materials on record and the decisions cited by the learned Advocates from both sides</span><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN;"> we are inclined to dispose of the rule with direction to the trial court to renumber the Misc.
