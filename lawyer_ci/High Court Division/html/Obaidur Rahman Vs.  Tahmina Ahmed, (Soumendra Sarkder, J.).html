In the office of the Notary Public, Dhaka in presence of one Mawlana the dower money was fixed at Tk. 3,00,000/- (Three lac). Subsequently, after the execution of ‘<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">holofnama’</em> </strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">(affidavit)</span> with regard to the marriage, according to the terms and conditions of that ‘<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">holofnama’</em></strong> on 10.12.2010 the marriage ceremony was held in the residence of the plaintiff’s father through one Md. Yousuf Kari. The ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">kabinnama’</em> was executed and registered on that date. Thereafter, the plaintiff and the defendant lived together as husband and wife in the residence of the defendant. The marriage was duly consumed, and at a stage of that; the defendant became addicted and he started to give pressure to the plaintiff for obtaining money as dowry from her father. The plaintiff while denied to bring money as dowry from her father, the defendant started torture to her and on 14.04.2013 the defendant driven her out from his residence and as a result of that; the plaintiff finding no other alternative returned back to the residence of her parents in one cloth. The further case of the plaintiff is such that the defendant was requested repeatedly to resolve the matter, but without resolving the matter of demanding dowry, the defendant again demanded Tk. 2,00,000/- (Two lac) dowry from the father of the plaintiff. The parents of the plaintiff was not in a position to give the dowry amount and since then the plaintiff is residing in the residence of her parents. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The contrary case of the defendant-petitioner in short is thus, that a relationship was developed between the plaintiff and the defendant through mobile phone initially and at a stage of that; the plaintiff asked the defendant to come at Savar of district Dhaka. Accordingly, the defendant on 25.11.2010 went to Savar, where the plaintiff and her other relatives with the help of some terrorists confined the defendant in a room and managed to obtain his signatures in a volume book and other papers. The further case of the defendant is such that the plaintiff and her men created a ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">kabinnama’</em> of marriage between he and the plaintiff, in where; the dower money was fixed at Tk.1,50,000/- (One lac and fifty thousand), out of which Tk.1,000/- (one thousand) was paid instantly. Subsequently, the defendant coming to his own residence from the residence of the plaintiff, informed the matter to his parents and other relatives and a “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Shalish-boithak</em>” was held. In that “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Shalish-boithak</em>” it was decided that the plaintiff will <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">take the rest dower money including maintenance</span> at a time. Accordingly, the plaintiff in that “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Shalish-boithak</em>” accepted Tk.1,50,000/- (One lac fifty thousand), which was given by the defendant to her. Thereafter, the defendant on 02.02.2013 going to the office of the marriage register gave “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Talaq</em>” to the plaintiff and an affidavit was executed to that effect in the office of the Notary Public on 03.02.2013.

The learned Advocate further submits that, the trial court as well as the appellate court committed illegality in holding the view that in fact the marriage ceremony was solemnized between the parties and there was unpaid dower money of that marriage. The learned Advocate also submits that the defendant after the so-called marriage divorced the plaintiff in proper way and swear an affidavit in the office of the Notary Public. The learned Advocate for the petitioner during his submissions after filing an application under Order XLI, rule 27 along with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure supported by two acknowledgement receipts and copy of notice under section 7(1) of Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 prays for giving the defendant-petitioner an opportunity to prove his case after accepting the papers submitted by him as additional evidence. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">As against the aforesaid submissions and application, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite party opposing the Rule and application, vehemently controverted the submissions advanced from the side of the petitioner and submits that the papers filed at present are all collusive, fraudulent and created and that, there was no threat or coercion from the side of the plaintiff-opposite party for the marriage ceremony between the plaintiff and the defendant. The learned Advocate further submits that the defendant-petitioner voluntarily with his free and full consent married the plaintiff-opposite party and the “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">kabinnama</em>” was executed and registered fairly and legally, in which; the dower money was fixed at Tk. 3,00,000/- (Three lac). The learned Advocate also submits that during disposal of the original suit and it’s subsequent appeal the learned trial court as well as the appellate court committed no illegality or irregularity, rather; on the basis of sufficient credible evidence the judgment and order was passed. The learned Advocate argued that at this stage; there is no scope for additional evidence or acceptance of the papers filed from the side of the defendant-petitioner under Order XLI, Rule 27 read with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, since all these papers are recent in origin and are forged, fabricated and manipulated. The learned Advocate further submits that, neither in the trial court nor in the appellate court, these papers were filed or exhibited after proof from the side of the defendant-petitioner and subsequently out of ill-motive to deprive the plaintiff-opposite party from getting her lawful demand which is her legal right, all these papers has been created. The learned Advocate lastly after referring some decisions of this Court and our Apex Court submits that the learned appellate court below rightly in his judgment and findings conclusively held that no notice under section 7(1) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 was given or issued by the defendant in support of the alleged ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Talaq’</em>. The acknowledgement due notice and the papers showing ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Talaqnama’</em> are all spurious papers. In the written statement also it is not the pleading’s case of the defendant that notice under section 7(1) of the Muslim Family Law Ordinance, 1961 was given or issued by him.

On that date when the defendant went to Savar, the plaintiff in collusion with her relatives and some miscreants forcibly confined the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>defendant in a room and managed to take his signatures in a volume book by which the ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">kabinnama</em>’ was created and in that ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">kabinnama</em>’ the dower money was fixed at Tk.1,50,000/-.
