The judicial review powers of the Bangladesh Supreme Court also cannot be exercised by an ICSID tribunal since ICSID tribunals have no powers to seize the proceeds of crime being enjoyed by the respondents No.4 and No.5 in Bangladesh. ICSID tribunals may only issue a pecuniary award but cannot punish corruption or declare invalid unlawful exercise of executive powers. The proper forum for the determination of issues such as unlawful exercise of executive authority tainted by bribery and corruption of Bangladesh Government officials is the Bangladesh Supreme Court applying Bangladeshi law under Article 102 of the Bangladesh Constitution. ICSID tribunals may benefit from our finding and there does not need to be any conflict since we are not infringing on the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunals. The corruption and illegality is at the heart of the contracts containing the arbitration agreements. If enforcement of any final arbitral award is sought in Bangladesh the Bangladeshi courts, at the time of making a decision whether to enforce an award arising from such contracts, would have to balance the public policy considerations of giving effect to the illegal contracts with the public policy consideration of recognizing the finality of ICSID arbitral awards. Regarding the third part of the Rule, it is clear that respondent No.5 (Niko Canada), the parent company which actually pleaded guilty to acts of corruption in Bangladesh and which initiated the corruption scheme, is not even party to the pending cases before the ICSID tribunals. The ICSID tribunals have no powers over the assets of respondent No.5 in Bangladesh. For these reasons, we cannot agree with the respondent No.4 that the Rule is infructuous.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">  </span>. . .

On ratification, the UNCAC created legal obligations for Bangladesh and those have to be enforced through the Executive branch and/or the Judiciary of Bangladesh. Thus, Bangladesh has a duty under international law, as laid out in Article 31 of the UNCAC, to confiscate the proceeds of crime. Article 51 of the UNCAC makes the return of assets which are proceeds of crime a fundamental principle of the UNCAC. As such all proceeds of crime acquired by the respondents No.4 and No.5, through the use of a corrupt scheme, are to be returned to the state of Bangladesh. Article 53 mandates provisions for the direct recovery of corruption assets, including laws permitting private civil causes of action to recover damages owed to victim states and the recognition of a victim state’s claim as a legitimate owner of stolen assets. Article 54 requires State Parties to give effect to any confiscation order for corruption proceeds issued in another State Party, and to “consider taking such measures as may be necessary to allow confiscation…without a criminal conviction.” . . .

In 2011 the respondent No.5 entered into a plea bargain with the Canadian Crown Prosecution and pleaded guilty to providing illegal gratification to Bangladesh State Minister for Energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain to further the business objectives of its subsidiaries. It was admitted that the respondents No. 4 and No.5 gave a motor vehicle as bribe to the then State Minister for Energy. Respondent No.5 also admitted to paying bribes in the form of personal travel expenses for the State Minister for Energy. In exchange of the guilty plea, the Canadian authorities did not pursue the other charges of corruption.

The evidence in the ACC case and the evidence from the Canadian authorities show that the procurement of the JVA and GPSA was through corruption. In January 2005 the respondent No.4 started drilling operations in Chattak and caused two successive blowouts resulting in loss and damage which has now been estimated to be over United States Dollar one billion (US$1,000,000,000). Bangladesh Environment Lawyers Association (“BELA”) had filed writ petition No. 6911 of 2005 before this Hon’ble Court seeking a rule, <em>inter alia</em>, as to why the JVA should not be treated as being nullity in the eye of law. The facts presented in the writ petition No. 6911 of 2005 dealt with the procedural aspects of execution of the JVA and BELA could not provide any evidence of corruption as the evidence was not available at that time. A judgment dated 17.11.2009 was passed in writ petition No. 6911 of 2005 stating that “Niko cannot avoid its responsibility of giving adequate compensation for the losses caused by two successive blowouts” and that the “Rule succeeds in part” and it was also stated that “Niko is directed to pay compensation money as per the decision taken in the money suit now pending in the Court of the Joint District Judge or as per mutual agreement among the parties.

Furthermore, under the Nationwide Agreement, Mr. Salim Bhuiyan was admittedly paid US$ five hundred thousand (US$ 500,000) by respondents No.4 and No.5 as gratification for his exercise of influence over Bangladeshi Government officials. The US$4 million Consultancy Agreement, under which US$ 2.93 million was paid on 21.10.03 i.e. five days after the execution of the JVA dated 16.10.03,is admitted by Niko to have been used for making a payment of US$500,000 to Mr. Salim Bhuiyan for his influence and ability to obtain meetings with Bangladeshi Government officials. These admissions by the respondent No. 4 of payments to Stratum (owned by Mr. Qasim Sharif) and then to Mr. Salim Bhuiyan are admitted facts which taint the JVA and GPSA with corruption and render them void <em>ab initio</em>. In addition, the Stratum Management Contract clearly violated sections 161-165 of the Penal Code since it expressly stated that the respondent No. 4 would pay Stratum for “payments made to expedite or secure the performance” by Bangladesh public officials for “issuance of permits or licenses required for” the Niko Project. Respondent No.4 admits that these payments were made and banking records show that US$ 2.93 million out of the $5 million was paid 5 days after the execution of the JVA. Furthermore, the agreement with Nationwide (owned by Mr. Salim Bhuiyan) constitutes violation of section 163 of the Penal Code since Mr.Bhuiyan obtained the payment of US$500,000from Niko for his exercise of “personal influence” over Bangladeshi Government officials. Respondent No.4blatantly admits to paying US$500,000 immediately after the JVA for Mr. Bhuiyan’s influence and ability to arrange meetings with Bangladeshi Government officials which enabled the JVA to be procured. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0in left 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">21.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">Mr. Tanjib-ul Alam submits that there is no <em>res judicata</em> of the present petition with the pending ICSID cases or the previous writ petition No. 6911 filed by BELA. This petition arises from a different cause of action and there is no uniformity of parties. The parties in the present writ petition are not the same parties before the pending ICSID arbitration cases, in particular respondent No.5 (which admitted to the acts of corruption) is not a party to the ICSID proceedings and neither is respondent No.1. In addition, there is no <em>res judicata</em> since the ICSID tribunals have not issued any final award or judgment. There is also no <em>res judicata</em> of the present petition with the previous judgment in writ petition No. 6911 of 2005 since that judgment did not look into the issue of corruption and BELA did not produce any evidence of corruption. BELA tried to show that the process of granting of the exploration rights in Chattak East, which was not a marginal/abandoned field, to Niko under the JVA was improper since the process was non-transparent and without any competitive bidding. However, without any evidence of corruption, it was not possible to reach the conclusion that the JVA was executed in bad faith, through misuse of power, or in an improper manner rendering the JVA illegal and without any legal effect.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0in left 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 109%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">22.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 109%;">Mr. Tanjib-ul Alam next submits that the respondent No.4 has argued before the ICSID tribunals that those tribunals do not have the power to carry out judicial review of Bangladesh Government actions under Article 102 of the Bangladesh Constitution. Thus, respondent No.4 cannot at the same time argue that the Bangladesh Supreme Court should also not exercise its powers of judicial review. Such a position is not maintainable since that would mean, in this case, no court or tribunal would have the power to review the <em>ultra vires</em> exercise of government authority tainted by corruption. The judicial review powers of the Bangladesh Supreme Court also cannot be exercised by the ICSID tribunals since they have no powers to freeze or confiscate the proceeds of crime that are now being enjoyed by the respondents No.4 and No.5 in Bangladesh. ICSID tribunals may only issue a pecuniary award and cannot punish corruption or declare invalid the unlawful exercise of executive powers. The proper and effective forum for the determination of issues such as unlawful exercise of executive authority tainted by bribery and corruption of Bangladesh Government officials is the Bangladesh Supreme Court applying Bangladeshi law under Article 102 of the Bangladesh Constitution. In other words, the ICSID tribunals do not provide an equally efficacious remedy to the remedy provided under Article 102. In particular, the petitioner, respondent No.1, and respondent No. 5 (which admitted to acts of corruption) are not parties before the ICSID arbitration tribunals. The ICSID arbitration cases only relate to “investment disputes” which form the subject matter of such claims and only apply to parties to the dispute, i.e. Niko Bangladesh Limited (respondent No.4), BAPEX (respondent No.3), and Petrobangla (respondent No.2). ICSID has no jurisdiction over Niko Canada (respondent No.5) which has admitted to corruption before the Canadian courts or the Bangladesh Government officials who issued the <em>ultra vires</em> instructions to enter the JVA and GPSA. Thus, the pending ICSID arbitration cases have no effect on the constitutional powers exercised under Article 102 of the Bangladesh Constitution to judicially review <em>ultra vires </em>government actions tainted by corruption. The ICSID tribunals’ decisions, as opposed to awards, are also not binding on national courts of any sovereign country exercising constitutional powers. Even ICSID awards are not final since they can be stayed and are subject to review or annulment proceedings. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0in left 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">23.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">In the affidavit in opposition dated 02.04.2017 the respondent No. 1 has produced substantial evidence of corruption gathered by Bangladesh through Mutual Legal Assistance (MLAs) requests between the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Canada, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States, and the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in Bangladesh. The investigation of the corruption of respondent No.4 and No.5 was initiated by the Canadian law enforcing authorities in 2005. The initial RCMP investigation began in June 2005 after an official from Canada’s Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) alerted RCMP to the possible violations of the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act by respondents No.4 and No.5. The RCMP started investigation and had sent a letter of request to Bangladesh for investigation and legal assistance. That investigation was joined by the United States Department of Justice, through the FBI, since one of the prime actors in the corruption scheme, Mr. Qasim Sharif, was a U.S. citizen and transferred a large part of the proceeds of crime to the United States.

Once the JVA was executed Mr. Qasim Sharif (President of Niko Bangladesh) arranged for part payment totaling Taka three crore (approximately US$ 500,000) into the Standard Chartered Bank account of Mr. Salim Bhuiyan who also had “political clout” with the State Minister for Energy Mr. AKM Mosharraf Hossain. The RCMP conducted interviews of Mr. Mamoon during 01.11.2008 and 02.11.2008 during which Mr. Mamoon admitted that Mr. Qasim Sharif of Niko offered him $1 million for assisting Niko’s projects in Bangladesh. Mr. Mamoon also stated that fifty percent of his power is because he is the “friend of Tarique Rahman”. Mr. Mamoon admitted that the pay order dated 07.01.2004 for Taka one crore eight lac (Tk. 10,800,000) received by him from Mr. Salim Bhuiyan was part payment for his assistance for the Niko projects. On 15.01.2008 Mr. Salim Bhuiyan provided a statement by which he admitted that he acted as middleman to facilitate cash payments from Mr. Qasim Sharif of Niko to Mr. AKM Mosharraf Hossain, former State Minister for Energy and Mr. Giasuddin Al Mamoon. After procurement of the JVA Mr. Qasim Sharif paid Mr. Salim Bhuiyan 3 crore taka into his Standard Chartered Bank in Gulshan.

The rendering of the JVA and GPSA void <em>ab initio</em> is ancillary to the finding that the exercise of the Government powers was procured by corruption and <em>ultra vires</em>. In addition, since the JVA and GPSA were approved by the Government and could not have been executed without Government approval there is no scope of treating them merely as commercial contracts. In addition, the ICSID tribunals have recognized that they have no powers over third parties or the courts of Bangladesh exercising jurisdiction even in the ICSID tribunals’ own decision. The jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunals in this case is purely based on contract and the state of Bangladesh is not a party to the pending ICSID arbitration cases. Public law issues such as corruption and judicial review of Government actions tainted by corruption are strictly speaking outside the ambit of these ICSID arbitration cases and the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunals, especially since the contracts containing the arbitration clauses are void <em>ab initio</em> and thus never existed. For this reason, the ICSID tribunals should defer to the Supreme Court of Bangladesh’s findings in this writ petition.

The Rule has three parts - (i) why the JVA should not be declared to be void <em>ab initio; </em>(ii) why the GPSA should not be declared to be void <em>ab initio </em>and (iii) why the assets of respondents No.4 and No.5, including their shareholding interest in Tullow Bangladesh Limited concerning Block-9 PSC should not be attached and seized to provide adequate compensation for the 2005 blowouts.

The judicial review powers of the Bangladesh Supreme Court also cannot be exercised by an ICSID tribunal since ICSID tribunals have no powers to seize the proceeds of crime being enjoyed by the respondents No.4 and No.5 in Bangladesh. ICSID tribunals may only issue a pecuniary award but cannot punish corruption or declare invalid unlawful exercise of executive powers.

ICSID tribunals may benefit from our finding and there does not need to be any conflict since we are not infringing on the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunals. However, it may be noted that the corruption and illegality is at the heart of the contracts containing the arbitration agreements. If enforcement of any final arbitral award is sought in Bangladesh the Bangladeshi courts, at the time of making a decision whether to enforce an award arising from such contracts, would have to balance the public policy considerations of giving effect to the illegal contracts with the public policy consideration of recognizing the finality of ICSID arbitral awards. Regarding the third part of the Rule, it is clear that respondent No.5 (Niko Canada), the parent company which actually pleaded guilty to acts of corruption in Bangladesh and which initiated the corruption scheme, is not even party to the pending cases before the ICSID tribunals.

Regarding the pending criminal cases, we are not getting into the merits of the allegations against the individuals concerned since that is the task of the criminal court where ACC’s criminal case is pending. Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Attorney General has submitted that payments were made to Mr. Moudud Ahmed while he was holding the office of the Law Minister and issued a legal opinion for his former client, Niko. The alleged conflict of interest for Mr. Moudud Ahmed, in issuing a legal opinion as Law Minister in favour of a former client, and then also receiving payments into his bank account from that client, is for Mr. Ahmed to answer in the pending criminal case. Similarly, allegations of the payments received by the other accused including Mr. AKM Mosharraf Hossain, Mr. Qasim Sharif, Mr. Salim Bhuiyan, and Mr. Giasuddin Al Mamoon are for them to defend in the pending criminal case where the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt, the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and the witnesses and accused can all be cross-examined. We find no merit in the argument that a writ petition challenging the improper use of Executive powers has to wait for a pending criminal case against the Government officials who have also been criminally charged for criminal misconduct arising from the same facts. If that argument was valid then the ICSID tribunals would also have to wait till completion of the criminal cases till making any finding of corruption. The finding of corruption is not the exclusive domain of the criminal courts or arbitral tribunals, though only criminal courts may impose criminal sanctions. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0in left 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">52.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">We also find no merit in the argument that a writ petition has to be kept in abeyance till the arbitration cases concerning investment disputes, between respondent No.4 on one side and respondent Nos. 2 and No.3 on the other, are completed.

Mr. Mahmud has also referred to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention to submit that the decision dated 19.07.2016is to be treated as a final judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. However, these arguments appear misconceived and misleading for a number of reasons. The ICSID tribunals do not provide an equally efficacious remedy as that provided under Article 102 of the Constitution of Bangladesh. In particular, the petitioner, respondent No.1 (Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources) and respondent No. 5 (Niko Canada, which pleaded guilty to acts of corruption in Canada) are not before the ICSID tribunals. The ICSID arbitration cases only relate to “investment disputes” which forms the subject of such claims and only apply to parties to the dispute, i.e. Niko Bangladesh Limited (respondent No.4), BAPEX (respondent No.3), and Petrobangla (respondent No.2). ICSID has no jurisdiction over Niko Canada (respondent No.5) which has admitted to corruption before the Canadian courts or the Ministry of Energy (respondent No.1) which issued the <em>ultra vires</em> instructions to enter the JVA and GPSA. Thus, the pending ICSID arbitration cases have no effect on our constitutional right and duty to judicially review <em>ultra vires </em>government actions tainted by corruption.

We cannot agree with this submission that there has to be a direct payment to a Bangladesh Government official for there to be corruption. This submission is not supported by the laws of Bangladesh, particularly the Penal Code. We note that section 162 of the Penal Code deals with “Taking gratification, in order, by corrupt or illegal means, to influence public servant”. Under section 162 of the Penal Code private individuals, such as Mr. Salim Bhuiyan or Mr. Giasuddin Al Mamoon, taking bribes to influence a public servant by corruption or illegal means is a crime. Similarly, section 163 of the Penal Code deals with “Taking gratification, for exercise of personal influence with public servant”. Taking or giving gratification to private individuals for their personal influence with public servants is also a crime. Thus, under the laws of Bangladesh there is no requirement that only direct payments to a Government official can constitute corruption. It would be sufficient if the gratification is extracted on a promise of exercise of personal influence with an official, to bring the offence within the mischief of this section 163 of the Penal Code. Proof of actual exercise of personal influence with an official is not necessary. The US$ 500,000payment admittedly made by respondents No.4 and No.5 to Mr. Salim Bhuiyan for his so-called ability to “arrange meetings” with Government officials through his social and political connections would clearly falls under the prohibitions of sections 162 and 163 of the Penal Code. Similarly, if the payment trail reaches Mr. Giasuddin Al Mamoon, then those payments were clearly for his exercise of personal influence and political clout over Bangladeshi Government officials. Mr. Mamoon openly claims that 50% of his power came from being a close friend of Mr. Tarique Rahman, son of the former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. Mr. Mamoon has also been convicted of money laundering along with his close friend and business associate, Mr. Tarique Rahman. These facts, though not vital or essential for disposal of the Rule, support the totality of the evidence of the corrupt scheme set up by the respondents No.4 and No.5 to acquire their investments in Bangladesh during 2003 to 2006. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0in left 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">60.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">We cannot agree with the submission of the respondent No.4 that the Agreed Statement of Facts cannot be relied upon since it only related to the 2005 period while the JVA was signed in 2003 and the GPSA in 2006. Mr. Khan submits that there is no causal link between the admitted corruption and the JVA or GPSA. However, it is clear and admitted in the Agreed Statement that Niko Canada (respondent No.5) made the payment to the Bangladeshi Energy Minister AKM Mosharraf Hossain to exercise his influence to ensure that respondent No.4 was able to secure a gas purchase and sales agreement (GPSA) acceptable to Niko, as well as to ensure that Niko was dealt fairly in relation to claims for compensation for blowouts. It is particularly important to note that the respondent No.5 pleaded guilty to the charges that “Niko Canada did, in order to obtain and retain an advantage in the course of business” provide bribe to Bangladesh officials. These words “obtain” and “retain” are significant. They imply that the bribe in 2005 was paid not only to “obtain” a future benefit such as the GPSA in 2006 but also to “retain” a past benefit such as the JVA in 2003. Corruption payments does not have to be simultaneous with the benefits procured. Bribe payments may be made for a past benefit, a future benefit, or to retain a benefit. We are unable to agree that bribery alone would not taint the procurement process of the JVA and GPSA but there must be shown that the bribery simultaneously and actually caused the benefit being bestowed to the bribe giver. If that was the law then many corrupt actors would be able to get away with corruption merely by taking the bribe at a time before or after the illegal benefit was bestowed or stating that the bribery did not actually cause the benefit being bestowed. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0in left 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">61.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">The Penal Code of Bangladesh clearly defines what constitutes bribery.

In addition, the Stratum Management Services Contract is clearly in violation of section 161 since its stated aim was to make payments to Bangladesh Government officials for the procurement of Niko’s projects in Bangladesh. There is no need to additionally show, as the respondent No.4 suggests, that these payments of bribes in fact influenced the Government officials who received the bribes. If that was the case, no one would be able to show corruption since one would need to go into the mind of the recipient of the bribe to determine if that person was influenced by the bribe.

On ratification, the UNCAC created legal obligations for Bangladesh and those have to be enforced through the Executive branch and/or the Judiciary of Bangladesh. Thus, Bangladesh has a duty under international law, as laid out in Article 31 of the UNCAC, to confiscate the proceeds of crime. Article 51 of the UNCAC makes the return of assets which are proceeds of crime a fundamental principle of the UNCAC. As such all proceeds of crime acquired by the respondents No.4 and No.5, through the use of a corrupt scheme, are to be returned to the state of Bangladesh. Article 53 mandates provisions for the direct recovery of corruption assets, including laws permitting private civil causes of action to recover damages owed to victim states and the recognition of a victim state’s claim as a legitimate owner of stolen assets. Article 54 requires State Parties to give effect to any confiscation order for corruption proceeds issued in another State Party, and to “consider taking such measures as may be necessary to allow confiscation…without a criminal conviction.”</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">75.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">We find support for our decision to confiscate the assets of the respondents No.4 and No.5 in the principles laid down in UNCAC. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">76.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">In <strong><em><u>Dr. Mobashir Hassan and Others vs. Federation of Pakistan</u></em></strong> PLD 2010 Supreme Court 265 the Supreme Court of Pakistan, while discussing the corruption and confiscation, agreed with the following: </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%; color: #000000;">“129. …A perusal of UN Convention Against Corruption indicates that the state had responsibility to develop and implement or maintain effective, coordinated anti-corruption policies; to take measures to prevent money laundering; to take measures for freezing, seizure and confiscation of proceeds of crime, derived from offences established in accordance with the Convention, or the property the value of which corresponds to that of such proceeds, property, equipment or other instrumentalities used in or destined for use in offences established in accordance with the Convention, etc.; State parties shall consider assisting each other in investigations of and proceedings in civil and administrative matters relating to' corruption; as well as affording to one another the widest measure of mutual legal assistance in investigations, prosecutions, and judicial proceedings in relation to the offences covered by the Convention; prevention and detection of transfers of proceeds of crime.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">77.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">In <strong><em><u>Biswanath Bhattacharya vs. Union of India</u></em></strong><em> (UOI) </em>AIR (2014) SC 1003, the Supreme Court of India discussed the confiscation of proceeds of crime: </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%; color: #000000;">41.

No payments can be made to respondent No.4 and No.5 by the respondents No.1, No.2 or No. 3 till these steps are completed.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">88.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">The respondent No.1 is further directed to seize and cancel the exploration rights of respondent No.5 or any of its subsidiaries obtained though corruption during the period 2003 to 2006, including the rights under the JVA, GPSA and the Block 9 PSC and either develop these gas fields themselves or, if not possible, reallocate them to competent companies through a fair, transparent and open bidding process. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 22.5pt left 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt;">89.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">      </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt;">In light of the above, we conclude that from 2003 till 2006 the respondents No.4 and No.5 had set up a corrupt scheme to illegally obtain gas exploration rights in Bangladesh. Based on the undisputed facts, we find that the JVA and GPSA have been procured by corruption and thus render them void<em> ab initio</em>. The rights and assets of the respondent No.5 in Block 9 PSC, for which respondent No.5 was found to be the least qualified of seven bidders in 1997, have also been obtained through this corrupt scheme and are thus being seized and confiscated as proceeds of crime as well as to provide compensation for the 2005 blowouts. All the rights, assets, and property of the respondent No. 4 and No.5 in Bangladesh, obtained from the State through the corrupt scheme, shall revert back to the State. </span></span></p><div><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--> </span><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 22.5pt left 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">90.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">      </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt;">In view of the above observations, we are inclined to hold that the Rule deserves merit and is bound to succeed. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 22.5pt left 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">91.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">      </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt;">Accordingly, the Rule is made absolute.
