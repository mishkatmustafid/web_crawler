A. Aziz Matubber on his conviction under section 302 of the Penal Code awarded by the Judgment dated October 21, 2008 passed in Sessions Case No157 of 2007 arising out of Hizla Police Station Case No. 02 dated July 07, 2007 corresponding to G.R. No. 66 of 2007.<br/>Deceased Monwara Begum shall be described hereinafter as victim of crime Monwara. Convict Abdur Razzak Matubber shall be described as convict-appellant.<br/>The prosecution case, in brief, is that one Md. Habibullah Talukder (P.W.1) lodged a First Information Report, shortly, “FIR” on July 07, 2007 with Hizla Police Station alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that there had an enmity between the victim and the accused Abdur Razzak Matubber who used to steal fruit from the victim Monowara Begum's garden and that the accused also threatened to kill her. The accused Abdur Razzak and the victim Monowara Begum was neighbors. On July 07, 2007 at around 14.15 hours the victim Monowara was going to her family pond to take her bath and when she reached the bank of the pond, accused Razzak started abusing her in filthy language who requested the accused not to use filthy language but the accused continued abusing her. At one stage the accused Razzak stabbed the victim with dao and hit her on the head and other parts of the body. The blows fractured the victim's skull. The accused also inflicted fatal blows on other parts of the body on neck, back and armpit and his mother the victim Monowara, succumbed to her injuries. The informant received Telephonic message and rushed to the place of occurrence and found his mother's dead body.  The local people surrounded the dwelling hut of accused Razzak. He came to learn about the occurrence from his sister Nasima Begum and on the same day he lodged FIR and that the accused was arrested by the Police after filing the case.<br/>On the basis of the aforesaid fact Hizla Police Station case No. 02 dated July 07, 2007 was started under sections 448,302,326,323 and read with section 34 of the Penal Code corresponding to G.R. No. 66 of 2007.<br/>The Investigating Officer took up the case for investigation; he prepared the Inquest Report of the victim in presence of witnesses; he visited the place of occurrence; duly sent the body of the victim to the Forensic Medicine Department of Barishal Shar-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital for post mortem. Post mortem of the victim was performed by one Dr. Md. Habibur Rahman.<br/>Ultimately, on conclusion of investigation the Investigating Officer, submitted charge-sheet against accused Razzak under section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/>Later, the case was duly sent to the learned Sessions Judge, Barisal for trial. Learned Sessions Judge on taking cognizance of the offence against accused Razzak under section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/>Convict Razzak had been placed on trial and charge framed under section 302 of the Penal Code and the charge being read over and explained, the accused Razzak pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Prosecution witnesses were, thereafter examined. After completion of examination of the prosecution witnesses under section 342 of the Cr.P.C he was asked to enter upon his defence, but once again he pleaded not guilty and refused to examine any witness or to submit any document in his defence.<br/>The defence case, as it transpired from the trend of cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, is that the accused Razzak is innocent. Further the defence claim that no such occurrence took place at the time, place and in the manner stated in the FIR.<br/>During the course of trial the prosecution produced as many as 19 witnesses including the Medical Officer and the Investigating Officer. However, the defense did not adduce any defense witness. The Trial Court after considering the evidence and materials on record found the accused Razzak guilty under section 302 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to death by its judgment and order dated October 21, 2008.<br/>Death sentence matter has been referred to this Court by way of a Reference by the Trial Court and the Reference has been noted as Death Reference No. 106 of 2008. Convict  Razzak however, also carried a petition of Appeal being registered as Jail Appeal No. 1005 of 2008.<br/>Death Reference and Jail Appeal are heard together and disposed of by this single judgment.<br/>Mr. Bishmadev Chakrabortty, the learned Deputy Attorney General with Mr. Md. Atiqul Hoque and Mr. Nizamul Haque Nizam, the learned Assistant Attorney General appeared in support of the Reference. While Mr. Md. Hatem Ali, the learned Advocate appeared  in support of Jail Appeal.<br/>Mr. Biswadev Chakraborty, the learned D.A.G submits that the prosecution case being proved to the hilt, the trial court rightly found the condemned prisoner guilty under section 302 of the Penal Code and convicted and sentenced him there under; in view of the barbaric and gruesome manner in which the condemned prisoner Razzak killed the victim Monowara, the trial court rightly awarded him death sentence and as such, the order of conviction and sentence should be maintained and the Death Reference be accepted. <br/>On the other hand, Mr. Md. Hatem Ali, the learned Advocate who took us through the FIR, and the entire evidence on records including the material exhibits and submits that the learned Sessions Judge fell into error of law in convicting convict appellant basing on the statements of the witnesses who are highly interested and relatives of the victim; that the Trial Court erred in law as well as in facts in convicting and sentencing the appellant and as such, the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set aside; that the prosecution could not prove its case beyond all shadow of doubt as such, the Trial Court was not justified in awarding death sentence to the condemned prisoner. He further submits with emphasis that the sentence of death passed upon the accused is extremely harsh and too severe. Death sentence, he added, should not be passed as a routine and this is not a case in which sentence of death is wanted.<br/>Now, in order to appreciate the arguments advanced by the learned Advocates we would now discuss the evidence adduced by the prosecution in this case.<br/>P.W 1 Md.

P.W 14 Alamgir an eye witness to the occurrence stated that on hearing hue and cry the local people rushed to the spot. He saw the convict Razzak kill Monwara with a dao.<br/>From the evidence of the aforesaid prosecution witness, it transpires that the prosecution case finds support in their evidence. The aforesaid witnesses also corroborated the said averment of the FIR stating that convict Razzak killed the victim Monowara with a dao and they are eye witnesses to the murder. They confined convict Razzak in his dwelling hut and within a short time the police came to the place of occurrence and arrested the convict Razzak. P.W 18 Constable Md. Abul Hossain carried the dead body of victim Monwara to the morgue of Barisal Sher-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital for autopsy. The Inquest Report, the Post Mortem Report and the evidence of the PWs 19 and 17 are consistent with each other regarding death of the victim.<br/>It is also found from the materials on record that the death of the victim was due to coma haemorrhage which was caused as a result of injuries which were anti-mortem and homicidal in nature and that it is<em> ex-facie</em> clear that the victim was injured with intention to cause death. There is no extenuating circumstance that may impel this court to take a lenient view and commute the sentence on record for the purpose of commutation of the death sentence.    <br/>We find from the seizure list exhibit 3 ka that 3 pices of blood stained saree, one blood stained petticoat and one blood stained lady's gauze scarf were seized at 18.50 hours on July 10, 2007 at Hizla Police Station. <br/>However, we  put the testimonies of the P.Ws 4,5,6,7,8,9,13 and 14 namely Parveen Begum,  Mst. Milon Tara Begum, Mst. Nasima Begum, Farid Ahmed, Anisur Rahman,  Md. Shaid Munshi, Mst. Jahanara Begum and Alamgir Matubber, the most vital prosecution witnesses, to the closest scrutiny as is required by law and found the same to be quite trustworthy. In expansive, pictorial and graphic evidence of the witnesses, the substantive part touching upon the factum of occurrence, the manner, method and the sequence of it has not been shaken, deviated from or render doubtful in their cross-examination.<br/>On in depth analysis of the evidence of above P.Ws we find that there are virtually no omission, in consisting or contradiction or any material fact concerning the factum and sequence of the offence between the statements made in their examination-in-chief and cross examination. Under the circumstances we must say that such rock-like evidence of the P.Ws, whose evidence are absolutely unshaken by the cross-examination, put the prosecution case on a definite foundation and to discredit them reasonable doubt must be created in our mind based on the evidence on record itself, not on conjectures and surmises. The evidence of the above witnesses have a natural flow. It does not appear to be a labored one. <br/>In a Criminal case, time, place and manner of the occurrence are very vital factors. In the instant case, the vital factors have been brought home to us by the prosecution.<br/>From the discussion, we have no hesitation in holding that the prosecution had succeeded in proving the charge brought against convict Razzak beyond all reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we find convict appellant guilty under section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/>The fact of the case shows that the convict used a heavy and sharp cutting dao and it has been well proved that the convict had inimical relationship with the victim Monowara.<br/>The entire fact of the case shows that the convict appellant brutally killed the victim in the broad day-light and not only that he threatened the local people who tried to resist him. The convict acted with cruelty in committing murder of the victim and in view of the matter we would like to observe that the ends of justice will be met if the convict appellant is awarded the capital punishment i.e the sentence of death.<br/>We therefore, hold beyond doubt that convict Abdur Razzak is the actual perpetrator of murder as he inflicted the fatal blow on the victim causing instant death. This is a premeditated, pre-planned, preconceived and calculated act by the convict Razzak with the intention of causing death of the victim which must come within the bound of clause 1 of Section 300 of the Penal Code and punishable under section 302 of the Code.<br/>By a close study          of the facts, materials on record including evidence, it transpired from the statements of P.Ws. 4,5,6,7,8,9,13 and 14 namely Perveen Begum, Most. Milon Tara Begum, Most. Nasima Begum, Farid Ahmed, Anisur Rahman, Md. Shahid Munshi, Most. Jahanara Begum and Alamgir Matubber specifically and strongly supported the prosecution case in the same voice as eye witnesses of the occurrence. They clearly established that on July 07, 2007 at around 2.20 p.m victim Monowara Begum was killed by the condemned prisoner Abdur Razzak who assaulted the victim with a dao indiscrimi-nately. The aforesaid witnesses also clearly stated that the skull of the victim was severely damaged and that she died on the spot. They corroborated the oral evidence given by each other before the trial court and proved the prosecution case successfully.<br/>P.W. 17 Dr. Habibur Rahman supported the case by proving the injury and cause of death because of the said injuries. P.W 19  Khan Emran Hossain also supported the case by proving the Inquest Report. The chain of evidence against the convict Abdur Razzak is so complete and specific that it does not leave any reasonable doubt in finding him guilty of the charge brought against him.<br/>For all reasons stated above we are constrained to hold that the charge has been proved against the convict Abdur Razzak we do not find any cogent and legal ground to interfere with the judgment and order of conviction and sentence as stated herein before. The appeal, therefore, must fail.<br/>The question posed stands answered in the epithet that Judicial Ruling of conviction and sentence prized upon the convict-appellant are well merited and justified and banner of criminal as well as Divine Justice has been upheld by the delivery of judicious verdict manifesting wisdom and good sense and the Judicial Ruling warrants no interference by this Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.<br/>The impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on 21<sup>st</sup> of October, 2008 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Barisal in Sessions Case No. 157 of 2007 is hereby upheld.<br/>In the result, the death reference No. 106 of 2008 is accepted and the connected Jail Appeal No. 1005 of 2008 is hereby dismissed.<br/>Death sentence in respect of convict Abdur Razzak be executed in the terms noted by learned Sessions Judge, Barisal in his judgment. <br/>Let the lower court records be sent down along with copy of the judgment and order at once.<br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
