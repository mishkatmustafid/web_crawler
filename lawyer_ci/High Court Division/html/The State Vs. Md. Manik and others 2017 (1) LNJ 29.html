The pw21, the recording Magistrate  annexed certificates to the effect that after the accused-persons were given three hours’ time for speculation, their </span></strong><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 114%; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">confessional statements were recorded which</span></strong> <strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 114%; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">appeared to her to be true.

It also transpires that the accused-persons were produced before the Magistrate within 24 hours of their arrest and that they were not even required to be taken on remand. Immediately after their production before the Magistrate, they made confessional statements. So, there arise no question of torturing or adopting any coercive measure </span></strong><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 114%; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">to secure the confessional statements from the</span></strong> <strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 114%; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">accused-persons.

As stated earlier, the Pw 21 Nazia Nahid, the recording Magistrate stated in her evidence that in compliance with the provisions of law she recorded the confessional statements of the confessing accused-persons; that she certified the confessional statements are true and voluntary; that the confessing accused-persons put their signatures in the confessional statements in her presence. Remarkably, in this case no suggestions whatsoever was given on behalf of the defence to the pw21 to the effect that under duress, torture, intimidation or by inducement the confessional statements of the accused-persons were secured. On perusal of the confessional statements, no irregularities or illegalities in recording the </span></strong><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 114%; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">statements are found.  So, there is no difficulty</span></strong><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 114%;"> to come to a finding that the confessional statements of the condemned-prisoner and the other convict-persons are voluntary and true and that the said statements may well form the basis for conviction of the accused-persons.          . . .(56)</span></strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt;">Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</span></strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">Sections 164 and 364</span></strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt;">Evidence Act (I of 1872)</span></strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">Section 24</span></strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 115%; tab-stops: right 210.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">The confessional statements of the condemned</span></strong><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%;">-prisoner and the other convict-persons are true, inculpatory and voluntary and said statements are sufficient to find them guilty in this case.

The said retraction petitions show that said petitions did not come through the concerned Jailor. Retraction petitions of the accused-petitioners Alauddin and Anwar have been written by their learned Advocates, not by the said Accused-persons. Further, said retraction-petitions having been made 1 ½ months after making the confessional statements, they are nothing but the result of afterthought and cannot be accepted. It has already been found that the confessional statements as made by the accused-persons are true and voluntary.

On 26.02.2009 at 11.30 a.m. she went to the school to appear in the examination. After examination she was returning home with her cousin Toma Ghosh and her friend Sadia. At 1.40 p.m. when they reached in front of the Bamansur Graveyard then an unknown man came to her from a yellow taxicab which was there from before. That man called Anamika and told her that he was performing business with her father. He told that he would go to their residence telling her to accompany him. At that time, two other persons were there inside the taxicab. When Anamika reached near the taxi cab, those persons forcibly dragged her into the taxi cab and kidnapped her away. Thereafter, another unknown person told Toma and her friend Sadia to inform Anamika’s house about the kidnapping of Anamika. Then, they went to the house of Anamika and informed about the act of kidnapping.

His daughter Anamika Ghosh aged about 9 years was a student of Class-III in Bamansur Kinder Garten School. On 26.02.2009 she had examination in that school. After appearing in the examination while she was returning home at 1.40 p.m. and when reached the road in the eastern side of Bamansur graveyard with his niece Toma Ghosh and Sadia, her friend, a taxicab was standing there at the place of occurence. In that taxicab there were three persons including the driver. At the time of occurrence a person came down from the taxicab and told Anamika that he used to perform business with her father and that he would go to their house and asked her to take them to their house. Thereafter, those three persons dragged his daughter forcibly into the taxicab, kidnapped her away and speedily went towards the south. At that time, Toma and Sadia were standing.  At that time, an unknown person standing there told Toma that the accused-persons kidnapped Toma away. He asked her to go home and inform the house of Toma quickly about the kidnapping. The hair of his daughter Anamaika was curly. She was 3’ feet high. Her complexion was fair. Her body was slim. She was wearing school dress, she had blue shirt,  was wearing white and navy blue shirt, put on cads, had I.D. card, had a pencil box containing pencils and hardboard, she was wearing half-pant and school shoes etc. The victim was accompanied by Toma Ghosh and Sadia.  The victim having not found on frantic search, he lodged the First Information Report (FIR) of the case with Keraniganj P.S. on 26.02.2009 at 9.30 p.m. This witness proved the FIR as Exhibit-1 and his signature therein as Exhibit-1/1. This witness further deposed that on 27.02.2009 at 12 ‘O’ clock noon, a mobile phone call came to the house of his nephew demanding Tk.10.00 lakhs as the ransom money for the release of the victim saying that if the demand was not met, the victim would be killed and that if the demand was met, the victim would be released. In that phone neither the identity of the caller nor his address was given. Thereafter, on 27.02.2009 at 8.00 p.m. again a mobile phone call came asking to take the money to Gabtoli. They forthwith informed the Keraniganj P.S. about the occurrence and the phone call. Thereafter, on 28.02.2009 at 8.00 a.m. in the morning another phone call came and he was asked to make the payment on that very date, otherwise, they would kill the victim. At that time, the ransom money was settled at Tk.2.10 lakhs.  He was asked to keep the money at a place behind the Ati Bazar Cinema Hall and he was also asked not to inform the police of the matter. After consultation among the brothers, for the safety of the victim, they sent Tk.2.10 lakhs through his brother Nanda Gopal Ghosh. Thereafter, the accused-persons acknowledged receipt of the money over mobile phone saying that he would get back his daughter.  They, thereafter, kept searching for his daughter.

Now, on scrutiny of the evidence on record, let us see as to whether the prosecution had been able beyond all shadow of doubt to bring home the charge as brought against the condemned-accused-prisoner and the other convicted-accused-persons and also to find out whether the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence is sustainable in law. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">49.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">From the evidence of the Pw1 Sudharam Ghosh, the Pw2 Sree Nanda Gopal Ghosh, the Pw4 Sree Durga Charan Ghosh, the Pw7 Shyam Dulal Ghosh, the Pw8 Sadhu Ghosh, the Pw13 Ahmadul Huda, The Pw14 Rajib, the Pw15 Md. Nurul Islam, the Pw17 Arzoo Mia, the Pw18, the Pw19 Md. Abul Naser, the Pw20 Toma Ghosh (8), it is evident that on 26.02.2009 at 1.40 p.m., while the victim deceased Anamika Ghosh along with the Pw20 Toma Ghosh (8) and Sadia were returning home after appearing in the examination in the ‘Bamansur Kinder Garten School’ reached in front of the road of ‘West Bamansur Graveyard’, the accused-persons kidnapped Anamika Ghosh away by a yellow taxicab and subsequently, the dead body of the victim Anamika Ghosh was found in a paddy field under Shibaloy Police Station, Manikganj on 01.03.2009. On 27.02.2009, the accused-persons demanded Tk.10.00 lakhs as ransom money for the release of the victim Anamika Ghosh which was settled at Tk.2.10 lakhs through negotiation. The informant paid the money through the Pw2 Nanda Lal Ghosh. The accused Anwar Hossain collected the money as per instruction of the accused Manik and that the accused Anwar Hossain received Tk.5,000/00 for collection of the money. The accused-parsons acknowledged the receipt of the money through mobile phone call assuring that they would return the victim Anamika Ghosh to her father. In the process the accused Md. Manik stayed in the ‘United Residential Hotel’ at Savar giving his false name to be Badhsa Mia and that of Anamika to be Shiuli. Despite realizing the ransom money, instead of returning the victim Anamika to her father, the informant, the accused Md. Manik killed her and to conceal the dead body of the victim buried it under heaps of soil in a IRRI paddy field. On 01.03.2009 the dead body, of the victim Anamika was recovered. After 5/6 days of the recovery of the dead body the accused-persons were arrested and a part of the ransom money i.e. Tk.1,27,0000/00 was recovered from the residence of the accused Manik as per his admission and showing and that the mobile phone sets used in the act of killing were recovered. The accused-persons Manik, Johni Ghosh admitted that the accused-persons Manik, Johni Ghosh, Alauddin, Anwar, Nurul Islam kidnapped away the victim Aanamika Ghosh and subsequently, killed her. The Pw3 Md. Ali Hossain took the dead body of the deceased to the morgue for autopsy. This witness identified the alamats viz, a pair of cads, blue colour half pant and yellow white banyan the victim was wearing at the time of occurrence. The Pw5 Kazi Abdur Razzak went to the IRRI paddy field on the basis of information and saw the dead body of the victim-child wearing school dress. As per his information police came and took photoss of the dead body and seized the alamats viz, tie with school-monogram, white shoes and white shocks, a school bag of the victim-girl. The pw6 Md. Majibar Rahman in his evidence stated that on 01.03.2009 he saw the dead body of the victim-girl; that the navy blue shirt, tie, white shoes, shocks the victim was wearing at the time of occurrence and the bag of the victim were seized in his presence. The pw9 Dr. Md. Halimullah held post mortem examination on the dead body of the victim-deceased. This witness stated in his evidence that in their opinion the death of the deceased was due to Asphyxia resulting from suffocation which was ante mortem and homicidal in nature. Said statement of the Pw9 support the confessional statement of the condemned-prisoner Manik that by throttling he killed the victim Anamika. The Pw10 S.I. Md.Lutfor Rahman  recovered the dead body of the victim-deceased and held inquest on the body, sent the dead body of the deceased for autopsy, seized the alamats viz. blue colour skirt, white colour shocks, blue colour tie with the inscription ‘Pacific Kinder Garten’, the victim-girl was wearing at the time of the occurrence and a white colour shopping bag, a blue colour cap, a black colour cap under seizure list, visited the place of occurrence, recorded statements of some of the witnesses and sent the dead body for autopsy. The Pw11 Md. Akkas Ali the seizure list (Exhibit-13) witness in respect of the three photoss (Material Exhibits-VII series) of the victim-deceased, stated in his cross that before seizure of the photos those were shown to him. The Pw12 Ratan Kumar Mondol took photoss of the victim with his camera and printed the photoss. This witness proved the seizure list in respect of the photoss of the victim-deceased and identified those in the Court. The Pw20 Toma Ghosh (8) a direct eye-witness to the alleged occurrence gave a vivid description of the alleged occurrence in her evidence stating specifically that the victim was kidnapped away in her presence from the place of occurrence by a taxicab. This witness identified the accused persons Manik and Alauddin in the dock. Further, the Pw20 Toma Ghosh being a minor girl of 8 years of age she was not supposed to know the accused-persons Manik and Alauddin from before.  The Pw21 Nazia Nahid recorded the confessional statements of the five accused-persons. She stated in her evidence that after observing all legal formalities she recorded the confessional statements of the accused-persons; that after the confessional statements were recorded she read over the statements to the accused-persons whereon they put their signatures therein admitting the statements to be true; that she appended certificates to the effect that the statements were voluntary and spontaneous; that there was no allegation of torture, influence or coercion by police for making the confessional statements; that she rightly forwarded the accused-persons to the jail custody after recording their statements. In this case an objection was raised on behalf of the defence to the effect that in all the confessional statements the starting time of recording the statements was stated to be 3.00 p.m. and the sending time of the accused-persons to the jail custody was stated to be 6.00 p.m.’; that recording of the five confessional statements at the same time and the recording of the statements at the same time i.e. 6.oo p.m. is absurd and as such, the confessional statements cannot be believed.  From the materials on record, it transpires that five accused-persons were forwarded to the Magistrate by a single forwarding. Further, The Pw21 stated categorically in her cross that she recorded the statements one by one. So, the question as to how she recorded the confessional statements of the five accused-persons at the same time does not arise. From her evidence it is found that no police personnel was present at the time of recording the statements, rather, only a peon was present. The accused-persons were brought to her at 12 ‘O’ clock noon. So, if she gave 3.00 hours’ time for speculation to the accused-persons, naturally she started recording the statements at 3.00 p.m. On perusal of the confessional statements of the accused-persons, it appears that the statements are very short. So, it was very much possible for the Pw21 to record the confessional statements of the five accused-persons within the span of three hours’ time. The Pw22, the Investigating Officer S.I. Md. Shahadat Hossain Khan stated in his evidence that during investigation he visited the place of occurrence, drew sketch map thereof with index, recorded the statements of the witnesses, did mobile tracking of the accused-persons, got the confessional statements of the accused-persons recorded under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by a Magistrate, recovered a portion of ransom many worth Tk.1,27,000/00 as per admission and showing of the accused Manik from his residence, seized the alamats of the case  and that after investigation prima-facie case having been made out against the accused-persons, submitted charge sheet against them. From the evidence of the Pw22, he appears not to have committed any illegality or irregularity in taking out investigation of the case. Further, from the cross examination of the Pws, the accused-persons could not extract anything favourable to them. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">50.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">In this case, apart from the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, there are the inculpatory confessional statements of the condemned-prisoner Md.

From the materials on record, it is also found that after commission of the offence, out of repentance, the accused Narayan committed suicide which suggests the truth of the commission of the occurrence by the accused-persons.  The pw21, the recording Magistrate  annexed certificates to the effect that after the accused-persons were given three hours’ time for speculation, their confessional  statements were recorded which appeared to her to be true. It appears further from the confessional statements that at any stage of recording the confessional statements, it did not appear to the pw21 that the statements were not voluntary (Reference: the clause no.9 of the statements) and she also appended certificates <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">to the effect that the five confessional statements</span> were voluntary. On perusal of the confessional statements, it further transpires that before making confessional statements the accused-persons did not make any complaint of torture, coercion or inducement against police. It also transpires that the accused-persons were produced before the Magistrate within 24 hours of their arrest and that they were not even required to be taken on remand. Immediately after their production before the Magistrate, they made confessional statements. So, there arise no question of torturing or adopting any coercive measure to secure the confessional statments from the accused-persons. On perusal of the confessional statements of the condemned-accused-prisoner and the other convict-accused-persons, it further transpires that they made the statements implicating themselves directly in the occurrence. As stated earlier, the Pw 21 Nazia Nahid, the recording Magistrate stated in her evidence that in compliance with the provisions of law she recorded the confessional statements of the confessing accused-persons; that she certified the confessional statements are true and voluntary; that the confessing accused-persons put their signatures in the confessional statements in her presence. Remarkably, in this case no suggestions whatsoever was given on behalf of the defence to the pw21 to the effect that under duress, torture, intimidation or by inducement the confessional statements of the accused-persons were secured. On perusal of the confessional statements, no irregularities or illegalities in recording the statements are found.  So, there is no difficulty to come to a finding that the confessional statements of the condemned-accused-prisoner and the other convict-accused-persons are voluntary and true and that the said statements may well form the basis for conviction of the accused-persons.  In the case of  Islamuddin (Md) alias Din Islam versus The State reported in 13 BLC (AD)at page 81 in our Apex Court held that“ It is now the settled principle of law that judicial confession if is found to be true and voluntary can form the sole basis of conviction against the maker of the same”.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">57.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">In view of the discussion made so far, this court finds that the confessional statements (Exhibits-21, 23, 25,27,27) of the condemned-accused-prisoner and the other convict-accused-persons are true, inculpatory and voluntary and said statements are sufficient to find them guilty in this case. From the record, it appears that the accused Manik retracted his confessional statement on 26.04.2008, the accused Alauddin retracted the confessional on 27.04.2009, the accused Anwar retracted confessional statement on 27.04.2009, the accused Anwar retracted confession on 27.04.2009 stating that police by force extracted the confessional statements. The said retraction petitions show that said petitions did not come through the concerned Jailor. Retraction petitions of the accused-petitioners Alauddin and Anwar have been written by their learned Advocates, not by the said Accused-persons. Further, said retraction-petitions having been made 1 ½ months after making the confessional statements, they are nothing but the result of afterthought and cannot be accepted. It has already been found that the confessional statements as made by the accused-persons are true and voluntary. It is the settled law that “Confessional statement whether retracted or not, if found voluntary can form the sole basis of conviction of the maker (Reference: Hazrat Ali and another versus State).”      </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%;">58.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%;">In this case, the confessional statements of the accused-persons, the evidence of the Pws including the evidence of the Pw20 Toma Ghosh, direct eye-witness to the alleged occurrence and the statements of the witnesses i.e. the Pw4 Sree Durga Charan Ghosh, the Pw15 Md. Nurul Islam and the Pw 17 Md. Arzoo Mia under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure corroborated the prosecution case. From the evidence on record, it is also seen that mentioning falsely his name to be Badsha and falsely mentioning the name of the victim Anamika to be Shiuli, the accused Manik boarded a hotel at Savar.  The accused Nurul Islam assisted the accused Manik saying that a brother with his sister would stay in the hotel. From the materials on record, it is also found that the accused-persons ManiK, Narayan, Johni and Alauddin chalked out plan of kidnapping the victim sitting at Shikaritola and that the taxi driver who entered into a contract with the accused Manik to take them with the victim to Mymensingh at Tk.5,000/00 also was involved in the kidnapping. The day before the occurrence, all the accused-persons waited for kidnapping the victim but could not kidnap the victim on that date. On the following day, they succeeded in kidnapping the victim girl. The accused-persons Alauddin and Johni Ghosh were involved in the alleged occurrence is manifest from the confessional statements of these accused-persons and  the statements under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of three witnesses i.e. the pw4, the pw15 and the Pw17  and the evidence of the eye-witness Toma. From the evidence of the Pw2 Sree Nanda Gopal Ghosh, the Pw4 Sree Durga Charan Ghosh, the Pw8 Sadhu Charan Ghosh and the Pw15 Nurul Islam, it appears that in addition to making the confessional statements, the accused-persons Johni Ghosh and Manik also made extra judicial confessions. The Pw2 Sree Nanda Gopal Ghosh stated in his evidence that the accused Johni admitted that they themselves kidnapped Anamika, the victim and that the accused-persons Manik, Alauddin, Nurul Islam and Narayan were also involved in the alleged occurrence. The Pw4 Sree Durga Charan Ghosh stated in his evidence that in their presence, the accused Manik admitted that they kidnapped Anamika; that he collected the ransom money through his nephew, the accused Anwar and that they killed the victim Anamika by throttling at a place under Shibaloy P.S. This witness further stated that the accused ManiK disclosed the names of the accused-persons Johni Ghosh, Alauddin, Nurul Islam and Narayan also to be involved in the alleged occurrence. The Pw8 Sadhu Charan Ghosh stated in his evidence that the accused Johni Ghosh in his presence stated that he himself, Manik, Alauddin, Anwar , Narayan and the driver together kidnapped the victim Anamika, realized ransom money and killed her. It is the established principle of law that a conviction can be rested on extra judicial confession subject to the fact that such statements are corroborated by other materials on record.(Reference: the case of State versus Moslem reported in 55 DLR at page 116). In this case the materials on record support the extra-judicial confessional statements of the accused-persons. It is also the established principle of law that extra-judicial confession can form a basis for conviction if found voluntary and true (Reference: case of Nausher Ali Sarder and others versus the State reported in 39 DLR (Ad) at page 194). This Court finds nothing to disbelieve the evidence of the Pw2, the Pw4, the Pw8 and the Pw15 with regard to the extra-judicial confession made by the aforesaid accused-persons. In this case the truth and voluntariness of the extra-judicial confessions made by the accused-persons was not challenged by the defence.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">59.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">In this case although the dead body of the victim Anamika as recovered from a IRRI paddy field was stated to be of an unknown girl.

Further, the accused-persons Alauddin and Johni Ghosh assisted the commission of offence by taking part in chalking out plan of kidnapping and by playing the role of the informers. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt;">62.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt;">In this case, naturally, the names of the accused-persons were not mentioned as the case is one of kidnapping and so also in view of the fact that the informant was not present at the time of occurrence. Subsequently, through investigation and confessional statements of the accused –persons, their names came out. From the materials on record, it transpires that the accused-persons Manik, Narayan, Johni. Alauddin chalked out plan to kidnap the victim sitting at Shikaritola and that the accused Manik was the master mind of the kidnapping and killing of the victim. The other accused-persons gave assistance to the accused Manik in perpetrating the occurrence playing their respective role in the occurrence.  The accused Johni and Alauddin directly participated in the alleged occurrence by taking part in planning, assisting and worked as the infromers with regard to the movement of  the victim and keeping watch at the locality. At the time of the occurrence the accused Alauddin stood beside the taxicab at the place of occurrence and saying Toma, the Pw20 (8) that the victim Anamika was kidnapped away asked her to inform the house of Toma about the kidnapping. The Pw20, as stated earlier, in her evidence identified him in the dock amongst the other accused-persons. The Pw20 categorically stated in her cross on behalf of this accused that none identified the accused Alauddin to her.  The accused Anwar was aware of the alleged occurrence from before as per the information given to him by his maternal uncle, the accused Manik. He fetched the ransom money of Tk.2.10 lakhs from behind ‘Atibazar Cinema Hall’ as per the instruction of the accused Manik and also got a share of Tk.5,000/00 from it. Subsequently, the taxi-cab driver Nurul Islam got involved in the kidnapping. When the accused Nurul Islam, the taxicab driver saw the other-accused-persons kidnap the victim, his moral duty was to inform the law enforcing agency of the occurrence and obstruct the other accused-persons from committing the offence, instead, he assisted the accused-persons to kidnap the victim-girl which is manifest from the fact that on the way to Mymensingh when they saw police near Tangail, he took back his taxi-cab and took the victim and the other accused-persons to Savar. It also appears from the materials on record that the accused Nurul Islam Munshi, the driver of the taxi cab was arrested first in the case and he mentioned the name of the accused Md. Manik and after tracking the call list of mobile phone of Manik, the other accused-persons were also arrested one by one. As a driver of the taxi cab, the accused Nurul Islam Munshi could have saved the life of the victim-girl but he did not do that. He entered into a contract with the accused Md. Manik at Tk. 5,000/00 as fare to reach them to Mymensingh. For allurement of the said money he took part in the alleged occurrence. Said accused also made arrangement for stay of the accuse Manik and the victim Anamaika in a hotel at Savar giving their false identity as brother and sister and giving their false names to be Badsha and Shiuli.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">63.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">So, from the evidence on record, it  is crystal clear that on 26.02.2009 at about 1.40 p.m. while the victim Anamika Ghosh  was returning home after appearing in the examination in ‘Bamansur Kindergarten School’, the accused-persons kidnapped her away by a taxicab; that thereafter, the accused-persons demanded Tk.10.00 lakhs as ransom money for her release which was settled at Tk.2.10 lakhs through negotiation; that as per the demand of the accused-persons, the father of the victim paid Tk.2.10 lakhs to the accused-persons as ransom money; that even after the payment of Tk.2.10 lakhs as ransom money , the accused-persons did not release the victim, rather, the accused Manik killed the victim by throttling  and buried her body under heaps of soil and that the other accused-persons in furtherance of their common intention took part in the act of kidnapping and killing.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">64.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">In view of the discussion made here above, and so also on perusal of the evidence on record and observation of the decisions as cited by the learned Advocates, this Court is led to find that on 26.02.2009 at about 1.40 p.m. the accused-persons kidnapped away the victim-deceased Anamika Ghosh from the road in front of Bamansur graveyard gate while she was going home after appearing in the examination, demanded Tk.10.00 lakhs as ransom money from the father of the victim girl and that even after realization of Tk.2.10 lakhs as ransom money, instead of releasing the victim, killed her ruthlessly in a  gruesome and relentless manner. This Court is also led to find that the trial court rightly found the accused Manik guilty under sections 7/8 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjahatan Daman Ain, 2000 (Amended in 2003) read with sections- 302/201 of the Penal Code and found the other accused-persons guilty  under section 7/8/30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 (Amended in 2003).</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt;">65.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt;">In this case, the victim Anamika was a minor, innocent girl of 8/9 years  of age and a student of Class III of a Kinder Garten School who was kidnapped in a pre-planned way for realization of ransom money  by the accused-persons and that even after realization of the ransom money, the condemned-accused-prisoner Md. Manik killed her by throttling relentlessly and after killing the girl buried her dead body under heaps of soil in a IRRI Paddy field to conceal evidence. The aforesaid acts of the condemned-accused-prisoner and the other convict-accused-persons defeat the brutality of the medieval age and the said acts are against humanity. The condemned-accused-prisoner and the other convict-accused-persons are the real threat to the humanity and the society. For the said loath some and heartless act of the condemned-accused-prisoner, he deserves capital punishment in this case. There are no mitigating or extenuating circumstances in this case in favour of the condemned-accused-prisoner. In this regard, the case of Md. Ershad Ali Sikder versus The State reported in 9 MLR (AD) at page 355 may be referred. In the said case our apex Court held that the sentence of death is the appropriate sentence where the death is caused with extreme brutality. So, according to this Court, the only punishment which the condemned-prisoner deserves in this case is the capital sentence i.e. the death sentence.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt;">66.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt;">In the light of discussion made here above, and so also on consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case we find that the trial Judge was perfectly justified in passing the impugned judgment and order awarding death sentence to the condemned–accused-prisoner Md.
