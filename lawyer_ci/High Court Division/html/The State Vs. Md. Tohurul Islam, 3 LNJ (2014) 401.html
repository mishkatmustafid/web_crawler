Karim and Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok took active part of the conspiracy and in order to execute the decision taken in the conspiracy they actively took part in the killing of 4 (four) police personnel and Izaradar Nojer Ali. In fact, we do not find any corroborative evidence against accused, namely, (i) Dilip, (ii) Tomal, (iii) Ahmed Shah Nuru, (iv) Khairul, (v) Abdul Mannan, (vi) Rabiul Islam, (vii) Majed Ali, except mentioning their names by co-accused in their confessional statement.</strong> <strong>There are long lines of decision which have firmly settled that confession of a co-accused is not evidence, it can only lend assurance to other evidence. From the various pronouncements of the apex courts, we find that the apex Courts consistently held that confession of a co-accused is not substantive evidence and such confession cannot be the sole basis of conviction of a co-accused in the absence of independent corroborative evidence. There are long line of decisions which have firmly settled that abscondance by itself is not the conclusive proof of guilt of the accused. Considering the decisions cited in the body of judgment, the evidence on record and the circumstances, we are of the opinion that justice will be met if the impugned order of conviction and sentence of death of accused, namely, Md. Nurul Islam @ Shine @ Tapash @ Tonmoy, son of Habibur Rahman @ Habib master; and Md. Tohurul Islam @ Azizul Haque, son of Monirul Islam is maintained and the order of conviction and sentence so far as it relates to condemned prisoners, namely, (1) Md. Shafiqul Islam son of late Mobarok Khan; (2) Abu Bakkar Siddique; (3) Nurunnabi Hasan @ Khokon; (4) Shafiqul Islam son of late Habibur Rahman; (5) Sanjay Kumar Saha; (6) Pintu is altered to imprisonment for life instead of death.      . . .

The Officer-in-Charge gave order to the informant to go to Chowbariahat with sufficient police force and arrest the miscreants. On getting the order from the O.C. of Manda Police Station, the informant entered a G. D. Entry No. 1139 dated 25.08.2006 and went to the place of occurrence with Md. Anisur Rahman, S.I. (P. W. 33), Md. Anowar Hossain, P.S.I (P.W. 32) and other forces. The distance between the Police Station and the Chowbariahat is 18 Kilometer. They reached Chowbariahat and found the dead bodies of A.S.I. A.T. Firoz, Constables, namely, Askan Ali, Farid, Babul Miah and they also found that their throats were cut. On query from the surroungding people, the informant came to know that on 25.08.2006 at 18.30 hours, 20/25 unknown miscreants wearing lungi, half shirt, full shirt, fastening gamcha on their head being armed with rifle, pipe gun, iron rod attacked the police personnel and slaughtered them by cutting their throat. The miscreants created panic in the area by exploding 8/10 bombs. The miscreants also looted away one 7.62 china pistol, handle No. 72, body No. 50007737 and 8 round of ammunitions from A.S.I. A.T. Firoz, 303 rifle and 10 round of ammunitions from Constable No. 486 Askan Ali, one china rifle and 20 round of ammunitions from Constable No. 285 Faridul, one short-gun and 10 round of ammunitions from Constable No. 548 Babul Miah. The miscreants also stabbed Nojer Ali with sharpen knife and Nojer Ali was seriously injured. Injured Nojer Ali was taken to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital for treatment but on the way at Mohonpur he succumbed to his injuries. The miscreants also looted away about Tk. 1,00,000/-(one lac) and fled away towards west. The miscreants did massacre for about 10 minutes and they were aged in between 25-40 years. The informant informed the matter to the Officer-in-Charge over mobile phone and the Officer-in-Charge also came to the place of occurrence.<br/><br/>On the basis of the aforesaid First Information Report (shortly, F.I.R.) police recorded Manda Police Station Case No. 23 dated 28.05.2006 under sections 353/396 of the Penal Code. Police investigated the case and during investigation visited the place of occurrence, prepared sketch map with separate index thereof, examined the witnesses and recorded their statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, arrested the accused and arranged recording of the statements of 5 accused under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and finally submitted charge sheet No. 71 dated 16.04.2007 under sections 120B/400/402 /353 / 396 of the Penal Code against the condenmened prisoners and the accused appellants as a <em>prima-facie </em>case was made out against them.<br/><br/>The case record was transmitted to the Durto Bichar Tribunal, Rajshaji for trial. The case was numbered as Durto Bichar Tribunal Case No. 21 of 2007.<br/><br/>The learned Judge of Druto Bichar Tribunal, Rajshahi framed charge against the accused (1) Md. Tohurul Islam @ Azizul Haque, (2) Md. Nurul Islam @ Shine @ Taposh @ Tonmoy, (3) Md.

The charge was read over and explained to the accused present to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. However, charge was framed against the absconding accused in their absence.<br/><br/>In order to substantiate the charge against the accused, the prosecution has examined as many as 39 witnesses in this case.<br/><br/>After close of evidence of the prosecution witnesses, the accused on dock were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This time also they repeated their innocence and adduced one witness as D.W. 1.  <br/><br/>The defence case, as it transpires from the trend of cross examination of the prosecution witnesses and also from the only defence witness is that the accused are innocent and they have been falsely implicated in this case. Their further case is that they have been serving in the office of CARB and they are not in any way involved in this case.<br/><br/>Considering the facts, circumstances and the evidence on record the learned Judge of the Druto Bichar Tribunal, Rajshahi convicted and sentenced the condemned prisoners and the accused appellants as aforesaid.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by, and dissatisfied with, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 24.01.2008 passed by the learned Judge of Druto Bichar Tribunal, Rajshahi, condemned prisoners, namely,</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Shafiqul Islam son of late Mobarak filed Criminal Appeal No. 983 of 2008 and Jail Appeal 148 of 2008;</li><li style="text-align:justify">Shafiqul Islam son of Habibur Rahman preferred Criminal Appeal No. 1020 of 2008 and Jail Appeal No. 147 of 2008. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, accused appellants, namely,</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Md.

In that meeting Nurul Islam @ Shine, Ataur, Shafiqul, Abdul Karim, Sagor (since dead), Majed Ali, Pintu, Khokon, Ahmed Shah Nurul, Shafiqul Islam, son of Habibur Rahman, Tohurul, Siddique, Hossain, Rabiul and others total 20 persons were present there. In that meeting it was decided that they would kill Izaradar Lutfor, Quader and Afzal. It was further decided that if police resists, they would also kill police personnel and snatch away their arms. Haji Azimuddin made a contract with accused, namely, Dilip and Tohurul. According to the contract Haji Azimuddin would give them handsome cash and also would give them looted arms. Haji Azimuddin had a quarrel with other Izaradar 2(two) months prior to the occurrence. On 25.08.2006 at 3.45 hours, 20 accused were divided into 5 groups. He and Abdul Karim were carrying pistol. Sagor (since dead) was carrying bomb. Other groups were carrying chora, iron rod etc. They arrived at Chowbariahat at 4.30 p.m. He gave signal at 6.00 P.M. and on getting the signal the other accused exploded bombs and inflicted iron rod blows on the head of police personnel and slaughtered them. Accused Tahrul slaughtered the daroga. Accused Dilip, Ataur and Tomal killed 3(three) police personnel. At that time one person came out from toll house and the accused dealt chora blow in his neck and subsequently he died. Thereafter they left the place chanting slogan “Purbabangla Communist Party Zindabad.”<br/><br/>This is the confessional statement given by accused Nurul Islam @ Shine. If we carefully analyse the above confessional statement of Nurul Islam @ Shine we find that according to the decision taken in the meeting held on 21.08.2006, they all came to the place of occurrence and as soon as he gave signal, other accused blasted bomb, inflicted iron rod blows on the head of the police personnel and slaughtered them. From the confessional statement of this accused, we find vivid description of the occurrence. P. W. 26 is the Magistrate who recorded the statement of this accused. He (P.W. 26) stated that he alerted the accused by saying that he was not bound to confess and if he would confess it might be used against him as evidence. The learned Magistrate also stated that he gave three hours reflection time to the accused. He complied with all the provisions of law provided under section 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before recording the confessional statement of accused Nurul Islam @ Shine.  The accused also did not complain of police torture at the time of recording his statement.<br/><br/>This condemned prisoner was not examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as he absconded during trial. He absconded since 02.12.2007. So there was no occasion to examine him under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In his confessional statement, accused Nurul Islam @ Shine stated that they slaughtered the police personnel. P. W. 31 held the autopsy. He corroborated with the statement of the accused as he found that all the dead bodies of police personnel had throat cut. The evidence of P.W. 31 fully corroborates the prosecution case. The Tribunal rightly held that the time, place and manner of the occurrence have been corroborated by the evidence of all the witnesses. His confession fully corroborates with the prosecution case. Therefore, we hold the view that the Tribunal rightly held that the confession of accused Nurul Islam @ Shine was voluntury and true. Accused Nurul Islam @ Shine filed an application for retraction of the confession. The trial court did not pass any order on the application for retraction. In fact, once a confession is taken to be voluntary and true, the application of retraction has no value. We shall discuss the value of retraction of confession later in the body of the judgment.<br/><br/>Confession of accused Tohurul Islam, aged 24:-<br/>Now, let us, scrutinize and analyze the confessional statement of accsued Tohurul Islam.<br/>Police arrested accused Tohurul Islam on 01.09.2006 at 11.00 P. M. and forwarded him to the Court on 03.09.2006.<br/>Police took him on remand for 10 (ten) days.<br/>On 07.09.2006, he made confessional statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/>He filed an application for retraction of his confession but his application for retraction was rejected. <br/>He was enlarged on bail on 26.07.2007 and thereafter he absconded and did not face trial.<br/>His bail was cancelled on 02.01.2008.<br/>As he absconded during trial, he could not be examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The confessionnal statement given by accused Tohurual Islam is reproduced here which runs as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ তহুরতল ইসলাম @ অাজিজুল হক<br/>অামি CARB অফিসে চৌবাড়িয়া ২৩ নং ব্র্যাঞ্চে ফার্ম ম্যানেজার হিসাবে ৬/৭ মাস কাল কাজ করছি। অামি বর্তমানে বিনোদপুর ডিগ্রী কলেজে পাশ কোর্সে ডিগ্রীতে পড়ছি। গত ২১.০৮.০৬ খ্রিঃ সোমবার CARB অফিস চৌবাড়িয়া ব্রাঞ্চের মিটিং করি। মিটিং-এ ১) অামি ২) নয়রতল ইসলাম @ শাহীন, ৩) দিলীপ, পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং মাচনা, নওগা, ৪) কাশেম পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং বলদারহার নিয়ামতপুর, ৫) খোকন পিতা ময়েজ সাং শিবপুর নিয়ামতপুর, ৬) হাসান পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং ভোলা হাট, চাপাইনবাবগঞ্জ, ৭) তমাল, পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং সমাজপাড়র, অাত্রাই, ৪) অাতাউর পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং সমাজপাড়া, অাত্রাই, ৯) পিন্টু পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং বলদাহার, নিয়ামতপুর, ১০) সাগর পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং দেলয়াবাড়ী, মান্দা, ১১)সঞ্জয় পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং গোদাগাড়ী, ১২) খায়রতল পিতা অজ্ঞাত, নাচোল চাপাইনবাবগঞ্জ, ১৩) করিম পিতা অজ্ঞাত তানোর, রাজশাহী, ১৪) সিদ্দিক পিতা অজ্ঞাত জেলা সাতক্ষীরা সহ অারো কয়েকজন ছিল। সন্ধ্যা অনুমান ৬.০০ টার দিকে মিটিং হয়। মিটিং শাহীন ও দিলীপ নেতৃত্ব দেয়। মিটিং সিদ্ধামত হয় চৌবাড়িয়া গরতর হাটে অপারেশন চালিয়ে হাটের ইজারাদার অাফজাল, ফজের কে মেরে ফেলতে হবে। হাজী অাজিমুদ্দিন তাদেরকে মেরে ফেললে অামাদের পার্টিকে ১২/১৩ লক্ষ টাকা দিবে শাহীন ও দিলীপ জানায়। হাজী অাজিমুদ্দন এর সাথে ঘটনার মাস দেড়েক অঅগে হাট ইজারাদারদের গন্ডগোল হয়।<br/>ঘটনার দিন ২৫/০৮/০৬ শুত্রুবার এর বিকাল অনুমান ৫টার দিকে অামরা ২০ জনের একটি দল বিভিন্ন ভাবে ভাগ হয়ে চৌবাড়িয়া গরতর হাটে যাই। অামি বাজারের পার্শ্বে পর পর ৫টি বোমা ফাটাই। তার ভয়ে লোকজন দৌড়াতে থাকে তখন অামরা পুলিশদের লোহার রড দিয়ে অাঘাত করি। ৪ জনকে অাঘাত করি। অামি দারোগাকে ছুরি দিয়ে জবাই করি। পুলিশের অসএ অামরা কেড়ে নেই। অন্য তিন জনকেও জবাই করে হত্যা করা হয়। কে জবাই করে বলতে পারব না। ইজারাদার নজের কে টোল ঘর থেকে বেরিয়ে যাওয়ার সময় তাকেও জবাই করে হত্যা করা হয়। কে জবাই করে বলতে পারব না। দারোগা ফিরোজকে সিদ্দিক, খোকন, তমাল ধরে রাখে। প্রথমে তমাল ছুরি দিয়ে অাঘাত করে। তারপর অামি তার কাছ থেকে ছুরি নিয়ে জবাই করি। তারপর অামরা পূর্ব বাংলা কমিউনিস্ট পার্টি লাল পতাকা জিন্দাবাদ বলে শ্লোগান দিতে দিতে খড়ি বাড়ী ও সাদা পুরের মধ্যসহলে চলে যাই। সেখানে দিলীপ ও শাহীনকে ছুরি, রড, পিসতল ২টি, বন্দুক ৩টি জমা দিয়ে নিয়ে বাড়ী চলে যাই। অসএগুলো দিলীপ, শাহীন, করিমের কাছে অাছে। অামি এক বৎসর অাগে সর্বহারা দলের সদস্য হই। মারার জন্য এখনো কোন টাকা পয়সা পাইনাই। শাহীন ও দিলীপ জানে টাকা পয়সা দিয়েছে কিনা অামাকে গত শুত্রুবার দিবাগত রাত অনুমান ১১টার সময় চাকলা নিয়ামতপুর থেকে পুলিশ ধৃত করেন।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the above confessional statement, it is clear that on 21.08.2006, a meeting was held at the CARB office. In that meeting the accused and other persons were present. It was decided in the meeting that they would kill Izaradar and if they could kill Izaradars, namely, Afzal and Fazlu, accused Azimuddin would give them Tk. 12/13 lac. Haji Azimuddin had a quarrel with other Izarader, one and half months prior to the occurrence. In pursuance of the decision and agreement taken in the meeting held on 21.08.2006, the accused along with others went to the cattle market in 5 groups. He himself blasted the bombs and people started running hither and thither. The accused dealt iron rod blow on the head of 4 police personnel. He himself slaughtered the Daroga. They also snatched away the arms from police personnel. The other 3 police personnel were also slaughtered. He took the knife from accused Tomal and slaughtered Daroga Firoj. Thereafter, they left the place chanting slogan “Purba Bangla, Lal Potaka, Zindabad.”<br/><br/>Upon a careful scrutiny of the confessional statement of accused Tohurul, we find that this confessional statement is inculpatory in nature. The accused himself stated that he himself blasted the bomb and he himself slaughtered the Daroga taking knife from Tomal. It is true that on 04.10.2006 accused Tohurul filed an application for retraction. But his application for retraction was rejected. Accused Tohurul absconded after he was granted bail. As a result, he could not be examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The learned Magistrate who recorded the confession of accused Tohurul stated in no uncertain terms that he cautioned accused Tohurul that he was not bound to confess and if he would confess, it might be used against him as evidence. He also gave the accused 3 hours time for reflection. The learned Magistrate stated that when he recoreded the confessional statement of accused Tohurul, he (accused Tohurul) looked normal and his health condition was good. The accused also did not complain of police torture before the Magistrate. The learned Magistrate complied with all the provisions of section 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before recording the confession of accused Tohurul. Therefore, we find that the confession given by accused Tohurul was voluntary. Moreover, the confession given by accused Tohurul is consistent with the prosecution case. He has stated in his confession that a meeting was held on 21.08.2006 in the CARB office. In that meeting it was decided that they would kill Izaradar and they would also kill the police personnel and take away their arms. In his confession accused Tohurul gave vivid description about the occurrence. As the confession of accused Tohurul is consistent with the prosecution case, we also hold the view that the confession of accused Tohurul is true as well.<br/><br/>Another accused, namely, Shafiqul, son of Mobarak made a confession.

He also stated that they looted away one pistol and 03 guns from police personnel and thereafter went away, chanting slogan, “Purba Bangla Communist Party Lal Potaka Zindabad.” From the above confessional statement, it is clear that this accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarak took active part at the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006 in the CARB Office, Chowbaria and he was also in one of 5 groups who are responsible for killing the police personnel and Nojer Ali. According to agreement and conspiracy dated 21.08.2006 they killed police personnel and Nojer Ali and stnatched away the arms from police personnel.<br/><br/>Police arrested accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarak on 29.09.2006 at 05.00 P. M. and he was forwarded to the Court on 30.09.2006. Police took him on remand for 04 days. He did not file any application for retraction. However, he was examined under 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. At the time of recording of his confession, the learned Magistrate compiled with all the provisions of sections 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He cautioned him that he was not bound to confess and if he would confess it would be used against him as evidence. He also gave him 03 hours time for reflection. He did not complain of police torture before the learned Magistrate when his confessional statement was recorded. P. W. 26 (the learned Magistrate) was thoroughly cross-examined by the learned Lawyer appearing on behalf of the accused. From the evidence of P. W. 26 nothing came out to believe that police tortured him during his custody under police. He was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on 06.01.2008, i. e, he was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 01 (one) year 04 (four) months after his arrest and this time he complained of police torture before the Tribunal. He could not produce any documentary and circumstantial evidence in support of his complain of police torture. We have already stated that once a confessional statement is taken to be voluntary and true, belated retraction has no value (45DLR(1993)306.)<br/><br/>The learned Magistrate stated that he complied with all the provisions of sections 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before recording the confession. The learned Magistrate also did not find any sign of torture on the person of accused Shafiqul son of Mobarok. The accused did not also show any sign of police torture on his person. The Magistrate gave certificate that the confession was voluntary. This confession is also consistent with the prosecution case. Since the confessional statement of this accused is consistent with the prosecution case, we are also of the opinion that the confession of accused Shafiqul Islam, son of Mobarak was voluntary and true as well.<br/><br/>Now, let us turn to the confessional statement of accused-appellant Roghunath Barmon.<br/>The confession of accused-appellant Roghunath Barmon:<br/>Police arrested Roghunath Barmon on 02.09.2006 in connection with other case.<br/>He was shown arrested on 05.10.2006 in this case.<br/>On 05.10.2006, he was given 04 days police remand and on 09.11.2006 he was given another 05 days police remand.<br/>He made confessional statement on 12.11.2006.<br/>The confessional statement of Roghunath Borman is as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>""অামি দেলুয়াবাড়ী CARB অফিসে ভাত রান্না করার কাজ করতাম ২/৩ মাস যাবত। ২৫.০৮.০৬ শুত্রুবার সন্ধ্যা ৬.০০ টার সময় চৌবাড়িয়া গরতর হাটে ঘটনা। অামি সকালে ভাত রান্না করি। খাওয়া দাওয়া করে শাহীন ও সাগর গোদা গাড়ী যায়। মিটিং অংশগ্রহণের জন্য। নুরতল ইসলাম @ শাহীনের পিতা-অজ্ঞাত, সাং নিম দীঘি, থানা-নিয়ামতপুর এবং সাগরের পিতার নাম জানি না, সাং কালিগ্রাম, মান্দা, নওগা। তারা খাওয়ার সময় অামাকে বিকাল ৩টা ৩.৩০ টার সময় চৌবাড়িয়া হাটে যেতে বলে। অামি বিকাল ৩.৩০ টা দিকে চৌবাড়িয়া CARB অফিসের কাছে নুরতল ইসলাম @ শাহীনকে দাড়িয়ে থাকতে দেখি। শাহীন অামাকে CARB অফিসের পাশে পিন্টু পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং চৌবাড়িয়া মান্দা এর বাড়ীতে নিয়ে যায়। যেয়ে দেখি ১৬/১৭ জন লোক টিভি দেখছে। তাদের মধ্যে শাহীন, সাগর, তহুরতল পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং নিমদীঘি নিয়ামতপুর, সানাউল্লাহ, সঞ্জয়, পিন্টু, পিন্টুর ভাই শফিকুল অপর শফিকুল পিতা ও ঠিকানা অজ্ঞাতদেরকে চিনতে পারি। বাকীদের চিনতে পারি নাই। ওখানে কিছুক্ষণ থাকার পর শাহীন ও সঞ্জয় বোমার ব্যাগ ও পিসতল (৩টি) বের করে। শাহীনের হাতে বোমা ও ১ টি পিসতল, সাগরের হাতে ১টি বোমা ও ১টি পিসতল, সঞ্জয়ের হাতে ১টি পিসতল, শফিকুল (CARB অফিসের) এর হাতে বোমার ব্যাগ ছিল, তহুরতলের কাছে ১টি ছোরা ও ১টি বোমা ছিল। শফিকুল অামাকে বোমা দেয়। অামরা সবাই ৪ জন করে ৫টি গ্রতপের ভিবত্তু হয়ে সন্ধ্যা ৬.০০ টার দিকে হাটে যাই। অামি এবং সানাউল্লাহ হাটের পূর্ব দিকে দাড়িয়ে ছিলাম। শাহীন ও তহুরতল ইসলাম ইশার দিলে শফিকুল বোমা ফাটায়। লোকজন পালাতে লাগল। অামি ও সানাউল্লাহ ঘটনাসহলের কাছে দেখি ৪ জন পুলিশ জবাই করা অবসহায় অাছে। অামি কাউকে জবাই করতে দেখি নাই। শুনেছি তহুরতল ২ জনকে শাহীন ১ জনকে জবাই করেছে। হাটের ইজারাদার হাসপাতালে মারা যায়। তাকে কে মেরেছে জানি না। ঘটনার পর দিয়ে দেখি শাহীন সহ বাকীরা পাকা রাসতার উপর দাড়িয়ে অাছে। অামি অামার কাছে থাকা বোমাটি শফিকুলের হাতে দেই। সানাউল্লাহ সহ অামাকে রেখে বাকীরা দক্ষিণ পশ্চিম কর্নারের দিকে চলে যায়। অামি বাস করে দেলুয়াবাড়ী বাস স্ট্যান্ডে নেমে যাই । অফিসে গিয়ে রাত্রে থাকি। শাহীন ও সাগর পরের দিন সকাল ৯/১০ টার দিকে মটর সাইকেল যোগে অাসে। শাহীন অামাকে বলে সঞ্জয় পুলিশের ২টি অসএ নিয়ে গেছে। ২টি পিসতল ও ১টি পুলিশের অসএ তানোর করিমের বাড়ীতে রেখে এসেছে। পরের দিন সাগরের অসএ গুলো নিয়ে অাসার কথা ছিল। নিয়ে এসেছে কিনা জানি না। ঘটনার ৬/৭ দিন পর পুলিশ অামাকে কালী গ্রাম CARB অফিস থেকে ধরে। এই অামার জবানবন্দী।''</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>If we scan the confessional statement of Roghunath, we find that accused Roghunath was in killing mission and he was included in one of the 05 groups. The learned Magistrate stated that before recording the confession of Roghunath, he complied with all the provisions of sections 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He also stated that he duly cautioned accused Roghunath that he was not bound to confess and if he would confess it might be used against him as evidence. He also gave 03 hours reflection time to the accused before recording his confession. He did not complain of police torture before the learned Magistrate. He did not even say anything about police torture in his statement under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Therefore we find that the confessional statement of Roghunath was voluntary.<br/><br/>Accused Roghunath has given the vivid description of the occurrence. He corroborated with other confessing accused and stated that there were 05 groups in the killing mission and he belonged to one of the groups. We find that the confessional statement of Roghunath is consistent with the prosecution case and as such we hold the view that the confession is also true.<br/><br/>Now, let us turn to the confessional statement of accused Abdul Karim.<br/>The Tribunal has sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life.<br/>Police arrested him on 05.09.2006 at 02.00 A. M.<br/>On 07.09.2006, he was taken on police remand for 06 days and he made confessional statement on 10.09.2006.<br/>He was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/>He was also granted bail but he could not avail of the privilege of bail because he was in the jail in another case.

Shine and Sagor (since dead) left for Deluabari. This statement of Abdul Karim is consistent with the statement of co-accused Nurul Islam @ Shine who made inculpatory statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The confession of Nurul Islam is inculpatory in nature and he categorically stated that Abdul Karim was with them in the meeting and in killing mission. This accused Abdul Karim also stated that Nurul Islam @ Shine made him a phone call by his mobile phone being No. 01713004403 and requested him to take him (accused Abdul Karim) to Deluabari as there was fight in Chowbariahat. Accused Tohurul Islam also stated that Abdul Karim was present at the meeting held on 21.08.2006 and he was also present in the killing mission. The confession of Tohurul Islam is inculpatory in nature. Accused Shafiqul Islam also stated that accused Abdul Karim was present at the meeting held on 21.08.2006 and he was in the killing mission in group No. 2. Abdul Karim admitted that accused Nurul Islam @ Shine and Sagor came to his house by motor cycle and stayed there at night. P. W. 33 seized the motor cycle from Abdul Karim, P. W. 20 is the seizure list witness of motor cycle. All these circumstances go to show that accused Abdul Karim was present at the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006 and he was also present in the killing mission on the date of occurrence and took part in the killing of 4(four) police personnel and Nojer Ali.<br/><br/>Police arrested accused Abu Bakkar Siddique on 14.09.2006. He was taken on police remand for 05 days and bail was granted to him on 14.05.2007. Thereafter, his bail was cancelled on 02.01.2007 and since then he has been absconding. Co-accused Nurul Islam, Tohurul Islam and Shafiqul Islam in their statements under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure mentioned the name of Abu Bakkar Siddique and stated that he was present both at the meeting held on 21.08.2006 and in the killing mission. Though police took him on remand for 05 days, this condemned prisoner did not make any confession. Though accused Abu Bakkar Siddique did not make confession, the other confessing accused mentioned his name. Accused Tohurul made inculpatory statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and he specifically mentioned the name of accused Abu Bakkar Siddique. Since the confession of accused Tohurul is inculpatory in nature and since we have found his confession voluntary and true we have reason to believe that accused Abu Bakkar Siddique was present both at the compiracy held on 21.08.2006 and also in the killing mission. From the voluntary and true confession of accused Tohurul and also from other confessing accused, we find that accused Abu Bakkar Siddique was present both at the compiracy any and in the killing mission. He was also one of the members of 5<sup>th</sup> group with accused Dilip and 2 others. Therefore, we find from the inculpatory confession of accused Tohurul and from other evidence that the accused Abu Bakkar Siddique was present at the time of commssion of offence of killing of 4 police personnel and Izaradar Nojer Ali. There are long lines of decisions which have firmly settled that confession of co-accused can be used against other accused, if the confession is inculpatory in nature and other corraborative evidence is available. Our this view is getting support from the decision in the following cases.<br/><br/>In case of The State Vs. Mir Hossain @ Mira and other reported in 56 DLR (HCD) 124, it has been held in paragraph 34:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“34. Under Section 30 of the Evidence Act, confession of a co-accused can be taken into consideration and on the strength of that confession, another co-accused can be convicted provided the said confession is corroborated by any other evidence, either direct and circumstantial.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of The State Vs. Abul Khair and others reported in 44 DLR (HCD) 284, it has been held, inter alia, in paragraph 9 that it is clear from the terms of sections 30 of the Evidence Act that where more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, a confession  made by any one of them affecting himself and any one of the co-accused can be taken into consideration by the Court not only against the maker of the confession, but also against the co-accused. Strictly speaking, it may not be a piece of evidence within the meaning of the term, but it lends assurance to the other evidence on record<br/>In the case of Moqbul Hossain vs State 12 DLR (SC) 217, the statement of a confessional nature were made by the co-accused affecting themselves and the appellant, the question arose as to whether section 30 of the Evidence Act could not be called in aid of the prosecution in support of the appellant’s conviction, SA  Rahman J, held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“....... Section 30 of the Evidence Act merely provides that the Court “may take into consideration” such confessions as against the appellant, as well as against their makers. The language of the section is very guarded and lends no warrant to the inference that such a statment made by a co-acccused could be treated as substantive evidence against the other person, sufficient to sustain his conviction. It is well settled that there ought to be other evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, linking such a person with the crime, before a confession made by the co-accused could be adverted to, in adjudging the guilt of that person.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of State vs Nalini (1999) 5 SCC, 253 it has been held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“A plain reading of section 30 of the Evidence Act discloses that when the following conditions exist, namely, (1) more persons than one are being tried jointly; (ii) the joint trial of the persons is for the same offence; (iii) a confession is made by one of such persons (who are being tried jointly for the same offence); (iv) such a confession affects the maker as well as such persons (who are being tried jointly for the same offence); (v) such a confession if proved in court, the court may take into consideration such confession against the maker thereof as well as against such persons (who are being jointly tried for the same offence).”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the instant case we find that accused Nurul Islam @ Shine, accused Tohurul Islam have made inculpatory confession and in their confessions they have given vivid descriptions of the occurrence and they have confessed that they were present at the conspiracy and they themselves killed the police personnel and Izaradar Nojer Ali. We have already held that their confessions are voluntary and true.<br/>About accused Abdul Karim, we find that accused Nurul Islam @ Shine, Tohurul Islam and Shafiqul Islam have mentioned in their confessional statements the name of accused A. Karim. He was present both at the conspiracy and the killing mission. The motor cycly of accused A. Karim was used by confessing accused Nurul Islam @ Shine and Sagor (since died). Police also seized the motor cycle from accused A. Karim. P. W. 20 Mamnur Rashid is the seizure list witness of the motor cycle belonged to Abdul Karim. P. W. 33 stated that he seized the alamat i. e. motor cycle from the house of A. Karim. So, from the inculpatory confessional statements of accused Nurul Islam @ Shine and Tohurul Islam and from the confessional statement of Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarak couple with the evidence of P. W. 20 and P. W. 33, we find accused A. Karim was present both at the conspiracy and the killing mission.<br/><br/>Accused Nurul Islam @ Shine, Tohurul Islam and Roghunath mentioned the name of accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok. In their statements under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, they mentioned that accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok was present both at the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006 and in the killing mission. Accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok has given vivid description about the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006 and the occurrence took place on 25.08.2006. Accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok categorically stated in his confessional statement that he was present both at the meeting held on 21.08.2006 and in the killing mission and he was one of the members of group No. 3. He also stated that they looted one pistol and 03 guns and left the place chanting slogan, “Purba Bangla Communist Party, ML Lal Potaka Zindabad.” Therefore, from the inculpatory confessional statements of Nurul Islam @ Shine, Tohurul Islam and from the confession of accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok himself, we find that accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok was present both at the conspiracy and in the killing mission.<br/><br/>Accused Roghunath Borman also stated that he was in the killing mission. He also gave vivid description about the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006 and the occurrence took place on 25.08.2006. He stated that accused Nurul Islam @ Shine and Tuhrul Islam gave the signal and Shafiqul blasted the bomb and he (Roghunath) and Sanaullah saw 04 (four) police personnel were slaughtered. So, from his own confessional statement and from the inculpatory confessional statement of Nurul Islam @ Shine, Tohurul Islam and from the confession of Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarak, we find that accused Roghunath was also very much present at the killing mission, that is, he participated in the killing of 4(four) police personnel and Izaradar Nojer Ali. There is also corraborative evidence against rest accused, that is, Abu Bakkar Siddique, Nurun Nabi Hossain @ Khoka, Shafiqul son of Habibur Rahman, Sonjoy and Pintu. We find that co-accused mentioned their name in their statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and we also find other circumstantial evidence agsinst them. P. W. 2 Rahela Begum stated in her cross-examination by the prosecution (she was declared hostile) that Tohurul took rent of her house and he (Tohurul) used to live there. She also stated that Shafiqul used to live in her house as tenant. She used to cook for her tenants. She also stated that all the accused took launch from her house and watched T. V. and, thereafter, all went to Chowbariahat. Daroga seized the T. V. from the house of Rahela Begum by preparing a seizure list. She rented her house to four persons who used to serve in CARB office. P. W. 2 corraborated with other P.W.s about time, place of occurrence and manner of occurrence. She admitted that 04 persons including Tohurul used to live in her house as tenants.<br/><br/>Accused Tohurul Islam made inculpatory confession and he also mentioned the name of Siddique and Khokan (accused Nurun Nabi Hossain) and 14 others who were present at the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006 at the CARB office at Chowbaria. He (accused Tohurul) also stated that on 21.08.2006 about 05.00 P. M, they (20 persons) were divided into 5 groups and went to Chowbaria cattle market to execute their agreement and he himself slaughtered Daroga. He stated that accused Siddique and Khokan caught hold of Daroga, A.S.I. A. T. Firoj and he himself slaughtered Daroga. Similarly co-accused Nurul Islam @ Shine also mentioned that Khokan (accused Nurun Nabi Hossain) and Siddique were involved in the occurrence.<br/><br/>P. W. 10, Ashraful Islam stated that the occurrence took place on 25.08.2006 at 6/6.15 hours. He has a medicine shop in Chowbariahat. He heard that the miscreants created panic and killed 04 police personnel. Police seized 14” Black and White T. V. from the house of Rahela and prepared seizure list wherein he put his signature. P. W. 11 Nazrul Haque stated that on 30.09.2006, police officer brought accused Roghunath Borman to the house of Rahela. This P. W. 11 went to the house of Rahela alongwith other and put his signature in the seizure list when police seized 14” Black and White T. V. P. W. 11 stated that accused Roghunath Borman disclosed that he and others were watching T. V. in the house of Rahela before committing the occurrence. Rahela also stated that she cooked food for 15/20 persons and after they took their food, they all went out. P. W. 11 stated that he heard that Haji Azim Uddin had a quarrel with other Izaradar of Chowbariahat. P. W. 4 stated in his cross examination by the prosecution (he was declared hostile) that there was a quarrel over the collection of toll and he fully corroborated P. W. 11. He further stated that on 2.6.2006, there was a quarrel regarding collection of toll of Chowbariahat and the brother of Haji Azim Uddin was confined and as a result Haji Azim Uddin threatened to other Izaradars. P. W. 23 Altaf Uddin stated that on 10.11.2006, police seized utensils from the house of Rahela (P.W.2) in his presence and police prepared the seizure list wherein he put his signature. He proved his signature which was marked as Exhibit 19 and he also proved the utensils which were proved as material Exhibit-XXX. P. W. 24 Baki Mondal, stated that when he was going back home, police took him to the house of Rahela Begum. He also saw there Roghunath Borman under police custody. Police seized utensils from the house of Rahela Begum (P.W.2). The Officer-in-Charge disclosed that meat was cooked in the said utensils. Rahela Begum (P.W.2) also stated that meat was cocked in the said utensil. Roghunath in his statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure also stated that on the date of occurrence dated 25.08.2006, Nurul Islam @ Shine told him to go to Chowbariahat and accordingly he went to Chowhbariahat. He went to the house of Pintu and saw that 16/17 persons were watching T. V. there. He mentioned the name of Shine, Sagor (since dead) Tohurul, Sanaullah, Sonjoy, Shafiqul brother of Pintu, Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarak and stated that they were present there. He accompanied Shine and Tohurul Islam to the house of Rahela Begum as per the decision of the meeting held on 21.08.2006. The occurrence took place in Chowbariahat on 25.08.2006. Similarly co-convict Shafiqul Islam, son of Mobarak mentioned in details about the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006. He also mentioned the name of Haji Azim Uddin, Roghunath, Sonjoy, Shafiqul Islam and Pintu who were present in the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006.<br/><br/>Accused Roghunath also corroborated other accused and stated in his confession that P. W. 2 Rahela Begum cooked meat and after launch all the accused watched T. V. Though accused Azim Uddin, Sanaul, Siddique, Khokan (accused Nurun Nabi Hossain) did not make any confession but their names have been disclosed by Nurul Islam, Tohurul, Shafiqul son of Mobarak and Roghunath and we also find corraborativ evidence against them.<br/><br/>We have considered the evidence of prosecution witnesses and we find that there was an enmity between accused Haji Azim Uddin and Izaradars of Chowbariahat and Haji Azim Uddin openly gave threat to other Izaradar and this matter of threat was disclosed at the meeting of conspiracy held on 21.08.2006. The time, place and manner of occurrence have been proved beyond doubt. It has also been proved that the house of Rahela Begum was used as shelter place before the occurrence took place.<br/><br/>Considering the evidence of prosecution witnesses we have reason to believe that accused Hazi Azimuddin, Siddique, Khokon (accused Nurun Nabi Hossain), Sanaul and Shafiqul son of Habibur Rahman along with 5 confessing accused, namely, Nurul Islam @ Shine, Tohurul, Roghunath, A. Karim and Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok took active part at the conspiracy and in order to execute the decision taken at the conspiracy they actively took part in the killing of 4 police personnel and Izaradar Nojer Ali. In fact, we do not find any corraborative evidence against accused, namely, 1. Dilip, 2. Tomal, 3. Ahmed Shah Nuru, 4. Khairul, 5. Abdul Mannan, 6. Rabiul Islam, 7. Majed Ali, except mentioning their names by co-accused in their confessional statement.<br/><br/>There are long lines of decision which have firmly settled that confession of a co-accused is not evidence, it can only lend assurance to other evidence. Let us have a glimpse over some of the decisions of our apex Court to ascertain the evidentiary value of confessional statement of co-accused.<br/><br/>In the case of Amir Hossain Howlader and other Vs. The State, 37 DLR (AD) 139, the Appellate Division has held as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The statement of a co-accused does not fall within the definition of evidence as given in section 3 of the Evidence Act. This is for the simple reason that it is not made on oath, that it is not made in presence of other person affected and that its veracity not tested by cross-examination. It is therefore a very weak evidence against a co-accused, if it is regarded as evidence under section 30. It may be pointed out that the confessional statement of a co-accused is much weaker than the evidence of an approver which fulfils all the three ingredients of ‘evidence.’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In on such case namely, Bhuboni Sahu Vs. The king, 76 Indian Appeals, 147, the Privy Council observed:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ But a confession of a co-accused is obviously evidence of a very weak type, It does not indeed come within the definition of ‘evidence’ contained in section 3 of the Evidence Act, It is not required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the accused and it cannot be tested by cross-examination. Section 30, however, provides that the court may take the confession into consideration and thereby, no doubt, makes it evidence on which the court may act; but the section does not say that the confession is to amount to proof. Clearly there must be other evidence. The confession is only one element in the consideration of the facts proved in the case; it can be put into the scale and weighed wth the other evidence.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Joygun Bibi Vs. State, 12 DLR (SC) 156 it has been held as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>It is true that if there were no other evidence against Joygun Bibi except the confession of Abdul Majid, then, the confession by itself being merely a matter to be taken into consideration, and not having the quality of evidence against Joygun Bibi, it could rightly be held in law that her conviction could not be sustained on the confession alone.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of the State Vs. Lalu Mia and another, 39 DLR (AD) 117, the Appellate Division has held:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“It is unnecessary to go into long line of decisions which has firmly settled that such confessional statement can be taken into consideration in a limited manner. But it cannot be made the foundation of a conviction if there is no other reliable evidence tending to prove the guilt of the accused. The confession made by them can be used only in support of other evidence that is to corroborate the other evidence.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Lutfon Nahar Begum Vs. The State, 27 DLR (AD29 it was held that confession of a co-accused could not be treated as substantive evidence against another accused but that it could only be used to lend assurance to other evidence.<br/><br/>In a recent case of Babar Ali Mollah and others Vs. The State, 44 DLR (AD)10, the Appellate Division has held as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Section 30 of the Evidence Act contemplates that a confession made by a co-accused in a joint trial for the same offence affecting himself and others may be taken into consideration. In other words, the confession of a co-oaccused may lend assurance to the other evidence on record. In the present case the evidence of P.Ws 1 and 5 being unreliable and insufficient to independently support the conviction of the appellants, the confession of the co-accused cannot lend any additional assurance tothe substantive evidence. Since, we have earlier held that the substantive evidence is unreliable and there being no other evidence the confession cannot be considered against the appellants in the present case.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the various pronouncements of the apex courts, we find that the apex Courts consistently held that confession of a co-accused is not substantive evidence and such confession cannot be the sole basis of conviction of a co-accused in the absence of independent and corroborative evidence.<br/><br/>It is true that accused Dilip, Tomal, Khairul, Abdul Awal and Rabiul Islam (surrendered after the judgment) absconded since begining and they did not face the trial. But abscondence itself is not the conclusive prove of guilt of the accused in absence of legal evidence. Only because of abscondence these accused could not held responsible for committing the offence.<br/><br/>There are long line of decisions which have firmly settled that abscondance by itself is not the conclusive proof of guilt of the accused. Our this view is getting support from a number of decisions. In the case of the State-Vs- Lalu Miah and another, 39 DLR (AD)117, it was held that abscondance by itself is not an incriminating matter, even an innocent person if implicated in the ejahar for a serious crime some times absconds to avoid harassment during investigation by the police. In the case of The State Vs. Safikul Islam 1991 BLD(AD) 121, it has been held that abscondance of the accused since the date of occurrence itself is not conclusive proof of his guilt or guilty conscience, but it lends weight to the circumstantial evidenc against him. Similar view has been taken in the cases of Ashraf Ali Munshi Vs. STate 48 DLR 590, Shahjahan Vs. State 46 DLR 575, State Vs. Balai Chandra Sarker, 47 DLR 467, State Vs. Sree Ranjit Kumar Pramanik, 45 DLR 660, Abdul Khaleque Vs. State, 45 DLR 75, State Vs. Badsha Mollah 41 DLR 11.<br/><br/>         Therefore, in view of the above settled principle of law, we are inclined to hold that accused Dilip, Tomal, Khairul, Abdul Awal and Rabiul Islam can not be held responsible for alleged conspiracy and murder of 4 (four) police personnel and Izaradar Nojer Ali only because they absconded after the occurrence in the absence of any other legal evidence against them.<br/> <br/>The learned Judge of the Tribunal found accused,</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Md. Tohurul Islam @ Azizul Hoque</li><li style="text-align:justify">Md. Nurul Islam @ Shine @ Tonmoy</li><li style="text-align:justify">Md.

However, besides inculpatory confessions of accused Nurul Islam @ Shine and Tohurul Islam and the confessional statements of accused Md. Abdul Karim, Md. Shafiqul Islam and Roghunath, some other circumstantial evidences are available as we have discussed hereinbefore, against the following accused, namely,</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Md. Nurul Islam @ Shine</li><li style="text-align:justify">Md. Tohurul Islam @ Azizul Haque</li><li style="text-align:justify">Md.

However, we also find that evidence is available against the following accused, namely,</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Roghunath Barmon</li><li style="text-align:justify">Abdul Karim</li><li style="text-align:justify">Sanaul Islam</li><li style="text-align:justify">Haji Azimuddin </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">There is also no corroborative evidence on record against accused, nmely, 1. Ahmed Shah Nurul and 2. Khairul Islam except mentioning their names by co-accused.<br/> <br/>It is true that accused Md. Tohurul Islam @ Azizul Haque filed applciation for retraction of his confession and the learned trial court rejected his application for retraction.<br/> <br/>Accused Nurul Islam @ Shine @ Toma @ Tanmay had also filed application for retraction on 04.10.2006. But once the confession is taken to be true and voluntary, the application for retraction of confession has no value. In this regard reliance may be placed on the case of Ayesha khatun and others Vs. The State, 19 DLR (1967)818. In the case referred to above it has been held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“If a court believes a confession whether judicial or extra judicial retracted or not retracted to be voluntary and true, it can convict the accused on its sole basis. This view has been expressed by a Division Bench of the High Court of West Pakistan in the case of Nawabuddin Vs. Crown. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of State Vs. Minhun @ Gul observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Retracted confession whether judicial or extra judicial could legally be taken in to consideration against the maker of those confessions himself and if his confessions were found to be true and voluntary then there was no need at all to look for further corraboration. It is now well settled that as against the maker himself his confession, judicial and extra judicial whether retracted or not retracted can in law validly form the sole basis of his conviction, if the court is satisfied and believes that it was true and was not obtained by torture, coercion or inducement.<br/> <br/>In the case of the State Vs. Minhun @ Gul Hassan PLD 1964, Supreme Court of Pakistan at page 813, has held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Retracted confession, whether judicial or extra-judicial, could legally be taken into consideration against the maker of those confessions himself, and if the confessions were found to be true and voluntary, then there was no need at all to look for further corroboration. As against the maker himself his confesison, judicial or extra-judicial, whether retracted or not retracted, can in law validly form the sole basis of his conviction, if the Court is satisfied and believes that it was true and voluntary and was not obtained by torture or coercion or inducement. The question, however, as to whether in the facts and circumstances of a given case the Court should act upon such a confession alone is an entirely different question, which relates to the weight and evidentiary value of the confession and not to its admissibility  in law.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of the State Vs. Fazu Kazi @ Fazlur Rahman and others. 29 DLR (SC) (1977) 271, it has been held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“A conviction of the confessing accused based on a retracted confession even if uncorroborated is not illegal, if the Court believes that it is voluntary and true”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of State Vs. Nurul Hoque, 45 DLR (1993)306 the High Court Division has held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“In the instant case the confessional statement of Semona Khatun had been retracted in her 342 statement only but not before. A confession can be taken into evidence though retracted, if found by the court to be true and voluntary and a belated retraction by a confessing accused at the end of the trial under section 342 would be of no value (Ref:PLD 1964 (AC) 813; 31 DLR 312, 16 DLR 598)”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Hafizuddin Vs. The State 42 DLR 397, it has been held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The law on this point is that a confessional statement, whether retracted or not if found to be true and voluntary, can form the basis of conviction of the maker”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Bakul Chandra Sarker Vs. The State 45 DLR 260 the High Court Division has held as under:<br/>Ahsanuddin Choudhury, J. relying upon the decision in the case of Joygun Bibi Vs. State 12 DLR (SC)151 and the case of Moqbul Hossain Vs. The State 12 DLR (SC) 217 observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>The retraction of a confession was a circumstance which had no bearing whatsoever upon the question whether in the first instance it was voluntarily made, and whether it was true. The fact that the maker of the confession later does not adhere to it cannot by itself have any effect upon the findings reached as to whether the confession was voluntary, and if so, whether it was true. The retraction of the confession was wholly immeterial once it was found that it was voluntary as well as true.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>There are other decisions too. But it will not, perhaps, be helpful to place more decisions on the same point. From all the decisions mentioned above we find that it has been firmly settled by judicial pronouncements that once a confession is found to be true and voluntary, the retraction of confession will be of no help to the confessing accused.<br/><br/>         As per the above pronouncements, there is no diffically in law to convict accused Md. Tohurul Islam @ Azizul Hoque and accused Nurul Islam @ Shine though they retracted their confession. We have already found that their confessions are voluntary and true.<br/> <br/>In respect of imposition of quantum of sentence, the learned Lawyer appearing for the condemned prisoners refers to the case of Lal Singh vs Emperor 40 Cr LJ Allahabad 132 and submits that Court has the power to give lesser sentence under section 396 of the Penal Code, though under section 302 of the Penal Code the rule is that a sentence of death should follow unless reasons are shown for giving lesser sentences, but no such rule applies to section 396 of the Indian Penal Code. Let us have a quick glimpse of the decision of the above case, that is, Lal Singh vs Emperor 40 CrLJ Allahabad 132 which runs as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“There remains the question of sentence. It is true that a man was wounded in the dacoity and eventually died. It is also true that the accused carried a gun in this dacoity. But it is stated that there were several guns carried in this dacoity and none of the witnesses say that the accused was the man who fired the shot which had fatal effects. We do not consider that as a general rule a sentence of death should necessarily follow a conviction under section 396, Indian Penal Code, and this section differs from section 302, Indian Penal Code in that respect. The rule is under section 302 that a sentence of death should follow unless reasons are shown for giving a lesser sentence, no such rule applies to section 396, Indian Penal Code. Accordingly, we find no reason in this case why the sentence of death should be imposed. We, therefore, maintain the conviction of Lal Singh under section 396, Indian Penal Code, and we reduce the sentence from a sentence of death to a sentence of transportation for life.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Therefore, according to the decision cited above there is scope in law to give lesser sentence in section 396 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>In fact, it is said that the most difficult task of a Judge is to decide what would be the quantum of sentene to be awarded upon an accused for committing an offence. It is not possible to lay down any cut and dry formula for imposition of sentence upon the accused. In the case of the State vs Rokeya Begum @ Rokeya Begum (condemned-prisoner) reported in 13 BLT 337, it has been held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Sentencing discretion on the part of a Judge is the most difficult task to perform. It is, also, not possible to lay down any cut and dry formula for imposition of sentence, but the object of sentence should be to see that crime does not go unpunished and the victim of crime as, also, the society has the satisfaction that justice has been done. It will be a mockery of justice to permit the accused to escape the extreme penalty of law when faced with such evidence and cruel act perpetrated by the offenders. To give lesser punishment to the condemned-prisoners who stand convicted in a shocking and revolting crime would render the Justicing System of the country suspect. Sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to Justice System to undermine public confidence in the efficacy of law.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Madan Gopal Kakkad vs Naval Dubey reported in 3 SCC (1992)204, it has been observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“We feel that Judges who bear the Sword of Justice should not hesitate to use that Sword with the utmost severity, to the full and to the end, if the gravity of the offfence so demands.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>We consider that both the above desicions are very good guideline for the Judges to decide the quantum of sentence to be imposed upon the accused who have committed the offence.<br/> <br/>Considering the decisions cited above, the evidence on record and the circumstances, we are of the opinion that justice will be met if the impugned order of conviction and sentence of death of accused, namely,</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Md.

However, accused Haji Azimuddin will get the benefit of section 35 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/>Before parting with the judgment, we like to record our some observations in respect of certain points of criminal justice.<br/> <br/>We, as the part of the judiciary, strongly believe that time has come to do something for the condemned prisoners. We find that the condemned prisoners are supposed to walk to the gallows but unfortunately they are not getting opportunity to defend themselves properly. Against this background of inadequate opportunity for the condemned prisoners to defend themselve, we are inclined to record some of our observationsons on certain points of criminal justice. The observations are:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li style="text-align:justify">In a death reference case almost all the condemned prisoners who are destined to walk to the gallows cannot afford to engage Lawyer to defend their case. According to the provisions of the Legal Remembrancer’s Manual, the condemned prisoners are provided with State Defence Lawyer. It is better, less we say, about the competence of the State Defence Lawyers. The State Defence Lawyers are appointed by the learned Solicitor of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. This Court notes with utter dismay that the Solicitor wing of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs appoints the State Defence Lawyers who have very minimum knowledge about criminal cases of grave nature, like sections, 302, 396 of the Penal Code etc. We could not just allow the condemned prisoners to walk to the gallows without giving them an opportunity of being defended by a competent Lawyer. Obviously, the responsibility is upon the State. Our Human Rights Organisations sometimes are doing laudable jobs and, we believe that they may also do something for the condemned prisoners who are destined to walk to the gallows without any opportunity of being defended by the competent Lawyers. We would appreciate if our Human Rights Organisations also look into the matter and take proper steps in this regard. In fact, walking to the gallows without an opportunity of being defended by a competent Lawyer is the worst form of violation of human rights. We would, therefore, expect that the Human Rights Organisations would take steps to include the matter of defending the condemned prisoners in their agenda. The minimum that they can do, they can appoint a pannel of competent Lawyers to defend the condemned prisoners who could not appoint Lawyer of their own choice because of poverty and other reason.</li><li style="text-align:justify">All State Defence Lawyers have a common grievance that they are given very minimum amount as ‘fees’ for attending the court to defend the condemned prisoners. We expect that the Solicitor wing of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs shall take proper steps to enhance the ‘fees’ of the State Defence Lawyers so that they get the reasonable fees.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         The Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs last revised the fees of the State Defence Lawyer on 16.11.2006. Already 8(eight) years have passed since then and the State Defence Lawyers are given the same amount of fees which was fixed in 2006. This is simply denying justice to the learned State Defence Lawyer. Let us quote the last G.O. dated 16.11.2006 issued by the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs which runs as under:</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;">সংশোধিত জি,ও<br/><u>একই নম্বর ও তারিখের সহলাভিষিত্তু হইবে।</u><br/>গণপ্রজাতমএী বাংলাদেশ সরকার<br/>অাইন, বিচার ও সংসদ বিষয়ক মমএণালয়<br/>সলিসিটর উইং, হিসাব শাখা<br/>অ্যাটর্নি জেনারেল ও সলিসিটর কার্যালয় ভবন,<br/><u>বাংলাদেশ সুপ্রীম কোর্ট প্রাঙ্গণ, ঢাকা।</u></div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;">নং- সল-হিসাব-৯৭/২০০৬-১৫৪৫                                  তারিখঃ ১৬/১১/২০০৬ ইং।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>প্রেরকঃ    শিরীন কবিতা আখতার,        <br/>            উপ-সলিসিটর।<br/>প্রাপকঃ    প্রধান হিসাব রক্ষন কর্মকর্তা,<br/>            অাইন, বিচার ও সংসদ বিষয়ক মমএণালয়,<br/>            এ, জি, বি ভবন, সেগুন বাগিচা, ঢাকা।<br/><br/>বিষয়ঃ রাষ্ট্রপক্ষে নিযুত্তু স্টেট ডিফেন্স ল'ইয়ারগনের দৈনিক শুনানী ফি/সম্মানী ভাতা বৃদ্ধিকরণ প্রসঙ্গে।<br/>         উপরোত্তু বিষয়ে নির্দেশিত হইয়া জানানো যাইতেছে যে, সরকার বাংলাদেশ সুপ্রীমকোর্টে রাষ্ট্রপক্ষে নিযুত্তু স্টেট ডিফেন্স ল'ইয়ারগনের দৈনিক শুনানী ফি/সম্মানী ভাতা পূর্ববর্তী সকল সরকারী অাদেশসমূহ বাতিলত্রুমে ১২০/-(একশত বিশ) টাকার সহলে <u>৩০০/- (তিনশত) টাকা নির্ধারণ করিলেন এবং প্রতি মামলায় সর্বোচ্চ অনধিক ২,০০০/-(দুই হাজার) টাকা ফি/সম্মানী ভাতা পাইবেন।</u><br/>এই সিদ্ধামেত অর্থ মমএণালয়ের সম্মতি রহিয়াছে। অর্থ মমএণালয়ের নথি নং-অম/অবি/প্রবি------/সম্মানী ৪/২০০৬ এর নোটানুচ্ছেদ ৫৬-৬০ দ্রষ্টব্য।<br/>         এই অাদেশ ০১.১১.২০০৬ ইং তারিখ হইতে কার্যকর হইবে।<br/><br/>স্বাক্ষরিত<br/>(শিরীন কবিতা অাখতার)<br/>উপ-সলিসিটর<br/>ফোন-৯৫৫৬১১৯ (অঃ)<br/>নং- সল-হিসাব-৯৭/২০০৬-১৫৪৫                                  তারিখঃ ১৬/১১/২০০৬ ইং।<br/>অনুলিপি ও প্রয়োজনীয় ব্যবসহা গ্রহণের জন্য প্রেরণ করা হইলঃ<br/>১।      অ্যাটর্নি জেনারেল অব বাংলাদেশ, ঢাকা।<br/>২।      সিনিয়র সহকারী সচিব দেওয়ানী/রীট/ফৌজদারী/এ, টি ও এ, এ, টি শাখা, অাইন, বিচার ও সংসদ বিষয়ক মমএণালয়, সলিসিটর উইং, অ্যাটর্নি জেনারেল ও সলিসিটর কার্যালয় ভবন, ঢাকা।</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: right;">সাক্ষরিত<br/>৩/৫/০৭<br/>(মোঃ মাইনুল হক)<br/>সিনিয়র সহকারী সচিব<br/>ফোন-৭১১০৯৫৫ (অঃ)<br/>(emphasis supplied)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>We consider that the above fee is too meagre for a State Defence Lawyer. It is not even befitting for a practicising Lawyer of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court. We find that already 8(eight) years have passed since the last G.O. was issued. Therefore, we consider that it is high time to revise the G.O. fixing the fees of the State Defence Lawyer without further delay. We strongly believe that the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamantary Affairs shall issue the new G.O. within short possible time superceeding all earlier G.Os. and fix the fees of the learned State Defence Lawyers commensurate to their services and status. The State Defence Lawyers are doing the sacred job of saving the neck of a human being. So, there is no scope to take the matter lightly, rather it should be taken into consideration with utmost seriousness.<br/> <br/>With these observations we like to conclude our judgment.<br/> <br/>At the end we wish to express our sincere appreciation to Dr. Md. Bashir Ullah, the learned Deputy Attorney General and his team for their lucid expression of law and for the invaluable assistance to this court.<br/> <br/>Let a copy of this judgment and order be sent to the Tribunal for information and taking necessary action.<br/><br/>         Send down the lower court records with a copy of this judgment to the Tribunal at once.<br/>      <br/>        Let a copy of this judgment be sent to:</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs (Attention: learned Solicitor) for taking necessary action as per the observasation made in the body of the judgment at para ‘A’ and ‘B’.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Chairman, Human Rights Organisations to take necessary action as per the observation made in the body of the judgment at para ‘A’.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
