An admission is a statement-oral or documentary which enables the court to draw an inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact. It is trite to say that every confession must necessarily be an admission, but, every admission does not necessarily amount to a confession. Broadly speaking, confession is an admission made at any time by a person charged with crime, stating or suggesting an inference that he committed the crime. A confession or an admission is evidence against its maker if its admissibility is not excluded by some provision of law. It will be pertinent to reitarate the well settled principle that a confession is admissible provided it is free and voluntary but it does not mean that a mere bald assertion by the accused that he was threatened or tortured or that an inducement was offered to him, can be accepted as true without any thing more. The suggestion must be rejected when there is no material whatsoever to hold that the prisoner was threatened or beaten and the story of tortured is, on the face of it incredible.               . . (232, 233 and 235)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 63</strong><br/><strong>Law clearly provides that photostat copy of its original being the secondary evidence is admissible in evidence. . . . (240)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure</strong><br/><strong>Section 161</strong><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 157</strong><br/><strong>The delay in examination of a witness is a veriable factor. It would depend upon a number of circumstances. For example, non-availability of witnesses, the investigating officer being pre-occupied in serious matters, the investigating officer spending his time in arresting the accused who are absconding, being occupied in other spheres of investigation of the same which may require his attention urgently and importantly, etc. </strong><strong>In view of the above proposition of law and the facts, circumstances and nature of the present case, particularly the offence of Criminal Conspiracy, examination of the PW-48 in a belated stage <em>ifso facto</em> does not render his evidence unreliable and shakey</strong><strong>                                                   . . . (262 and 265)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 30</strong><br/><strong>It is the settled proposition of law that in a joint trial where more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, a confession made by any of them affecting himself and any of his co-accused can be taken into consideration by the Court not only against the maker of the confession but also against the co-accused, it may not be an evidence within the strict meaning of the term but it can be used to lend assurance to other evidence on record.                                            . . . (277)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 10</strong><br/><strong>In criminal law a party is not generally responsible for the acts and declarations of other unless they have been expressly directed, or assented to by him; “<em>nemo reus est nisi mens sit rea</em>”. This section, however, is based on the concept of agency in cases of </strong><strong>conspiracy. Conspiracy connotes a partnership</strong><strong> in crime or actionable wrong. A conspirator is considered to be an agent of his associates in carrying out the objects of the conspiracy and anything said, done or written by him, during the continuance of the conspiracy, in reference to the common intention of the conspirators, is a relevant fact against each one of his associates, for the purpose of proving the conspiracy as well as for showing that he was a party to it. Each is an agent of the other in carrying out the object of the conspiracy and in doing anything in furtherance of the common design.           . . . (285)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Penal Code, 1860 (XLV of 1860)</strong><br/><strong>Section 120A</strong><br/><strong>The criminal conspiracy doctrine only requires overlapping chains of agreement that link the physical perpetrator to the accused. However, the lack of a direct agreement between the defendant and the physical perpetrator is no bar to applying the conspiracy doctrine as long as the chain of overlapping agreements connects them. The act of ‘agreement’ is to be inferred from act and conduct of the accused-amid, prior or subsequent to the commission of the principal offence. Conspiracy to commit crime by itself is punishable as a substantive </strong><strong>offence and every individual offence committed</strong><strong> pursuant to the conspiracy is separate and </strong><strong>distinct offence to which individual offenders</strong><strong> are liable to punish, considering their overt acts, independent of </strong><strong>the conspiracy. The agreement does not come</strong><strong> to an end with its making, but would endure </strong><strong>till it is accomplished</strong><strong> or abandoned or proved</strong><strong> abortive. Being a continuing offence, if any acts or omissions which constitute an offence </strong><strong>are done the conspirators continue to be parties</strong> <strong>to the said conspiracy. The agreement continues</strong><strong> in operation</strong> <strong>and therefore in existence until it is discharged</strong> <strong>or terminated by completion of its performance</strong><strong> or by abandonment or frustration.                     . . . (292, 293 and 299)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 342</strong><br/><strong>It is by now well settled that cognizance of offence can be taken only ones either by the Magistrate or by the Sessions Court. In the instant case the learned Judge of trial Court framed charges against the accused persons in presence of them and same were read over and explained to them and at the time of examination of the accused persons under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the learned trial Judge has brought all the incriminating pieces of evidence and materials to the notice of the concerned accused persons, adduced by the prosecution. Thus, the accused persons were not prejudiced in any manner in the trial. As such, the submissions of the learned Advocate for the accused that the trial has been vitiated, is not at all tenable in law.             . . . (325)</strong><br/><br/><strong><em>State Vs. Md.

Sharif Shahidul Alam Bipul [exhibit-9] submitted that the accused was produced before the Magistrate for recording the statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure from the custody of RAB personnel beyond the period of office hour after a prolong remand and the Magistrate without comply the provision of sections 164 of 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure recorded his statement [exhibit 9] and thus the said statement cannot be said true and voluntary and it has got no evidentiary value and as such the Tribunal erred in law in convicting accused Sharif Shahidul Alam Bipul relying on exhibit 9, the alleged confessional statement made by him.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Ali further submitted that exhibit 9(kha), a Photostat copy of the alleged confessional statement of Mufti Abdul Hannan, was not made in connection with the present case, rather, it was made in connection with Ramna (Dhaka Metropolitan area) Police Station case no.46(4)2001. As such said confessional statement cannot be used and considered as evidence in this case. In support of his submission he referred to the case of State vs. Md. Khurshed Alam and others, reported in 17 BLC, page 10. He also submitted that alleged confessional statement [9(kha)] was the result of prolonged remand and in human torture. Further, in recording the said statement the Magistrate (PW-49) also did not comply the provision of section 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Thus, the alleged confessional statement is not true and voluntary and is not admissible in evidence. To substantiate the above submission he referred to the cases of State Vs. Raza Abdul Majid and others, reported in 1 BLC, page-144, Chunnu Vs. State, reported in 65 DLR, page-127, Belal alias Bellal and 2 others Vs. State, reported in 54 DLR, page-80, the State vs. Ali Hossain, reported in 18 BlD, page-655, Nurul Islam vs. The State, reported in 28 BLD, page-114.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Ali referring to the evidence of PW-48 submitted that the said witness is a hired and managed witness. For the purpose of this case the prosecution having tutored him produced before the court. Moreover, the investigating officer recorded his statement after long laps of time and this inordinate delay in examining the important prosecution witness creates a serious doubt as to the truth of the prosecution case. In fact he was a source of Police and his contradictory and inconsistence evidence makes the whole prosecution case doubtful and he cannot be said a trustworthy and reliable witness and his evidence must be left out for consideration.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Ali also submitted that the investigation officer investigated the case in a perfunctory manner and that the prosecution withheld so many vital witnesses, which presumed that had they been examined they would not support the prosecution case and non examination of the vital witnesses creates adverse presumption as to the veracity of the prosecution case. The prosecution also failed to prove the place of conspiracy and ingredients of conspiracy. He referring to exhibit 8(kha), the sketch map of alleged house of conspiracy submitted that in the said sketch map house number, road number and other particulars have not been mentioned therein.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Ali submitted that the Tribunal most illegally convicted accused Mufti Moinuddin and Mohibullah relaying on the retracted, involuntary and untrue statements made by co-accused Mufti Abdul Hannan, Sharif Shahidul Alam alias Bipul. It is well settled proposition of law that confession of a co-accused cannot be the sole basis to convict another accused. In this case there is no corroborative evidence to lend support to the said confessional statement.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Ali lastly submitted that the prosecution miserably failed to prove its case beyond doubt and there is no legal evidence to convict the above accused persons and as such the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence is liable to be set aside and they deserve acquittal.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>         Submission on behalf of accused Md.

He submitted that a good number of prosecution witnesses were the victims of the occurrence and as such they are the most competent, natural and credible witnesses and the defence has failed to shake their respective evidence in any manner.</li><li style="text-align:justify">He further submitted that it is now well settled proposition of law that conviction on the basis of a confessional statement upon the maker can be very much based even if the confessional statement had been retracted at a later stage.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Further, confession of a co-accused can be taken into consideration and on the strength of that confession another co-accused can be convicted if it is corroborated by any other evidence, both direct and circumstantial.

The alamats seized by local police also handed over to them for examination.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Those alamats were examined in the forensic Explosives Laboratory, Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Fort Hatstead, Sevenoaks, Kent TNI47BP.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Forensic case officer Sarah Louise Lancaster in his report [exhibit-x] opined to the effect:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS<br/>Based upon my examinations, the information provided and having studied the printed copies of the scene photographs, it is my opinion that the damage near the Hazrat Shahjalal Mosque and injuries described were caused by the explosion of an anti-personnel grenade.<br/>The items collectively included metal (Most likely steel) spheres/balls from a functioned grenade, explosively damaged, drab/brown coloured, plastics fragments, which probably originated form a grenade body and/or grenade fuze and a conventional fly-off lever from a grenade fuze. Trace quantities of the high explosive PETN were found on the explosively damaged plastics fragments in items NF/20 and RB/1. Such residues are consistent with having resulted from, for example, the detonation of a grenade containing a PETN based explosive composition. Item as/3 comprised a pair of severely damaged and bloodstained trousers, parts of which were peppered with small holes that were likely formed by explosively propelled metal spheres similar to those contained within items NF/5, NF/6 and NF/7”.<br/><strong>AND</strong><br/>“Although the type of grenade cannot be conclusively and unequivocally identified, the appearance of the lever shows that it most likely originated from an ARGES type grenade such as the HG 84 or an ARGES licensed produced grenade. An example of an Inert Arges HG 84 grenade (disassembled and less any explosives components) is shown in photographs 9 and 10. The grenade lever shown in these photographs is similar in size and general appearance to the lever contained in item NF/19. As with other Arges designes, this type of grenade consists of a plastic body that contains steel balls and a filling of PETN high explosive.<br/>It may also be of interest to note that, according to the literature, the Pakistan Ordnance Factories (POF) plastic hand grenade is a licensed produced Arges model known as the 84-P2A1 grenade, which consists of a plastic body that contains approximately 5000 steel balls and a plasticized PETN explosive composition.<br/>As demonstrated at the scene, the explosion of such a hand grenade could cause damage to property and would be likely to result in death or very serious injuries to persons in the proximity of the explosion. Persons within range of the fast moving shrapnel could also suffer serious injuries”.</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">If we consider this report, exhibit-X, coupled with the oral evidence of the above witnesses and the post mortem reports exhibits 4, 4(Ka) and 4(Kha) we have no hesitation to hold that the prosecution has been successfully able to prove that on 21.05.2004 after Jumma prayer the offenders exploded grenade aiming British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Mr. Anwar Chowdhury when he was leaving Mazar premises having completed Jumma prayer and because of such grenade explosion he along with 40/50 others were injured and 03(three) others succumbed to their injuries.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Let us now discuss whether the confessional statements under section 164 of the code of criminal procedure made by accused Md.

An admission is a statement-oral or documentary which enables the court to draw an inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact. It is trite to say that every confession must necessarily be an admission, but, every admission does not necessarily amount to a confession. Broadly speaking, confession is an admission made at any time by a person charged with crime, stating or suggesting an inference that he committed the crime. A confession or an admission is evidence against its maker if its admissibility is not excluded by some provision of law.</li><li style="text-align:justify">On careful examination of exhibit-9(Kha) it appears that in the confessional statement accused Mufti Abdul Hannan confessed his guilt in committing similar nature of different offences in different places.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It will be pertinent to reitarate the well settled principle that a confession is admissible provided it is free and voluntary but it does not mean that a mere bald assertion by the accused that he was threatened or tortured or that an inducement was offered to him, can be accepted as true without any thing more.

When the conspiratorial agreement has been made, the offence of conspiracy is complete, it has been committed, and the conspirator can be prosecuted even though no performance had taken place. But the fact that the offence of conspiracy is complete at the stage does not mean that the conspiratorial agreement is finished with. It is not dead. If it is being performed, it is very much alive.

The evidence as to transmission of thoughts sharing the unlawful design may be sufficient</u>.”<br/>[Underlines supplied]<br/><strong>Object of the conspiracy and the offence committed in this particular case</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">On scanning the confessional statement of accused Abdul Hannan [exhibit 9(Kha)] it appears that in his statement he had given a vivid description about their organisational (Harkatul Jihad Al Islami Bangladesh) object, plan and policy. In his statement he categorically stated that while he had been studying at Karachi in Pakistan, he having taken training participated in Afgan war to protect the interest of Muslims and in a fighting he received injury and he was admitted in a hospital at Peshwar in Pakistan. So many people from Bangladesh participated in the said war. The people who participated in the Afgan war having returned from Afganistan formed an organisation namely ‘Harkatul Jihad Al Islami Bangladesh’. He joined in the said organisation and became a top leader of it. The said organisation also sent some members of it to Arakan for participating in the war for RSO and RFA. In order to protect the image of Islam, as per the decision of the said organisation, they attacked by blasting bombs on the cultural program organised by ‘Udichi Shilpi Goshti’, a progressive cultural organisation, in Jessore and due to such bomb attacked 10/12 persons died and more than hundred peoples were injured. In the month of July, 2000 they had taken a decision to attack the leaders of Awami League in order to save the ‘Alims (Islamic Scholars)’ of the country as well as the ‘Islam’. Due to some actions taken by the Awami League Government against the Islamic Scholars it was their belief that Awami League was against Islam and Islamic Scholars as well as the agent of India. Pursuant to the said decision they had taken several attempts to kill Awami League Chief Sheikh Hasina, particularly in the month of July, 2000 at Kotalipara under district Gopalganj and in 2001 at Sylhet when she went there for holding public meeting. They had also attacked on the cultural program celebrating ‘Pohela Boishakh’ at Ramna Batmul. To achieve their common object and design they supplied bombs and grenades in the different parts of the country through their organisational men and made several attempts to kill local Awami League leaders in Sylhet. They used to collect arms, ammunitions, explosives and money from outside and inside the country and they also helped RSO and RFO groups of Arakanees in Mayanmar.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Accused Sharif Shehidul Alam alias Bipul in his confessional statement [exhibit-9] stated that in the year 1994 he joined with the activities of ‘Harkatul Jihad Al Islami Bangladesh’ in Sylhet and in 1995 he along with 15 others took training in Fenchuganj and in the year 1996 he saw the training program of the members of Harkatul Jihad at Lalkhan Bazar and he knew accused Mufti Abdul Hannan. Eventually, he went to Lebia taking job and having returned from Lebia in the year 2003, he made contract with accused Mufti Abdul Hannan and he went to the house of Mufti Abdul Hannan at Badda, Dhaka where he saw accused Ovi, Moin and others. On discussions among them, they had taken decision to attack on the leaders of the Awami League terming them as the enemy of Islam. They also believed that the Britain and America were also against Islam.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Accused Delwar Hossain Ripon in his confessional statement [exhibit-9(Ka)] also stated that accused Bipul instigated him to join in the said organisation in order to participate in ‘Jihad’ saying that the Muslims in the different parts of the world were being oppressed by the America, Britain and Israil.</li><li style="text-align:justify">If we consider the above statements of the accused persons together with the evidence of PW-48 then object, plan, policy and design of the accused persons would be crystal clear. On the plea to protect Islam the accused persons and their organisation namely ‘Harkatul Jihad Al Islami Bangladesh’ had hatched conspiracy to annihilate the leaders of Awami League, the political party which led the liberation struggle and war of independence of Bangladesh and a secular force of the country, including it’s Chief Sheikh Hasina terming them as ‘the enemy of Islam’ and ‘agent of India’. They also took stand against the Bangali culture terming the same as anti Islam. Pursuant to their common plan, policy and design they took several attempts to kill Awami League Chief Sheikh Hasina and the other leaders of Awami League and attacked on the cultural activists in the different parts of the Country. They also attacked on the cultural program organized by Udichi at Jessor and in the program of ‘Pohela Boishakh’ at Ramna Batmul. </li><li style="text-align:justify">In the instant case in furtherance of their common plan, policy and design the accused had attacked on the British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Mr. Anwar Chowdhury on the day of occurrence by blasting grenade in order to kill him when he was coming out from the premises of the Mazar of Hazrat Shahjalal (R:) after offering Jumma prayer and as a result of such grenade explosion 03(three) persons died and about 50/60 persons including the British High Commissioner were injured.</li><li style="text-align:justify">We have already discussed about the propositions of law regarding criminal conspiracy and its continuation. The conspiracy is held to be continued and renewed as to all its members wherever and whenever any member of the conspiracy acts in furtherance of the common design. In a case of conspiracy it does not require that each and every person who is a party to the conspiracy must do some overt act towards the fulfillment of the object of conspiracy, the essential ingredient being an agreement between the conspirators to commit the crime and if these requirements and ingredients are established the act would fall within the trappings of the mischief of criminal conspiracy. As such, we have no hesitation to hold that all the accused are liable for committing the offence to have been committed in this particular case.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>         Whether any omission or any defect done by the investigating officer in the investigations render the entire prosecution case doubtful-</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Mohammad Ali, the learned Advocate for the accused referring to exhibit-8(Kha), the sketch map of the house from where grenades were supplied and the accused persons were used to stay, argued that the investigating officer investigated the case in a perfunctory manner.

For truly attaining this object of a ‘fair trial’, the Court should leave no stone unturned to do justice and protect the interest of the society as well.”</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Having considered the above principles of law, we are led to hold that mere omission in not mentioning the details description of the house [exhibit 8(Kha)], where the accused persons used to stay, meet and hatch conspiracy to implement their plan and policy and from where accused Ripon and Bipul collected grenades, does not destroy the prosecution case in any manner.</li><li style="text-align:justify">However, no suggestion was put to the investigating officer by the defence with regard to exhibit 8(Kha) and the said document was exhibited without any objection and same was unchallenged by the defence. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>         Whether the trial has been vitiated it not taking cognizance by the learned Sessions Judge</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The learned defence Advocate was argued that in the instant case the learned Sessions Judge, Sylhet having received the case record without taking cognizance of the offences against the accused persons proceeded with the trial and framed charged against the accused persons and thereby the trial has been vitiated.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Section 193 of the Code of Criminal Procedure speaks of cognizance of offences by the Court of Session and provides as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“193. <strong>Cognizance of offences by Courts of Session</strong>- Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, no Court of Session shall take cognizance of any offence as a court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been sent to it by a Magistrate duly empowered in that behalf.”</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">It is pertinent to mentioned here that by way of amendment of law the words ‘unless the case has been sent to it’ has been inserted in place of the words ‘unless the accused has been committed to it’.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the case of <strong>Dharampal Vs. State of Hariana, reported in (2014) 3 SCC, page-306</strong>, it has been held that:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The key words in the section are that “no Court of Session shall take cognizance of any offence as a court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a Magistrate under this Code”. The above provision entails that a case must, first of all, be committed to the Court of Session by the Magistrate, the second condition is that only after the case had been committed to it, could the Court of Session taken cognizance of the offence exercising original jurisdiction. Although, an attempt has been made by Mr. Dave to suggest that the cognizance indicated in Section 193 deals not with cognizance of an offence, but of the commitment order passed by the learned Magistrate, we are not inclined to accept such a submission in the clear wordings of Section 193 that the Court of Session may take cognizance of the offences under the said section.<br/>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  .<br/><u>It is well settled that cognizance of an offence can only be taken once. In the event, a Magistrate takes cognizance of the offence and then commits the case to the Court of Session the question of taking fresh cognizance of the offence and, thereafter, proceed to issue summons, is not in accordance with law. If cognizance is to be taken of the offence, it could be taken either by the Magistrate or by the Court of Session</u>. The language of Section 193 of the Code very clearly indicates that once the case is committed to the Court of Session by the learned Magistrate, the Court of Session assumes original jurisdiction and all that goes with the assumption of such jurisdiction.<br/>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br/>Nor can there be any question of part cognizance being taken by the Magistrate and part cognizance being taken by the learned Sessions Judge.” (Underlines supplied)</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">In the said case it has been held that cognizance of offence can be taken only ones either by Magistrate or by the Sessions Court.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the case of <strong>R.N Agarwal Vs.

The State, reported in 42 DLR page-286</strong>]</li><li style="text-align:justify">The Appellate Division in the case of <strong>Mr. Haripada Biswas Vs. The State and another, reported in 6 BSCR (AD), page-83</strong> also held that Court of Session is precluded from talking cognizance offence as a Court of original jurisdiction.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the instant case from the records it appears that the concerned Magistrate having accepted the charge sheet on 26.06.2007 and thereby taken cognizance of the offences against the persons recommended for prosecution sent the case record to the learned Sessions Judge as per provision of section 205C of the Code of Criminal Procedure and thereafter, the learned Sessions Judge proceeded with the case and framed charge against the persons sent to him by the Magistrate duly empowered.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It is by now well settled that cognizance of offence can be taken only ones either by the Magistrate or by the Sessions Court. In the instant case the learned Judge of trial Court framed charges against the accused persons in presence of them and same were read over and explained to them and at the time of examination of the accused persons under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the learned trial Judge has brought all the incriminating pieces of evidence and materials to the notice of the concerned accused persons, adduced by the prosecution. Thus, the accused persons were not prejudiced in any manner in the trial. As such, the submissions of the learned Advocate for the accused that the trial has been vitiated, is not at all tenable in law.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>         Is the prosecution bound to examine all the witnesses cited in the charge-sheet?</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Mohammad Ali, the learned defence Advocate also argued that in the instant case the prosecution failed to examine some of the vital witnesses namely, Mr. Anwar Chowdhury, the British High Commissioner to Bangladesh, Abul Hossain, the Deputy Commissioner, Sylhet and colonel Golam Rabbani, the owner of the house in question at Badda, Dhaka.</li><li style="text-align:justify">PW-53, the investigating officer in his cross-examination stated he did not examine Mr. Anwar Chowdhury, the British High Commissioner to Bangladesh due to protocol reasons.</li><li style="text-align:justify">However, it is well settled that the prosecution is not bond to examine each and every witnesses cited in the charge-sheet. Public prosecution has to take decision in that regard in a fair manner. If the prosecution felt that its case has been well established through the witnesses examined, it cannot be said that non-examination of some persons rendered its version vulnerable.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>         Whether the trial Court awarded appropriate sentence to the concerned accused persons </strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. A.K.M Faiz, the learned defence Advocate, for accused Delwar Hossain Ripon submitted that the sentence of death awarded to the accused is very harsh and he prayed for commutation of sentence considering his age, no criminal antecedent and agony of death in condemn cell for last 8(eight) years.</li><li style="text-align:justify">From the evidence and materials on record we have already found that all the accused persons were the active members of an organisation namely ‘Harkatul Jihad Al Islami Bangladesh’. Their organized criminal activates clearly show that they belonged to an organised group and to achieve their goal they also had resorted terrorist activities exploding grenades and bombs targeting innocent peoples and by their such activities innocent persons were being killed.</li><li style="text-align:justify">“Terrorism by nature is difficult to define. Acts of terrorism conjure up emotional responses in the victims (those hurt by the violence and those affected by the fear) as well as in the practitioners. Even the U.S. Government cannot agree on one single definition. The old adage “one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter” is still alive and well. Listed below are several definitions of terrorism used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“Terrorism is the use or threatened use of force designed to bring about political change.”   <em>Brian Jenkins</em><br/>“Terrorism constitutes the illegitimate use of force to achieve a political objective when innocent people are targeted.” <em>Walter Laqueur</em><br/>“Terrorism is the premeditated, deliberate, systematic murder, mayhem, and threatening of the innocent to create fear and intimidation in order to gain a political or tactical advantage, usually to influence an audience.” <em>James M. Poland</em><br/>“Terrorism is the unlawful use or threat of violence against persons or property to further political or social objectives. It is usually intended to intimidate or coerce a Government, individuals or groups, or to modify their behavior or politics.”   <em>Vice-President’s Task force, 1986.</em><br/>“Terrorism is the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a Government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives”            <em>FBI definition.”</em><br/>[<strong>Source:</strong> <strong>Mohd.

Terrorism is generally an attempt to acquire or maintain power or control by intimidation and causing fear and helplessness in the minds of people at large or any section thereof and it is a totally abnormal phenomenon. <u>Terrorism</u><u> is distinguishable from other forms of violence as in terrorism the deliberate and systematic use of coercive intimidation is used.</u>”<br/> [Underlines supplied]</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">We cannot overlooked and ignored the facts and circumstances that in the recent past in our country some interested and vested quarters in order to achieve their illegal goals and objects had taken resort of terrorist activities, sometimes on the plea of protecting ‘Islam religion’ and sometimes in guise of political programs. And to implement their evil design they killed so many innocent people exploding grenades and bombs in public places as well as public and private transports and caused damage to buildings including educational institutions, railway, roads, bridges etc by setting fire. The evil forces also targeted Bangali culture and attacked on different cultarul programs in different places of the country. As such, to protect the interest of the society<strong>,</strong> innocent people and the State, the offenders of terrorism must be awarded adequate punishment. There is no scope to show any leniency to the offenders of such type of organised crimes.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the case of <strong>Sevaka Perumal Vs. State of Tamil Nadu, reported in (1991) 3 SCC page-471,</strong> it has been observed:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“9. The law regulates social interests, arbitrates conflicting claims and demands. Security of persons and property of the people is an essential function of the State. It could be achieved through instrumentality of criminal law. Undoubtedly, there is a cross-cultural conflict where living law must find answer to the new challenges and the courts are required to mould the sentencing system to meet the challenges. The contagion of lawlessness would undermine social order and lay it in ruins protection of society and stamping out criminal proclivity must be the object of law which must be achieved by imposing appropriate sentence. Therefore, law as a cornerstone of the edifice of order should meet the challenges confronting the society. Friedman in his Law in Changing Society stated that, “State of criminal law continues to be- as it should be- decisive reflection of social consciousness of society.” Therefore, in operating the sentencing system, law should adopt the corrective machinery or the deterrence based on factual matrix. By deft modulation of sentencing process be stern where it should be, and tempered with mercy where it warrants being. The facts and given circumstances in each case, the nature of the crime, the manner in which it was planned and committed, the motive for commission of the crime, the conduct of the accused and all other attending circumstances are relevant facts which would enter into the area of consideration. <u>For instance a murder committed due to deep seated personal rivalry may not call for penalty of death. But an organized crime or mass murders of innocent people would call for imposition of death sentence as deterrence</u>. In Mahesh Vs. State of M.P., this Court while refusing to reduce the death sentence observed thus: (SCC P.82, para-6)<br/><u>“[I]t will be a mockery of justice to permit the accused to escape the extreme penalty of law when faced with such evidence and such cruel acts. To give the lesser punishment for the accused would be to render the justicing system of the country suspect. The common man will lose faith in courts</u>. In such cases, he understands and appreciates the language of deterrence more than the reformative jargon.<br/><u>Therefore, undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society could not long endure under serious threats.</u> If the courts did not protect the injured, the injured would then resort to private vengeance. <u>It is therefore, the duty of every court to award proper sentence having regard to the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed etc</u>.” [Underlines supplied]<br/>The Crime of terrorism deserves to be evaluated as ‘crimes of serious gravity’</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify"><strong>In the case of Yakub Abdul Razzak Memon Vs.
