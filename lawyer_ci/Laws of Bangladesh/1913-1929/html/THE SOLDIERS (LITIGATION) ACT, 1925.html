application or appeal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Power of Collector to intervence in case of unrepresented soldier</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">5.         If any Collector has

certify the facts in the prescribed manner to the Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Notice to be given in case of unrepresented soldier</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">6.(1) If a

special conditions, and that a postponement of the proceeding in respect of the soldier is necessary in the interests of justice, the Court shall thereupon postpone the proceeding in respect of the soldier for the prescribed period, or, if no period has been prescribed, for such period as it thinks fit.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Court may proceed when no certificate received</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">8.         If, after issue of a notice under section 6, the prescribed authority either certifies that the soldier is not serving under special

conditions,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the proceeding in respect of such soldier may, in any case such as is referred to in the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 6 and shall, in any other case, be postponed in the manner provided in section 7.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Power to set aside decrees and orders passed against a soldier serving under war or special conditions</p><p style="text-align: justify;">10.(1) In any proceeding before a Court in which a decree or order has been passed against any soldier whilst he was serving under any special conditions, the soldier or, if he is dead, his legal representative may apply to the Court which passed the decree or order for an order to set aside the same, and, if the Court, after giving an opportunity to the opposite party of being heard, is satisfied that the interests of justice require that the decree or order should be set aside as against the soldier, the Court shall, subject to such conditions, if any, as it thinks fit to impose, make an order accordingly.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2)        The period of limitation for an application under sub-section (1) shall be ninety days from the date of the decree or order, or, where the summons or notice was not duly served on the soldier in the proceeding in which the decree or order was passed, from the date on which the applicant had knowledge of the decree or order; and the provisions of section 5 or the Limitation Act, 1908, shall apply to such applications.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3)        When the decree or order in respect of which an application under sub-section (1) is made is of such a nature that it cannot be set aside as against the soldier only, it may be set aside as against all or any of the parties against whom it has been made.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(4)        Where a Court sets aside a decree or order under this section, it shall appoint a day for proceeding with the suit, appeal or application, as the case may be.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Modification of law of limitation where soldier or his legal representative is a party</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">11.       In computing the period of limitation prescribed by sub-section (2) of section 10 of this Act, the Limitation Act, 1908 or any other law for the time being in force, for any suit, appeal or application to a Court, any party to which is or has been a soldier, or is the legal representative of a soldier, the period during which the soldier has been serving under any special conditions, and, if the soldier has died while so serving, the period from the date of his death to the date on which official intimation thereof was sent to his next-of-kin by the authorities in Bangladesh, shall be excluded:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that this section shall not apply in the case of any suit, appeal or application instituted or made with the object of enforcing a right of pre-emption except where the said right accrues in such circumstances, and is in respect of agricultural land and village immovable property situated in any such area, as the Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, specify in this behalf.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Power of Court to refer questions to prescribed authorities</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">12.       If any Court is in doubt whether, for the purposes of section 10 or section 11, a soldier is or was at any particular time serving under special conditions, or has died while so serving or as to the date of such death or as to the date on which official intimation of such death was sent to his next-of-kin by the authorities in Bangladesh, the Court may refer the point for the decision of the prescribed authority, and the certificate of that authority shall be conclusive evidence on the point.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Rule-making power</b></p><p
