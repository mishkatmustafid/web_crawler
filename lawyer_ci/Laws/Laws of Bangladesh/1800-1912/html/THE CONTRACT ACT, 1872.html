In this Act the following words and expressions are used in the following senses, unless a contrary intention appears from the context:-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal, when accepted becomes a promise:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) The person making the proposal is called the "promisor" and the person accepting the proposal is called the "promisee":</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(d) When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or abstinence or promise is called a consideration for the promise:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(e) Every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration for each other, is an agreement:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(f) Promises which form the consideration or part of the consideration for each other are called reciprocal promises:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(g) An agreement not enforceable by law is said to be void:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(h) An agreement enforceable by law is a contract:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(i) An agreement which is enforceable by law at the option of one or more of the parties thereto, but not at the option of the other or others, is a voidable contract:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(j) A contract which ceases to be enforceable by law becomes void when it ceases to be enforceable.</p><p align="center">CHAPTER I</p><p align="center">OF THE COMMUNICATION, ACCEPTANCE AND REVOCATION OF PROPOSALS</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Communication, acceptance and revocation of proposals</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. The communication of proposals, the acceptance of proposals, and the revocation of proposals and acceptances, respectively, are deemed to be made by any act or omission of the party proposing, accepting or revoking by which he intends to communicate such proposal, acceptance or revocation, or which has the effect of communicating it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Communication when complete</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. The communication of a proposal is complete when it comes to the knowledge of the person to whom it is made.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The communication of an acceptance is complete,–</p><p style="text-align: justify;">as against the proposer, when it is put in a course of transmission to him, so as to be out of the power of the acceptor;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">as against the acceptor, when it comes to the knowledge of the proposer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The communication of a revocation is complete,-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">as against the person who makes it, when it is put into a course of transmission to the person to whom it is made, so as to be out of the power of the person who makes it;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">as against the person to whom it is made, when it comes to his knowledge.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A proposes, by letter, to sell a house to B at a certain price.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The communication of the proposal is complete when B receives the letter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) B accepts A's proposal by a letter sent by post.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The communication of the acceptance is complete,–</p><p style="text-align: justify;">as against A, when the letter is posted;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">as against B, when the letter is received by A.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) A revokes his proposal by telegram.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The revocation is complete as against A when the telegram is despatched. It is complete as against B when B receives it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">B revokes his acceptance by telegram. B's revocation is complete as against B when the telegram is despatched, and as against A when it reaches him.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revocation of proposals and acceptances</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. A proposal may be revoked at any time before the communication of its acceptance is complete as against the proposer, but not afterwards.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">An acceptance may be revoked at any time before the communication of the acceptance is complete as against the acceptor, but not afterwards.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A proposes, by a letter sent by post, to sell his house to B.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">B accepts the proposal by a letter sent by post.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A may revoke his proposal at any time before or at the moment when B posts his letter of acceptance, but not afterwards.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">B may revoke his acceptance as any time before or at the moment when the letter communicating it reaches A, but not afterwards.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Revocation how made</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. A proposal is revoked –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(1) by the communication of notice of revocation by the proposer to the other party;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) by the laps of the time prescribed in such proposal for its acceptance, or, if no time is so prescribed, by the lapse of a reasonable time, without communication of the acceptance;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) by the failure of the acceptor to fulfil a condition precedent to acceptance; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(4) by the death or insanity of the proposer, if the fact of his death or insanity comes to the knowledge of the acceptor before acceptance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Acceptance must be absolute</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">7. In order to convert a proposal into a promise, the acceptance must-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(1) be absolute and unqualified;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) be expressed in some usual and reasonable manner, unless the proposal prescribes the manner in which it is to be accepted. If the proposal prescribes a manner in which it is to be accepted, and the acceptance is not made in such manner, the proposer may, within a reasonable time after the acceptance is communicated to him, insist that his proposal shall be accepted in the prescribed manner, and not otherwise; but if he fails to do so, he accepts the acceptance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Acceptance by performing, conditions, or receiving consideration</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">8. Performance of the conditions of a proposal, or the acceptance of any consideration for a reciprocal promise which may be offered with a proposal, is an acceptance of the proposal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Promises, express and implied</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">9. In so far as the proposal or acceptance of any promise is made in words, the promise is said to be express.

All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing herein contained shall affect any law in force in Bangladesh, and not hereby expressly repealed, by which any contract is required to be made in writing or in the presence of witnesses, or any law relating to the registration of documents.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Who are competent to contract</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">11. Every person is competent to contract who is of the age of majority according to the law to which he is subject, and who is of sound mind, and is not disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is subject.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What is a sound mind for the purposes of contracting</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">12. A person is said to be of sound mind for the purpose of making a contract if, at the time when he makes it, he is capable of understanding it and of forming a rational judgment as to its effect upon his interests.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A person who is usually of unsound mind, but occasionally of sound mind, may make a contract when he is of sound mind.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A person who is usually of sound mind, but occasionally of unsound mind, may not make a contract when he is of unsound mind.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A patient in a lunatic asylum, who is at intervals of sound mind, may contract during those intervals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A sane man, who is delirious from fever or who is so drunk that he cannot understand the terms of a contract or form a rational judgment as to its effect on his interests, cannot contract whilst such delirium or drunkenness lasts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"Consent” defined</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">13. Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"Free consent" defined</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">14. Consent is said to be free when it is not caused by-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(1) coercion, as defined in section 15, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) undue influence, as defined in section 16,or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) fraud, as defined in section 17, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(4) misrepresentation, as defined in section 18, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(5) mistake, subject to the provisions of sections 20, 21 and 22.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Consent is said to be so caused when it would not have been given but for the existence of such coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"Coercion" defined</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">15. "Coercion" is the committing, or threatening to commit, any act forbidden by the Penal Code or the unlawful detaining or threatening to detain, any property, to the prejudice of any person whatever, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation - It is immaterial whether the Penal Code is or is not in force in the place where the coercion is employed.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A, on board an English ship on the high seas, causes B to enter into an agreement by an act amounting to criminal intimidation under the Penal Code.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A afterwards sues B for breach of contract at Chittagong.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A has employed coercion, although his act is not an offence by the law of England, and although section 506 of the Penal Code was not in force at the time when or place where the act was done.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"Undue influence" defined</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">16.(1) A contract is said to be induced by "undue influence" where the relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other and uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing principle, a person is deemed to be in a position to dominate the will of another-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) where he holds a real or apparent authority over the other or where he stands in a fiduciary relation to the other; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) where he makes a contract with a person whose mental capacity is temporarily or permanently affected by reason of age, illness, or mental or bodily distress.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) Where a person who is in a position to dominate the will of another, enters into a contract with him, and the transaction appears, on the face of it or on the evidence adduced, to be unconscionable, the burden of proving that such contract was not induced by undue influence shall lie upon the person in a position to dominate the will of the other.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing in this sub-section shall affect the provisions of section 111 of the Evidence Act, 1872.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A having advanced money to his son, B, during his minority, upon B's coming of age obtains, by misuse of parental influence, a bond from B for a greater amount than the sum due in respect of the advance. A employs undue influence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A, a man enfeebled by disease or age, is induced, by B's influence over him as his medical attendant, to agree to pay B an unreasonable sum for his professional services. B employs undue influence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) A, being in debt to B, the money-lender of his village, contracts a fresh loan on terms which appear to be unconscionable. It lies on B to prove that the contract was not induced by undue influence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(d) A applies to a banker for a loan at a time when there is stringency in the money market. The banker declines to make the loan except at an unusually high rate of interest. A accepts the loan on these terms. This is a transaction in the ordinary course of business, and the contract is not induced by undue influence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"Fraud" defined</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">17. "Fraud" means and includes any of the following acts committed by a party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agent, with intent to deceive another party thereto or his agent, or to induce him to enter into the contract:-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(1) the suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to be true;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) the active concealment of a fact by one having knowledge or belief of the fact;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) a promise made without any intention of performing it;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(4) any other act fitted to deceive;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(5) any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Explanation</b> – Mere silence as to facts likely to affect the willingness of a person to enter into a contract is not fraud, unless the circumstances of the case are such that, regard being had to them, it is the duty of the person keeping silence to speak, or unless his silence is, in itself, equivalent to speech.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A sells, by auction, to B, a horse which A knows to be unsound. A says nothing to B about the horse's unsoundness. This is not fraud in A.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) B is A's daughter and has just come of age. Here, the relation between the parties would make it A's duty to tell B if the horse is unsound.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) B says to A-"If you do not deny it, I shall assume that the horse is sound." A says nothing. Here, A's silence is equivalent to speech.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(d) A and B, being traders, enter upon a contract. A has private information of a change in prices which would affect B's willingness to proceed with the contract. A is not bound to inform B.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"Misrepresentation" defined</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">18. “Misrepresentation" means and includes–</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(1) the positive assertion, in a manner not warranted by the information of the person making it, of that which is not true, though he believes it to be true;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) any breach of duty which, without an intent to deceive, gains an advantage to the person committing it, or any one claiming under him, by misleading another to his prejudice or to the prejudice of any one claiming under him;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) causing, however innocently, a party to an agreement to make a mistake as to the substance of the thing which is the subject of the agreement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Viodability of agreements without free consent</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">19. When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract viodable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A party to a contract, whose consent was caused by fraud or misrepresentation, may, if he thinks fit, insist that the contract shall be performed, and that he shall be put in the position in which he would have been if the representations made had been true.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Exception.</b>–If such consent was caused by misrepresenta-tion or by silence, fraudulent within the meaning of section 17, the contract, nevertheless, is not voidable, if the party whose consent was so caused had the means of discovering the truth with ordinary diligence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Explanation</b> – A fraud or misrepresentation which did not cause the consent to a contract of the party on whom such fraud was practised, or to whom such misrepresentation was made, does not render a contract voidable.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A, intending to deceive B, falsely represents that five hundred maunds of indigo are made annually at A's factory, and thereby induces B to buy the factory. The contract is voidable at the option of B.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A, by a misrepresentation, leads B erroneously to believe that five hundred maunds of indigo are made annually at A's factory. B examines the accounts of the factory, which show that only four hundred maunds of indigo have been made. After this B buys the factory. The contract is not voidable on account of A's misrepresentation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) A fraudulently informs B that A's estate is free from encumbrance. B thereupon buys the estate. The estate is subject to a mortgage. B may either avoid the contract, or may insist on its being carried out and the mortgage-debt redeemed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(d) B, having discovered a vein of ore on the estate of A, adopts means to conceal, and does conceal, the existence of the ore from A. Through A's ignorance B is enabled to buy the estate at an under-value. The contract is voidable at the option of A.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(e) A is entitled to succeed to an estate at the death of B; B dies: C, having received intelligence of B's death, prevents the intelligence reaching A, and thus induces A to sell him his interest in the estate. The sale is voidable at the option of A.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Power to set aside contract induced by undue influence</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">2[ 19A. When consent to an agreement is caused by undue influence, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any such contract may be set aside either absolutely or, if the party who was entitled to avoid it has received any benefit thereunder, upon such terms and conditions as to the Court may seem just.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A's son has forged B's name to a promissory note. B, under threat of prosecuting A's son, obtains a bond from A for the amount of the forged note. If B sues on this bond, the Court may set the bond aside.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A, a money-lender, advances Taka 100 to B, an agriculturist, and, by undue influence, induces B to execute a bond for Taka 200 with interest at 6 per cent per month. The Court may set the bond aside, ordering B to repay the Taka 100 with such interest as may seem just.]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Agreement void where both parties are under mistake as to matter of fact</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">20. Where both the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is void.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Explanation</b> - An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject-matter of the agreement is not to be deemed a mistake as to a matter of fact.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A agrees to sell to B a specific cargo of goods supposed to be on its way from England to 3[ Chittagong]. It turns out that, before the day of the bargain, the ship conveying the cargo had been cast away and the goods lost. Neither party was aware of the facts. The agreement is void.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A agrees to buy from B a certain horse. It turns out that the horse was dead at the time of the bargain, though neither party was aware of the fact. The agreement is void.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) A, being entitled to an estate for the life of B, agrees to sell it to C. B was dead at the time of the agreement, but both parties were ignorant of the fact. The agreement is void.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Effect of mistakes as to law</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">21. A contract is not voidable because it was caused by a mistake as to any law in force in Bangladesh; but a mistake as to a law not in force in Bangladesh has the same effect as a mistake of fact.</p>4[ * * *]<p align="center"><i>Illustration</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A and B make a contract grounded on the erroneous belief that a particular debt is barred by the Bangladesh Law of Limitation: the contract is not voidable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Contract caused by mistake of one party as to matter of fact</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">22. A contract is not voidable merely because it was caused by one of the parties to it being under a mistake as to a matter of fact.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What considerations and objects are lawful and what not</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">23. The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless- it is forbidden by law; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">is fraudulent; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">involves or implies injury to the person or property of another; or the Court regards it as immoral, or opposed to public policy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In each of these cases, the consideration or object of an agreement is said to be unlawful. Every agreement of which the object or consideration is unlawful is void.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A agrees to sell his house to B for 10,000 Taka. Here B's promise to pay the sum of 10,000 Taka is the consideration for A's promise to sell the house, and A's promise to sell the house is the consideration for B's promise to pay the 10,000 Taka. These are lawful considerations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A promises to pay B 1,000 Taka at the end of six months; if C, who owes that sum to B, fails to pay it. B promises to grant time to C accordingly. Here the promise of each party is the consideration for the promise of the other party and they are lawful considerations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) A promises, for a certain sum paid to him by B, to make good to B the value of his ship if it is wrecked on a certain voyage. Here A's promise is the consideration for B's payment and B's payment is the consideration for A's promise and these are lawful considerations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(d) A promises to maintain B's child and B's promises to pay A 1,000 Taka yearly for the purpose. Here the promise of each party is the consideration for the promise of the other party. They are lawful considerations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(e) A, B and C enter into an agreement for the division among them of gains acquired, or to be acquired, by them by fraud. The agreement is void, as its object is unlawful.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(f) A promises to obtain for B an employment in the public service, and B promises to pay 1,000 Taka to A. The agreement is void, as the consideration for it is unlawful.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(g) A, being agent for a landed proprietor, agrees for money, without the knowledge of his principal, to obtain for B a lease of land belonging to his principal. The agreement between A and B is void, as it implies a fraud by concealment by A, on his principal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(h) A promises B to drop a prosecution which he has instituted against B for robbery, and B promises to restore the value of the things taken. The agreement is void, as its object is unlawful.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(i) A's estate is sold for arrears of revenue under the provisions of an Act of the Legislature, by which the defaulter is prohibited from purchasing the estate. B, upon an understanding with A, becomes the purchaser, and agrees to convey the estate to A upon receiving from him the price which B has paid. The agreement is void, as it renders the transaction, in effect, a purchase by the defaulter, and would so defeat the object of the law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(j) A, who is B's mukhtar, promises to exercise his influence, as such, with B in favour of C, and C promises to pay 1,000 Taka to A. The agreement is void, because it is immoral.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(k) A agrees to let her daughter to hire to B for concubinage. The agreement is void, because it is immoral, though the letting may not be punishable under the Penal Code.</p><p align="center"><i>Void Agreements</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Agreements void, if considerations and objects unlawful in part</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">24.

A dies before the day. The contract cannot be enforced either by A's representatives or by B.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Effect of refusal to accept offer of performance</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">38. Where a promisor has made an offer of performance to the promisee, and the offer has not been accepted, the promisor is not responsible for non-performance, nor does he thereby lose his rights under the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Every such offer must fulfil the following conditions:–</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(1) it must be unconditional:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) it must be made at a proper time and place, and under such circumstances that the person to whom it is made may have a reasonable opportunity of ascertaining that the person by whom it is made is able and willing there and then to do the whole of what he is bound by his promise to do:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) if the offer is an offer to deliver anything to the promisee, the promisee must have a reasonable opportunity of seeing that the thing offered is the thing which the promisor is bound by his promise to deliver.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">An offer to one of several joint promisees has the same legal consequences as an offer to all of them.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustration</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A contracts to deliver to B at his warehouse, on the 1st March, 1873, 100 bales of cotton of a particular quality.

When a party to a contract has refused to perform, or disabled himself from performing his promise in its entirety, the promisee may put an end to the contract, unless he has signified, by words or conduct, his acquiescence in its continuance.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A, a singer, enters into a contract with B, the manager of a theatre, to sing at his theater two nights in every week during the next two months, and B engages to pay her 100 Taka for each nights performance.

B has signified his acquiescence in the continuance of the contract, and cannot now put an end to it, but is entitled to compensation for the damage sustained by him through A's failure to sing on the sixth night.</p><p align="center"><i>By whom Contracts must be performed</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Person by whom promise is to be performed</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">40. If it appears from the nature of the case that it was the intention of the parties to any contract that any promise contained in it should be performed by the promisor himself, such promise must be performed by the promisor. In other cases, the promisor or his representatives may employ a competent person to perform it.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A promises to pay B a sum of money. A may perform this promise, either by personally paying the money to B or by causing it to be paid to B by another; and, if A dies before the time appointed for payment, his representatives must perform the promise, or employ some proper person to do so.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A promises to paint a picture for B. A must perform this promise personally.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Effect of accepting performance from third person</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">41. When a promisee accepts performance of the promise from a third person, he cannot afterwards enforce it against the promisor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Devolution of joint liabilities</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">42. When two or more persons have made a joint promise, then, unless a contrary intention appears by the contract, all such persons during their joint lives, and after the death of any of them his representative jointly with the survivor or survivors, and after the death of the last survivor, the representatives of all jointly, must fulfil the promise.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Any one of joint promisors may be compelled to perform Each promisor may compel contribution Sharing of loss by default in contribution</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">43.

A and B are compelled to pay the whole sum. They are entitled to recover it from C.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Effect of release of one joint promisor</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">44. Where two or more persons have made a joint promise, a release of one of such joint promisors by the promisee does not discharge the other joint promisor or joint promisors; neither does it free the joint promisors so released from responsibility to the other joint promisor or joint promisors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Devolution of joint rights</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">45. When a person has made a promise to two or more persons jointly, then, unless a contrary intention appears from the contract, the right to claim performance rests, as between him and them, with them during their joint lives, and, after the death of any of them, with the representative of such deceased person jointly with the survivor or survivors, and, after the death of the last survivor, with the representatives of all jointly.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustration</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A, in consideration of 5,000 Taka lent to him by B and C, promises B and C jointly to repay them that sum with interest on a day specified. B dies. The right to claim performance rests with B's representative jointly with C during C's life, and after the death of C with the representatives of B and C jointly.</p><p align="center"><i>Time and Place for Performance</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Time for performance of promise where no application is to be made and no time is specified</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">46. Where, by the contract, a promisor is to perform his promise without application by the promisee, and no time for performance is specified, the engagement must be performed within a reasonable time. Explanation – The question "what is a reasonable time" is, in each particular case, a question of fact.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Time and place for performance of promise where time is specified and no application to be made</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">47. When promise is to be performed on a certain day, and the promisor has undertaken to perform it without application by the promisee, the promisor may perform it at any time during the usual hours of business on such day and at the place at which the promise ought to be performed.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustration</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A promises to deliver goods at B's warehouse on the first January. On that day A brings the goods to B's warehouse, but after the usual hour for closing it, and they are not received. A has not performed his promise.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Application for performance on certain day to be at proper time and place</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">48. When a promise is to be performed on a certain day, and the promisor has not undertaken to perform it without application by the promisee, it is the duty of the promisee to apply for performance at a proper place and within the usual hours of business.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Explanation</b> – The question "what is a proper time and place" is, in each particular case, a question of fact.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Place for performance of promise were no application to be made and no place fixed for performance</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">49. When a promise is to be performed without application by the promisee, and no place is fixed for the performance of it, it is the duty of the promisor to apply to the promisee to appoint a reasonable place for the performance of the promise, and to perform it at such place.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustration</i></p>A undertakes to deliver a thousand maunds of jute to B on a fixed day. A must apply to B to appoint a reasonable place for the purpose of receiving it, and must deliver it to him at such place.<b>Performance in manner or at time prescribed or sanctioned by promisee</b>50. The performance of any promise may be made in any manner, or at any time which the promisee prescribes or sanctions.<p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) B awes A 2,000 Taka. A desires B to pay the amount to A's account with C, a banker. B, who also banks with C, orders the amount to be transferred from his account to A's credit, and this is done by C. Afterwards, and before A knows of the transfer, C fails. There has been a good payment by B.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A and B are mutually indebted. A and B settle an account by setting off one item against another, and B pays A the balance found to be due from him upon such settlement. This amounts to a payment by A and B, respectively, of the sums which they owed to each other.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) A owes B 2,000 Taka. B accepts some of A's goods in reduction of the debt.

The debt is discharged as soon as B puts into the post a letter containing the note duly addressed to A.</p><p align="center"><i>Performance of Reciprocal Promises</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Promisor not bound to perform, unless reciprocal promisee ready and willing to perform</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">51. When a contract consists of reciprocal promises to be simultaneously performed, no promisor need perform his promise unless the promisee is ready and willing to perform his reciprocal promise.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A and B contract that A shall deliver goods to B to be paid for by B on delivery.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A need not deliver the goods, unless B is ready and willing to pay for the goods on delivery.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">B need not pay for the goods, unless A is ready and willing to deliver them on payment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A and B contract that A shall deliver goods to B at a price to be paid by installments, the first installment to be paid on delivery.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A need not deliver, unless B is ready and willing to pay the first installment on delivery.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">B need not pay the first installment, unless A is ready and willing to deliver the goods on payment of the first installment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Order of performance of reciprocal promises</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">52. Where the order in which reciprocal promises are to be performed is expressly fixed by the contract, they shall be performed in that order; and, where the order is not expressly fixed by the contract, they shall be performed in that order which the nature of the transaction requires.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A and B contract that A shall build a house for B at a fixed price. A's promise to build the house must be performed before B's promise to pay for it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A and B contract that A shall make over his stock-in-trade to B at a fixed price, and B promises to give security for the payment of the money. A's promise need not be performed until the security is given, for the nature of the transaction requires that A should have security before he delivers up his stock.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Liability of party preventing event on which the contract is to take effect</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">53. When a contract contains reciprocal promises, and one party to the contract prevents the other from performing his promise, the contract becomes voidable at the option of the party so prevented; and he is entitled to compensation from the other party for any loss which he may sustain in consequence of the non-performance of the contract.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustration</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A and B contract that B shall execute certain work for A for a thousand Taka. B is ready and willing to execute the work accordingly, but A prevents him from doing so. The contract is voidable at the option of B; and, if he elects to rescind it, he is entitled to recover from A compensation for any loss which he has incurred by its non-performance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Effect of default as to that promise which should be first performed, in contract consisting of reciprocal promises</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">54. When a contract consists of reciprocal promises, such that one of them cannot be performed, or that its performance cannot be claimed till the other has been performed, and the promisor of the promise last mentioned fails to perform it, such promisor cannot claim the performance of the reciprocal promise, and must make compensation to the other party to the contract for any loss which such other party may sustain by the non-performance of the contract.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A hires B's ship to take in and convey, from Chittagong to the Mauritius, a cargo to be provided by A, B receiving a certain freight for its conveyance. A does not provide any cargo for the ship. A cannot claim the performance of B's promise, and must make compensation to B for the loss which B sustains by the non-performance of the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A contracts with B to execute certain builder's work for a fixed price, B supplying the scaffolding and timber necessary for the work. B refuses to furnish any scaffolding or timber, and the work cannot be executed. A need not execute the work, and B is bound to make compensation to A for any loss caused to him by the non-performance of the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) A contracts with B to deliver to him, at a specified price, certain merchandise on board a ship which cannot arrive for a month, and B engages to pay for the merchandise within a week from the date of the contract. B does not pay within the week. A's promise to deliver need not be performed, and B must make compensation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(d) A promises B to sell him one hundred bales of merchandise, to be delivered next day, and B promises A to pay for them within a month. A does not deliver according to his promise. B's promise to pay need not be performed, and A must make compensation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Effect of failure to perform at fixed time, in contract in which time is essential</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">55. When a party to a contract promises to do a certain thing at or before a specified time, or certain things at or before a specified times, and fails to do any such thing at or before the specified time, the contract, or so much of it as has not been performed, becomes voidable at the option of the promisee, if the intention of the parties was that time should be of the essence of the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Effect of such failure when time is not essential</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If it was not the intention of the parties that time should be of the essence of the contract, the contract does not become voidable by the failure to do such thing at or before the specified time; but the promisee is entitled to compensation from the promisor for any loss occasioned to him by such failure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Effect of acceptance of performance at time other than that agreed upon</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If, in case of a contract voidable on account of the promisor's failure to perform his promise at the time agreed, the promisee accepts performance of such promise at any time other than that agreed, the promisee cannot claim compensation for any loss occasioned by the non-performance of the promise at the time agreed, unless, at the time of such acceptance he gives notice to the promisor of his intention to do so.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Agreement to do impossible act</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">56. An agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Contract to do act afterwards becoming impossible or unlawful</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A contract to do an act which, after the contract is made, becomes impossible, or, by reason of some event which the promissor could not prevent, unlawful, becomes void when the act becomes impossible or unlawful.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Compensation for loss through non-performance of act known to be impossible or unlawful</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where one person has promised to do something which he knew, or, with reasonable diligence, might have known, and which the promisee did not know to be impossible or unlawful, such promisor must make compensation to such promisee for any loss which such promisee sustains through the non-performance of the promise.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A agrees with B to discover treasure by magic.
