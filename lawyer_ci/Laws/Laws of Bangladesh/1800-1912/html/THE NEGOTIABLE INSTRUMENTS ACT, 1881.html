The instruments respectively marked (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) are not promissory notes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Bill of exchange”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. A “bill of exchange” is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order, signed by the maker, directing a certain person to pay on demand or at fixed or determinable future time a certain sum of money only to, or to the order of, a certain person or to the bearer of the instrument.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A promise or order to pay is not “conditional”, within the meaning of this section and section 4, by reason of the time for payment of the amount or any instalment thereof being expressed to be on the lapse of a certain period after the occurrence of a specified event which, according to the ordinary expectation of mankind, is certain to happen, although the time of its happening may be uncertain.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The sum payable may be “certain,” within the meaning of this section and section 4, although it includes future interest or is payable at an indicated rate of exchange, or is payable at the current rate of exchange, and although it is to be paid in stated instalments and contains a provision that on default of payment of one or more instalments or interest, the whole or the unpaid balance shall become due.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where the person intended can reasonably be ascertained from the promissory note or the bill of exchange, he is a “certain person” within the meaning of this section and section 4, although he is misnamed or designated by description only.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">An order to pay out of a particular fund is not unconditional within the meaning of this section; but an unqualified order to pay, coupled with-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) an indication of a particular fund out of which the drawee is to reimburse himself or a particular account to be debited to the amount, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) a statement of the transaction which gives rise to the note or bill, is unconditional.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where the payee is a fictitious or non-existing person the bill of exchange may be treated as payable to bearer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Cheque”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. A “cheque” is a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and not expressed to be payable otherwise than on demand.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Drawer” “Drawee” “Drawee in case of need” “Acceptor” “Acceptor for honour” “Payee”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">7. The maker of a bill of exchange or cheque is called the “drawer;” the person thereby directed to pay is called the “drawee.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When in the bill or in any indorsement thereon the name of any person is given in additional to the drawee to be resorted to in case of need, such person is called a “drawee in case of need.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">After the drawee of a bill has signed his assent upon the bill, or, if there are more parts thereof than one, upon one of such parts, and delivered the same, or given notice of such signing to the holder or to some person on his behalf, he is called the “acceptor”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When a bill of exchange has been noted or protested for non-acceptance or for better security, and any person accepts it supra protest for honour of the drawer or of any one of the indorsers, such person is called an “acceptor for honour.” “Acceptor for honour”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The person named in the instrument, to whom or to whose order the money is by the instrument directed to be paid, is called the “payee”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Holder”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Payee”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">8. The “holder” of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque means the payee or indorsee who is in possession of it or the bearer thereof but does not include a beneficial owner claiming through a benamidar. “Holder”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation - Where the note, bill or cheque is lost and not found again, or is destroyed, the person in possession of it or the bearer thereof at the time of such loss or destruction shall be deemed to continue to be its holder.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Holder in due course”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">9. “Holder” in due course” means any person who for consideration becomes the possessor of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque if payable to bearer, or the payee or indorsee thereof, if payable to order, before it became overdue, without notice that the title of the person from whom he derived his own title was defective. “Holder in</p><p style="text-align: justify;">due course”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation - For the purposes of this section the title of a person to a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is defective when he is not entitled to receive the amount due thereon by reason of the provisions of section 58.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Payment in due course”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">10. “Payment in due course” means payment in accordance with the apparent tenor of the instrument in good faith and without negligence to any person in possession thereof under circumstances which do not afford a reasonable ground for believing that he is not entitled to receive payment of the amount therein mentioned.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Inland instrument</p><p style="text-align: justify;">11. A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque drawn or made in Bangladesh, and made payable in, or drawn upon any person resident in, Bangladesh shall be deemed to be an inland instrument.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Foreign instrument</p><p style="text-align: justify;">12. Any such instrument not so drawn, made or made payable shall be deemed to be a foreign instrument.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Negotiable instrument”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">13.(1) A “negotiable instrument” means a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable either to order or to bearer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation (i) - A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is payable to order which is expressed to be so payable or which is expressed to be payable to a particular person, and does not contain words prohibiting transfer or indicating an intention that it shall not be transferable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation (ii) - A Promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is payable to bearer which is expressed to be so payable or on which the only or last indorsement is an indorsement in blank.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation (iii) - Where a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque either originally or by indorsement, is expressed to be payable to the order of a specified person, and not to him or his order, it is nevertheless payable to him or his order at his option.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) A negotiable instrument may be made payable to two or more payees jointly or it may be made payable in the alternative to one of two, or one or some of several payees.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Negotiation</p><p style="text-align: justify;">14. When a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is transferred to any person, so as to constitute that person the holder thereof, the instrument is said to be negotiated.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Indorsement</p><p style="text-align: justify;">15. When the maker or holder of a negotiable instrument signs the same, otherwise than as such maker, for the purpose of negotiation, on the back or face thereof or on a slip of paper annexed thereto, or so signs for the same purpose a stamped paper intended to be completed as a negotiable instrument, he is said to indorse the same, and is called the “indorser”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Indorsement “in blank” and “in full” “Indorsee”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">16. (1) If the indorser signs his name only, the indorsement is said to be “in blank”, and if he adds a direction to pay the amount mentioned in the instrument to, or to the order of, a specified person, the indorsement is said to be “in full”, and the person so specified is called the “indorsee” of the instrument.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) The provisions of this Act relating to a payee shall apply with the necessary modifications to an indorsee.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ambiguous instruments</p><p style="text-align: justify;">17. Where an instrument may be construed either as a promissory note or bill of exchange, the holder may at his election treat it as either, and the instrument shall be thenceforward treated accordingly.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where amount is stated differently in figures and words</p><p style="text-align: justify;">18. If the amount undertaken or ordered to be paid is stated differently in figures and in words, the amount stated in words shall be the amount undertaken or ordered to be paid:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that if the words, are ambiguous or uncertain, the amount may be ascertained by referring to the figures.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Instruments payable on demand</p><p style="text-align: justify;">19. A promissory note or bill of exchange is payable on demand,-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) where it is expressed to be so, or to be payable at sight or on presentment; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) where no time for payment is specified in it; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) where the note or bill accepted or indorsed after it is overdue, as regards the person accepting or indor-sing it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Inchoate stamped instruments</p><p style="text-align: justify;">20.(1) Where one person signs and delivers to another a paper stamped in accordance with the law relating to stamp duty chargeable on negotiable instruments, either wholly blank or having written thereon an incomplete negotiable instrument, in order that it may be made, or completed into a negotiable instrument he thereby gives prima facie authority to the person who receives that paper to make or complete it, as the case may be, into a negotiable instrument for the amount, if any, specified therein, or, where no amount is specified for any amount, not exceeding, in either case, the amount covered by the stamp.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) The person so signing shall, subject to the provisions of sub-section (3), be liable upon such instrument, in the capacity in which he signed the same, to any holder in due course, for the amount specified in the instrument or filled up therein:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that no person other than a holder in due course shall receive from the person so signing the paper anything in excess of the amount intended by him to be paid thereunder.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) In order that any such instrument may on completion be enforceable against any person who became a party thereto before such completion, it must be filled up within a reasonable time and strictly in accordance with the authority given:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that if any such instrument after completion is negotiated to a holder in due course, it shall be valid and effectual for all purposes in his hands, and he may enforce it as if it had been filled up within a reasonable time and strictly in accordance with the authority given.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“At sight” “On presentment” “After sight”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">21. The expression “after sight” means, in a promissory note, after presentment for sight, and, in a bill of exchange, after acceptance, or noting for non-acceptance, or protest for non-acceptance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When note or bill payable on demand is overdue</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4[ 21A. A promissory note or bill of exchange payable on demand shall be deemed to be overdue when it appears on the face of it to have been in circulation for an unreasonable length of time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A note or bill payable at a determinable future time</p><p style="text-align: justify;">21B. A promissory note or bill of exchange is payable at a determinable future time within the meaning of this Act if it is expressed to be payable-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) at a fixed time after date or sight; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) on or at a fixed time after the occurrence of a specified event which is certain to happen, though the time of its happening may be uncertain.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Anti-dating and post-dating</p><p style="text-align: justify;">21C. A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is not invalid by reason only that it is anti-dated or post-dated:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that anti-dating or post-dating does not involve any illegal or fraudulent purpose or transaction.]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Maturity” Days of grace</p><p style="text-align: justify;">22. The maturity of a promissory note or bill of exchange is the date at which it falls due.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Every promissory note or bill of exchange which is not expressed to be payable on demand, at sight or on presentment is at maturity on the third day after the day on which it is expressed to be payable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Calculating maturity of bill or note payable so many months after date or sight</p><p style="text-align: justify;">23. In calculating the date at which a promissory note or bill of exchange, made payable a stated number of months after date or after sight, or after a certain event, is at maturity, the period stated shall be held to terminate on the day of the month which corresponds with the day on which the instrument is dated, or presented for acceptance or sight, or noted for non-acceptance, or protested for non-acceptance, or the event happens, or, where the instrument is a bill of exchange made payable a stated number of months after sight and has been accepted for honour, with the day on which it was so accepted. If the month in which the period would terminate has no corresponding day, the period shall be held to terminate on the last day of such month.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Illustrations</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A negotiable instrument, dated 29th January, 1878, is made payable at one month after date.

The instrument is at maturity on the 3rd December, 1878.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Calculating maturity of bill or note payable so many days after date or sight</p><p style="text-align: justify;">24. In calculating the date at which a promissory note or bill of exchange made payable a certain number of days after date or after sight or after a certain event is at maturity, the day of the date, or of presentment for acceptance or sight, or of protest for non-acceptance, or on which the event happens, shall be excluded.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When day of maturity is a holiday</p><p style="text-align: justify;">25. When the day on which a promissory note or bill of exchange is at maturity is a public holiday, the instrument shall be deemed to be due on the next preceding business day.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation - The expression “public holiday” includes Sundays and the days declared by the Government, by notification in the official Gazette, to be public holidays.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CHAPTER III</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PARTIES TO NOTES, BILLS AND CHEQUES</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Capacity to make, etc, promissory notes, etc</p><p style="text-align: justify;">26. Every person capable of contracting, according to the law to which he is subject, may bind himself and be bound by the making, drawing, acceptance, indorsement, delivery and negotiation of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Minor</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where such an instrument is made, drawn or negotiated by a minor, the making, drawing or negotiation entitles the holder to receive payment of such instrument and to enforce it against any party thereto other than the minor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to empower a corporation to make, indorse or accept such instruments except in cases in which, under the law for the time being in force, they are so empowered.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Agency</p><p style="text-align: justify;">27. Every person capable of binding himself or of being bound, by the making, drawing, acceptance or negotiation of a negotiable instrument, may so bind himself or be bound by a duly authorised agent acting in his name.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A general authority to transact business and to receive and discharge debts does not confer upon an agent the power of accepting or indorsing bills of exchange so as to bind his principal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">An authority to draw bills of exchange does not of itself import an authority to indorse.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Authority of partner</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5[ 27A. A partner acting in the firm name may bind the firm by the making, drawing, acceptance or negotiation of a negotiable instrument to the extent authorised by law relating to partnership for the time being in force.]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Liability of agent signing</p><p style="text-align: justify;">28.(1) Where a person signs a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque without adding to his signature words indicating that he signs it as an agent for and on behalf of a principal or in a representative character, he is personally liable thereon but the mere addition to his signature of words describing him as an agent or as filling a representative character does not exempt him from personal liability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), any person signing a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque for and on behalf of the principal is not liable to a person who induces him to sign upon the belief that the principal alone would be held liable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Transferor by delivery and transferee</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6[ 28A.(1) Where the holder of a negotiable instrument payable to bearer negotiates it by delivery without indorsing it, he is called a “transferor by delivery”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) A transferor by delivery is not liable on the instrument.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) A transferor by delivery who negotiates a negotiable instrument thereby warrants to his immediate transferee, being a holder for consideration, that the instrument is what it purports to be, that he has a right to transfer it, and that at the time of transfer he is not aware of any defect which renders it valueless.]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Liability of legal representative signing</p><p style="text-align: justify;">29. A legal representative of a deceased person who signs his name to a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is liable personally thereon unless he expressly limits his liability to the extent of the assets received by him as such.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Signature essential to liability</p><p style="text-align: justify;">29A. No person is liable as maker, drawer, indorser or acceptor of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque who has not signed it as such:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that where a person signs any such instrument in a trade or assumed name he is liable thereon as if he had signed it in his own name.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Forged or unauthorised signature</p><p style="text-align: justify;">29B. Subject to the provisions of this Act, where a signature on a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is forged or placed thereon without the authority of the person whose signature it purports to be, the forged or unauthorised signature is wholly inoperative, and no right to retain the instrument or to give a discharge therefor or to enforce payment thereof against any party thereto can be acquired through or under that signature, unless the party against whom it is sought to retain or enforce payment of the instrument is precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that nothing in this section shall effect the ratification of an unauthorised signature not amounting to a forgery.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Stranger signing instrument presumed to be indorser</p><p style="text-align: justify;">29C. A person placing his signature upon a negotiable instrument otherwise than as maker, drawer or acceptor is presumed to be an indorser unless he clearly indicates by appropriate words his intention to be bound in some other capacity.]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Liability of drawer</p><p style="text-align: justify;">30.(1) (a) The drawer of a bill of exchange by drawing it, engages that on due presentment it shall be accepted and paid according to its tenor, and that if it be dishonoured, he will compensate the holder or any indorser who is compelled to pay it; and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) the drawer of a cheque by drawing it, engages that in the case of dishonour by the drawee he will compensate the holder:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that due notice of dishonour of the bill or cheque has been given to or received by the drawer as hereinafter provided.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) The drawee of a bill of exchange is not liable thereon until acceptance in the manner provided by this Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Liability of drawee of cheque</p><p style="text-align: justify;">31. The drawee of a cheque having sufficient funds of the drawer in his hands properly applicable to the payment of such cheque must pay the cheque when duly required so to do, and, in default of such payment, must compensate the drawer for any loss or damage caused by such default.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Liability of maker of note and acceptor of bill</p><p style="text-align: justify;">32.(1) In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the maker of a promissory note, by making it, and the acceptor before maturity of a bill of exchange by accepting it, engages that he will pay it according to the tenor of the note or his acceptance respectively, and in default of such payment, such maker or acceptor is bound to compensate any party to the note or bill or any loss or damage sustained by him and caused by such default.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) The acceptor of a bill of exchange at or after maturity, by accepting it, engages to pay the amount thereof to the holder on demand.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Only drawee can be acceptor except in need or for honour</p><p style="text-align: justify;">33. No person except the drawee of a bill of exchange, or all or some of several drawees, or a person named therein as a drawee in case of need, or an acceptor for honour, can bind himself by an acceptance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Acceptance by several drawees not partners</p><p style="text-align: justify;">34. Where there are several drawees of a bill of exchange who are not partners, each of them can accept it for himself, but none of them can accept it for another without his authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Liability of indorser</p><p style="text-align: justify;">35. In the absence of a contact to the contrary, the indorser of a negotiable instrument, by indorsing it, engages that on due presentment it shall be accepted and paid according to its tenor and that if it be dishonoured he will compensate the holder or subsequent indorser who is compelled to pay it for any loss or damage caused to him by such dishonour.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Every indorser after dishonour is liable as upon an instrument payable on demand.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Liability of prior parties to holder in due course</p><p style="text-align: justify;">36. Every prior party to a negotiable instrument is liable thereon to a holder in due course until the instrument is duly satisfied.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Maker, drawer and accept or principals</p><p style="text-align: justify;">37. The maker of a promissory note or cheque, the drawer of a bill of exchange until acceptance, and the acceptor are, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, respectively liable thereon as principal debtors, and the other parties thereto are liable thereon as sureties for the maker, drawer or acceptor, as the case may be.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Prior party a principal in respect of each subsequent party</p><p style="text-align: justify;">38. As between the parties so liable as sureties, each prior party is, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, also liable thereon as a principal debtor in respect of each subsequent party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Illustration</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A draws a bill payable to his own order on B who accepts. A afterwards indorses the bill to C, C to D, and D to E. As between E and B, B is the principal debtor, and A, C and D are his sureties. As between E and A, A is the principal debtor and C and D are his sureties. As between E and C, C is the principal debtor and D is his surety.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Liability of accommodation party and position of accommodation party</p><p style="text-align: justify;">7[ 38A.(1) An accommodation party is liable on a negotiable instrument to a holder in due course, notwithstanding that when such holder took the instrument he knew such party to be an accommodation party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) An accommodation party to a negotiable instrument, if he has paid the amount thereof, is entitled to recover such amount from the party accommodated.]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Suretyship</p><p style="text-align: justify;">39. When the holder of an accepted bill of exchange enters into any contract with the acceptor which, under section 134 or 135 of the Contract Act, 1872, would discharge the other parties, the holder may expressly reserve his right to charge the other parties, and in such case they are not discharged.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Discharge of indorser’s liability</p><p style="text-align: justify;">40. When the holder of a negotiable instrument, without the consent of the indorser, destroys or impairs the indorser's remedy against a prior party, the indorser is discharged from liability to the holder to the same extent as if the instrument had been paid at maturity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Illustration</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A is the holder of a bill of exchange made payable to the order of B, which contains the following indorsements in blank:-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">First indorsement, “B”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Second indorsement, “Peter Williams.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Third indorsement, “Wright &amp; Co.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Fourth indorsement, “John Rozario.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This bill A puts in suit against John Rozario and strike out, without John Rozario's consent, the indorsements by Peter Williams, and Wright &amp; Co.

An acceptor of a bill of exchange already indorsed is not relieved from liability by reason that such indorsement is forged, if he knew or had reason to believe the indorsement to be forged when he accepted the bill.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Acceptance of bill drawn in fictitious name</p><p style="text-align: justify;">42. An acceptor of a bill of exchange drawn in a fictitious name and payable to the drawer's order is not, by reason that such name is fictitious, relieved from liability to any holder in due course claiming under an indorsement by the same hand as the drawer's signature, and purporting to be made by the drawer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Negotiable instrument made, etc, without consideration</p><p style="text-align: justify;">43. A negotiable instrument made, drawn, accepted, indorsed or transferred without consideration, or for a consideration which fails, creates no obligation of payment between the parties to the transaction. But if any such party has transferred the instrument with or without indorsement to a holder for consideration, such holder, and every subsequent holder deriving title from him, may recover the amount due on such instrument from the transferor for consideration or any prior party thereto.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Exception I - No party for whose accommodation a negotiable instrument has been made, drawn, accepted or indorsed can, if he have paid the amount thereof, recover thereon such amount from any person who became a party to such instrument for his accommodation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Exception II - No party to the instrument who has induced any other party to make, draw, accept, indorse or transfer the same to him for a consideration which he has failed to pay or perform in full shall recover thereon an amount exceeding the value of the consideration (if any) which he has actually paid or performed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Partial absence or failure of money-consideration</p><p style="text-align: justify;">44. When the consideration for which a person signed a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque consisted of money, and was originally absent in part or has subsequently failed in part, the sum which a holder standing in immediate relation with such signer is entitled to receive from him is proportionally reduced.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation - The drawer of a bill of exchange stands in immediate relation with the acceptor. The maker of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque stands in immediate relation with the payee, and the indorser with his indorsee. Other signers may by agreement stand in immediate relation with a holder.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Illustration</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A draws a bill on B for Taka 500 payable to the order of A. B accepts the Bill, but subsequently dishonours it by non-payment. A sues B on the bill. B proves that it was accepted for value as to Taka 400, and as an accommodation to the plaintiff as to the residue. A can only recover Taka 400.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Partial failure of consideration not consisting of money</p><p style="text-align: justify;">45. Where a part of the consideration for which a person signed a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque, though not consisting of money, is ascertainable in money without collateral inquiry, and there has been a failure of that part, the sum which a holder standing in immediate relation with such signer is entitled to receive from him is proportionally reduced.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Holder’s right to duplicate of lost bill</p><p style="text-align: justify;">8[ 45A. Where a bill of exchange has been lost before it is overdue, the person who was the holder of it may apply to the drawer to give him another bill of the same tenor, giving security to the drawer, if required, to indemnify him against all persons whatever in case the bill alleged to have been lost shall be found again.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the drawer on request as aforesaid refuses to give such duplicate bill, he may be compelled to do so.]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">OF NEGOTIATION</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Delivery</p><p style="text-align: justify;">46. The making, acceptance or indorsement of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is completed by delivery, actual or constructive.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As between parties standing in immediate relation, delivery to be effectual must be made by the party making, accepting or indorsing the instrument or by a person authorised by him in that behalf.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As between such parties and any holder of the instrument other than a holder in due course, it may be shown that the instrument was delivered conditionally or for a special purpose only, and not for the purpose of transferring absolutely the property therein.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable to bearer is negotiable by the delivery thereof.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable to order is negotiable by the holder by indorsement and delivery thereof.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Negotiation by delivery</p><p style="text-align: justify;">47. Subject to the provisions of section 58, a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable to bearer is negotiable by delivery thereof.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Exception - A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque delivered on condition that it is not to take effect except in a certain event is not negotiable (except in the hands of a holder for value without notice of the condition) unless such event happens.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Illustrations</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A, the holder of a negotiable instrument payable to bearer, delivers it to B's agent to keep for B. The instrument has been negotiated.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A, the holder of a negotiable instrument payable to bearer, which is in the hands of A's banker, who is at the time the banker of B, directs the banker to transfer the instrument to B's credit in the banker's account with B. The banker does so, and accordingly now possesses the instrument as B's agent. The instrument has been negotiated, and B has become the holder of it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Negotiation by indorsement</p><p style="text-align: justify;">48. Subject to the provisions of section 58, a promissory note, bill if exchange or cheque payable to order is negotiable by the holder by indorsement and delivery thereof.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Conversion of indorsement in blank into indorsement in full</p><p style="text-align: justify;">49. When a negotiable instrument has been indorsed in blank, any holder may, without signing his own name, convert the blank indorsement into an indorsement in full by writing above the indorser's signature a direction to pay the amount to or to the order of himself or some other person; and the holder does not thereby incur the responsibility of an indorser.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Effect of indorsement</p><p style="text-align: justify;">50.(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act relating to restrictive, conditional and qualified indorsement, the indorsement of a negotiable instrument followed by delivery transfers to the indorsee the property therein with the right of further negotiation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) An indorsement is restrictive which either-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) restricts or excludes the right to further negotiate the instrument; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) constitutes the indorsee an agent of the indorser to indorse the instrument or to receive its contents for the indorser or for some other specified person:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that the mere absence of words implying right to negotiate does not make the indorsement restrictive.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Illustrations</p><p style="text-align: justify;">B signs the following indorsements on different negotiable instruments payable to bearer:-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) "Pay the contents to C only."</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) "Pay C for my use."</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) “Pay C or order for the account of B.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(d) “The within must be credited to C.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These indorsements exclude the right of further negotiation by C.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(e) “Pay C.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(f) “Pay C value in account with the Oriental Bank.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(g) “Pay the contents to C, being part of the consideration in a certain deed of assignment executed by C to the indorser and others.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These indorsements do not exclude the right of further negotiation by C.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Who may negotiate</p><p style="text-align: justify;">51. Every sole maker, drawer, payee or indorsee, or all of several joint makers, drawers, payees or indorsees, of a negotiable instrument may, if the negotiability of such instrument has not been restricted or excluded as mentioned in section 50, indorse and negotiate the same.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation - Nothing in this section enables a maker or drawer to indorse or negotiate an instrument, unless he is in lawful possession or is holder thereof; or enables a payee or indorsee to indorse or negotiate an instrument, unless he is holder thereof.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Illustration</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A bill is drawn payable to A or order. A indorses it to B, the indorsement not containing the words “or order” or any equivalent words. B may negotiate the instrument.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Indorser who excludes his own liability or makes it conditional</p><p style="text-align: justify;">52. The indorser of a negotiable instrument may, by express words in the indorsement, exclude his own liability thereon, or make such liability or the right of the indorsee to receive the amount due thereon depend upon the happening of a specified event, although such event may never happen.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where an indorser so excludes his liability and afterwards becomes the holder of the instrument, all intermediate indorsers are liable to him. Where the right of an indorsee to receive the amount due on the negotiable instrument is made dependent in the aforesaid manner the condition is valid only as between the indorser and the indorsee.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where the indorsement of a negotiable instrument purports to be conditional, the payer may disregard the condition, and payment to the indorsee is valid whether the condition has been fulfilled or not.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Illustrations</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) The indorser of a negotiable instrument signs his name adding the words-“Without recourse”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Upon this indorsement he incurs no liability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A is the payee and holder of a negotiable instrument. Excluding personal liability by an indorsement “without recourse,” he transfers the instrument to B, and B indorses it to C, who indorses it to A. A is not only reinstated in his former rights, but has the rights of an indorsee against B and C.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Holder claiming through holder in due course</p><p style="text-align: justify;">53. (1) A holder who derives his title through a holder in due course, and who is not himself a party to any fraud or illegality affecting the negotiable instrument, has all the rights therein of that holder in due course as regards the acceptor and all parties to the instrument prior to that holder.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Where the title of the holder is defective,-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) if he negotiates the instrument to a holder in due course, that holder obtains a good and complete title to the instrument; and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) if he obtains payment of the instrument, the person who pays him in due course gets a valid discharge for the instrument.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rights of holder in due course</p><p style="text-align: justify;">9[ 53A. A holder in due course holds the negotiable instrument free from any defect of title of prior parties, and free from defences available to prior parties among themselves, and may enforce payment of the instrument for the full amount thereof against all parties liable thereon.]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Instrument indorsed in blank</p><p style="text-align: justify;">54. Subject to the provisions hereinafter contained as to crossed cheques, a negotiable instrument indorsed in blank is payable to the bearer thereof even although originally payable to order.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Conversion of indorsement in blank into indorsement in full</p><p style="text-align: justify;">55. If a negotiable instrument, after having been indorsed in blank, is indorsed in full, the amount of it cannot be claimed from the indorser in full, except by the person to whom it has been indorsed in full, or by one who derives title through such person.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Requisites of indorsement</p><p style="text-align: justify;">56.(1) Negotiation by indorsement must be of the entire instrument.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) An indorsement which purports to transfer to the indorsee only a part of the amount payable, or which purports to transfer the instrument to two or more indorsees severally, is not valid as a negotiation of the instrument; but where such amount has been paid in part, a note to that effect may be indorsed on the instrument, which may then be indorsed for the balance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Legal representative cannot by delivery only negotiate instrument indorsed by deceased</p><p style="text-align: justify;">57. The legal representative of a deceased person cannot negotiate by delivery only a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable to order and indorsed by the deceased but not delivered.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Negotiation of instrument of party already liable thereon</p><p style="text-align: justify;">10[ 57A. Where a negotiable instrument is negotiated back before maturity to the maker or drawer or a prior indorser or to the acceptor, such party may, subject to the provisions of this Act, re-issue and further negotiate the instrument, but he is not entitled to enforce payment of the instrument against any intervening party to whom he was previously liable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rights of holder</p><p style="text-align: justify;">57B. A holder may receive payment in due course under a negotiable instrument and further negotiate it in the manner provided by this Act; he may also sue on such instrument in his own name.]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Defective title</p><p style="text-align: justify;">58. When a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque has been lost or has been obtained from any maker, drawer, acceptor or holder thereof by means of an offence or fraud, or for an unlawful consideration, neither the person who finds or so obtains the instrument nor any possessor or indorsee who claims through such person is entitled to receive the amount due thereon from such maker, drawer, acceptor or holder, unless such possessor or indorsee is, or some person through whom he claims was, a holder thereof in due course.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Instrument acquired after dishonour or when overdue</p><p style="text-align: justify;">59. The holder of a negotiable instrument, who has acquired it after dishonour, whether by non-acceptance or non-payment, with notice thereof, or after maturity, has only, as against the other parties, the rights thereon of his transferor and is subject to the equities to which the transferor was subject at the time of acquisition by such holder:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Accommodation note or bill</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that any person who, in good faith and for consideration, becomes the holder, after maturity, of a promissory note or bill of exchange made, drawn or accepted without consideration, for the purpose of enabling some party thereto to raise money thereon, may recover the amount of the note or bill from any prior party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Illustration</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The acceptor of a bill of exchange, when he accepted it, deposited with the drawer certain goods as a collateral security for the payment of the bill, with power to the drawer to sell the goods and apply the proceeds in discharge of the bill if it were not paid at maturity. The bill not having been paid at maturity, the drawer sold the goods and retained the proceeds, but indorsed the bill to A. A's title is subject to the same objection as the drawer's title.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Instrument negotiable till payment or satisfaction</p><p style="text-align: justify;">60. A negotiable instrument may be negotiated (except by the maker, drawee or acceptor after maturity) until payment or satisfaction thereof by the maker, drawee or accept or at or after maturity, but not after such payment or satisfaction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CHAPTER V</p><p style="text-align: justify;">OF PRESENTMENT</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Presentment for acceptance</p><p style="text-align: justify;">61. A bill of exchange payable after sight must, if no time or place is specified therein for presentment, be presented to the drawee thereof for acceptance, if he can, after reasonable search, be found, by a person entitled to demand acceptance, within a reasonable time after it is drawn, and in business hours on a business day. In default of such presentment, no party thereto is liable thereon to the person making such default.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the drawee cannot, after reasonable search, be found, the bill is dishonoured.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the bill is directed to the drawee at a particular place, it must be presented at that place; and if at the due date for presentment he cannot, after reasonable search, be found there, the bill is dishonoured.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where authorised by agreement or usage, a presentment through the post office by means of a registered letter is sufficient.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Presentment of promissory note for sight</p><p style="text-align: justify;">62. A promissory note, payable at a certain period after sight, must be presented to the maker thereof for sight (if he can, after reasonable search, be found) by a person entitled to demand payment, within a reasonable time after it is made and in business hours on a business day. In default of such presentment, no party thereto is liable thereon to the person making such default.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Drawee’s time for deliberation</p><p style="text-align: justify;">63. The holder must, if so required by the drawee of a bill of exchange presented to him for acceptance, allow the drawee forty-eight hours (exclusive of public holidays) to consider whether he will accept it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Presentment for payment</p><p style="text-align: justify;">64. Subject to the provisions of section 76, promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques must be presented for payment to the maker, acceptor or drawee thereof respectively, by or on behalf of the holder as hereinafter provided. In default of such presentment, the other parties thereto are not liable thereon to such holder.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Exception - Where a promissory note is payable on demand and is not payable at a specified place, no presentment is necessary in order to charge the maker thereof nor is presentment necessary to charge the acceptor of a bill of exchange.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The provisions of this section are without prejudice to the provisions relating to presentment or acceptance in the case of a bill of exchange.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation - Where there are several persons, not being partners liable on the negotiable instrument, as makers, acceptors or drawees, as the case may be, and no place of payment is specified, presentment must be made to them all.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hours for presentment</p><p style="text-align: justify;">65. Presentment for payment must be made during the usual hours of business, and, if at a banker's within banking hours.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Presentment for payment of instrument payable after date or sight</p><p style="text-align: justify;">66. A promissory note or bill of exchange, made payable at a specified period after date or sight thereof, must be presented for payment at maturity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Presentment for payment of promissory note payable by instalments</p><p style="text-align: justify;">67. A Promissory note payable by instalments must be presented for payment on the third day after the date fixed for payment of each instalment; and non-payment on such presentment has the same effect as non-payment of a note at maturity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Presentment for payment of instrument payable at specified place and not elsewhere</p><p style="text-align: justify;">68. A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque made, drawn or accepted payable at a specified place and not elsewhere must, in order to charge any party thereto, be presented for payment at that place.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Instrument payable at specified place</p><p style="text-align: justify;">69. A promissory note or bill of exchange made, drawn or accepted payable at a specified place must, in order to charge the maker or drawer thereof, be presented for payment at that place.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Presentment where no exclusive place specified</p><p style="text-align: justify;">70. A promissory note or bill of exchange, not made payable as mentioned in sections 68 and 69, must be presented for payment at the address of the maker, acceptor or drawee given in the instrument, and if no such address is given at the place of business if known, or at the ordinary residence (if known), of the maker, drawee or acceptor thereof, as the case may be.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Presentment when maker, etc, has no known place of business or residence</p><p style="text-align: justify;">71. If the maker, drawee or acceptor of a negotiable instrument has no known place of business or residence, and no place is specified in the instrument for presentment for acceptance or payment, such presentment may be made to him in person wherever he can be found.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation - In this section and sections 68 and 69, “specified place” means a place sufficiently described so as to enable the person presenting the instrument to locate it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">What constitutes valid presentment and mode of presentment</p><p style="text-align: justify;">11[ 71A.(1) To constitute a valid presentment it shall be sufficient if instead of the original negotiable instrument a copy thereof certified to be true by the holder is delivered to the person liable thereon, either personally or by registered post or by other effective means.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) If, after such delivery, the person liable to pay so demands, the holder shall allow him to inspect the original negotiable instrument during the hours of business of the holder, and if the holder fails to do so within a reasonable time, the presentment shall be deemed to be invalid.]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Presentment of cheque to charge drawer</p><p style="text-align: justify;">72. Subject to the provisions of section 84, a cheque must, in order to charge the drawer, be presented at the bank upon which it is drawn before the relation between the drawer and his banker has been altered to the prejudice of the drawer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Presentment of cheque to charge any other person</p><p style="text-align: justify;">73. A cheque must, in order to charge any person except the drawer, be presented within a reasonable time after delivery thereof by such person.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Presentment of instrument payable on demand</p><p style="text-align: justify;">74. Subject to the provisions of section 31, a negotiable instrument payable on demand must be presented for payment within a reasonable time after it is received by the holder.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Presentment by or to agent, representative of deceased, or assignee of insolvent</p><p style="text-align: justify;">75. Presentment for acceptance or payment may be made to the duly authorised agent of the drawee, maker or acceptor, as the case may be, or, where the drawee, maker or acceptor has died, to his legal representative, or, where he has been declared an insolvent, to his assignee.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Excuse for delay in presentment for acceptance or payment</p><p style="text-align: justify;">12[ 75A. Delay in presentment for acceptance or payment is excused if the delay is caused by circumstances beyond the control of the holder, and not imputable to his default, misconduct or negligence. When the cause of delay ceases to operate, presentment must be made within a reasonable time.]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When presentment unnecessary</p><p style="text-align: justify;">76. No presentment for payment is necessary, and the instrument shall be deemed to be dishonoured at the due date for presentment, in any of the following cases:-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) if the maker, drawee or acceptor intentionally prevents the presentment of the instrument, or,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">if the instrument being payable at his place of business, he closes such place on a business day during the usual business hours, or,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">if the instrument being payable at some other specified place, neither he nor any person authorised to pay it attends at such place during the usual business hours, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">if the instrument not being payable at any specified place, he cannot after due search be found;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) as against any party sought to be charged therewith, if he has engaged to pay notwithstanding non-presentment;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) as against any party if, after maturity, with knowledge that the instrument has not been presented-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">he makes a part payment on account of the amount due on the instrument, or promises to pay the amount due thereon in whole or in part,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">or otherwise waives his right to take advantage of any default in presentment for payment;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(d) as against the drawer, if the drawer could not suffer damage from the want of such presentment;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(e) where the drawee is a fictitious person;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(f) as regards an indorser, where the negotiable instrument was made, drawn or accepted for the accommodation of that indorser and he had reason to expect that the instrument would not be paid if presented; and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(g) where, after the exercise of reasonable diligence, presentment as required by this Act cannot be effected.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation - The fact that holder has reason to believe that the negotiable instrument will, on presentment, be dishonoured does not dispense with the necessity for presentment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Liability of banker for negligently dealing with bill presented for payment</p><p style="text-align: justify;">77. When a bill of exchange accepted payable at a specified bank has been duly presented there for payment and dishonoured, if the banker so negligently or improperly keeps, deals with or delivers back such bill as to cause loss to the holder, he must compensate the holder for such loss.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CHAPTER VI</p><p style="text-align: justify;">OF PAYMENT AND INTEREST</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To whom payment should be made</p><p style="text-align: justify;">78. Subject to the provisions of section 82, clause (c), payment of the amount due on a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque must, in order to discharge the maker or acceptor, be made to the holder of the instrument.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Interest when rate specified or not specified</p><p style="text-align: justify;">79. Subject to the provisions of any law for the time being in force relating to the relief of debtors, and without prejudice to the provisions of section 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908,?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) when interest at a specified rate is expressly made payable on a promissory note or bill of exchange and no date is fixed from which interest is to be paid, interest shall be calculated at the rate specified, on the amount of the principal money due thereon, from the date of the note, or, in the case of a bill, from the date on which the amount becomes payable, until tender or realisation of such amount, or until the date of the institution of a suit to recover such amount;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) when a promissory note or bill of exchange is silent as regards interest or does not specify the rate of interest, interest on the amount of the principal money due thereon shall, notwithstanding any collateral agreement relating to interest between any parties to the instrument, be allowed and calculated at the rate of six per centum per annum from the date of the note, or, in the case of a bill, from the date on which the amount becomes payable, until tender or realisation of the amount due thereon, or until the date of the institution of a suit to recover such amount.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Interest when no rate specified</p><p style="text-align: justify;">80. When no rate of interest is specified in the instrument, interest on the amount due thereon shall, not-withstanding any agreement relating to interest between any parties to the instrument, be calculated at the rate of six per centum per annum from the date at which the same ought to have been paid by the party charged until tender or realisation of the amount due thereon, or until such date after the institution of a suit to recover such amount as the Court directs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation - When the party charged is the indorser of an instrument dishonoured by non-payment, he is liable to pay interest only from the time that he receives notice of the dishonour.</p><p popular-posts="" style="text-ali                      &lt;/div&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;                  &lt;/article&gt;                                    &lt;div class=" widget="" widget_categories=""></p><h3 class="widget-title"><span>Disclaimer:</span></h3><div class="widget-content" style="text-align:justify;"><p>The information contains in this web-site is prepared for educational purpose.
