In the following sections “transfer of property” means an act by which a living person conveys property, in present or in future, to one or more other living persons, or to himself, or to himself and one or more other living persons; and “to transfer property” is to perform such act.In this section “living person” includes a company or associations or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, but nothing herein contained shall affect any law for the time being in force relating to transfer of property to or by companies, associations or bodies of individuals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What may be transferred</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. Property of any kind may be transferred, except as otherwise provided by this Act or by any other law for the time being in force.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) The chance of an heir-apparent succeeding to an estate, the chance of a relation obtaining a legacy on the death of a kinsman, or any other mere possibility of a like nature, cannot be transferred.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A mere right of re-entry for breach of a condition subsequent cannot be transferred to any one except the owner of the property affected thereby.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) An easement cannot be transferred apart from the dominant heritage.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(d) An interest in property restricted in its enjoyment to the owner personally cannot be transferred by him.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(dd) A right to future maintenance, in whatsoever manner arising, secured or determined, cannot be transferred.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(e) A mere right to sue cannot be transferred.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(f) A public office cannot be transferred, nor can the salary of a public officer, whether before or after it has become payable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(g) Stipends allowed to military, naval, air-force and civil pensioners of the Government and political pensions cannot be transferred.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(h) No transfer can be made (1) in so far as it is opposed to the nature of the interest affected thereby, or (2) for an unlawful object or consideration within the meaning of section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872, or (3) to a person legally disqualified to be transferee.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(i) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise a tenant having an untrasnferable right of occupancy, the farmer of an estate in respect of which default has been made in paying revenue or the lessee of an estate under the management of a Court of Wards, to assign his interest as such tenant, farmer or lessee.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Persons competent to transfer</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">7. Every person competent to contract and entitled to transferable property, or authorised to dispose of transferable property not his own, is competent to transfer such property either wholly or in part, and either absolutely or conditionally, in the circumstances, to the extent and in the manner allowed and prescribed by any law for the time being in force.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Operation of transfer</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">8. Unless a different intention is expressed or necessarily implied, a transfer of property passes forthwith to the transferee all the interest which the transferor is then capable of passing in the property, and in the legal incidents thereof.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Such incidents include, where the property is land, the easements annexed thereto, the rents and profits thereof accruing after the transfer, and all things attached to the earth;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and, where the property is machinery attached to the earth, the moveable parts thereof;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and, where the property is a house, the easements annexed thereto, the rent thereof accruing after the transfer, and the locks, keys, bars, doors, windows, and all other things provided for permanent use therewith;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and, where the property is a debt or other actionable claim, the securities therefor (except where they are also for other debts or claims not transferred to the transferee), but not arrears of interest accrued before the transfer;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and, where the property is money or other property yielding income, the interest or income thereof accruing after the transfer takes effect.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Oral transfer</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">9. A transfer of property may be made without writing in every case in which a writing is not expressly required by law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Condition restraining alienation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">10. Where property is transferred subject to a condition or limitation absolutely restraining the transferee or any person claiming under him from parting with or disposing of his interest in the property, the condition or limitation is void, except in the case of a lease where the condition is for the benefit of the lessor or those claiming under him : Provided that property may be transferred to or for the benefit of a woman (not being a Hindu, 7[ Muslim] or Buddhist), so that she shall not have power during her marriage to transfer or charge the same or her beneficial interest therein.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Restriction repugnant to interest created</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">11. Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created absolutely in favour of any person, but the terms of the transfer direct that such interest shall be applied or enjoyed by him in a particular manner, he shall be entitled to receive and dispose of such interest as if there were no such direction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where any such direction has been made in respect of one piece of immoveable property for the purpose of securing the beneficial enjoyment of another piece of such property, nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect any right which the transferor may have to enforce such direction or any remedy which he may have in respect of a breach thereof.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Condition making interest determinable on insolvency or attempted alienation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">12. Where property is transferred subject to a condition or limitation making any interest therein, reserved or given to or for the benefit of any person, to cease on his becoming insolvent or endeavouring to transfer or dispose of the same, such condition or limitation is void.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing in this section applies to a condition in a lease for the benefit of the lessor or those claiming under him.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Transfer for benefit of unborn person</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">13. Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created for the benefit of a person not in existence at the date of the transfer, subject to a prior interest created by the same transfer, the interest created for the benefit of such person shall not take effect, unless it extends to the whole of the remaining interest of the transferor in the property.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustration</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A transfers property of which he is the owner to B in trust for A and his intended wife successively for their lives, and, after the death of the survivor, for the eldest son of the intended marriage for life, and after his death for A's second son. The interest so created for the benefit of the eldest son does not take effect, because it does not extend to the whole of A's remaining interest in the property.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Rule against perpetuity</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">14. No transfer of property can operate to create an interest which is to take effect after the life-time of one or more persons living at the date of such transfer, and the minority of some person who shall be in existence at the expiration of that period, and to whom, if he attains full age, the interest created is to belong.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Transfer to class some of whom come under sections 13 and 14</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">15. If, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created for the benefit of a class of persons with regard to some of whom such interest fails by reason of any of the rules contained in sections 13 and 14, such interest fails in regard to those persons only and not in regard to the whole class.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Transfer to take effect on failure of prior interest</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">16. Where, by reason of any of the rules contained in sections 13 and 14, an interest created for the benefit of a person or of a class of persons fails in regard to such person or the whole of such class, any interest created in the same transaction and intended to take effect after or upon failure of such prior interest also fails.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Direction for accumulation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">17. (1) Where the terms of a transfer of property direct that the income arising from the property shall be accumulated either wholly or in part during a period longer than-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) the life of the transferor, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) a period of eighteen years from the date of the transfer, such direction shall, save as hereinafter provided, be void to the extent to which the period during which the accumulation is directed exceeds the longer of the aforesaid periods, and at the end of such last-mentioned period the property and the income thereof shall be disposed of as if the period during which the accumulation has been directed to be made had elapsed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) This section shall not affect any direction for accumulation for the purpose of-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(i) the payment of the debts of the transferor or any other person taking any interest under the transfer, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(ii) the provision of portions for children or remoter issue of the transferor or of any other person taking any interest under the transfer, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(iii) the preservation or maintenance of the property transferred; and such direction may be made accordingly.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Transfer in perpetuity for benefit of public</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">18. The restrictions in sections 14, 16 and 17 shall not apply in the case of a transfer of property for the benefit of the public in the advancement of religion, knowledge, commerce, health, safety, or any other object beneficial to mankind.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Vested interest</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">19. Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of a person without specifying the time when it is to take effect, or in terms specifying that it is to take effect forthwith or on the happening of an event which must happen, such interest is vested, unless a contrary intention appears from the terms of the transfer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A vested interest is not defeated by the death of the transferee before he obtains possession.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation.-An intention that an interest shall not be vested is not to be inferred merely from a provision whereby the enjoyment thereof is postponed, or whereby a prior interest in the same property is given or reserved to some other person, or whereby income arising from the property is directed to be accumulated until the time of enjoyment arrives, or from a provision that if a particular event shall happen the interest shall pass to another person.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>When unborn person acquires vested interest on transfer for his benefit</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">20. Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created for the benefit of a person not then living, he acquires upon his birth, unless a contrary intention appear from the terms of the transfer, a vested interest, although he may not be entitled to the enjoyment thereof immediately on his birth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Contingent interest</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">21. Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of a person to take effect only on the happening of a specified uncertain event, or if a specified uncertain event shall not happen, such person thereby acquires a contingent interest in the property. Such interest becomes a vested interest, in the former case, on the happening of the event, in the latter, when the happening of the event becomes impossible.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Exception.-Where, under a transfer of property, a person becomes entitled to an interest therein upon attaining a particular age, and the transferor also gives to him absolutely the income to arise from such interest before he reaches that age, or directs the income or so much thereof as may be necessary to be applied for his benefit, such interest is not contingent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Transfer to members of a class who attain a particular age</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">22. Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of such members only of a class as shall attain a particular age, such interest does not vest in any member of the class who has not attained that age.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Transfer contingent on happening of specified uncertain event</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">23. Where, on transfer of property, an interest therein is to accrue to a specified person if a specified uncertain event shall happen, and no time is mentioned for the occurrence of that event, the interest falls unless such event happens before, or at the same time as, the intermediate or precedent interest ceases to exist.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Transfer to such of certain persons as survive at some period not specified</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">24. Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is to accrue to such of certain persons as shall be surviving at some period, but the exact period is not specified, the interest shall go to such of them as shall be alive when the intermediate or precedent interest ceases to exist, unless a contrary intention appears from the terms of the transfer.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustration</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A transfers property to B for life, and after his death to C and D, equally to be divided between them, or to the survivor of them. C dies during the life of B. D survives B. At B's death the property passes to D.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Conditional transfer</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">25. An interest created on a transfer of property and dependent upon a condition fails if the fulfilment of the condition is impossible, or is forbidden by law, or is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law, or is fraudulent, or involves or implies injury to the person or property of another, or the Court regards it as immoral or opposed a public policy.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A lets a farm to B on condition that he shall walk a hundred miles in an hour. The lease is void.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A gives Tk. 500 to B on condition that he shall marry A's daughter C. At the date of the transfer C was dead. The transfer is void.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) A transfers Tk. 500 to B on condition that she shall murder C. The transfer is void.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(d) A transfers Tk. 500 to his niece C if she will desert her husband. The transfer is void.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Fulfilment of condition precedent</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">26. Where the terms of a transfer of property impose a condition to be fulfilled before a person can take an interest in the property, the condition shall be deemed to have been fulfilled if it has been substantially complied with.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A transfers Tk. 5,000 to B on condition that he shall marry with the consent of C, D and E. E dies. B marries with the consent of C and D. B is deemed to have fulfilled the conditions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A transfers Tk. 5,000 to B on condition that he shall marry with the consent of C, D and E. B marries without the consent of C, D and E, but obtains their consent after the marriage. B has not fulfilled the condition.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Conditional transfer to one person coupled with transfer to another on failure of prior disposition</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">27. Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of one person, and by the same transaction an ulterior disposition of the same interest is made in favour of another, if the prior disposition under the transfer shall fail, the ulterior disposition shall take effect upon the failure of the prior disposition, although the failure may not have occurred in the manner contemplated by the transferor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But, where the intention of the parties to the transaction is that the ulterior disposition shall take effect only in the event of the prior disposition failing in a particular manner, the ulterior disposition shall not take effect unless the prior disposition fails in that manner.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A transfers Tk. 500 to B on condition that he shall execute a certain lease within three months after A's death, and, if he should neglect to do so, to C. B dies in A's life-time. The disposition in favour of C takes effect.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A transfers property to his wife; but, in case she should die in his life-time, transfers to B that which he had transferred to her. A and his wife perish together, under circumstances which make it impossible to prove that she died before him. The disposition in favour of B does not take effect.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ulterior transfer conditional on happening or not happening of specified event</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">28. On a transfer of property an interest therein may be created to accrue to any person with the condition superadded that in case a specified uncertain event shall happen such interest shall pass to another person, or that in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen such interest shall pass to another person. In each case the dispositions are subject to the rules contained in sections 10, 12, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 27.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Fulfilment of condition subsequent</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">29. An ulterior disposition of the kind contemplated by the last preceding section cannot take effect unless the condition is strictly fulfilled.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustration</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A transfers Tk. 500 to B, to be paid to him on his attaining his majority or marrying, with a proviso that, if B dies a minor or marries without C's consent, the Tk. 500 shall go to D. B marries when only 17 years of age, without C's consent. The transfer to D takes effect.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Prior disposition not affected by invalidity of ulterior disposition</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">30. If the ulterior disposition is not valid, the prior disposition is not affected by it.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustration</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A transfer a farm B for her life, and, if she do not desert her husband, to C. B is entitled to the farm during her life as if no condition had been inserted.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Condition that transfer shall cease to have effect in case specified uncertain event happens or does not happen</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">31. Subject to the provisions of section 12, on a transfer of property an interest therein may be created with the condition superadded that it shall cease to exist in case a specified uncertain event shall happen, or in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A transfers a farm to B for his life, with a proviso that, in case B cuts down a certain wood, the transfer shall cease to have any effect. B cuts down the wood. He loses his life-interest in the farm.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A transfers a farm to B, provided that, if B shall not go to England within three years after the date of the transfer, his interest in the farm shall cease. B does not go to England within the term prescribed. His interest in the farm ceases.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Such condition must not be invalid</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">32. In order that a condition that an interest shall cease to exist may be valid, it is necessary that the event to which it relates be one which could legally constitute the condition of the creation of an interest.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Transfer conditional on performance of act, no time being specified for performance</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">33. Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created subject to a condition that the person taking it shall perform a certain act, but no time is specified for the performance of the act, the condition is broken when he renders impossible, permanently or for an indefinite period, the performance of the act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Transfer conditional on performance of act, time being specified</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">34. Where an act is to be performed by a person either as a condition to be fulfilled before an interest created on a transfer of property is enjoyed by him, or as a condition on the non-fulfilment of which the interest is to pass from him to another person, and a time is specified for the performance of the act, if such performance within the specified time is prevented by the fraud of a person who would be directly benefited by non-fulfilment of the condition, such further time shall as against him be allowed for performing the act as shall be requisite to</p><p style="text-align: justify;">make up for the delay caused by such fraud. But if no time is specified for the performance of the act, then, if its performance is by the fraud of a person interested in the non-fulfilment of the condition rendered impossible or indefinitely postponed, the condition shall as against him be deemed to have been fulfilled.</p><p align="center"><i>Election</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Election when necessary</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">35. Where a person professes to transfer property which he has no right to transfer, and as part of the same transaction confers any benefit on the owner of the property, such owner must elect either to confirm such transfer or to dissent from it; and in the latter case he shall relinquish the benefit so conferred, and the benefit so relinquished shall revert to the transferor or his representative as if it had not been disposed of,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">subject nevertheless,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">where the transfer is gratuitous, and the transferor has, before the election, died or otherwise become incapable of making a fresh transfer,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and in all cases where the transfer is for consideration,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">to the charge of making good to the disappointed transferee the amount or value of the property attempted to be transferred to him.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustrations</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The farm of Ulipur is the property of C and worth Tk. 800. A by an instrument of gift professes to transfer it to B, giving by the same instrument Tk. 1,000 to C. C elects to retain the farm. He forfeits the gift of Tk. 1,000.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the same case, A dies before the election. His representative must out of the Tk. 1,000 pay (Tk.) 800 to B.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The rule in the first paragraph of this section applies whether the transferor does or does not believe that which he professes to transfer to be his own.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A person taking no benefit directly under a transaction, but deriving a benefit under it indirectly, need not elect.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A person who in his one capacity takes a benefit under the transaction may in another dissent therefrom.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Exception</i> to the last preceding four rules.?Where a particular benefit is expressed to be conferred on the owner of the property which the transferor professes to transfer, and such benefit is expressed to be in lieu of that property, if such owner claim the property, he must relinquish the particular benefit, but he is not bound to relinquish any other benefit conferred upon him by the same transaction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Acceptance of the benefit by the person on whom it is conferred constitutes an election by him to confirm the transfer, if he is aware of his duty to elect and of those circumstances which would influence the judgment of a reasonable man in making an election, or if he waives enquiry into the circumstances.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Such knowledge or waiver shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be presumed, if the person on whom the benefit has been conferred has enjoyed it for two years without doing any act to express dissent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Such knowledge or waiver may be inferred from any act of his which renders it impossible to place the persons interested in the property professed to be transferred in the same condition as if such act had not been done.</p><p align="center"><i>Illustration</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A transfers to B an estate to which C is entitled, and as part of the same transaction gives C a coal-mine.
