"Partnership" is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are called individually "partners" and collectively "a firm", and the name under which their business is carried on is called the "firm name".</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Partnership not created by status</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. The relation of partnership arises from contract and not from status;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and, in particular, the members of a Hindu undivided family carrying on a family business as such, or a Burmese Buddhist husband and wife carrying on business as such are not partners in such business.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Mode of determining existence of partnership</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">6.

Where no provision is made by contact between the partners for the duration of their partnership, or for the determination of their partnership, the partnership is "partnership at will".</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Particular partnership</p><p style="text-align: justify;">8.

(1) A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a price. There may be a contract of sale between one part-owner and another.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) A contract of sale may be absolute or conditional.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer, the contract is called a sale, but where the transfer of the property in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject to some condition thereafter to be fulfilled, the contract is called an agreement to sell.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(4) An agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred.</p><p align="center"><i>Formalities of the contract</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Contract of sale how made</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. (1) A contract of sale is made by an offer to buy or sell goods for a price and the acceptance of such offer. The contract may provide for the immediate delivery of the goods or immediate payment of the price or both, or for the delivery or payment by instalments, or that the delivery or payment or both shall be postponed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Subject to the provisions of any law for the time being in force, a contract of sale may be made in writing or by word of mouth, or partly in writing and partly by word of mouth or may be implied from the conduct of the parties.</p><p align="center"><i>Subject-matter of Contract</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Existing of future goods</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. (1) The goods which form the subject of a contract of sale may be either existing goods, owned or possessed by the seller, or future goods.(2) There may be a contract for the sale of goods the acquisition of which by the seller depends upon a contingency which may or may not happen.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) Where by a contract of sale the seller purports to effect a present sale of future goods, the contract operates as an agreement to sell the goods.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Goods perishing before making of contract</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">7. Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods, the contract is void if the goods without the knowledge of the seller have, at the time when the contract was made, perished or become so damaged as no longer to answer to their description in the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Goods perishing before sale but after agreement to sell</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">8. Where there is an agreement to sell specific goods, and subsequently the goods without any fault on the part of the seller or buyer perish or become so damaged as no longer to answer to their description in the agreement before the risk passes to the buyer, the agreement is thereby avoided.</p><p align="center"><i>The Price</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ascertainment of price</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">9. (1) The price in a contract of sale may be fixed by the contract or may be left to be fixed in manner thereby agreed or may be determined by the course of dealing between the parties.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Where the price is not determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the buyer shall pay the seller a reasonable price. What is a reasonable price is a question of fact dependent on the circumstances of each particular case.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Agreement to sell at valuation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">10. (1) Where there is an agreement to sell goods on the terms that the price is to be fixed by the valuation of a third party and such third party cannot or does not make such valuation, the agreement is thereby avoided:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that, if the goods or any part thereof have been delivered to, and appropriated by, the buyer, he shall pay a reasonable price therefor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Where such third party is prevented from making the valuation by the fault of the seller or buyer, the party not in fault may maintain a suit for damages against the party in fault.</p><p align="center"><i>Conditions and Warranties</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Stipulations as to time</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">11. Unless a different intention appears from the terms of the contract, stipulations as to time of payment are not deemed to be of the essence of a contract of sale. Whether any other stipulation as to time is of the essence of the contract or not depends on the terms of the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Condition and warranty</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">12. (1) A stipulation in a contract of sale with reference to goods which are the subject thereof may be a condition or a warranty.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) A condition is a stipulation essential to the main purpose of the contract, the breach of which gives rise to right to treat the contract as repudiated.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) A warranty is a stipulation collateral to the main purpose of the contract, the breach of which gives rise to a claim for damages but not to a right to reject the goods and treat the contract as repudiated.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(4) Whether a stipulation in a contract of sale is a condition or a warranty depends in each case on the construction of the contract. A stipulation may be a condition, though called a warranty in the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>When condition to be treated as warranty</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">13. (1) Where a contract of sale is subject to any condition to be fulfilled by the seller, the buyer may waive the condition or elect to treat the breach of the condition as a breach of warranty and not as a ground for treating the contract as repudiated.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Where a contract of sale is not severable and the buyer has accepted the goods or part thereof, the breach of any condition to be fulfilled by the seller can only be treated as a breach of warranty and not as a ground for rejecting the goods and treating the contract as repudiated, unless there is a term of the contract, express or implied, to that effect.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) Nothing in this section shall effect the case of any condition or warranty fulfilment of which is excused by law by reason of impossibility or otherwise.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Implied undertaking as to title, etc</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">14. In a contract of sale, unless the circumstances of the contract are such as to show a different intention there is-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) an implied condition on the part of the seller that, in the case of a sale, he has a right to sell the goods and that, in the case of an agreement to sell, he will have a right to sell the goods at the time when the property is to pass;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) an implied warranty that the buyer shall have and enjoy quiet possession of the goods;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) an implied warranty that the goods shall be free from any charge or encumbrance in favour of any third party not declared or known to the buyer before or at the time when the contract is made.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sale by description</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">15. Where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there is an implied condition that the goods shall correspond with the description; and, if the sale is by sample as well as by description, it is not sufficient that the bulk of the goods corresponds with the sample if the goods do not also correspond with the description.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Implied conditions as to quality or fitness</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">16. Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any other law for the time being in force, there is no implied warranty or condition as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale, except as follows:-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(1) Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, so as to show that the buyer relies on the seller's skill or judgment, and the goods are of a description which it is in the course of the seller's business to supply (whether he is the manufacturer or producer or not), there is an implied condition that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that, in the case of a contract for the sale of a specified article under its patent or other trade name, there is no implied condition as to its fitness for any particular purpose.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Where goods are bought by description from a seller who deals in goods of that description (whether he is the manufacturer or producer or not), there is an implied condition that the goods shall be of merchantable quality:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that, if the buyer has examined the goods, there shall be no implied condition as regards defects which such examination ought to have revealed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) An implied warranty or condition as to quality or fitness for a particular purpose may be annexed by the usage of trade.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(4) An express warranty or condition does not negative a warranty or condition implied by this Act unless inconsistent therewith.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sale by sample</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">17. (1) A contract of sale is a contract for sale by sample where there is a term in the contract, express or implied, to that effect.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) In the case of a contract for sale by sample there is an implied condition-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) that the bulk shall correspond with the sample in quality;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) that the buyer shall have a reasonable opportunity of comparing the bulk with the sample;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) that the goods shall be free from any defect, rendering them unmerchantable, which would not be apparent on reasonable examination of the sample.</p><p align="center">CHAPTER III</p><p align="center">EFFECTS OF THE CONTRACT</p><p align="center"><i>Transfer of Property as between Seller and Buyer</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Goods must be ascertained</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">18. Where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained goods, no property in the goods is transferred to the buyer unless and until goods are ascertained.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Property passes when intended to pass</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">19. (1) Where there is a contract for the sale of specific or ascertained goods the property in them is transferred to the buyer at such time as the parties to the contract intend it to be transferred.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) For the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties regard shall be had to the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the case.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) Unless a different intention appears, the rules contained in section 20 to 24 are rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the time at which the property in the goods is to pass to the buyer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Specific goods in a deliverable state</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">20. Where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is made, and it is immaterial whether the time of payment to the price or the time of delivery of the goods, or both, is postponed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Specific goods to be put into a deliverable state</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">21. Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods and the seller is bound to do something to the goods for the purpose of putting them into a deliverable state, the property does not pass until such thing is done and the buyer has notice thereof.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Specific goods in a deliverable state, when the seller has to do anything thereto in order to ascertain price</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">22. Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, but the seller is bound to weigh measure, test or do some other act or thing with reference to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, the property does not pass until such act or thing is done and the buyer has notice thereof.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sale of unascertained goods and appropriation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">23.(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer.

(1) Whether it is for the buyer to take possession of the goods or for the seller to send them to the buyer is a question depending in each case on the contract, express or implied, between the parties. Apart from any such contract, goods sold are to be delivered at the place at which they are at the time of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the sale, and goods agreed to be sold are to be delivered at the place at which they are at the time of the agreement to sell, or if not then in existence, at the place at which they are manufactured or produced.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Where under the contract of the sale the seller is bound to send the goods to the buyer, but no time for sending them is fixed, the seller is bound to send them within a reasonable time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) Where the goods at the time of sale are in the possession of a third person, there is no delivery by seller to buyer unless and until such third person acknowledges to the buyer that he holds the goods on his behalf:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that nothing in this section shall affect the operation of the issue or transfer of any document of title to goods.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(4) Demand or tender of delivery may be treated as ineffectual unless made at a reasonable hour.

(1) Unless otherwise agreed, the buyer of goods is not bound to accept delivery thereof by instalments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Where there is a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered by stated instalments which are to be separately paid for, and the seller makes no delivery or defective delivery in respect of one or more instalments, or the buyer neglects or refuses to take delivery of or pay for one or more instalments, it is a question in each case depending on the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case, whether the breach of contract is a repudiation of the whole contract, or whether it is a severable breach giving rise to a claim for compensation, but not to a right to treat the whole contract as repudiated.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Delivery to carrier or wharfinger</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">39.

If the seller omits, so to do, and the goods are lost or damaged in course of transit or whilst in the custody of the wharfinger, the buyer may decline to treat the delivery to the carrier of wharfinger as a delivery to himself, or may hold the seller responsible in damages.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) Unless otherwise agreed, where goods are sent by the seller to the buyer by a route involving sea transit, in circumstances in which it is usual to insure, the seller shall give such notice to the buyer as may enable him to insure them during their sea transit, and if the seller fails so to do, the goods shall be deemed to be at his risk during such sea transit.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Risk where goods are delivered at distant place</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">40. Where the seller of goods agrees to deliver them at his own risk at a place other than that where they are when sold, the buyer shall, nevertheless, unless otherwise agreed, take any risk of deterioration in the goods necessarily incident to the course of transit.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Buyer's right of examining the goods</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">41. (1) Where goods are delivered to the buyer which he has not previously examined, he is not deemed to have accepted them unless and until he has had a reasonable opportunity of examining them for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are in conformity with the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Unless otherwise agreed, when the seller tenders delivery of goods to the buyer, he is bound, on request, to afford the buyer a reasonable opportunity of examining the goods for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are in conformity with the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Acceptance</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">42. The buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods when he intimates to the seller, that he has accepted them, or when the goods have been delivered to him and he does any act in relation to them which is inconsistent with the ownership of the seller, or when, after the lapse of a reasonable time, he retains the goods without intimating to the seller that he has rejected them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Buyer not bound to return rejected goods</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">43. Unless otherwise agreed, where goods are delivered to the buyer and he refuses to accept them, having the right so to do, he is not bound to return them to the seller, but it is sufficient if he intimates to the seller that he refuses to accept them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Liability of buyer for neglecting or refusing delivery of goods</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">44. When the seller is ready and willing to deliver the goods and requests the buyer to take delivery, and the buyer does not within a reasonable time after such request take delivery of the goods, he is liable to the seller for any loss occasioned by his neglect or refusal to take delivery, and also for a reasonable charge for the care and custody of the goods:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that nothing in this section shall affect the rights of the seller where the neglect or refusal of the buyer to take delivery amounts to a repudiation of the contract.</p><p align="center">CHAPTER V</p><p align="center">RIGHTS OF UNPAID SELLER AGAINST THE GOODS</p><p style="text-align: justify;">45.
