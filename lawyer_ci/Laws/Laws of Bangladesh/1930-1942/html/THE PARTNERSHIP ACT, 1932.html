"Partnership" is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are called individually "partners" and collectively "a firm", and the name under which their business is carried on is called the "firm name".</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Partnership not created by status</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. The relation of partnership arises from contract and not from status;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and, in particular, the members of a Hindu undivided family carrying on a family business as such, or a Burmese Buddhist husband and wife carrying on business as such are not partners in such business.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Mode of determining existence of partnership</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. In determining whether a group of persons is or is not a firm, or whether a person is or is not a partner in a firm, regard shall be had to the real relation between the parties, as shown by all relevant facts taken together.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation 1.The sharing of profits or of gross returns arising from property by persons holding a joint or common interest in that property does not of itself make such persons partners.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Explanation 2.The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business, or of a payment contingent upon the earning of profits or varying with the profits earned by a business, does not of itself make him a partner with the persons carrying on the business;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and, in particular, the receipt of such share or payment-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) by a lender of none to persons engaged or about to engage in any business,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) by a servant or agent as remuneration,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) by the widow or child of a deceased partner, as annuity, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(d) by a previous owner or part owner of the business, as consideration for the sale of the goodwill or share thereof,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">does not or itself make the receiver a partner with the persons carrying on the business.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Partnership at will</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">7. Where no provision is made by contact between the partners for the duration of their partnership, or for the determination of their partnership, the partnership is "partnership at will".</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Particular partnership</p><p style="text-align: justify;">8. A person may become a partner with another person in particular adventures or undertakings.</p><p align="center">CHAPTER III</p><p align="center">RELATIONS OF PARTNERS TO ONE ANOTHER</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>General duties of partners</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">9.

Subject to the provision of this Act, a partner is the agent of the firm for the purposes of the business of the firm.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Implied authority of partner as agent of the firm</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">19. (1) Subject to the provisions of section 22, the act of a partner which is done to carry on, in the usual way, business of the kind carried by the firm, binds the firm.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The authority of a partner to bind the firm conferred by this section is called his "implied authority".</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) In the absence of any usage or custom of trade to the contrary, the implied authority of a partner does not empower him to-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) submit a dispute relating to the business of the firm to arbitration,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) open a banking account on behalf of the firm in his own name,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) compromise or relinquish any claim or portion of a claim by the firm,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(d) withdraw a suit or proceeding filed on behalf of the firm,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(e) admit any liability in a suit or proceeding against the firm,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(f) acquire immovable property on behalf of the firm,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(g) transfer immovable property belonging to the firm, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(h) enter into partnership on behalf of the firm.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Extension and restriction of partner's implied authority</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">20. The partners in a firm may, by contract between the partners, extend or restrict the implied authority of any partner.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding any such restriction, any act done by a partner on behalf of the firm which falls within his implied authority binds the firm, unless the person with whom he is dealing knows of the restriction or does not know or believe that partner to be a partner.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Partner's authority in an emergency</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">21. A partner has authority, in an emergency, to do all such acts for the purpose of protecting the firm from loss as would be done by a person of ordinary prudence, in his own case, acting under similar circumstances, and such acts bind the firm.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Mode of doing act to bind firm</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">22. In order to bind a firm, an act or instrument done or executed by a partner or other person on behalf of the firm shall be done or executed in the firm name, or in any other manner expressing or implying an intention to bind the firm.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Effect of admissions by a partner</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">23.
