(1) Where the Government has reason to believe that any person has committed (whether after the commencement of this Ordinance or not) any scheduled offence, the Government may, whether or not any Court has taken cognizance of the offence, authorise the making of an application to the District Judge within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the said person ordinarily resides or carries on his business, for the attachment under this Ordinance of the money or other property which the Government believes the said person to have procured by means of the offence, or if such money or other property cannot for any reason be attached, of other property of the said person of value as nearly as may be equivalent to that of the aforesaid money or other property.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) The provisions of Order XXVII of the First Schedule to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 shall apply to proceedings for an order of attachment under this Ordinance as they apply to suits by the Government.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) An application under sub section (1) shall be accompanied by one or more affidavits stating the grounds on which the belief that the said person has committed any scheduled offence is founded, and the amount of money or the value of other property believed to have been procured by means of the offence; the application shall also furnish-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a)        any information available as to the location for the time being of any such money or other property, and shall, if necessary, give particulars, including the estimated value, of other property of the said person;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b)        the names and addresses of any other persons believed to have, or to be likely to claim, any interest or title in the property of the said person.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ad interim attachment</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. (1) Upon receipt of an application under section 3, the District Judge shall, unless for reasons to be recorded in writing he is of opinion that there exist no prima facie grounds for believing that the person in respect of whom the application is made has committed any scheduled offence or that he has procured thereby any money or other property, pass without delay an ad interim order attaching the money or other property alleged to have been so procured, or if it transpires that such money or other property is not available for attachment, such other property of the said person of equivalent value as the District Judge may think fit:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that the District Judge may if he thinks fit before passing such order, and shall before refusing to pass such order, examine the person or persons making the affidavits accompanying the application.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) At the same time as he passes an order under sub section (1), the District Judge shall issue to the person whose money or other property is being attached a notice, accompanied by copies of the order, the application and affidavits and of the evidence, if any, recorded, calling upon him to show cause on a date to be specified in the notice why the order of attachment should not be made absolute.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) The District Judge shall also issue notices, accompanied by copies of the documents accompanying the notice under sub-section (2), to all persons represented to him as having, or being likely to claim, any interest or title in the property of the person to whom notice is issued under the said sub section, calling upon each such person to appear on the same date as that specified in the notice under the said sub section and make objection if he so desires to the attachment of the property or any portion thereof on the ground that he has an interest in such property or portion thereof.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(4) Any other person claiming an interest in the attached property or any portion thereof may, notwithstanding that no notice has been served upon him under this section, make an objection as aforesaid to the District Judge at any time before an order is passed under sub section (1) or sub section (3), as the case may be, of section 5.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Investigation of objections to attachment</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">5.

Any person whose property has been or is about to be attached under this Ordinance may at any time apply to the District Judge to be permitted to give security in lieu of such attachment, and where the security offered and given is in the opinion of the District Judge satisfactory and sufficient, he may withdraw or, as the case may be, refrain from passing, the order of attachment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Administration of attached property</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">9. (1) The District Judge may, on the application of any person interested in any property attached under this Ordinance and after giving the agent of the Government an opportunity of being heard, make such orders as the District Judge considers just and reasonable for</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) providing from such of the attached property as the applicant claims an interest in, such sums as may be reasonably necessary for the maintenance of the applicant and of his family, and for the expenses connected with the defence of the applicant where criminal proceedings have been instituted against him in any Court for a scheduled offence;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) safeguarding so far as may be practicable the interests of any business affected by the attachment, and in particular, the interests of any partners in such business.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Where it appears to the District Judge to be just and convenient, he may by order appoint a receiver to manage any property attached under this Ordinance in accordance with such instructions as the District Judge may from time to time think fit to give; and where a receiver is so appointed, the provisions of rules 2, 3, 4 and 5 of Order XL of the First Schedule to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, shall be applicable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Duration of attachment</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">10. An order of attachment of property under this Ordinance shall, unless it is withdrawn earlier in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, continue in force-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) where no Court has taken cognizance of the alleged scheduled offence at the time when the order is applied for, for three months from the date of the order under sub section (1) of section 4 or sub section (2) of section 6, as the case may be, unless cognizance of such offence is in the meantime so taken, or unless the District Judge on application by the agent of the Government thinks it proper and just that the period should be extended and passes an order accordingly; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b)        where a Court has taken cognizance of the alleged scheduled offence, whether before or after the time when the order was applied for, until orders are passed by the District Judge in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance after the termination of the criminal proceedings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Appeals</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">11.
