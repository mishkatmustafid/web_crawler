<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p><strong>RE:</strong> <strong>LEGAL OPINION &amp; VETTING FOR DRAFTS OF SECOND MODIFICATION OF LENDERS PARI-PASSU SECURITY SHARING AGREEMENT AND DEED OF SECOND MODIFICATION OF FIXED &amp; FLOATING CHARGE A/C COMPANY 1.</strong></p>
<p>We refer to your letter dated 15.08.2006, 22.08.2006 &amp; 23.08.2006 on the above subject.</p>
<p>We have perused the contents of your letter and other papers/documents referred to us in connection with the above-mentioned account. Our opinion on the draft deeds/documents is given below.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second Modification of the Lender’s Pari-Passu Security Sharing Agreement:</span></strong></p>

<td valign="top" width="170">Page 1, particulars ofBank 1</td>
<td valign="top" width="406">In page 1, clause 2, we suggest   the replacement of the reference of  ‘BANK   1’ with ‘BANK 1’.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="170">Definition of Bank 2</td>
<td valign="top" width="406">Both Bank Asia Limited and Bank   2 has been defined as ‘BANK 2’, this is confusing. We suggest that Bank 2   should be defined as ‘ALFALAH’ and the defined term should be used throughout   the Agreement accordingly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="170">Recital S</td>
<td valign="top" width="406">In line 2 of recital S, we   suggest the replacement of ‘BCCBL’ with ‘NCCBL’.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="170">Recital W</td>
<td valign="top" width="406">We suggest the revision of   Recital W as follows:
<p>“By a Sanction Letter No. _______________   dated 29.12.2005 issued by UBL and duly accepted by the Borrower (herein   after referred to as ‘UBL Sanction Letter’) UBL has further granted to the   Borrower Revolving L/C Limit of Tk. 10,00,00,000.00 (Taka Ten Crore) only on   the terms and conditions set forth in the UBL Sanction Letter.”</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="170">Recital BB</td>
<td valign="top" width="406">In line 2 of Recital BB, after the words ‘UBL Sanction Letter’ we suggest the insertion of   ‘MBL 2<sup>nd</sup> Sanction Letter’.
<p>In line 3 of Recital BB, we suggest that ‘SIBL Sanction Letter’ should be replaced with ‘TBL Sanction Letter’.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="170">Page 6, Clause 6</td>
<td valign="top" width="406">In page 6, we suggest the   revision of Clause 6(I1) as follows:
<p>“By a Sanction Letter No.   UBL/CORP/ADV/UFIL – LC/2005/01 dated 29.12.2005 issued by UBL and duly accepted by the   Borrower (herein after referred to as ‘UBL Sanction Letter’) UBL has further   granted to the Borrower Revolving L/C Limit of Tk. 10,00,00,000.00 (Taka Ten   Crore) only on the terms and conditions set forth in the UBL Sanction   Letter.”</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="170">Page 7, Clause 6 (which has to   be re-numbered to Clause 9)</td>
<td valign="top" width="406">In the first line of existing   clause 6, the words ‘Recital H’ should be replaced with ‘Recital O’
<p>(Explanation: As the first Modification of the Lender’s Pari-Passu Security Sharing Agreement   has already renamed ‘Recital H’ to   ‘Recital O’, the second Modification of the Lender’s Pari-Passu   Security Sharing Agreement has to rename ‘Recital O’ to ‘Recital R’)</p></td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="170">Page 8, Clause 8 (which   has to be re-numbered to Clause 11), definition of ‘Amount   Outstanding’</td>
<td valign="top" width="406">In line 8 of the definition of ‘Amount Outstanding’, after the   words ‘UBL Sanction Letter’ we suggest inserting ‘MBL 2<sup>nd</sup> Sanction   Letter’.
<p>In line 9 of the definition of ‘Amount Outstanding’, it is our   opinion that ‘SIBL Sanction Letter’ should be replaced with ‘TBL Sanction Letter’.</p></td>

<td valign="top" width="170">General</td>
<td valign="top" width="406">We have not been provided with the sanction letters issued by all   the lenders. As such, we suggest to ascertain all the commercial terms and   conditions are in order.</td>
