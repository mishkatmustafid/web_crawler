<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Corporate Guarantee</span></strong></p>
<p>Please note that a contract of guarantee always involves three parties, namely the Principal Debtor, Surety and the Creditor. However, there is only principal debtor and the Creditor. Oman Bangladesh Leasing and Finance Limited (the Company) is liable to the Bank as principal debtor and as such a corporate guarantee from the Company shall not provide any additional comfort to NCCBL. Usually a third party i.e. Surety guarantees the performance of the obligations of the principal debtor, in whose default the surety becomes liable for the discharge of the liability of the principal debtor.</p>
<p>Also note that an Irrevocable General Power of Attorney to sell the hypothecated assets will be required. Letter of Hypothecation should be filed with RJSC with Form XVIII within 21 days of execution of the same.</p>
<p>Subject to the above, the documents referred to us seem to be in order.</p>
<p>If you have any queries, do not hesitate to contact us. All papers/documents referred to us are returned herewith.</p>
<p>Thanking you.</p>
