<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p><strong>RE:     LEGAL OPINION ON MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING FOR CREDIT RATINGS. </strong></p>
<p>We refer to your letter dated 29 November 2006 on the above subject.</p>
<p>We have perused the contents of your letter and other papers/documents referred to us in connection with the above Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”).</p>
<p>Our opinion on the draft MOU is given below.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>

<td valign="top" width="161"><strong>Clause/Paragraph</strong></td>

<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 3</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">According   to Clause 5 of Bangladesh Bank BRPD circular no. 6 dated 05 July 2006, BANK 1 has to disclose their credit rating   prominently in their published financial statement and as a result BANK 1   needs to finalise their statutory accounts within 12 February 2006. That is why we suggest that Clause 3 of the MOU be   deleted and replaced with the following:
<p>“3.   That the First Party has agreed to undertake the rating assignment and complete   the same within six weeks from the date of the Second Party providing all   information required vide CRISL’s primary questionnaire and satisfying   subsequent queries. In any event, the First Party agrees that they would   complete the rating assignment by ________________ 2006 so that the Second   party will have adequate time to complete their Statutory accounts and be   able to disclose the credit rating in their published financial statement.”</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 4</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">The   terms contained in Clause 4 are commercial terms, please ensure whether BANK   1 agrees to pay the stated service fee of Tk. 600,000 and also review the   fact that 50% of the fees will have to be paid at the signing of the MOU and   remaining 50% of the fees will be paid after the submission by CRISL of the   draft report but before the declaration of rating.
<p>In   line 2 of Clause 4, “600,0000” should be replaced with “600,000”.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 5</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">Please   delete Clause 5 and replace with the following:
<p>“5.   That the entire information and clarification furnished by the Second Party   for facilitating rating and the Credit Rating provided by the First Party   shall be held on trust by the First Party on behalf of the Second Party and   the said information will solely be the property of the Second Party. The   said information can only be used by the First Party for the purpose of   providing the Second Party’s credit rating and peer analysis.”</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 6</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">Please   delete Clause 6 and replace with the following:
<p>“6.   That the First Party has agreed, in principle, to the surveillance of rating   on yearly basis at a fee which is two third of the original fees, subject to   the acceptance in writing of the same by the Second Party. The surveillance   report will be submitted to the management of the Second Party by the First   Party with in Four weeks from the date of the receipt of the complete   information from the Second Party; in any event, the First Party agrees that   they would complete the surveillance report within the _____ day of the month   of _________ of the calendar year.”</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 9</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">Please   delete the second sentence of Clause 9 and replace it with the following   sentence:
<p>“Once   the Credit Rating has been accepted and used by the Second Party, the First   Party may only publish the same with the written permission of the Second   Party.”</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 10</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">Please   delete clause 10 and replace with the following:
<p>“10.   That in the event of failure on the part of the Second Party to furnish, as   required by the First Party from time to time, such relevant information,   material and clarification which are needed to provide the Credit Rating or in   the event of failure on the part of the Second Party to pay the fees as and   when due, the First Party shall have the right to suspend/withdraw the rating   assigned, subject to giving the Second Party a 7 (seven) days notice to   rectify the defect.”</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 11</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">In   this clause the First Party has the right to disclose in public interest.   This likely to create confusion because in case of any dispute who will   decide what is meant by “public interest”. As such we are of the opinion that   the words “in public interest” be deleted and replaced with the words “if   required by law”.</td>
