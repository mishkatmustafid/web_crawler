Provided however that in the event of a transfer of shares by the   Group B shareholder to its Affiliate, no offer for sale/transfer of shares   will be required to be made to the Group A shareholders.</p>
<p>51B. Except in   accordance with the provisions of Article 51C below, the Group A shareholders   shall not transfer sell, give, exchange, pledge, encumber, deliver, assign,   mortgage, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any of their shares whether now   owned or hereafter acquired by them and the Company shall not acknowledge or   register any such transfer, sale, gift, exchange, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pledge, encumber</span>,   delivery, assignment, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mortgage, hypothecation</span> or any other disposal of   such shares.</p>

</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please note that</span></strong>, according to Section 7.2.1 of the Agreement, the Investor Nominee Director shall not be required to hold qualification shares. We have not changed the Articles of COMPANY 1 reflecting this provision, because according to the Companies Act 1994 this is not permitted. According to Section 97 of the Companies Act 1994, it shall be the duty of every director to hold qualification number of shares as specified in the Articles of Association within sixty days of his appointment. The Act makes no difference between a normal director and a nominee director. Therefore, the Nominee Director has to hold the qualification number of shares</p>
