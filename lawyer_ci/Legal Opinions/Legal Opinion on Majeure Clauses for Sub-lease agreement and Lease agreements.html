<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from the lease agreement between Mr. ………….. and COMPANY 2 dated 28 June 2000, all the other lease agreements have identical force majeure clauses. However, the lease agreement dated 28 June 2000 shall expire on 30 June 2007, as such we have been informed by COMPANY 1 that this lease will not be sub-leased by COMPANY 1; ZPBL shall enter into a lease agreement with Mr. ……………. after 30 June 2007.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regarding the remaining lease agreements, COMPANY 1 cannot allow ZPBL to enjoy force majeure clauses in the Sub-Lease Agreements which give ZPBL better rights then what COMPANY 1 itself enjoys under the Lease Agreements. In view of the above, we suggest that Article 8 of the sub-lease agreement should be deleted and replaced with the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Article 8: Force Majeure</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ZPBL shall not be responsible for damages to the Premises which are caused due to Acts of God. In case of violence due to war, civil war or civil commotion or of fire, storm, tempest, flood or other irresistible force causing damage to the demised premises rendering it unfit for use and occupation, COMPANY 1 shall ask the Landlord, if so desired by ZPBL, to restore and reinstate the demised premises immediately at the Landlord’s expense and meanwhile the demised premises or the damaged part thereof shall be vacated and the rent or a fair proportionate part thereof shall abate until the demised premises shall be restored and reinstated, and made ready for occupation provided always that if demised premises shall not be restored and reinstated and made ready for occupation, ZPBL shall be at liberty without prejudice to their rights under any other provisions of this lease to give notice in writing to COMPANY 1 determining the said term and thereupon this sub-lease shall stand absolutely determined without prejudice to any claim by either party against the other in respect of any antecedent breach of any covenants conditions herein contained.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any further query, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanking you,</p>
