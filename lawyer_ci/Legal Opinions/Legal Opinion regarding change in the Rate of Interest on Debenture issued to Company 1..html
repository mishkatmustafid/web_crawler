</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Dear  Sirs,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Re: Legal Opinion regarding change in the Rate of Interest on Debenture issued to Company 1. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter dated March 5, 2007 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From perusal of your letter and the documents forwarded to us, it appears that Company 1 (“COMPANY 1”) entered into a Debenture Subscription Agreement dated 6 August, 2006 (“the Agreement”) with COMPANY 2 (“COMPANY 2”). According to this COMPANY 2 subscribed to 8 (eight) debentures of Tk. 50,00,000.00 (fifty lac) only each amounting to Tk. 4,00,00,000.00 (four crore) only and COMPANY 1 were paying half yearly interest @13% since June 5, 2005, as per schedule.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On February 22, 2007, COMPANY 2 issued a letter No. …………. quoting clause 17 of the Agreement and informed COMPANY 1 that the Board of Directors of COMPANY 2 vide a resolution dated 16.02.2007 has increased the rate of interest against Debenture Loan from 13% to 13.50% with effect from March 1, 2006 and requested COMPANY 1 to pay the increased amount since then.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In these circumstances, you have sought our legal opinion as to whether COMPANY 2 can change/amend arbitrarily the rate of interest which was mentioned in the Agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OUR OPINION</span></strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Clauses 2 and 3 of the Agreement states as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“02. the company shall pay interest @ 13% (thirteen percent) to COMPANY 2 from the date of disbursement of Tk. Tk. 4,00,00,000.00 (four crore) only or part thereof.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">03. Interest on the debentures shall be paid to COMPANY 2 on half-yearly basis commencing from the date of disbursement …..”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, Clause (Kha) of the sanction letter No. …………. dated 13.04.2003 (Sanction Letter), issued by COMPANY 2 and duly accepted by COMPANY 1 and which forms part of the Agreement according to Clause 20, states as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“(Kha) The Term of the purchased Debentures shall be 5 years and the interest shall be payable half yearly @13% and the principle amount shall be repayable after five years, at a time.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Board of Directors of COMPANY 2 vide a resolution dated 16.02.2007, by quoting clause 17 of the Agreement, has ‘<strong>apparently</strong>’ increased the rate of interest against Debenture Loan from 13% to 13.50% with effect from March 1, 2006 and requested COMPANY 1 to pay the increased amount since then.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Clause 17 of the Agreement states as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“17. COMPANY 2 hereby reserves the right to stipulate <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">any other conditions in addition to the conditions specified above</span></strong> in order to protect the interest of the of the itself”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">By this clause COMPANY 2 has reserved the right to stipulate <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">any other conditions</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <em>in addition</em> to the conditions specified in the Agreement</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span></strong> Increasing interest from 13% to 13.5% <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">is not an addition</span></strong> of a new clause but an amendment of the existing clause No. 2 of the Agreement which requires the agreement of both the parties to the Agreement for the same to be legally effective and enforceable against the parties thereto.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the premises stated above, if COMPANY 2 wants to revise the interest rate then COMPANY 2 shall have to mutually agree upon a suitable interest rate with COMPANY 1. After mutual agreement between COMPANY 2 and COMPANY 1, an amendment to the Agreement may be executed between the parties incorporating the revised interest rate.</p>
