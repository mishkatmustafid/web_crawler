<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mr. Z</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Address….</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Re:      Legal opinion regarding Unclaimed Dividend and Market </strong><strong>Lot</strong><strong> of Shares. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter no. ………………. dated 30 July 2007on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You have requested us to provide our legal opinion regarding the following issues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. </strong><strong>Whether Company 1 (“the Company”) may forfeit the unclaimed dividend after 6 (six) years and transfer the amount to staff/workers’ welfare fund of the Company?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the provided Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company. Article 156 of the Articles of Association states as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“<em>156. </em><em>All dividends unclaimed for one year after having been declared may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Board of Directors for the benefit of the Company. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">All dividends unclaimed for three year after having been declared may be forfeited by the Board of Directors</span>. However, the Board of Directors, if they think appropriate, may at any time annul such forfeiture and may pay such dividends.</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to this article, all dividends unclaimed for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">three year</span> after having been declared may be forfeited by the Board of Directors. Therefore, we are of the opinion that, the Board of Directors of the Company may<strong> </strong>forfeit any unclaimed dividend amount after three years or more have passed from those being declared. The decision as to what to do with the forfeited amount depends on the Board of Directors and if they want they may transfer the amount to staff/workers’ welfare fund of the Company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. </strong><strong>Whether the Company may charge 3% to 5% service charge on the unclaimed dividend amount which has been claimed after 3 (three) years but before 6 (six) years?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to Article 156, although all dividends unclaimed for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">three year</span> after having been declared may be forfeited, the Board of Directors, if they think appropriate, may at any time annul such forfeiture and may pay such dividends. Therefore, under the Articles of Association, discretion has been give to the Board of Directors as to whether or not the unclaimed dividend amount shall be paid to the shareholder after 3 (three) years. We are of the opinion that, the Board of Directors may, if they think appropriate, charge 3% to 5% service charge on the unclaimed dividend amount which has been claimed after 3 (three) years or more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. </strong><strong>At present the Market lot of Shares of the Company is 20 (twenty) shares. Whether the Company may change the Market </strong><strong>Lot</strong><strong> of Shares to 1 (one) shares?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to Regulation 8 2) (c) of the Listing Regulations of Stock Exchange 1 at the time of listing in the Stock Exchange 1, one of the condition that has to be fulfilled is that,<em> </em>the share certificates shall be issued in such marketable lots as may be determined or approved by the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Therefore, we are of the opinion that any subsequent change in the Market Lot of Shares of the Company has to be with the approval of SEC. You are advised to seek the necessary permission from SEC in this matter.</p>
