In all the said Writ Petitions the High Court Division vide its judgement and order dated 27.06.2001 gave finding that the proceedings of L. A. Case No. 138 of 1961-62 has not yet been completed. The High Court Division also held that the petitioners of the aforesaid Writ Petitioners must either be given an <strong>alternative Plot </strong>or be given compensation according to the <strong>present market value</strong>.
