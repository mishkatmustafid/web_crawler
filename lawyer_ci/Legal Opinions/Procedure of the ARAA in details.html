<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Query:C</span></strong><strong> Can we file money suit against the guarantors for attaching personal properties/shares who have given their personal guarantees? What is the procedure and how much time will it take to complete the entire process? Do we have to file a separate case for this or it can be associated with the money suit filed against the client?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that provision for filing Artha Rin Suit against the guarantors of the principal debtor has been made in Section 6 of the Act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 6 states as follows:–</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“(5) In case of filing suits by financial institutions against the principal debtor, if there is any third party mortgagor or third party guarantor related to the loan, they shall be made defendant; and the judgment, order or decree passed by the Court shall be effective against all the defendants jointly and severally and suit for execution of decree shall be conducted at the same time against all the defendants-debtors:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that in case of recovery of loan by execution of decree, the Court shall firstly, attach the property of the principal debtor-defendant and thereafter, as far as possible, the property of the third party mortgagor and third party guarantor respectively.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In accordance with the above provision of law, it appears that if there is any guarantor present who has provided any guarantee in relation to the loan granted to the principal debtor, they shall be made party as defendant in the same suit that will be filed against the principal debtor and any judgment, order or decree passed by the Court shall be effective against all the defendants jointly and severally. No separate suit for such is required.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SCB may apply for an attachment of the property of the guarantor at the time of filing an execution case for execution of the decree passed in the Artha Rin Suit. However, if it appears that there is a possibility that the guarantor is about to dispose/remove whole or part of his property, it may apply for an attachment of the property while the Artha Rin Suit is still pending before the court. However, please note that in accordance with the provision of section 6 (5) of the Act, in case of recovery of loan by execution of decree, the Court shall firstly, attach the property of the principal debtor-defendant and thereafter as far as possible, the property of the third party mortgagor and lastly third party guarantor.</p>
