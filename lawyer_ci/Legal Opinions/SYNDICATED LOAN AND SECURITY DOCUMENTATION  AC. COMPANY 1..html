Except for the following comments, the others have been incorporated in the relevant drafts.</p>

<p>‘<strong>AVAILABILITY PERIOD</strong>’ means, in respect of the Term Loan Facility, 12 (twelve) months from the date of signing   this Agreement unless extended by the Lenders;</p></td>

<td valign="top" width="144">Clause 4.2(a)</td>
<td valign="top" width="381">Under the Facility   Agreement covenants have to be complied with until all liabilities of the   Borrower are discharged. Compliance of some of the covenants is not even   possible before disbursement. For example, clause 10.1.3 stipulates as under:“the Borrower will use   the Term Loan only for the purpose of setting up the Project as per details of the Information   Memorandum. For the avoidance of doubt, amounts of drawndown under the Term   Loan Facility shall not be applied towards prepayment of any Advances”
<p>Compliance of the   aforesaid covenant is not possible unless and until disbursement is made.</p>
<p>Therefore we are of the   view that there is no necessity in seeking compliance of covenants as   precondition to the disbursements subsequent to first disbursement.</p></td>

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With regard to the comment on WITNESS, please note that it is a usual practice to witness the execution of any deed/document. This practice has been developed for the purpose of ensuring proper execution of deed/document. Besides there is scope of argument that by mere witnessing the instrument the same will not turn to be a bond.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In view of the above we are of the opinion that the documents should be witnessed.</p>
