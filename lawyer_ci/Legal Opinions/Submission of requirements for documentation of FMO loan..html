</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Re:      Submission of requirements for documentation of FMO loan. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letters dated 19 November 2006 14 December 2006 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the documents submitted by you for fulfilling the requirements for documentation of FMO Loan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our comments on the same are as follows:</p>

<p>Loan Agreement with Bank 3</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="413">
<p>Under   “Securities” of the terms and conditions it is stated: “First registered   hypothecation charge over all present and future movable and immovable assets   including books of debts on a pari-passu basis with other lender”. So authorisation   to share the securities on a pari pasu basis is given.</p>
<p>Under   clause 9.1.1 the liabilities of Company 1 to BANK 2 under this Agreement will   continue to rank at least equally and rateably (pari passu) in point of   priority and security with all its other liabilities except :</p>
<p>a)      liabilities giving rise to liens   or rights of set-off in the normal course of trading, the aggregate amount of   which is not material; and</p>
<p>b)      liabilities which are preferred   solely by law and not by reason of any encumbrance.”</p>
<p>Moreover,   according to clause 9.1.2, DBH will not create or permit to exist over all or   any part of its business or assets (present or future) any encumbrances   without the prior consent of BANK 2.</p>
<p>So   although BANK 2’s loan will rank at least equally and rateably (pari passu)   with the previous lenders, but as CBC is a new lender, a No Objection   Certificate (“NOC”) has to be obtained from BANK 2 regarding the accession to   the pari pasu agreement.</p>
<p>There   is no clause in this agreement authorising sharing of the securities on a   pari pasu basis. As such a NOC has to be obtained from IFC regarding the   accession to the pari pasu agreement.</p>
<p>According clause 17.2(v) of this agreement, unless expressly agreed   otherwise by FMO, DBH shall not create or permit to exist any Lien on any   property, revenues or other assets, present or future of DBH except in the   situations contained in sub clauses a to c. As such a NOC has to be obtained from FMO   regarding the accession to the pari pasu agreement.</p>
<p>There   is no clause in this agreement authorising sharing of the securities on a   pari pasu basis. As such a NOC has to be obtained from IFC regarding the   accession to the pari pasu agreement.</p></td>
