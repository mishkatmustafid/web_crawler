<p style="text-align:justify">We refer to your letter no. ………………… dated 15 August 2007 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Advocate Mr. X on behalf of Mr. y and others vide his letter dated 12.08.2007 has responded to our legal reply no. ……………. dated 25.07.2007. We have already explained to Advocate Mr. X vide our letter no. ……………. dated 25.07.2007 that the 79422 shares in question owned by the Directors of The Company 1 in Bank 1 are the subject matter of Court Proceedings and any bonus shares and dividends derived from the shares in question are also sub judice and therefore, the Bank is unable to comment on the matters referred to in his legal notice and is also unable to pay any dividends to Mr. y and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">If Advocate Mr. X on behalf of Mr. y and others, nevertheless, initiates legal proceeding against the Bank in a court of law regarding the payment of dividends of the said shares, then the Bank shall have to defend the case in the court of law.</p>
