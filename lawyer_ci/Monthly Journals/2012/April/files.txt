inter alia, stating  that the suit property originally belonged to Bariz Mahmood, the predecessor of the plaintiffs; that before SA record, he became totally blind and  at that time his sons were minors ; that Bariz Mahmood died leaving two sons namely Abdus Sobhan and Akbor Ali, and one daughter namely Zobeda Khatoon; that zobeda Khatoon died leaving only one daughter namely Firoza Khatoon who got 1/5 Share and plaintiff Nos. 1 and 2 also got accordingly; that the plaintiff Nos. 1  and 2 were in possession in respect of 9/30 portion of suit land and that plaintiff No. 3 was in possession in respect of 1/30  portion of suit land.<br/><br/><strong>3.</strong>  It is further stated that recently at the time of SA operation, the plaintiffs did not keep any document of suit property due to blindness of their father; that the responsibility of preparing SA record was given to Mafizuddin, the predecessor of defendant Nos. 1 to 3; that the plaintiffs came to know from the employee of the  survey  department that  SA record was prepared  in the name of Mafizuddin, the predecessor of defendants Nos.  1 to 3 on the  1<sup>st</sup> Ashin  of 1405 BS and to avoid future problem,  the plaintiffs have filed this suit.<br/><br/><strong>4.</strong>   The defendant Nos. 5 to 7 contested the suit by filing written statement and denied the material allegations made in plaint and asserted, inter alia, that the suit property of schedule ‘Ka’ of CS khatian No. 456 belonged to Barij Mahmood  as riyoti title under Prashanna Kumar Sarker;  that after CS record, due to nonpayment of tax, the suit property was purchased through nilam auction by the Zaminder and took possession there of; that after purchase, zaminder  took selami from Chaco Das and Madan Das and possession was given to them as pattan; that on the basis  of pattan, they  have been possessing and cultivating the suit land; that Chaco Das and Madan Das were cousin and as such Chaco  Das  by amicable  settlement got the suit property and was possessing the same; that later on he sold out to Mafizuddin total 1.61 acres of land by kabala dated 02.04.1956 and also sold 23 decimals of land to Afezuddin; that accordingly  SA record was prepared in the name of Modan Borman , Mafizuddin and Afazuddin; that  the predecessor  of the plaintiffs  did not  get any property; that  Mafizuddin died leaving three sons namely Amir Ali, Zakrul Hoque and Babul Hossain who got the property and have been possessing the same; that Modan Kumar while possessing the suit property died leaving 4 sons Kais Alu Barman, Monglu Barman, Shemcharan Roy and Dhumalu Barman; that Ma Charan   got .18  acres of land, Dhumalu Barman got .18 acres of land, Kalisalu Barman got .18 acres of land, and Monglu got .18 acres of land by kabalas dated 17.1187, 15.09.88,15.10.88 and 18.10.88  respectively who transferred the suit property through kabala to Amir Ali; that   though.72 acres of land were transferred to Amir Ali but actually Amir Ali got 69 acres of land; that thus Amir Ali and his two brothers  were the owners of 1.38 acres  of land; that  Modon  Borman sold. 23 acres of land out of .46 acres of land to Ensan Bibi; that  Ensan Bibi sold.15 acres of land out of .23 acres of land  to Ashedul Hoque; that Abdul Aziz Minor and Ensan Bibi transferred remaining  .08 acres of land  by kabala dated 22.06.99 to Shahabuddin; that Afazuddin  Sheikh sold .23 acres of land to different persons but at present Abdul Hakim and Hossain are in possessing of 11 ½  acres  of land each; that in this way the sons of defendant No. 5 are in possession of 1.53  acres of land for  the last 45 years. Recent record  was also recorded in their names. Plaintiffs have no right title and interest in the suit property. Hence the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/><strong>5.</strong>  The plaintiffs examined 3 witnesses including plaintiff No. 1 and the defendants examined 4 witnesses including defendant No.4.<br/><br/><strong>6.</strong>  The learned Senior Assistant Judge, Syedpur, Nilphamari was pleased to  decree the suit by his judgment and decree dated 30.05.2002. against the defendants and the defendant Nos. 5 to 7 preferred  an appeal against the  judgment and decree of the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Syedpur in the court of learned District Judge, Nilphamari which was registered as other appeal No. 79 of 2002 and on transfer, the appeal was heard by the learned Joint District Judge,  (in charge),  Nilphamari who allowed the appeal by his judgment and decree dated 17.03.2003 reversing the judgment and decree dated 30.05.2002 passed  by the  learned Senior Assistant Judge, Syedpur, Nilphamari in  Other Suit No. 52 of 99 decreeing the suit.<br/><br/><strong>7.</strong>  Being aggrieved by the judgment and decree dated 17.03.2003  passed by the learned Joint District Judge (in charge), Nilphmari, the plaintiffs petitioners preferred this revisional application  and obtained this Rule.<br/><br/><strong>8.</strong>  Mr. AFM Md. Zubair Hussain, the learned Advocate for the  plaintiffs petitioners submits that the learned  Joint District Judge  committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice  in not having considered the material evidence in respect of fact, title and possession of the plaintiffs in the suit land; that the  plaintiffs have been able to prove their prima facie title in the suit land by adducing CS procha but the learned Joint District Judge without giving any cause and reasoning came to an erroneous finding  that the plaintiffs have failed to prove their prima facie title. He further submits that the trial court found the title of the suit property in favour of the plaintiffs and the lower appellate court not having considered the fact  committed an error of law resulting in an error in  his decision occasioning failure of justice and as such the impugned judgment  and decree is not sustainable in law.<br/><br/><strong>9.</strong>   He cited the decision in the case of  Hussain Ahmed Chowdhury @ Ahmed Hossain Chowdhury and others vs. Md. Nurul Amin and others reported in  47 DLR (AD)162 in support of his contention.<br/><br/><strong>10.</strong>   Mr. MA Khaleque, the learned Advocate for the  defendants opposite parties  submits that the plaintiffs petitioners  has no prima facie  title and possession in the suit  land; that the defendants opposite parties  have title and possession in the suit land;  that  Senior Assistant Judge failed to  consider the facts, circumstances and evidence on record.  On the other hand, he submits that the learned Joint District Judge, considering the facts, circumstances and evidence on record rightly allowed the appeal reversing the judgment and decree of the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Nilphamari and as such there is no scope to interfere the impugned judgment and  decree of reversal.<br/><br/><strong>11.</strong>   He cited the decisions in the case of  Abdul Hamid Mollah vs. Md. Abdul Hye and others reported in  49 DLR 428; in the case of  Hriday Ranjan Dey and another vs. Niranjan Dey and others  reported in  6 MLR(AD)267, in the case of  Lal Miah  being dead his heirs Momena Khatun and others vs. Haji Md. Ibrahim Meah and others reported in  28 DLR (AD)61  and in the case of  Khobhari Singh vs. Ram Proshad Roy and another reported in The Calcutta Law Journal 387 in support  of his contention.<br/><br/><strong>12.</strong>   Now the point for determination is whether the court below committed any illegality or  material irregularity  in passing  his decision  which is occasioning any failure of justice.<br/><br/><strong>13.</strong>   There is no denying of the fact that the suit land  originally belonged to  Boriz Mahmood, the predecessor  of the plaintiffs and CS  record was accordingly prepared in his name; that at the time of SA record, Boriz Moahmood became blind and his heirs were minors; that task of  preparing  SA record was given to the  predecessor of the  defendants Nos. 1 to 3 , Mofizuddin who collusively prepared the same in his name; that the plaintiffs are all along in possession and the story of  auction sale is false and fabricated and as such the plaintiff are entitled to get decree.<br/><br/><strong>14.</strong>   The case of the  contesting defendants,  on the other hand, is that the suit land was put to auction due to nonpayment  of rent; that the  zaminder purchased the suit land  by way of auction sale; that the zaminder subsequnelty  leased out the suit land to Checo Das and Monmohan  Das; that  Chaco Das acquired the entire land by way of amicable settlement and sold out 1.61 acres to Mofizuddin and  .23 acres to Afazuddin whose names  were recorded in the SA khatian including Modan Mohan. The further contention of the defendants opposite parties  is that the defendants having title in the suit land have been possessing the same paying  rent to the Zaminder as  well as to the government.<br/><br/><strong>15.</strong>  It is consistent view of our apex court  that plaintiff is to prove his case and he cannot  get a decree on the weakness or failure  of the defendant. The plaintiff is to prove his own case even in a experte proceeding . Disbelieve of the defence case  “ipsofacto’ does  not make the plaintiff’s case believable.  Even in the case of an experte disposal of a suit, the court is required to come to a finding on the assessment of the materials on record that  the plaintiff has been able to prove his case. I find support  of the above view in the case of Khandaker  Mobarok Ali vs. Jahanara Begum reported in 1 ADC(2004) 401 and Jinnatunnessa vs. BD 48 DLR (HCD) 208.<br/><br/><strong>16.</strong>  Now let us see whether the plaintiffs petitioners have succeeded in proving their case. The plaintiffs petitioners have brought this suit simply praying for declaration of title in the suit land as the SA record was prepared in the names of defendants opposite parties. As regards the preparation of SA record in the name Mofizuddin, the predecessor of the defendant Nos. 1 to 3, the contention of the plaitniffs petitioners is that the  predecessor of the plaintiffs namely Boriz Mahmood became blind and his heirs were minors and as such he had given the task of preparing  SA record on the predecessor of the defendant Nos. 1 to 3 namely Mofizuddin who collusively prepared the same in his name. The plaintiffs have totally failed to prove such contention by adducing any evidence.<br/><br/><strong>17.</strong>  On the other hand, the contention of the contesting defendants is that suit  land was put to auction due to nonpayment of rent and zaminder auction purchased the suit land and leased out the same taking salami and giving receipts which were marked exhibit- ‘Ka’ and ‘Ka(1)’ to ‘Ka (6)’. Thereafter the defendants purchased suit land  by way of kabala  dated 02.04.1946 marked exhibit  ‘kha’, kabala dated 10.12.1962 marked exhibit – ‘ga’, kabala dated 22.06.1999 marked exhibit ‘Gha’, kabala dated 23.01.1984 marked exhibit – ‘Cha’ kabala dated 02.05.2983 marked exhibit ‘Cha’ (1), kabala dated  17.11.1987 exhibit ‘Cha’ (2), Kabala dated 15.10.1988 exhibit ‘Cha’ (3), Kabala dated 15.09.1988 exhibit  6(4) and Kabala dated 18.10.1990 marked exhibit  6(5).It is  also the contention  of the contesting defendants that field record marked exhibit “ Uma” was prepared  in the names of the defendants by virtue of the above  mentioned documents. The further  contention of the contesting defendants is that  the defendants have been possessing the suit land on the basis of these kabalas paying rent  to the government and these rent receipts are marked exhibits Ka(3) to Ka(6). It is not the contention of the plaintiffs that these  kabala and rent receipts are forged and fraudulent.  The only contention of plaintiffs is that the defendants have failed to file any papers of auction sale.<br/><br/><strong>18.</strong>  In this respect the contention of the defendants  opposite parties is that though no paper of auction was filed by the defendants  opposite  parties, that does not  debar them from  getting relief because their subsequent papers of taking pattan, deeds  and rent receipts have filled up the lacunas to understand that the  suit land was auction sold due to nonpayment of rent.<br/><br/><strong>19.</strong>  On perusal of the record, it  appears that  the plaintiffs have totally failed to prove their possession  in the suit land. On the contrary, the defendants by adducing reliable documentary and oral evidence  have succeeded in proving their long possession in the suit land for which the  learned trial court also categorically  admitted the possession of the defendants in the suit land even  before the preparation of SA record. Recent field record marked exhibit ‘Uma’ is also the document of possession of the defendants.<br/><br/><strong>20.</strong>   In this respect the learned Advocate for the  opposite parties cited the decision in case of Hridoy Ranjan  Day the another vs. Niranjan Dey and others reported in 6 MLR (AD)267 wherein it  has  been held that person entering into possession of land on the basis of defective title document and having been in continuous  possession there of  for more than 12 years acquires title preferred by adverse possession as contemplated under section 28 of the Lamination Act, 1908 and as such he is entitled  to get  decree for declaration of his title. In the instant case  since  the defendants  opposite  parties have been in possession on the  basis of zamindery receipt, various deeds, SA records, government rent receipts and field record which are  though defective title still they have acquired title on the basis of continuous possession in the suit land for more  than 12 years. A person remains in possession of a land on the basis of defective title for more than 12 years can acquire title.  Person in possession of land can only be dispossessed by another having better title. In the instant case, the plaintiffs petitioners have acquired no better title in the suit land than that of the defendants opposite parties.<br/><br/><strong>21.</strong>  In this connection I may profitable refer the decisions in the case of Abdul Hamid Mollah  vs. Abdul Hye reported in 49 DLR 418 wherein it has been held that the defendant being in possession of the suit land from before  the filing of the  suit, the plaintiffs was to pray for recovery of khas possession by way of consequential  relief and only a simple suit  for declaration in not maintainable. In the instant case, the plaintiffs petitioners appear to be out of possession for more than 12 years, their simple suit for declaration is legally barred without praying for consequential relief of the recovery of khas possession.<br/><br/><strong>22.</strong>  The scope of section 115(1) of the code of Civil Procedure is now  well settled.  Consistent pronouncements by the Highest court of the country have made it abundantly clear that a court  of revision under section 115(1) CPC can interfere with the findings of fact as the final court of facts only in exceptional circumstances  when the findings are shockingly pervers or these are vitiated by non reading and misreading of the material evidence  or mis-construction of any important documents affecting the merit of the suit. The learned advocate for the plaintiffs  petitioners has not been able  to find out any such legal infirmity  in the impugned judgment which calls for  any interference.<br/><br/><strong>23.</strong>   In the facts and circumstances of the case and the materials on record. I am of the view  that the learned court of appeal below on proper consideration of the evidence on record and after adverting  to the reasons assigned by the trial court reversed the judgment passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Syedpur, Nilphamari. The findings recorded by the learned court of appeal  below are  well supported by the evidence on record and are based on correct principle of the appreciation of the evidence. I find no illegality in the impugned judgment to call for any interference by this court exercising revisional power.<br/><br/><strong>24.</strong>   In the result the revision fails and the Rule is discharged without any order as to cost.<br/><br/>        Send down the L.C.R at once.<br/> </div></div></div>

The land covering an area of 43 acres appertaining to R.S. Khatian No.157 originally belonged to Lamio Matbar to the extent of 8 annas share and Khemari Mongi and Chamakhi Mongi to the extent of 2 and 6 annas shares respectively. The Revenue Officer by an order dated 03.04.1953 made 17.79 acres of land as khas out of the share belonging to Lamio Matbar in Miscellaneous Case No.09 of 1952 under section 20 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and the remaining .372 acre was duly recorded in his name in S.A. Khatian No.240. The shares of Khemari and Chamakhi Mongi were recorded in the S.A. Khatian No.142. Against the decision of making khas, Lamio Matbar preferred an appeal before the learned Special Judge, Bakergonj, who on consideration of the evidence on record set aside the order passed by the Revenue Officer. The Additional Collector, Bakergonj by an order dated 12.07.1955 in Miscellaneous Case No.192/55-56 directed to realize the rent from Lamio Matbar for those lands. He also directed not to disturb the possession of Lamio Matbar in those 17.79 acres of land. Subsequently, the Revenue Officer corrected the Khatian in Miscellaneous Case No.30 of 1977-78. The plaintiffs purchased the suit land from Lamio Matbar and had their names recorded in the khatian between 1956 and 1963. In 1987 some of the defendants claimed that they had taken settlement of the suit land from the Government denying the title of the plaintiffs to the suit land and hence the plaintiffs have been constrained to file the aforesaid suit.<br/><br/><strong>4</strong>.         The Defendants filed three sets of written statements. Their case, in essence, is that suit land is khas land of the Government which settled the same to the defendants in different settlement cases and they have been in possession of the suit land by paying rent to the Government regularly. Defendant Nos.4 to 11 also stated in their written statement that the suit land is the khas land of the Government which settled 13.03 acres of land to these defendants who are landless cultivators and on the contrary the plaintiffs have no title to, and possession in, the suit land. Defendant Nos.25 to 28 also filed a separate written statement but ultimately did not contest the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>5</strong>.         Trial Court by its judgment and decree dated 29.10.1991 decreed the suit in part for 17.19 acres of land.<br/> <br/><strong>6</strong>.         Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree of the trial Court, the plaintiffs (respondents herein) preferred Title Appeal No.116 of 1992, the Government preferred Title Appeal No.5 of 1992 and some of the defendants preferred Title Appeal No.87 of 1992.<br/> <br/><strong>7</strong>.         All those appeals were analogously heard and disposed of by the learned Additional District Judge, Patuakhali, who by the judgment and decree dated 04.05.1998 allowed the Title Appeal Nos.87 of 1992 and 5 of 1992 and dismissed the Title Appeal No.116 of 1992 and set aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court and also dismissed the suit as a whole.<br/> <br/><strong>8</strong>.         Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree of the appellate Court, the plaintiffs preferred three revisional applications before the High Court Division and obtained Rules being Civil Revision Nos.3863, 4612 and 4613 of 1998.<br/> <br/><strong>9</strong>.         A learned Single Judge of the High Court Division made the Rules absolute by the judgment and order dated  23.07.2002 and decreed the suit in full.<br/> <br/><strong>10</strong>.       Against the judgment and order of the High Court Division passed in the civil revisions, the Government of Bangladesh, represented by the Deputy Commissioner, Patuakhali and other defendants preferred Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.196, 197 and 198 of 2003 before this Division and leave was granted on 25.07.2004 resulting in Civil Appeal Nos.185-87 of 2004.<br/> <br/><strong>11</strong>.       Mr. Kurunamoy Chakma, learned Deputy Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the appellants in all the appeals, submits that the suit land was made khash as per provision of section 20 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and that the High Court Division without taking into consideration this legal aspect reversed the judgment delivered by the appellate Court, which allowed two appeals and dismissed the other.   <br/> <br/><strong>12</strong>.       We have considered the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division and the other papers in the paper book. Admittedly, the suit land along with other lands originally belonged to Lamio Matbar. The Revenue Officer by an order dated 03.04.1953 made 17.79 acres of land khas out of the share belonging to Lamio Matbar in Miscellaneous Case No.09 of 1952 under section 20 of the State Acquisition of the Tenancy Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act). Against the decision of making khas, Lamio Matbar preferred Special Appeal No.290 of 1954 before the learned Special Judge, Bakergonj, who on consideration of the evidence on record, set aside the order passed by the Revenue Officer. The Additional Collector, Bakergonj, by an order dated 12.07.1955 in Miscellaneous Case No.192/55-56 directed to realize rent from Lamio Matbar from those lands. He also directed not to disturb the possession of the Lamio Matbar in those 17.79 acres of land. Subsequently, the Revenue Officer recorded the khatian in Miscellaneous Case No.30/77-78 in respect of those lands. The plaintiffs purchased the suit land from Lamio Matbar and had their names recorded in the khatian in respect of their purchased land. In 1987 some defendants claimed that they had taken settlement of the suit land from Government denying the title of the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/><strong>13</strong>.       In order to address, the submission of the learned Deputy Attorney General, it is necessary to go through the leave granting order. Leave was granted to consider the following submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioners.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“I. The land in question is the khas land of the Government and the Government settled the same to various defendants and they have been possession the same by paying regular rent and the plaintiffs have no right, title, interest and possession and that the land has been made khas under section 20 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. It is argued that the revenue officer by order dated 03.04.1953 declared that 17.79 acres of land were the khas land of the original owner Lamio Matbar and the original owner successfully challenged the order in Special Appeal No.2904 of 1954 before the Special Judge, Bakergonj and the High Court Division committed an error in arriving at a finding that since the revenue authority did not take any action as per direction of the Special Judge and accepted rent from the original owners, they have acquired right, title and interest. It is further argued that the original owner did not challenge the judgment and order passed by the Special/Subordinate Judge before the higher court and the same is binding upon the revenue authority as well as the original owner and the revenue authority has no power to pass any order for collection of rent from the original owner and that the High Court Division having considered that the schedule and the provision of section 20 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act declared that the suit is the khas land of the Government and has accordingly been recorded in khatian No.1 Lamio Matbar ceased to have any right, title and interest in the same land and as such the transferee from him has acquired no right, title and interest.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/> <br/><strong>14</strong>.       To begin with, it is necessary to quote section 53 of the Act as under :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“53. <strong>Appeal to the Special Judge</strong>-Any person aggrieved by an order of the Revenue Authority under sub-section (2) of section 19 passed on appeal filed in respect of the determination of rent or recording of possession of any land, or by an entry made in a record-of-rights under sub-section(2) of section 31 relating to the determination of rent or recording of possession of any land (or by an order settling fair and equitable rent of any land under sub-section (2) of section 46A), may present an appeal against such order or entry within three months from the date of the final publication under section 42 of the Compensation Assessment-roll to which such appeal relates, to the Special Judge appointed under sub-section (4) of section 48. The decision of the Special Judge on such an appeal shall, notwithstanding anything contained in section 52, be final.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>15</strong>.       Having considered the section, it appears that the decision made by the Special Judge on such appeal shall be final. The learned Special Judge in the concluding portion of the judgment stated that the procedure initially adopted by the Revenue Officer was correct. He allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the Revenue Officer dated 03.04.1953. He also observed that the revenue authority might take appropriate action according to law in the light of the observations contained in his judgment. The learned Special Judge regretted that in this ex-parte case, he had to make observation detrimental to the appellant Lamio Matbar.<br/> <br/><strong>16</strong>.       The Special Judge as mentioned in section 53 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act (in short the Act) is appointed under sub-section (4) of section 48 of the Act which runs as follows :<br/><em>“(4) The Government may appoint one or more persons who has or have exercised the power of a District Judge or a Subordinate Judge to be a Special Judge or Special Judges for the purposes of hearing appeals which may be preferred to him or them under the provisions of this Act and of inquiring into disputes as to the title to receive any compensation under a Compensation Assessment-roll finally published under section 42 or as to the apportionment of any compensation referred to him under section 60.”</em><br/> <br/><strong>17</strong>.       Having considered sub-section (4) of section 48 and sections 51 and 55 of the Act, it appears that a District Judge or a Subordinate Judge to be appointed as a Special Judge is not a <em>‘persona designata’</em> but a Court, who exercises the power of a District Judge or a Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) and he has to follow the procedures prescribed under section 55 of the Act. He is to determine and to decide the right of the parties; therefore, he is a ‘Court’ within the meaning of the Civil Courts Act,1987. Since the Special Judge is a ‘Court’ such Court is subordinate to the High Court Division. Any order passed by a Special Judge is amenable to the High Court Division under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The word final in section 53 means that no appeal lies against the decision of the Special Judge but it does not take away the revisional powers of the High Court Division.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>       In the case of <strong>A.K.M. Rurul Amin Vs. District Judge and Appellate Election Tribunal, Bhola and others (1986) 38 DLR (AD) 172,</strong> the question arose whether the District Judge while acting under section 29 (4) of section 29 of the Local Government (Union Parishad) Ordinance,1983 (in short, the Ordinance) is a <em>‘persona designata’</em> or a Court. In the above case, this Division held as follows :<br/><em>“When a District Judge has been defined as “the Judge of a Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction” by using this expression for constituting the election appellate tribunal and empowering to hear him an appeal from the decision of an Election Tribunal, it can not be intended that he is to act as a ‘persona designata’. While making such legislation the law-making authority is supposed to know the definition of such expression provided in existing Act. Also, from the very context in which it has been used, it is evident that District Judge is not to act in his private capacity or any capacity other than a Court. This would appear from the qualifying words “within whose jurisdiction the election in dispute was held” used in Article (section) 29(4) of the Ordinance. The qualifying words exclude any other capacity which may be attributed to him, obviously enough, such jurisdiction means and refers to the jurisdiction he exercises while sitting as a Court.”   </em><br/> <br/><strong>19</strong>.       From the above case, it appears that while acting under sub-section (4) of section 29 of the Ordinance as Election Appellate Tribunal, the District Judge is not a <em>‘persona designata’</em> but a Court. Therefore, this Division has concluded that against the decision of Election Appellate Tribunal, an aggrieved party may file a revisional application under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure before the High Court Division. In the case of <strong>Pijush Kanti Chowshury and others vs. Abdur Rashid and others (1971) 23 DLR 60,</strong> it has been held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The learned Special Judge exercises jurisdiction under section 53 of the East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. Section 55 of the Act clearly lays down that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code shall, as possible, apply to all appeals presented to a Special Judge under section 53 and some other sections. In our opinion, the provision of section 55 of this Act is conclusive on the point that these appeals are to be considered not by ‘a persons designate’ but by a Court as contemplated under the Code of Civil Procedure.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>20</strong>.       From the above, it transpires that the Special Judge as mentioned in section 53 is not a ‘persona designata’ but a Court as contemplated under the Code of Civil Procedure. Though finality has been attached to the decision delivered by the Special Judge, the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court Division under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure is available against such decision. <br/> <br/><strong>21</strong>.       Moreover, similar view has also been taken in the case of <strong>Abdul Mannan Vs. Mofiz Uddin (1958) 10 DLR 527.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>22</strong>.       Be that as it may, nobody came forward to invoke the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court Division.<br/> <br/><strong>23</strong>.       Having gone through the judgments of the Courts below, it appeared that the revenue authority had not taken any action according to law in the light of the observations contained in the judgment passed by the learned Special Judge. The learned Special Judge delivered his judgment on 23.04.1959 but the Additional Collector, Bakergonj by an order dated 12.07.1959 directed to realize rent from Lamio Matbar from those lands in Miscellaneous Case No.192/55-56.It is also curious to note that the Additional Collector also directed not to disturb the possession of the Lamio Matbar in those 17.79 acres of land. Subsequently, the Revenue Officer corrected the khatian in Miscellaneous No.30/77-78.<br/> <br/><strong>24</strong>.       From the aforesaid action of revenue authority, it appears that Lamio Matbar was allowed to continue his possession in the aforesaid lands and that the revenue authority failed to take possession of the excess land in possession of Lamio Matbar. It appears from Exhibits-2(ka) and 3 that Lamio Matbar filed an application to the Additional Collector, Bakergonj to accept rent from him and to make necessary arrangement so that he could peacefully possess the suit land. On 12.05.1955, the Additional Collector passed an order to the effect that Lamio Matbar would remain in possession of the said land and directed the authority to realize rent from him. He also directed the District Manager and Circle Officer not to disturb possession of Lamio Matbar. Therefore, it appears that the authority protected the right and possession of the Lamio Matbar in the suit land without dealing with the matter in the light of the observations made by the learned Special Judge. Record also reveals that the Additional Collector also allowed Lamio Matbar to transfer the suit land. Neither the Government nor the other defendants in their written statement or in their evidence claimed that any decision of making the suit land khash by the Government was notified in the official gazette and compensation was assessed and the same was published.<br/> <br/><strong>25</strong>.       Sub-section 1 of section 39 laid down that compensation payable to a rent receiver, a cultivating raiyat, a cultivating under-raiyat or a non-agricultural tenant, in respect of the acquisition of lands in his khash possession which he is not entitled to retain under section 20, shall be determined in accordance with the table mentioned in section 39. Sub-section 2 of section 39 then states that said that any dispute regarding classification of the lands for the purpose of sub-section 1 shall be referred to the prescribed revenue authority whose decision thereon shall be final. Section 40 deals with preliminary publication of Compensation Assessment-roll and then section 41 deals with appeal which can be presented with regard to assessment of compensation against the decision of the revenue authority. It is after all these that under section 42 the final publication of Compensation Assessment-roll is made. Section 44 then says that on the publication of a notification in the official gazette under sub-section 2 of section 43 declaring that compensation mentioned in that section shall ensue, one of them, being that all the interests that are acquirable under the Act but have not acquired under Chapter-II of the Act shall “<em>with the effect from the fist day of the agricultural year next following the date of publication of such notification in the Official Gazettee, be deemed to have been acquired by the Government and vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances</em>”.       <br/> <br/><strong>26</strong>.       A close reading of the provisions made in the sections 42,43 and 44 of the Act point to inevitable conclusions that every interest which is liable to be acquired under the Act has to be paid for and that except in the cases of acquisition under Chapter-II of the Act the interests which are acquirable vest in the Government only if assessment of compensation in regard to the same has been made and published as provided in the Act. Record reveals that the suit land has not been included in the Compensation Assessment roll of the area. Therefore, it can not be contended that the said land has vested in the Government merely because it was acquirable and because there has been notification in respect of the area under section 43(2) of the Act.<br/> <br/><strong>27</strong>.       Another important aspect is that by Ordinance No.XV of 1961 the retainable quantity of khash land has been increased from 100 to 375 standard bighas. In the case of <strong><em>Sree Gour Nitai Saha Vs. Providence of East Pakistan,</em> <em>(1970) 22 DLR 143</em></strong> it has been held that any attempt to take away and settle lands in khas possession of the tenant when the area of such lands is not in excess of 375 bighas will be unauthorized in law.<br/> <br/><strong>28</strong>.       The High Court Division came to a finding that the total land under possession of Lamio Matbar was not more than 375 standard bighas before or after amendment of proviso to section 20 of the Act. The High Court Division further found that the Government failed to produce any document to substantiate that the suit land was in excess of 375 bighas belonging to Lamio Matbar.<br/> <br/><strong>29</strong>.       Having considered Exhibit-4 series the High Court Division found that Lamio Matbar transferred some land after taking permission and approval of the Collector and that the Collector considered the law resisting the transfer which came into operation on 14.12.1948 and gave permission and approval to Lamio Matbar to transfer the same. Therefore, the Government now can not claim the suit property which was purchased by the plaintiffs and their predecessors. The High Court Division also found that there is nothing in the evidence on record that the Government took over possession of the excess land of Lamio Matbar; rather the Additional Collector, Bakergonj, directed the revenue authority as well as the Manager to realize rent from him as it appeared in Exhibit-2(ka) and Exhibit-Ka, it appeared that the Revenue Officer found possession of the plaintiffs in the suit land.<br/> <br/><strong>30</strong>.       In the light of the findings made before, we find that the petitioners could not make out any case to interfere with the impugned judgment and order delivered by the High Court Division. The findings arrived at and the decision made by the High Court Division are based on proper appreciation of laws and facts.<br/>           <br/>Accordingly, all the 3 (three) appeals are dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/>           <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

After   one   year,   vide   certificate   dated 02.10.1989 issued by the Executive Engineer, plaintiff came to know that the alignment and design of the aforesaid work has been again changed and re-fixed from country side to deep river side and duration of the said work extended up to 1989-90; subsequently, duration of the aforesaid work was extended up to June 1991, which is evident from Certificate dated 29.05.1990 issued by Executive Engineer, Gomati Water Development Board, Comilla. Thereafter, plaintiff completed the work i. e. the north side of Kaladumuria River from Eliotgonj to Kushiara and able to complete the entire work within 30.06.1991. Plaintiff was entitled to get Tk. 98,84,098.00 but he was paid Tk. 16,29,436.00   only.   Plaintiff on  02.09.1992  submitted  bill  and  requested defendant  opposite  party No.   1   to  pay the  bill.   Subsequently,  plaintiff petitioner on 02.09.1992 submitted representation and asked for settlement of the bill through Arbitration. Since the defendant opposite parties failed to start Arbitration proceedings, plaintiff-petitioner by issuing legal notice dated 01.04.1995  upon  the  opposite parties,  appoint an Arbitrator under the Arbitration Act of 1940 to settle the dispute.<br/><br/><strong>3.         </strong>After several bouts of legal proceedings for appointment of arbitrator, lastly, Mr, Justice M. A. Wahab (Retired) was appointed as arbitrator who gave the disputed award.<br/><br/><strong>4.</strong>         Opposite party No. 4 contested the case by filing written objection denying the material allegations made in the plaint.<br/><br/><strong>5.</strong>         It is admitted fact the arbitrator did not submit the award of his own but as per direction of the Court, submitted award to Court on 20.08.2005. Defendant-opposite party filed objection on 09.10.2005. Here start the litigation between the parties afresh and ultimately this revision was filed. Plaintiff filed application for rejecting the written objection on the ground that it was filed beyond time and also no security accompanied with written objection. Learned Judge accepted the written objection on the ground that since the award was filed not by the arbitrator on his own motion, but as per direction of the Court, as such, it was an illegality and objection having been filed in Court, although after period of limitation, but when the arbitration itself suffers from many illegalities, the delay can be condoned. On the question of furnishing security submitted as claimed by the opposite party, the learned Judge observed that he find security with the record, as such, since security has been filed, all the requirements of law having been complied with, the objection as filed can be accepted.<br/><br/><strong>6.</strong>            Mr. A.

Nazrul Islam, learned Advocate, appearing for the plaintiff-petitioner referred to the Limitation Act particularly Article 158 arid 175 and submits that Arbitration Act being special law, the time limit provided in the sections shall be construed as mandatory and Section 5 of Limitation Act has no manner of application in this matter. Learned Advocate further submits that the security as filed by the opposite party is nothing but personal bond and if the plaintiff be given decree then it will take 100s of litigations to get the decreetal money from the opposite party. Learned Advocate    further   submits   that opposite   party   being   a   government functionaries, the security ought to be submitted in bank guarantee or pay order so that decree if passed, the decreetal amount can be realized without further litigation. Learned Advocate mainly submits that written objection having filed out of time without security is liable to be rejected outright.<br/><br/><strong>7.</strong>            In support of his submission, learned Advocate relied on the case of Abul Bashar Vs. Investment Corporation of Bangladesh, reported in 52 DLR (AD) 178, Nilkantha Sidramappa Ningasher pellant Vs. Kashinath Somanna Ningabo and others, reported in AIR 1962 (SC) 666, Sh. Mahboob Alam Vs.

Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh reported in 4 BLC 407, 18 BLT (AD) 380, 1 BLC 81 and also referred to some decisions of Indian jurisdictions. Learned Advocates prays that the rule may be made absolute.<br/><br/><strong>8.</strong>         Mr. Kamal Ul- Alam, learned Advocate along with Mr. Mir Joynal Abedin, learned Advocate, appearing for the opposite parties, submits that, since the arbitrator did not submit the report to the Court himself as such question of limitation does not arise in this case as, as soon as the opposite party came to know of filing of the award in Court, defendant No. 1 appeared and filed written objection. Learned Advocate further submits that date of knowledge can not be construed to be the date of notice, there is difference in between knowledge and notice and when the opposite party gathered knowledge he filed written objection and also security as such opposite partv cannot be thrown out of Court on the ground of limitation. Learned Advocate further submits that the security as submitted was submitted in accordance with the provision of law and this security is a legal one and was accepted by the Court as such filing of security cannot be challenged.<br/><br/><strong>9.</strong>         Mr. Kamal Ul-Alam, learned Advocate, referred to the decision of Sonali Bank Vs. Hare Krishna Das and others, reported in 49 DLR 282 where their lordships observed that,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"The liability of the principal debtor is co-extensive with that of the guarantor. A creditor is at liberty to pursue either the principal debtor or the guarantor according to his sweet will for realisation of his dues or he can proceed against both of them simultaneously."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>10. </strong>      Learned Advocate also referred to the decisions of Gangaram Vs. Chief Engineer (Projects), Orissa and other, reported in AIR 1983 (Ori) 262, case of Chokolinga Chttiar Vs. Dandayuthapani Chettiar, reported in AIR 1928 (Mad) 1262, the case of M R Sikder Vs.

Sikder Construction Ltd and another, reported in 8 LG (AD) 75, the case of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartipakkha (RAJUK) Vs. M N Mam and Associates Ltd. and another, reported in 54 DLR 161. He lastly prays that the rule should be discharged.<br/><br/><strong>11.</strong>       We will refer to the decisions cited by the parties if required.<br/><br/><strong>12.</strong>       Points formulated on the pleadings of the parties are (i) whether the written objection can be accepted when it is filed beyond the period of limitation as prescribed under Section 30 of the Arbitration Act and secondly, whether the security as deposited in the Court can be said to be filed as per Section 33 of the Arbitration Act.<br/><br/><strong>13.</strong>       Let us take up first point first for consideration. From the order sheet of the case it appears that award was filed in Court on 20.08.2005. From order dated 27.08.2005, it appears that the learned Advocate for the Water Development Board in the margin of the order put his signature by signing. Thereafter, it appears that the learned Advocate for the Water Development Board took adjournment on 03.09.2005, 06.09.2005, 21.09.2005 lor filing written objection and on 09.10.2005 written objection was filed. Mr. A. K. M. Nazrul Islam, learned Advocate, submits, this is actually beyond the period of limitation as prescribed under section 30 of the Arbitration Act. Let us quote section 30 of the Act, Section 30 speaks,<br/><br/>"Grounds for setting aside award -An award shall not be set aside except on one or more of the following grounds namely: -</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>that an  arbitrator  or umpire has  misconducted himself or the proceedings;</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>that an award has been made after the issue of an order by the Court superseding the arbitration or after arbitration proceedings have become invalid under section 35;</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>that an award has been improperly procured or is otherwise invalid." If any party wants to set aside an award he must come within these three categories otherwise award shall remain valid.</em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Limitation filing written objection is 30 days as prescribed in Article 158 of the Limitation Act which is:-</div><table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td style="height: 38px; width: 241px; text-align: center;">Description of  application</td><td style="height: 38px; width: 138px; text-align: center;">Period of limitation</td><td style="height: 38px; width: 211px; text-align: center;">Time from which period begins to run</td></tr><tr><td style="height: 90px; width: 241px; text-align: center;">158- Under the Arbitration Act, 1940.(X of 1940) set aside an award or to get an award remitted for reconsideration.</td><td style="height: 90px; width: 138px; text-align: center;">Thirty days</td><td style="height: 90px; width: 211px; text-align: center;">The  date  of service  of the notice of filing of the award.<br/>			 </td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>14.</strong>       For disposal of this rule, relevant sections of Arbitration Act as well as Limitation Act are required to be referred to. We have already referred Section 30 and 33 before. Now, we refer Section 37 and 42. Section 37 runs as:- "(1) All the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1908 (IX of 1908) shall apply to arbitrations as they apply to proceedings in Court. By this section, Arbitration Act give entry of Limitation Act in the proceeding of arbitration subject to the provision of Arbitration Act i. e. where the Arbitration Act itself provide for limitation then the period mentioned in the Limitation Act shall have no applicability as Arbitration Act being a special law its provisions shall have the effect over the period mentioned in the Limitation Act. When provision of Limitation Act made applicable to special law it applies specially and in applying the provision of Limitation Act Court must guard itself so that by applying the provision of Limitation Act the provision of special Act would not be given a meaning by which the special feature of special law would stand as nugtory. According to Black's Law Dictionary special law defined as 'a law that pertains to and affects a particular case, person, place, or thing, as oppose to the general public. But it is a paramount law as it continue in force with its special identity for an indefinite period i. e. a provision of law, which is not applicable generally, but which applies to a particular or specified subject or class of subject.' Since provision of Arbitration Act applies to a certain class of person with its provision, is a special law, as such, when it made provision of applicability of Limitation Act, the provision of Limitation Act should be applied specifically, strictly and specially.<br/><br/><strong>15.</strong>       Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam, made his submission that since no notice was served by the Arbitrator, this opposite party filed the written objection within time of his knowledge with adequate security. From the papers produced, it appears that opposite party appears in the suit on 03.09.2005 and filed application for adjournment for filing written objection and court: allowed time and fixed 06.09.2005, when it again adjourned at the instant of opposite party and fixed 21.09.2005, when it again adjourned at the instance of the opposite party and fixed 09.10.2005 when written objection was filed. From 03.09.2005 upto 09.10.2005 is 36 days i. e. more than 30 days as provided under Article 158 of the Limitation Act. It is argued that notice of filing of the award was not served but when opposite party appeared on 03.09.2005 at that time this point may be taken, but on subsequent dates, till filing of written objection, opposite party continue with definite knowledge of filing of award as such, each day opposite party spend with definite knowledge of award in court and opposite himself allowed time to run out as opposite party filed the written objection on the 36th day.<br/><br/><strong>16.</strong>       Let us refer to the decisions on this subject. In the case of Rajdhani Unnayanun Kartipakhya Vs. N. M. Alam and Associates Ltd and another, 54 DLR 161 where a Division Bench of the High Court Division held, "It appears from the record that the defendant-petitioner appeared in court on 3-2-1999 and after taking several adjournments filed the written objection on 28.3.2000 which is, in our opinion, not at all time barred. It also appears from the impugned order dated 7.5.2000 of the Court below that the Court not only rejected the written objection on the ground that the same was barred under Article 158 of the Limitation Act, but also for want of security deposit relating to the award. The order of the learned Court below is quoted is a clear bar against taking such a plea.<br/><br/><strong>17.</strong> This decision did not find support from other decisions of this sub­continent.<br/><br/><strong>18.</strong>     Next, the case of Dhaka Leather Complex Ltd BCIC Vs.  Sikder Construction Ltd. and another, 55 DLR 578, where it is observed and held as "Mr. Samad read order dated 20.3.2002 and submitted that by the order the written statement filed was accepted and after such acceptance, the delay, if any, in filing the written objection must be held to be condoned.<br/><br/><strong>19.</strong>       We are unable to accept such submission. Receipt of the written objection by the court cannot be termed as condonation of the delay in making the objections. The defendant never sought for condonation of the delay by making any application. Limitation under Article 158 of the Limitation Act goes to the root of the right to set aside or get the award remitted for reconsideration. In the circumstances, there is no escape from the conclusion that the objection filed was out of time by more than a year and such objections did not deserve any consideration, and was, therefore, liable to be rejected outright upon such ground of limitation alone. It was however, rejected on merit."<br/><br/><strong>20.</strong>       Next, the case Bangladesh Water Development Board and others -Vs-Progati Prakanshali and another, 49 DLR 335, it is observed and held as it appears from the order sheet that he appeared before the court on 15.5.1994 and ultimately filed the written objection/application under section 33 of the Arbitration Act on 20.7.1994 which is beyond the period of limitation and there is nothing on record to dislodge the finding of the learned Subordinate Judge on that point. It is further admitted that at the time of filing of the written objection/application under section 33 of the Arbitration Act the second party appellant did not make any deposit as was required under section 33 of the Arbitration Act and that rendered the application under section 33 of the Arbitration Act a nullity in the eye of law for non-compliance of the provision to section 33 of the said Act and the learned Subordinate Judge rightly took, the view that non-compliance of the proviso to section 33 of the Arbitration Act rendered the said written objection/application under section 33 of the Arbitration Act non existent in the eye of law.<br/><br/><strong>21.</strong>       In the case of Hazi Amir Aux -Vs- Sonokhau, PLD 1979 Kar 45, it is observed and held as <em>"Mr. Zafar submitted that the trial court has no power to extend and in support of this submission he referred me to judgment of a Single Judge of the West Pakistan High Court as Thai Development Authority -vs- Nisar Ahmed Qureshi( PLD 1962 Lah 830). The learned Single Judge held in that case section 5 of the Limitation Act was not available to extend time under Article 158 of the Limitation Act, no Judgment to the contrary has been cited. I would therefore, follow this Lahore case, and the result is that the trial Court's order permitting the respondent to file objections after 30 days as illegal. As the objections were thus time-barred, the First Appellate Court erred in setting aside the award on the basis of these time-barred application. And by so doing it committed an error affecting its jurisdiction, therefore, the Revision should be allowed."</em><br/><br/><strong>22.</strong>       In the case of Mol. Enterprises Inc -Vs- Bangladesh, 1999 (VII) BLT 265, it is held as 'The application challenging the validity of the Award having been filed beyond limitation, the same could not be entertained and section 5 of the Limitation Act was not at all applicable for condonation of delay. Similarly, the Court also got no jurisdiction to decide the proceeding under section 14 of the Act. Support for this proposition of law is sought to be drawn from authorities placed before us on behalf of the appellant which are Mohamed Esoof -vs- VR Subramanyam and another Ganesh Chandra Misra -vs- Artatrana Misra, and others, AIR 1965 Orissa 17, Hastimal Dalichand Bora and others, AIR 1965 Orissa 17 Hastimal Balichand Bora and others -vs- Hiralal Motichand Mutha, AIR 1954 Bomiay 243, Divi Dilla -vs- Babu Ram, AIR 1927 Lahore 273, wherein it is laid down that a Court has no jurisdiction to entertain any application for setting aside an award if it is filed after the period of limitation of 30 days as enhanced in Article 158 of the Limitation Act and the Court also got no jurisdiction to condone the delay under section 5 of the Limitation Act which got no manner of application in this regard. In the unreported case Civil Appeal No. 1 of 1984, Khurshid Anwar and another, appellants -vs- Jamil Akthar, respondent, arising out of Civil Revision No. 149(c) of 1982, judgment dated January 14, 1985 their Lordships of the Appellate Division considered the question whether the inherent power under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure was attracted in condoning the delay in entertaining an objection to the Award given by the Arbitrator which was filed beyond 30 days ^ prescribed in Article 158 of the Limitation Act. The Appellate Division answered the question in the negative. The observations of the Appellate Division is couched in the following language:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"This clearly shows that the respondent got knowledge of the  filing of the award   in Court and as such, even if limitation starts from this date still the objection is found to have been filed beyond 30 days as prescribed in Article 158 of the Limitation Act. The provision for exercising Court's inherent power under section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code is not attracted to a case specifically governed by statute."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>23.</strong>       In the decision of 52 DLR (AD) 178 it is held Arbitration Act is a special law, no application for extension of period of time limit can be entertained after the period prescribed as, learned Advocate submits, Article 158 of Limitation Act prescribe 30 days limitation from the date of service of the notice or filing of the award in Court.<br/><br/><strong>24.</strong>       In 8 LG (AD) 75 in paragraph 17 it is held, as,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"In the instant case the appeal was filed under section 17 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 which amongst other provides that no appeal shall lie from such decree except on the ground that it is in excess of or not otherwise in accordance with the award. In the instant case the High Court Division observed that after an award is given under the Arbitration Act, various remedies are provided for under the Arbitration act by way of modification under section 15, correction under section 16 and setting aside the award on any of the grounds under section 30 of the Arbitration Act. But section 17 empowers the Court to remit the award or any of the matters referred to arbitration for reconsideration or to set aside the award. According to Section 17 of the Arbitration Act after the time for making an application for setting aside an award has expired or such an application having been refused, the court shall pronounce judgment according to the award and upon such judgment a decree shall follow and that no appeal shall lie against such a" decree except in a case where the decree was passed in excess of the award or not in accordance with the award. In the case of Abdus Salam and another Vs. Osman Gani and another reported in BCR 1984 (AD) 346 the Appellate Division held that a decree is to follow upon the pronouncement of the judgment according to the award. No appeal lies from such decree except on the ground that it is in excess of or not otherwise in accordance with the award. In this case objection filed out of time was rejected on the ground of limitation under Article 158 of the Limitation Act. The Appellate Division held that the Courts decreeing the suit in accordance with the arbitration award is justified and the appeal under section 17 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 before the High Court Division was not competent as the suit was decreed in accordance with the award."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>25.                    </strong>Admittedly, the defendant-petitioner of this revisional application appeared before the Court on 03.02.1999 and after taking several adjournment filed written objection on 28.03.2000 which, according to Mr. M A Samad is beyond the period of 30 days and governed by Article 158 of the Limitation Act and the learned Subordinate Judge, according to him, rightly rejected the written objection of the defendant-petitioner being barred<br/><br/><strong>26.</strong>       After appearance in Court the question of serving of notice does not arise as from that date, opposite party got definite knowledge of filing of the award in Court and time was running out from that date for filing written objection and if the time runs out then filing of written objection does not arise.<br/><br/><strong>27.</strong>      As such we have no other option but to reject the written objection as it was filed long after the period of Limitation prescribed under Article 158. Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam, learned Advocate relied on the decision of 8 LG (AD) 75 wherein it is held that:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"Knowledge of the filing of the award acquired otherwise than in the way prescribed by Section 14(1) should be distinguished from the service of notice under section 14(2) in the absence of the service of notice the application under section 14(2) for direction to cause the award to be filed in court should be made within three (3) years from the date when right to apply accrues according to the residuary provision of Article 181 of the Limitation Act."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>28.</strong>       Even we accept the submission of Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam that the written objection so filed can be treated as an application for setting aside the award then also the written objection as filed can not be accepted as opposite party is bound by the provision of Section 33 of the Arbitration Act and is governed by the general principle that it shall be filed within a reasonable time with the security not after in ordinance delay.<br/><br/><strong>29.</strong>       There is another hurdle for the opposite party. From the impugned order we find that learned Judge having found 'there is security' accepted the written objection as well as the security so filed. Here, Article 178 of the Limitation Act, governing limitation for filing security may be looked in which runs as:-<br/> </div><table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td style="height: 43px; width: 241px; text-align: center;">Description of application.</td><td style="height: 43px; width: 138px; text-align: center;">Period of limitation.</td><td style="height: 43px; width: 211px; text-align: center;">Time from which period begins to run.</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 241px; text-align: center;">178- Under the Arbitration Act, 1940.

No application for filing this bond or security filed by the opposite party as such, it is clear that this bond or security placed in the record must be in connivance with some black under hand tries stealthily which thus can not be accepted. Since there is no order entering this bond or security in record we are taken a back how the learned Judge work on it and accepted it when law does not permit him to do so. It may presume that bond was filed beyond the period prescribed proviso to section 33 of the Act, as such, there was no order entering the bond on record as such we can safely say that no bond has been filed. In the: case of Bangladesh Water Development Board -Vs- Nasim &amp; Brothers and another, 1988 BLD 369, it is held; In such circumstances, now we are to decide whether the letter of guarantee that was submitted long after the filing of the application under section 33 of the Act, is a valid deposit as contemplated under the law. The learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that lawyer did not know of the provision of law. The ignorance of law or mistake of law is no ground and the learned Advocate cannot lawfully plead that before this court. Further the language as quoted above clearly says that the application shall not be entertained if the deposit of money as required to pay under the award has not been made. Thus no application can be entertained if the deposit is not made in accordance with the law. We hold that the deposit under section 33 of the Act is a condition precedent for entertainment of the application and without the deposit it is to be construed as if there was no application in the eye of law. Thus it is correct to say that the guarantee that was filed look after is no deposit under the law and the application has been rightly rejected. 1<br/><br/><strong>36.</strong>       54 DLR 161 wherein on similar fact, the High Court Division observed that,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"The deposit contemplated under the law is a condition precedent for entertainment of the application challenging the award. Deposit made during the pendency of the case cannot be treated a valid deposit as the language of the law is mandatory."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>37.</strong>       Law is to obey and procedure is to follow if not justice being blind, can not resent the litigant.

Petitioner vehemently challenge the security as it is filed on stamp paper of Tk. 150 by an Executive Engineer who is not the authority but an employee and if the executant either removec from service either of his own volition or otherwise or died, then further complication would arise as such, security would be on such instrument which will not cause any hindrance in getting the decreed money on the event of success by the plaintiff. Mr. Kamal-ul-Ala submits that such type security on Tk. ISO/- stamp paper is accepted by court and refer to the decision of N. R. Sikder -vs.- Bangladesh Water Development Board, 49 DLR 113, where it is held,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"A copy of this bond or security has been annexed with the petition. We have carefully gone through this and it appears that one Mr. M. Majidul Islam, Chairman, Bangladesh Water Development Board on behalf of the said Board undertook to pay to the plaintiff a sum of Taka 4,95,29,000.00 (Taka four crore ninety five lac &amp; twenty nine thousand) only as awarded by the learned Arbitrator Mr. Justice Abdur Rahman Chowdhury by his award dated 27th November 1993 and also undertook to pay any other sum as maybe adjudged by the court to be payable thereunder and the Board (BWDB) guarantees the payment of such sum in the event of above proceedings ending in favour of the plaintiff by the Court. It appears from this document that on behalf of Bangladesh Water Development Board the Chairman undertook to pay to the plaintiff any amount that may be allowed by the trial Court while disposing of Title Suit No. 284 of 1993 and this has been executed on behalf of the board and the Board guarantees payment of such sum. though in this security of guarantee of bond in which name this may be styled on properly has been included as required under Order 25 rule 1, Order 38 rule 5, Order 41 rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure but the plaintiffs in case of their success in the suit. Further, the Water Development: Board has been constituted under President's Order No. 59 of 1972 which is a body corporate having its  common  seal and this  Board is  governed  by  the provision of this order and it has also own properties. So far mere nor including of the properties in the security the same cannot be brushed asid&lt; or rejected. The meaning of the word security that we have found out cover the bond that has been executed and filed on behalf of the Board."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>43.</strong>       Since a Division of this Court accepted such type of Bond as security, the security so filed can be accepted if it is filed as per law provided under Section 33 of the Act.<br/><br/><strong>44.</strong>       Question also be whether such type of security can be said to be good enough. It is our considered view that when a government functionary is involved then the security shall be either in the form of bank draft or pay order or bank guarantee otherwise it will take long time to get the money as if security given by the office i.e. the Executive Engineer on the event of either death or removal or retired from service then further such type of bond is required to be filed in Court.<br/><br/><strong>45.</strong>      Mr. Kamal-Ul-Alam, learned Advocate for the opposite parties has submitted of Section 128 of Contract Act and referred to the decision of Sonali Bank -Vs- Hare Krishna Das, 49 DLR 282. Section 128 of Contract Act relating to liability of the surety which is co-extensive with the principal debtor, unless it is otherwise provided by the contract. This law binds the surety to perform obligation immediately on the failure of principle debtor to perform its part. In the cited decision it is held,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"It is true that the onus is on the petitioner to prove his case and in the instant case on perusal of evidence and materials on record we find that the plaintiff have been able to prove their case against the defendants. Besides, there is another aspect of the case which has been lost sight of by the learned Subordinate Judge that is, that the liability of the principal debtor is co-extensive with the guarantor. A creditor can pursue either the principal debtor or the guarantor according to his sweet will to realise his dues or can proceed against both simultaneously. In the instant case the defendant No. 1 is the principal debtor and defendant Nos. 2-4 are guarantors. The defendant Nos. 1-3 did not contest the suit. The case of the plaintiff with regard to defendant Nos. 1-3 remains uncontested. Moreover, the plaintiffs have proved their case against them by cogent evidence. In view of that matter we do not find any reason why the learned Subordinate Judge did not decree the suit at least against defendant Nos. 1-3 and the judgment is not sustainable on that count also.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>46.</strong>       We have perused the materials and evidence on record and we have already found that the plaintiff have been able to prove their case against all the defendants who are jointly and severally liable to repay the loan. It appears to us that the Court below failed to appreciate the true import and tenor of the relevant provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, and the learned Subordinate Judge is  absolutely ignorant about the relevant provisions  of the  said Act.  The learned Subordinate Judge  on  a total misconception of lawr and facts misconstrued and misinterpreted the evidence and materials on record and most illegally dismissed the suit although th&lt; plaintiffs have successfully proved their case. In the result the appeal i allowed without cost. The impugned judgment and decree dated 30.9.8 passed in Money Suit No.  11 of 1984 of the 1st Court of Addition Subordinate Judge, Chittagong, are set aside. The suit is decreed with cost."<br/><br/><strong>47.</strong>       We do not understand how in applying Section 128 of the Contract Act improve the case of Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam improve as in the instant case the question of acceptance of written objection and security, liability of guarantor would arise if there be any dispute in payment of money so guaranteed.<br/><br/><strong>48.</strong>       Since we find written objection is not maintainable, such valued submission do not require to be considered, we leave it to Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam to agitate it before the higher forum if required.<br/><br/><strong>49.</strong>       We find substances in the rale.<br/><br/><strong>50.</strong>       In the result, the rule is made absolute without any order as to costs. The judgment and order No. 209 dated 17.06.2009 passed by the learned Joint District J udge, Comilla in Arbitration Suit No. 01 of 1995 is hereby set aside.<br/><br/><strong>51.</strong>       The order of stay at the time of issuance of the rule is hereby vacated. Let a copy ot the judgment be sent to the court below at once.<br/><br/><strong>            Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Nuruzzaman, J:</strong></span><br/><br/>The instant Rule was issued calling upon the opposite parties to show cause as to why the proceedings of Shalikha Non-G-R. Case No. 143 of 2006 under sections 467, 468 and 471 of the Penal Code, now pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Magura, should not be quashed.<br/><br/><strong>2</strong>.             Facts relevant for disposal of the Rule, in brief, are that, Mir Layek Ali, the opposite party No.2, had some paternal lands, described in the schedule annexed to the complaint petition, being situated within the boundary of a fish farm owned by the accused No.1 Md. Suruj Ali Sikder (herein, the petitioner No.1), who was interested to purchase that land at a cheap price. On 03.09.2005 the accused persons i.e. the present petitioners, in collusion with each other, created a Bainapatra using the forged signature of Mir Layek Ali. On that bainapatra they contended that Mir Layek Ali executed the Bainapatra to sell the said land to Md. Suruj Ali Sikder settling the  price of the schedule land at Tk.1,90,000/= out of which Md. Suruj Ali Sikder had paid Tk.80,000/= at the time of singing of the Bainapatra. The terms of alleged bainapatra was that Layek Ali would execute and register the sale deed of the land in favour of Suruj Ali Sikder by 30.12.2005 on receiving the rest of the amount of consideration. It is alleged that actually Mir Layek Ali neither signed any Bainapatra nor took any money from the said Suruj Ali Sikder. The accused persons claiming said forged Bainapatra as genuine one, asked for execution and registration of the sale deed by Layek Ali upon receiving the balance amount and lastly, on 30.12.2005 when Layek Ali denied to have received any money and as such also denied to execute and register the sale deed, Suruj Ali filed a complaint register case before the Upazila Magistrate Court, Salikha, being Petition Case No.4 of 2006. The learned Upzila Magistrate was pleased to send the case to the Shalikha Police Station to treat the same as first information report and take necessary steps for investigation. Accordingly, Shalikha P.S. G.R. Case No.34 of 2006 was started.  However, in course of investigation, the investigation officer arranged to verify/examine the signature of Mir Layek Ali on the alleged Bainapatra with one of his admitted signatures by the handwriting expert. After conclusion of the investigation, the investigation officer found that the Bainapatra was not genuine as the handwriting expert opined that the signature of Layek Ali on the Bainapatra does not tally with his admitted one. Alleged Bainapatra is lying with the case record of Shalikha G-R-Case No.34 of 2006. On the above allegations the present opposite party No.1 i.e. Mir Layek Ali, filed a petition of complaint before the Magistrate first class, cognizance court, Shalikh Upazila, Magura under section 467/468/471 of the Penal Code. The learned Magistrate sent the petition of complaint to the Shalikha Police Station for investigation whereupon Non G.R. Case No.143 of 2006 under section 467/468/471 of the Penal Code was started. <br/><br/><strong>3</strong>.             Investigation officer, Sub Inspector of Police of the Shalikha Police Station, after investigation, having found the prima-facie case proved against the accused persons submitted police report (charge sheet) under section 467/468/471 of the Penal Code against the accused persons. After submission of the police report the Learned Magistrate accepted the same and transferred the case record to the court of Additional District Magistrate, Magura, for trial.<br/><br/><strong>4</strong>.             The learned Additional District Magistrate, Magura on 17.09.2007 fixed the case for charge hearing, on that date the accused persons filed application under section 241 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for discharging them from  the charge. The learned Additional District Magistrate after hearing the parties allowed the application of discharge in part and discharged accused petitioners No.2-5 from the charge by his order dated 17.9.2007 and framed charge only against the accused petitioner No.1, Md. Suruj Ali Sikder, under section 467/468/471 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/><strong>5</strong>.             Being aggrieved by the order dated 17.09.2007 passed by the learned Additional District Magistrate, Magura, in Shalikha P.S. Non G.R. Case No.143 of 2006, the informant, Mir Layek Ali filed Criminal Revision No.36 of 2007 under section 435 and 439 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the learned Sessions Judge, Magura who, after hearing the parties allowed the revision and set aside the Judgment and order dated 17.09.2007 passed by the learned Additional District Magistrate, Magura, by his Judgment and order 12.02.2008 and directed the Additional District Magistrate, Magura, to re-hear the charge hearing and frame charge in accordance with law.<br/><br/><strong>6</strong>.             Challenging the proceeding in Shalikha Non-G-R. Case No.143 of 2006 under section 467/468/471 of the Penal Code the accused petitioners filed the instant Criminal Miscellaneous Case, under section 561 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, before this court and obtained the present Rule and stay.<br/><br/><strong>7.</strong>             Mr. Reazuddin Khan, the learned advocate appearing for the accused petitioners, upon placing the  back ground of the case submitted that the accused petitioner Md. Suruj Ali Sikder, as complainant lodged a petition of complaint before the Upazila Magistrate, cognizance court Shalikha, Magura against the present opposite party No.2 Mir Layek Ali, under section 406/420 of the penal code which was registered as Shalikha P.S. Case No.4 dated 05.03.2006 corresponding to G.R. Case No.34 of 2006 wherein police submitted final report which was accepted by the court. But before conclusion of the said proceeding Layek Ali started the proceedings of the Shalikha Police Non-G.R. Case No. 143 of 2006 under section 467/468/471 of the penal code which is barred under sub section (c) (1) of section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as the mandatory provisions of law are to be followed in initiating a case under section 467/468/471 of the Penal Code. Therefore, the initiation and continuation of the proceedings of the Shalikha Non-G.R.-Case No.143 of 2006 under section 467/468/471 of the Penal Code is nothing but an abuse of the process of the court. He further submitted that if the offence disclosed under section 467/468/471 of the Penal Code relates to any document, which has been submitted and used in any proceeding as evidence in any court then before filing of such case against a person the provision of section 195 (1) (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is required to be followed. But in the instant case the proceedings has been started without following the provision of section 195 (1) (c) of the Criminal procedure code, which is violation of law, as such the proceedings is liable to be quashed. In support of his submissions he relied on the case of Abdul Hai Khan and other-vs-the state and another reported in 40 D.L.R. (AD) 226; the case of Kamalapati Trivedi-vs-the state of west Bengal A I R 1979 (SC) 777; the case of Abdur Rahman-vs-the state 29 D.L.R. (SC) 256; the case of Seraj Uddoulla-vs-Abdul Kader 45 D.L.R. (AD) 101. He lastly submitted that the initiation and continuation of the proceeding of the instant case is thus being sheer abuse of the process of the court and to secure the ends of Justice the same is liable to be quashed.<br/><br/><strong>8</strong>.             Mr. Kazi Md. Shafiqul Hasan the learned Advocate appearing for the opposite party No.2 submitted that initiation and continuation of the proceedings of the Shalikha Police Station Non.G.R. Case No.143 of 2006 is not barred by sub-section (c) of section 195 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure because when the case was filed neither any proceeding was pending before any court nor the Bainapatra in question has been used as evidence before any court for which the provision of section 195 (1) (c) has no manner of application in the instant case as such the Rule is liable to be discharged. He further submitted that in the petition of complaint of Non G. R. Case No.143 of 2006 it has been clearly mentioned that they have produced the photocopy of the aforesaid Bainapatra, not the original, therefore, to prove the allegation it requires to examine the witnesses which are the disputed question of fact as such the Rule is not maintainable. He, lastly, submitted that on 04.01.2007 the learned Magistrate accepted the final report in the earlier case living Salikha P.S. G.R. Case No. 34 of 2006 (arising out of petition case No. 4 of 2006) and before that date the case was under investigation which was a police proceeding not a Judicial proceeding before any court. The instant case started on 31.07.2006, after the final report in the earlier case was accepted, thus under no circumstances the proceeding of the instant case attracted the provision of sub section (c) of section 195 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Therefore, the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/><br/><strong>9</strong>.             In order to appreciate the submissions of the learned Advocates for the respective parties we have gone through the application and the annexures appended thereto and given our anxious consideration to their submissions.<br/><br/><strong>10</strong>.          The question is whether the proceeding of Shalikha P.S. Non G.R. Case No.143 of 2006 is an abuse of the process of the court.<br/><br/><strong>11</strong>.          Considering the materials on record it transpires that the accused petitioner Md. Suruj Ali Sikder admittedly filed the petition of complaint against the opposite party no.2 and others being Petition Case No.04 of 2006 under section 420/406 of the Penal Code before the Court of Shalikha Upazila Magistrate, cognizance court, on 03.01.2006 on the basis of Bainapatra dated 03.09.05. The learned Magistrate sent the petition of complaint to the officer-in-charge, Shalikha Police Station, to treat the same as first information report and to take necessary steps for investigation which gave rise to Shalikha Police Station Case No.4 dated 06.03.2006 corresponding to G.R. Case No.34 of 2006. During investigation the investigation officer took the opinion of handwriting expert and on the basis of the expert opinion submitted the final report which was accepted on 04.01.2007. But before accepting the final report of the aforesaid case accused Mir Layek Ali as complainant (herein opposite party No.2) on 31.07.2006 filed the petition of complaint before the court of Upazila Magistrate, Cognizance Court, Magura under section 469/468/471 of the Penal Code against the present petitioners which was sent to the Shalikha police station for investigation giving rise to the instant case. After investigation, the investigation officer submitted the charge sheet against the present petitioners. On receipt of the police report the case record was transferred to the court of Additional District Magistrate, who, after hearing the parties, framed charge under section 461/468/471 against the accused petitioner No. 1 and discharged the other accuseds.<br/><br/><strong>12</strong>.          Being aggrieved by the order of discharge passed by the Additional District Magistrate, complainant preferred criminal revision before the learned Sessions Judge, Magura.<br/><br/><strong>13</strong>.          In revision the learned Sessions Judge, set aside the order of the learned Additional District Magistrate with observation and directed the learned A.D.M. to re-hear the charge hearing and to pass order in accordance with law.<br/><br/><strong>14</strong>.          Now the question before us is whether the proceedings of the instant case is barred by sub section (c) of section 195 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the continuation of the said proceeding is abuse of the process of the court.<br/><br/><strong>15</strong>.          For the convenience of discussions and ready reference we feel it necessary to quote section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which reads as follows:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Section 195- (1) No Court shall take cognizance-</strong><br/><em>Of any offence punishable under sections 172 to 188 of the Penal Code, except on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned, or of some other public servant to whom he is subordinate;</em><br/><em>Of any offence punishable under any of the following sections of the same Code, namely, sections 193, 194, 196, 199, 200, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211 and 228, when such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any Court, except on the complaint in writing of such Court or of some other Court to which such Court is subordinate; or </em><br/><em>Of any offence described in section 463 or punishable under section 471, section 475 or section 476 of the same Code, when such offence is alleged to have been committed by a party to any proceeding in any Court in respect of a document produced or given in evidence in such proceeding, except on the complaint in writing of such Court, or of some other Court to which such Court is subordinate.</em><br/><em>In clauses (b) and (c) of sub-section (1), the term ‘Court’ includes a Civil, Revenue or Criminal Court, but does not include a Registrar or Sub-Registrar under the Registration Act, 1908.</em><br/><em>For the purposes of this section, a Court shall be deemed to be subordinate to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the appealable decrees or sentences of such former Court, or in the case of a Civil Court from whose decrees no appeal ordinarily lies to the principal Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction within the local limits of whose jurisdiction such Civil Court is situate:</em><br/><em>Provided that:-</em><br/><em>where appeals lie to more than one Court, the Appellate Court of inferior jurisdiction shall be the Court to which such Court shall be deemed to be subordinate; and</em><br/><em>where appeals lie to a Civil and also to Revenue Court, such Court shall be deemed to be subordinate to the Civil or Revenue court according to the nature of the case or proceeding in connection with which the offence is alleged to have been committed.</em><br/><em>The provisions of sub-section (1), with reference to the offence named therein, apply also to criminal conspiracies to commit such offences and to the abetment of such offences, and attempts to commit them.</em><br/><em>Where a complaint has been made under sub-section (1), clause (a), by a public servant, any authority to which such public servant is subordinate may order the withdrawal of the complaint and, if it does so, it shall forward a copy of such order to the Court and, upon receipt thereof by the Court, no further proceedings shall be taken on the complaint.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>16</strong>.          On a plain reading and close scrutiny of section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as quoted above, it appears that the provision of this section is mandatory and in absence of a complaint lodged accordingly, as required by the section, no court can take cognizance of an offence described  therein.<br/><br/><strong>17</strong>.          On perusal of the first information report of the Non G. R. Case No.143 of 2006 of Shalikha P. S. it appears that it discloses the offence described in section 463 which is punishable under section 471 of the Penal Code. On further Perusal of the said F.I.R. (annexure-“A”) it appears that informant admitted that the whole basis of his case is the out come of the alleged Bainapatra dated 03.09.2005, which was produced before the court of Upazila Magistrate, Cognizance Court, Shalikha, Magura to start the proceedings of Petition Case No.4 of 2006 which gave rise to Shalikha P.S. G.R. Case No. 34 of 2006 under section 420/406 of the Penal Code and to make it clear we may refer some portions of the petition of complaint as contained in the Shalikha Non G.R. case No. 143 of 2006 which are as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"আসামীরা আমার স্বাক্ষর জাল করিয়া একটা জাল বায়না নামা সৃষ্টি করিয়া জালিয়াতি করিয়াছে এবং সেই জাল বায়না নামা (দলিল) খাটি হিসাবে ব্যবহার করিয়া গত ৩০/০১/০৬ তারিখে মোকাম শালিখা উপজেলা ফৌজদারী আদালতে আমারও আমার কতক স্বাক্ষীদেরনামে একট মিথ্যা মামলা দায়ের করিয়াছেন যাহার নমবর শালিখা পি ৪/০৬ বর্তমান নমবর শালিখা জি, আর ৩৪/০৬ ধারা ৪০৬/৪২০ দঃ বিঃ যে মামলা আইনানুগ ব্যবসহা গ্রহনের জন্য শালিখা থানায় প্রেরিত হইলে শালিখা থানা মামলা রেকর্ড করিয়া তদমত কালে জাল বায়না নামায় আমার স্বাক্ষর ও আমার নমুনা স্বাক্ষর গ্রহন করিয়া ঢ়াকায় হস্তলেখা বিশারদের (Hand Writing Expert) দ্বারা পরীক্ষা জাল বায়না নামার স্বাক্ষর আমার স্বাক্ষর না মর্মে মতামত দিয়া প্রমান করিয়াছেন যে, অত্র মামলার আসামীরা আমার স্বাক্ষর জাল করিয়া একটা জাল বায়না নামা সৃষ্টি করিয়াছে। বর্তমানে জাল বায়না নামাটি শালিখা জি, আর ৩৪/০৬ নং মোকদ্দমার নথিতে সংরক্ষিত আছে। অত্রসাৎ উক্তজাল বায়না নামার একটা ফটো কপি দাখিল করিলাম। স্বাক্ষীরা ঘটনা জানে।"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>18</strong>.          So, from the above statement of the informant it is crystal clear that in the proceeding of G. R. Case No.34 of 2006, under section 406/420 of the Penal Code, the alleged Bainapatra has been produced and used. Thus the said proceeding was not merely a police proceeding but it was clearly a Judicial Proceedings because while such proceedings was so pending the accuseds were enlarged on bail and thereafter the learned Magistrate passed the order to take the opinion of the handwriting expert regarding the genuinety of the signature in the Bainapatra with the admitted signature of Mir Layek Ali, the opposite party No. 2 herein. From the above fact it is clear that the learned Magistrate applied his judicial discretion. It further appears that on 04.01.2007 when the final report was accepted, i.e. before conclusion of that proceeding the opposite party No.2 on 31.7.2006started the instant proceeding being G.R. case No.143 of 2006.<br/><br/><strong>19</strong>.          In our jurisdiction it is now well settled that taking  cognizance of a case under section 461/468/471 of the Penal Code, without a written complaint filed by the concerned court, where the alleged document was produced or given in evidence is illegal and without jurisdiction and as such filing of such case at the instance of a private party and initiation and continuation of any such proceeding, wherein offence discloses under the definition of section 463 and punishable under section 467/468/471 of the Penal Code, without complying with the provision of section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, is nothing but an abuse of process of the court.<br/><br/><strong>20</strong>.          In this regard we may profitably refer to the case of Abdul Hai Khan and others-vs-the state and another reported in 40 D.L.R. (AD) 226, wherein it has been held.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In the instant case, the Bainapatra appears to have been forged by one of the appellants who thereafter produced it in the proceeding, namely the suit for specific performance of a contract described in it. Both the offences-forgery and use of a forged document are closely linked with each other and as such these offences clearly fall very much within the ambit of section 195 (C). No cognizance thereof can be taken except on a complaint by the court.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>21</strong>.          In the present case 1st question is whether the order dated 06.03.2006 passed in Petition Case No.4 of 2006 directing the Shalikha Police to treat the petition of complaint as F.I.R. and during the period of investigation the learned Magistrate passed further orders in the proceeding of the said case are the Judicial function or supervisory/executive function of the Magistrate.<br/><br/><strong>22</strong>.          In order to appreciate the above question we need to examine the provision of law and the authorities in Judicial review.<br/><br/><strong>23</strong>.          As it appears to us that in earlier case the Bainapatra in question produced in the court of learned Magistrate of cognizance court, who sent the same to the police for treating the same as F.I.R. and investigate the matter and while the case was so pending the learned Magistrate was pleased to enlarged the accused persons on bail and accorded permission to send the alleged bainapatra to the handwriting expert for his openion. After investigation the police submitted final report and prayed for sanction to prosecute the informant under section 211 and 109 of the Penal Code<br/><br/><strong>24</strong>.          In this regard we can mention to the case of Seraj Uddowla-vs-Abdul Kader wherein a High Court Division, at Chittagong, Bench, in Criminal Revision No.53 of 1984, relying upon some decisions of Kolkata High Court, namely Haibat Khan, ILR Cal-30, Tayabullah I.L.R. 43 Cal-1152 A.I.R. 1917, Cal 593. Ganga Prasad, A.I.R. 1991 Cal 263, took the view and observed thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“It is well settled that a proceeding before a Magistrate within the meaning of section 195 Cr.P.C. commences when a complainant makes a complaint before him alleging facts constituting an offence or when a Magistrate  takes cognizance of an offence upon a report in writing of such facts by a police officer or when a magistrate takes cognizance of an offence upon receipt of information from a person other than a Police Officer or when the Magistrate does not accept the final report submitted by the police officer after investigation and continues the proceeding against the accused on the basis of narazi petition or suo-motu ordering enquiry or examining witnesses. Orders passed by a Magistrate in respect of a case initiated on the basis of an FIR lodged by an informant at the Police Station ending in discharge of the accused on acceptance of Final Report are not proceedings in a  court within the meaning of section 195 CrPC as it is merely in the category of the “Police Proceedings” under Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal procedure although such information to the police may come within the ambit of the expression “falsely charges any person” as used in section 211 of the Penal Code.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>25</strong>.          Against the said order of the High Court Division in the above case our apex court, after discussing the relevant law in the appeal, reversed the Judgment of the High Court Division in the light of the decision given by the Indian Supreme Court in the case of Kamala Pati Trivedi-vs-the state of west Bengal, reported in A.I.R. 1979 (SC) 777, as decided by their lordships in the case of Serajuddola-vs-Abdul Kader and another reported in 45 D.L.R. (AD) 101 our apex court has held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“During the pendency of police investigation of a cognizable cases the steps that are taken before the Magistrate in relation to production of the accused, granting of bail, etc have held to be proceeding before a court and the functioning of the Magistrate in his Judicial capacity.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>26</strong>.          Thus the decision in 45 DLR(AD) 101 being the latest position of law dictated by the Appellate Division we hold that the decision given by the Magistrate in the earlier proceeding wherein the Bainapatra in question has been produced is decision given under his judicial capacity. The earlier proceeding being pending, at least on 31.7.2006. As such the complaint lodged by a private party, namely, the present opposite party No.2, not by the court concerned, during the pendency of the earlier proceeding is  barred under section 195 (1) (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>27</strong>.          Further more, if we read sub section (c) of section 195 (1) along with section 195 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it would be clear that the offences referred to in sub section (c) when committed in pursuance of conspiracy or in the course of the some transaction, the same will fall within the ambit of sub-section (4) of section 195 including their abetments or attempts independent of the dates of their commission. So, clause (c) of section 195 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure bars the jurisdiction of a criminal court to take cognizance upon a private complaint of certain offences committed by a party to any proceeding in a court in respect of documents when used or produced in that proceeding which empowers only that court, before which the proceeding is taken, to make such complaint.<br/><br/><strong>28</strong>.          So, we have no hesitation to hold that the alleged Bainapatra has been used in the proceeding of the earlier Petition Case No.4 of 2006 corresponding to G.R. Case No.143 of 2006 and on the basis of the Bainapatra in question, the cognizance court has passed the order dated 06.03.2006 and other order regarding granting of bail of the accuseds, and obtaining the handwriting expert’s opinion on the signature in the alleged Bainapatra was a proceeding pending before that court.  As such during the pendency of such proceeding a complaint lodged by the present opposite party No.2, a private party, not by the concerned court is completely barred under section 195(1)© of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><br/><strong>29</strong>.          For the discussions made above, we are of the view that the orders passed by the learned Magistrate in the earlier proceeding of the G. R. case No.34 of 2006, no doubt, were judicial orders, not administrative or supervisory orders. So, only that court has the jurisdiction to make a complaint not a private party.<br/><br/><strong>30</strong>.          Moreover, the facts and circumstances of the case, as has been disclosed in the petition of complaint of the instant case in its entirety, are not well founded. So, the submissions advance by the learned Advocate for the opposite party No.2 are not the correct exposition of facts and law and as such not-tenable in law. On the contrary the grounds urged by the learned Advocate for the petitioners being the correct exposition of the facts and law of the instant case the same prevail and appear  to have a good deal of force.<br/><br/><strong>31</strong>.          In the light of the discussions made herein above we are of the view that initiation and continuation of the proceeding of Shalikha P.S. Non G.R. Case No.143 of 2006 under section 467/468/471, Penal Code, is barred by section 195 (1) (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as such the continuation of the said proceeding is abuse of the process of the court.<br/><br/><strong>32</strong>.          Thus, the Rule having merit, it succeeds.<br/><br/><strong>33</strong>.          In the result, the Rule is made absolute. The proceedings of the Shalikha Non-G.R. Case No.143 of 2006, now pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Magura, is hereby quashed.<br/><br/>                Office is directed to communicate the order at once.<br/><br/><strong>                Ed.</strong><br/> <br/> </div></div></div>

The petitioner of the Writ Petition No. 5396 of 2008, namely, Nazma Parveen was appointed as a Lecturer in the Department of History of Lalmatia Mohila College, Dhaka on ad hoc basis for 6(six) months by Memo No.  Ga/3-8038(7-1) dated 08.04.2004. Subsequently by Memo No. Ga/3-8671(5-1) dated 09.11.2004, her service was extended on ad hoc basis until further orders. The petitioner of the other Writ Petition (Writ Petition No. 5564 of 2008) Roksana Munni was appointed as a part-time Lecturer in the Department of Psychology of the college by Memo No. N/3-10585(5-1) dated 17.11.2005 under certain stipulations. Afterwards she was appointed as a Lecturer in that department on ad hoc basis by Memo No. N/3-11814(5-1) dated 11.01.2007. Anyway, on their appointments, both the petitioners had been discharging their respective duties honestly, sincerely and faithfully.  But none the less, on 29.04.2008 the Governing Body of Lalmatia Mohila College, Dhaka (respondent no.2) in its 115<sup>th</sup> meeting discussed that as the number of students in the Departments of History and Psychology and some other Departments of the college was very meagre, there was no requirement for retention of any ad hoc teacher therein and accordingly a decision was taken in the said meeting to terminate the petitioners and others by giving 3(three) months’ prior notice to them. Thereafter pursuant to the decision of the Governing Body of the college taken in its 115<sup>th</sup> meeting, the petitioners were terminated from the service of the college by the impugned Memo Nos. N/3-13370(5-1) and N/3-13371 (5-1) both dated 14.05.2008 to be effective on and from 14.08.2008. The terminations of the petitioners from the service of Lalmatia Mohila College, Dhaka are without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/><br/><strong>4.</strong>        The respondent no.1 in both the Writ Petitions has contested the Rules by filing Affidavits-in-Opposition. Its case, as set out therein, in brief, runs as follows:<br/><br/>            It is true that the petitioner of the Writ Petition No. 5396 of 2008 Nazma Parveen was appointed as a Lecturer in the Department of History of Lalmatia Mohila College, Dhaka on ad hoc basis. It is also true that the petitioner of the Writ Petition No. 5564 of 2008 Roksana Munni was initially appointed as a part-time Lecturer in the Department of Psychology of the college; but subsequently she was appointed as a Lecturer in the self-same department on ad hoc basis. Both the petitioners were appointed as Lecturers in their respective departments because of political clout and wire-pulling. The provisions relating to recruitment of teachers in the college were thrown to the winds due to backstage manoeuvres. There are no provisions for appointment of any teacher in the college on ad hoc basis within the four corners of the “জাতীয় বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় অধিভুক্ত বেসরকারী কলেজ শিক্ষকদের চাকুরীর শর্তাবলী রেগুলেশন, ১৯৯৪” (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations of 1994). The very appointments of the petitioners as Lecturers on ad hoc basis are illegal. As the number of students in various departments of the college was inadequate and because of financial constraint, the Governing Body of the college in its 115<sup>th</sup> meeting took a decision to terminate the petitioners and others with 3(three) months prior notice and accordingly by the impugned orders dated 14.05.2008, they were terminated from the service of the college with effect from 14.08.2008. The respondent no.1 did not commit any illegality in terminating the petitioners from the service of the college. Their terminations are terminations simpliciter. From this point of view, no exception can be taken thereto. As such, the Rules are liable to be discharged with costs.<br/><br/><strong>5.</strong>     At the outset, Dr. Naim Ahmed, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner of the Writ Petition No. 5396 of 2008, submits that admittedly the petitioner Nazma Parveen  was an ad hoc appointee (Lecturer in the Department of History) vide Annexure-‘A’ dated 08.04.2004; but the provisions of the 2<sup>nd</sup>  Proviso to Regulation 15 of the Regulations of 1994  were not complied with before her termination and in that view of the matter, her termination from service is clearly without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/><br/><strong>6.</strong>      Dr. Naim Ahmed, however, concedes that there is no provision for appointment of a teacher on ad hoc basis within the four corners of the Regulations of 1994, though there is a provision for appointment of a part-time teacher within the meaning of Regulation 2(cha).<br/><br/><strong>7.</strong>      Dr. Naim Ahmed further concedes that the termination of the petitioner Nazma Parveen from the service of Lalmatia Mohila College, Dhaka is a termination simpliciter.<br/><br/><strong>8.</strong>    Mr. Md. Emdadul Haque Kazi, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner Roksana Munni of the Writ Petition No. 5564 of 2008,   submits that initially she was appointed as a part-time Lecturer in the Department of Psychology vide Annexure-‘B’ dated 17.11.2005 and subsequently she was appointed as a Lecturer in that department on ad hoc basis by Annexure-‘D’ dated 11.01.2007 and the termination of the petitioner Roksana Munni on the score of inadequate  number of students in the Department of Psychology and in view of the financial stringency of the college authority can not be sustainable in law particularly when efforts were underway to appoint more teachers in various departments of the college.<br/><br/><strong>9.</strong>        Mr. Md. Emdadul Haque Kazi also submits that the impugned order of termination of the petitioner Roksana Munni is bad in law in any view of the matter.<br/><br/><strong>10.</strong>      On the other hand, Mr. Md. Ramzan Ali Sikder, the learned Advocate  appearing on behalf of the respondent no.1 in both the Writ Petitions, submits that admittedly the petitioners were appointed on ad hoc basis as Lecturers in the Departments of History and Psychology of Lalmatia Mohila College, Dhaka and their terminations are terminations simpliciter and that being so, Lalmatia Mohila College being a private college is not amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution and given this scenario,  the petitioners have no locus standi to file the Writ Petitions.<br/><br/><strong>11.</strong>        Mr. Md. Ramzan Ali Sikder further submits that it is an indisputable fact that the Principal of Lalmatia Mohila College is not performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of any local authority and in this perspective, the petitioners have no standing at all.<br/><br/><strong>12.</strong>      Mr. Md. Ramzan Ali Sikder also submits that the petitioners were admittedly appointed on ad hoc basis and they were never included in the Monthly Pay Order (MPO) and their relationship with the college authority was that of master and servant and this being the panorama, the master can not be forced to retain service of the servant and the remedy of the petitioners, if any, lies in a suit for damages in the competent Civil Court.<br/><br/><strong>13.</strong>      Mr. Md. Ramzan Ali Sikder next submits that there was a flagrant contravention of the provisions of Regulation 5 of the Regulations of 1994 in the matter of appointment of the petitioners and as there is no provision whatsoever for their appointments on ad hoc basis, they were rightly terminated from the service of Lalmatia Mohila College under Section 16 of the General Clauses Act.<br/><br/><strong>14.</strong>        In support of the above submissions, Mr. Md. Ramzan Ali Sikder has drawn our attention to the decisions in the cases of Khorshed Alam, Managing Director of Spark Engineering &amp; Construction Ltd…Vs… Ministry of Commerce, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Secretariat and others, 47 DLR (HCD) 209; Din Mohammad…..Vs….Government of Bangladesh and others, 14 BLD (AD) 142; Alauddin Sikder (Md) and another….Vs….Bangladesh and others, 56 DLR (AD) 130; Messrs Malik &amp; Haq and another….Vs…Muhammad Shamsul Islam Chowdhury and two others, 13 DLR (SC) 228; Cholera Research Laboratory, Dhaka….Vs…Md. Mozammel Huq, 25 DLR 260 and Jamal Uddin….Vs….Mir Kashem Bahumukhi High School and others, 56 DLR(HCD) 474.<br/><br/><strong>15.</strong>         We have heard the submissions of Dr. Naim Ahmed and Mr. Md. Emdadul Haque Kazi and the counter-submissions of Mr. Md. Ramzan Ali Sikder, perused the Writ Petitions, Affidavits-in-Opposition and relevant Annexures annexed thereto.<br/><br/><strong>16.</strong>       It is admitted that the petitioner of the Writ Petition No. 5396 of 2008 Nazma Parveen was initially appointed as a Lecturer in the Department of History of Lalmatia Mohila College for 6(six) months on ad hoc basis vide Annexure-‘A’ dated 08.04.2004. It is further admitted that subsequently by Memo No. Ga/3-8671(5-1) dated 09.11.2004, her service was extended on ad hoc basis until further orders. Again, it is undisputed that the petitioner of the Writ Petition No. 5564 of 2008 Roksana Munni was initially appointed as a part-time Lecturer in the Department of Psychology on 17.11.2005. Undeniably, she was appointed on ad hoc basis as a Lecturer in the self-same department by Memo No. N/3-11814(5-1) dated 11.01.2007. However, by the impugned orders dated 14.05.2008, the petitioners were terminated from the service of the college. The orders of termination are under challenge in the Writ Petitions.<br/><br/><strong>17.</strong>        The moot question before us is whether the petitioners have any locus standi to file the Writ Petitions. It goes without saying that Lalmatia Mohila College is a non-Government (private) college. There is no gainsaying the fact that the Principal of this private college is not performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of a local authority.<br/><br/><strong>18.</strong>          In this regard, a reference may be made to the definition of ‘Local Authority’ as given in Section 3(28) of the General Clauses Act of 1897. Section 3(28) of the Act is reproduced below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Local  Authority-‘Local authority’ shall mean and include a Paurashava, Zilla Board, Union Panchayat, Board of Trustees of a port or other authority legally entitled to, or entrusted by the Government with, the control or management of a municipal or local fund, or any corporation or other body or authority constituted or established by the Government under any law.”</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>19.</strong>         Having regard to the definition of ‘Local Authority’ in the General Clauses Act (quoted above), a non-Government college  can not be held to be a local authority inasmuch as it has not been  constituted  or established by  the Government  under any law. Both Dr. Naim Ahmed and Mr. Md. Emdadul Haque Kazi candidly concede that Lalmatia Mohila College being a private college is not a local authority within the meaning of Section 3(28) of the General Clauses Act.  It is a truism that the Principal of Lalmatia Mohila College is not performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic. As the college is not a local authority within the meaning of Section 3(28) of the General Clauses Act and as it is not performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic, the same is not amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution. On this point, our view is buttressed up by the decision in the case of Mofizul Huq….Vs…Mofizur Rahman and others   reported in 49 DLR (AD) 38. In that decision, our Appellate Division has clearly, categorically and unambiguously held that a recognized non-Government school is neither a statutory body nor a local authority within the meaning of the General Clauses Act. So obviously Lalmatia Mohila College is neither a statutory body nor a local authority as per the General Clauses Act.<br/><br/><strong>20.</strong>           The decisions in the cases of Khorshed Alam, Managing Director of Spark Engineering &amp; Construction Ltd…Vs… Ministry of Commerce, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Secretariat and others, 47 DLR (HCD) 209; Din Mohammad…..Vs….Government of Bangladesh and others, 14 BLD (AD) 142 and Alauddin Sikder (Md) and another….Vs….Bangladesh and others, 56 DLR (AD) 130 relied on by Mr. Md. Ramzan Ali Sikder are not exactly on the point we are dealing with.<br/><br/><strong>21.</strong>    In the decision in the case of Messrs Malik &amp; Haq and another….Vs…Muhammad Shamsul Islam Chowdhury and two others reported in 13 DLR (SC) 228 referred to by Mr. Md. Ramzan Ali Sikder, it has been held that the master can not be forced to retain the service of a servant against his will, but he may be liable to pay damages, if any, to the servant for breach of contract.<br/><br/><strong>22.</strong>   In the decision in the case Cholera Research Laboratory, Dacca….Vs…Md. Mozammel Huq reported in 25 DLR 260 adverted to by Mr. Md. Ramzan Ali Sikder, it has been held in paragraph 12.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“12. From the above mentioned decisions, it appears that the law relating to a dismissed employee other than Government Servant is now settled. Such a case is covered by the law of Master and Servant. In the case reported in 21 DLR (SC), page 365, a dismissed employee of Eastern Mercantile Bank Ltd. instituted a suit for declaration that the order terminating his service was null and void. In that case, the plaintiff complained of violation of the regulations of the Bank in terminating his service. The learned Judges of the Supreme Court referred to the earlier decision of the Court reported in 13 DLR (SC) page 228 and reiterated the view taken therein. It has been held that since the respondent’s services were not regulated by any legal instrument, it could not be said that the declaration asked for by him was in relation to any legal character. It was held that such a suit not being in relation to any legal character is not maintainable under Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act. It was further held that in such cases, the law of Master and Servant is applicable and the remedy of an aggrieved person lies in a suit for damages only. On careful examination of the said decision, it appears that the present case is fully covered by the decision.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>23.</strong>     In the case of Jamal Uddin….Vs….Mir Kashem Bahumukhi High School and others reported in 56 DLR (HCD) 474, it has been held that when the service of the petitioner is governed by the rules of Master and Servant, the Master can not be forced to accept the service of the Servant.<br/><br/><strong>24.</strong>       As already observed, the petitioners were appointed on ad hoc basis in the Departments of History and Psychology of Lalmatia Mohila College, Dhaka. Admittedly there are no provisions whatsoever for appointment of the petitioners on ad hoc basis within the four corners of the Regulations of 1994. This being the picture, their service is not regulated by any legal instrument. In such a posture of things, it leaves no room for doubt that the relationship between Lalmatia Mohila College Authority and the petitioners is that of Master and Servant, to all intents and purposes.<br/><br/><strong>25.</strong>   From the foregoing discussions and in view of the facts and circumstances of the case, we have no hesitation in holding that the petitioners have no locus standi at all to file the Writ Petitions. Consequentially, on this score alone, the Rules are liable to be discharged.<br/><br/><strong> 26.</strong>      As we have found that the petitioners have no standing, we refrain from making any observation as to the merit of the case.<br/><br/><strong>27.</strong>      Regard being had to the facts and circumstances of the case, it transpires that the petitioners filed the instant Writ Petitions knowing full well that they had no locus standi to do so. As we see it, they should be saddled with some costs in that Lalmatia Mohila College Authority had to contest the Rules out of the coffers of the college. Furthermore, the awarding of costs will serve as a deterrent to others so that they will feel disinclined to come up with frivolous and vexatious Writ Petitions in future. <br/><br/><strong> 28.</strong>      Accordingly, the Rules are discharged on the ground of incompetency of the Writ Petitions. Each petitioner is directed to pay costs of Tk. 5000/- (five thousand) only to the respondent no.1 within 30(thirty) days from date, failing which, the costs shall be realized from her through the process of the Court.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The special type of managing committee form under Regulation 50 has not fall and foul of the scheme of the Regulations of 2009 it appears that since the school is being ran by the Co-operative Society Limited Regulation 7 of the Regulations of 2009 can not be invoked with a view to form a normal or managing committee, rather a regular can only be formed under Regulation 49 in the background of the facts and circumstances of the case.

The Intermediate and Secondary Education Ordinance, 1961 was promulgated for re-orgainizing the Intermediated and Secondary Education in Bangladesh. In exercise of the powers conferred under Section 39 of the said Ordinance of 1961, the respondent no. 1 framed the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (Managing Committees of the Recognized Non-Government Secondary Schools) Regulations, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations of 1977) for regulating the elections, constitutions and functions of the Managing Committees of the Recognized Non-Government Schools in Bangladesh. However, on 08.10.2006, the then Headmistress of the school applied to the respondent no. 1 for setting up a Special Type of Managing Committee under Regulation 20(2) of the Regulations of 1977 for a term of 3(three) years in order to maintain congenial academic atmosphere there. Accordingly, the respondent no.3, under the signature of the respondent no. 4, by a Memo dated 05.04.2007, communicated the Government’s approval to the constitution of the Special Type of Managing Committee for the school. In due course, the respondent no. 1, under the signature of the respondent no. 2, by a Memo dated 22.04.2007, established the Special Type of Managing Committee therefore for a term of 3(three) years under Regulation 20(2) of the Regulations of 1977. The tenure of the Special Type of Managing Committee expires on 21.04.2010 as per the Memo dated 22.04.2007.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>         However, another Special Type of Managing Committee was illegally proposed to replace the said Special Type of Managing committee before expiry of its tenure. At one stage, Mr. Md. Azizul Huq, the incumbent Headmaster of the school, intimated the respondent no.3 about the same and requested him to allow the pre-existing Special Type of Managing Committee to complete its tenure by a letter dated 03.08.2009. Anyway, the respondent no.3, under the signature of the respondent no. 5, issued a Memo dated 12.07.2009 requesting the respondent no. 1 to take steps in accordance with the provisions of “মাধ্যমিক ও উচ্চ মাধ্যমিক শিক্ষা বোর্ড, চট্টগ্রাম (মাধ্যমিক ও উচ্চ মাধ্যমিক স্তরের বেসরকারী শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠানের গভারনিং বডি ও ম্যানেজিং কমিটি) প্রবিধানমালা, ২০০৯” (herein after mentioned as the Regulations of 2009) to form a Special Type of Managing Committee for the school. In response to the aforesaid Memo dated 12.07.2009, the respondent no.1, by a Memo dated 29.07.2009, informed the respondent no.3 that prior approval of the Government, that is to say, the Ministry of Education is required in order to constitute a Special Type of Managing Committee under Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009. In pursuance of the aforesaid Memo dated 29.07.2009, the respondent no. 3, under the signature of the respondent no. 5, by a Memo dated 24.08.2009, directed the respondent no. 1 to take steps in accordance with Regulations 53(1) and 9 of the Regulations of 2009 in that regard. The said Memo dated 24.08.2009 did not accord any prior approval of the Government for constituting a Special Type of Managing Committee of the School as per the criteria laid down in Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009. Be that as it may, at a subsequent stage, the respondent no. 1, under the signature of the respondent no. 2, issued the impugned Memo dated 24.09.2009 (Annexure-‘A’) according approval to the so-called special Type of Managing Committee for the school for a period of two years in purported exercise of powers under Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009. Afterwards, the incumbent Headmaster of the school, namely, Mr. Md. Azizul Huq, acting as Member-Secretary of the pre-existing Special Type of Managing Committee by a letter dated 29.09.2009, lodged a complaint with the respondent no.3 stating, inter alia, that the purported Special Type of Managing Committee was constituted in violation of the Regulations of 2009. In response thereto, the respondent no. 5 issued a Memo dated 01.10.2009 requesting the respondent no. 1 to furnish an enquiry report vis-à-vis the purported Special Type of Managing Committee. Since the impugned Memo dated 24.09.2009 is in contravention of the provisions of Regulations 50 of the Regulations of 2009, the constitution of the Special Type of Managing Committee is without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>         The added respondent no. 7 has contested the Rule by filing an Affidavit-in-Opposition. His case, as set out in the Affidavit-in-Opposition, briefly runs as follows:<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>         The tenure of the Special Type of Managing Committee of the Ankur Society Girls’ High School constituted under Regulation 20(2) of the Regulations of 1977 expired on 21.04.2009 by operation of the provisions of Regulations 53(1) read with Regulation 9 of the Regulations of 2009. After the expiry of the term of the said Special Type of Managing Committee on 21.04.2009, another Special Type of Managing Committee was duly constituted under Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009 on 24.09.2009. On that very date, it held its first meeting and took some decisions and according to those decisions, it informed the concerned banks of its formation for doing the needful. Thereafter on 04.10.2009, a special general meeting was held and the minutes of the earlier meeting dated 24.09.2009 were approved and in the said meeting, the Special Type of Managing Committee unanimously took a decision to issue a show-cause notice upon the incumbent Headmaster of the school for his misbehaviour, misconduct, non-cooperation and insubordination. But by suppressing the fact of functionality of the Special Type of Managing Committee constituted under Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009, the petitioner filed the instant Writ Petition and obtained the Rule. The impugned Memo dated 24.09.2009 is lawful and valid. As such, the Rule is liable to be discharged with costs.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>         At the outset, Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner, submits that  prior approval of the Board and the Government is a condition precedent to the formation of the special type of managing committee  under Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009; but it appears in view of Annexure-‘D’ series and Annexure-‘F’. It appears that the Government did not expressly accord any prior approval and that being so, the constitution of the special type of managing committee by the impugned Memo dated 24.09.2009 is ‘de hors’ the law.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>         Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud next submits that Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009 contemplate formation or constitution of a special type of managing committee in a special situation or exigency  but the impugned Memo dated 24.09.2009 does not indicate  any special situation or exigency  which necessitated the constitution  of this special kind of managing committee for the school and in this perspective,  the formation of the special type of managing committee under Regulation 50 is without lawful authority.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>         Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud also submits that as per direction of the Government vide Annexure-‘E’ to the Writ Petition  a managing committee  under Regulation 7 of the Regulations of 2009 should have been formed and the  Annexure-‘E’ does not betoken  the formation of any special kind of managing committee under Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>         Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud next submits that the incumbent the Headmaster of the school Mr. Md. Azizul Huq lodged a complaint with the Government against the formation of the special kind of managing committee under Regulation 50 and the Government directed the respondent no. 1 to enquire into the matter and this direction of the Government is virtually a negation of the implied approval, if any, of the government to the formation of the special kind of managing committee under Regulation 50.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>       Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud also submits that it is ex-facie clear from Annexure-‘B’ series  to the Writ Petition that both the Board and the Government accorded express approval to the formation of the special type of managing committee under Regulation 20(2) of the Regulations of 1977 but in the formation of the so-called special managing committee under Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009 the Government did not accord its approval either  expressly or impliedly and the non-according of the approval to the special type of managing committee under Regulation 50 has rendered the same non-east.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>       Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud also submits that the incumbent Headmaster of the school has not been made  a Member-Secretary of the special type of managing committee formed on 24.09.2009 though Regulation 46(1) of the Regulations of 2009 mandates that the head of the non-Government Educational Institution shall preserve the documents and with regards and manage the operate funds of the school as Member-Secretary and since admittedly the Headmaster has not been made a Member-Secretary of the so-called special type of managing committee, its formation is of no legal effect.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>       Mr. Md. Mutahar Hossain the another Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner, submits that  as per Regulation 34 of the Regulations of 2009  for holding a special meeting at least 24 hours  notice must be served upon the members of the special type of managing committee and in that meeting not more than one agenda  item could be listed for discussion but it appears from  minutes of the first meeting of the special type of managing committee held on 24.09.2009 that the members and that committee were not 24 hours meeting prior to holding of the get and what is more,  there were more than one agenda item in the meeting in violation  of Regulation 34 of the Regulations of 2009 and given this scenario, it can not be said that the first meeting of the special  kind of managing committee was held on 24.09.2009 in accordance with law  and this being the position, it can not be accepted  in law that  the special type of managing committee held its first meeting is lawfully on the very date of formation of the committee, that is to say, on 24.09.2009.  <br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>       On the contrary, Mr. A. F. Hassan Ariff, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the added respondent no. 7, submits that the record shows  that the approval of the Board to the formation of the special type  of managing committee as contemplated Regulation 50 of  the Regulations of 2009 has been given by Annexure-‘A’ and from a combined reading  of Annexure-‘D’ series and Annexure-‘E’ there can not be  any other meaning then to according of approval to the formation of the special type of managing committee thereunder and in such a posture of things, it can not be said that the Government  did not accord its prior approval  to the constitute a special type of managing committee of the school under Regulation 50 and  from this point of view,  the formation of the special type of managing committee is legal and valid.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>       Mr. A. F. Hassan Ariff further submits that in view of the provisions of Regulations 53 and Regulation 9  it is crystal clear that the tenure of the pre-existing  special managing committee of the school has been curtailed  to two years and as the pre-existing  special managing  committee did not take any step to constitute a regular managing committee under Regulation 49 of the Regulations of 2009 a special situation arose or exigency arose to constitute  a special type of managing committee as provided of Regulations of 2009 though the exigency has not been spelt out in the impugned Memo dated  24.09.2009 and with a view to meeting this special situation or exigency the special type of managing  committee  was constituted  under Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009 and considered from this standpoint, no exception can be taken thereto.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>       Mr. A. F. Hassan Ariff next submits that the order given by the Government for holding an enquiry into the formation of the special type of managing committee by the respondent no.1 does not necessarily negate the implied approval of the Government to its formation and since the matter is at the  enquiry stage. The petitioner has no locus standi and standing to come up with the Writ Petition under Article 102 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>       Mr. A. F. Hassan Ariff further submits that Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009 does not postulate that the Headmaster of the school  should be the Member-Secretary of the special type of managing committee from under Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009 and in this regard, he has  drawn our attention to Regulation 3 of the Regulations of 2009 and according  to the Regulation 3 barring Regulations 48, 49, 50 and 51 the management and Regulation of a Non-Government Educational Institution shall be carried on according to the Regulations of 2009 and since the applicability of Regulation 50 has been expressly  barred by Sub-Regulation(1) of Regulation 3 it does not lie in the mouth of Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud to say that the Member-Secretary of the special type of managing committee under Regulation 50 should be the Headmaster of the school and such being the state of affairs,  no exception can be taken to the formation  of the special type of managing committee on this count.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>       Mr. A. F. Hassan Ariff  next  submits that it is true  that on the  very date of formation of the managing committee on 24.09.2009 the first meeting was held  giving less than 24 hours  notice and in that meeting there were 2 agenda  items but the present petitioner being a member of the  pre-existing special managing committee formed under Regulation 22  of the Regulations of 1977  has no legal right to assail the holding the first  meeting of the  of the special type of managing committee formed under Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009 and in this regard, the petitioner is mere and interloper and he is not an aggrieved by the serving of the notice giving less than 24 hours and discussion more than one agenda item in that meeting.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>       Mr. A. F. Hassan Ariff further submits that the previous special managing committee formed under Regulation 20(2) of the Regulations of 1977 was defunct by operation of Regulations 53 and 9 of the Regulations of 2009 and on the date of filing of the Writ Petition 04.10.2009 and Rule issued on 27.10.2009  the petitioner has had no subsisting  legal right to protect by this Constitutional Court and as per the Proviso to Regulation  9 the previous special meeting  of the managing committee would till the holding of the first meeting  of the new managing committee and after the holding of the first meeting of the special type of managing committing formed under Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009 the previous special managing committee should wash their hands  of the matter.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>   We have heard the submissions of the learned Advocate Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud and the counter-submissions of the learned Advocate Mr. A. F. Hassan Ariff and perused the Writ Petition, Affidavit-in-Opposition and relevant Annexures annexed thereto.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>      It is admitted that the earlier special managing committee was formed under Regulation 20(2) of the Regulations of 1977 on 22.04.2007 for a period of 3 years. It is further admitted that both the Board and the Government accorded their respective approval to the constitution of the special managing committee under said Regulation 20(2). It is also undisputed that prior to the formation of the special type of managing committee as provided by Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009 the earlier special managing committee have been performing the functions duties and responsibilities  of the managing committee of the school. It transpires that controversies and differences of opinion have previewed of the formation of the special type of managing committee under the said Regulation 50 on 24.09.2009 (Annexure-‘A’ to the Writ Petition). In the facts and circumstances of the case, it seems to us that the earlier special managing committee formed under Regulation 20(2) of the Regulations of 1977. The present special type of managing committee formed under Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009 purportedly managing the affairs of the school to the exclusion of the other. The bone of contention between the parties for the constitution of the special type of managing committee under Regulation 50 of the Regulation of 2009.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>      It has already been observed that the earlier managing committee was formed on 22.04.2007. Pursuant to Regulation 20(2) of the Regulations of 1977, at the instant of the then Headmaster of the school for a period of 3 years. In this connection, Regulations 53(1) and 9 of the Regulations of 2009 may be reproduced below:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“৫৩(১) এই প্রবিধানমালা কার্যকর হওয়া সত্ত্বেও, মাধ্যমিক ও উচ্চ মাধ্যমিক শিক্ষা বোর্ড, চট্রগ্রাম এর অধিক্ষেত্রভুক্ত এলাকায় অবস্থিত মাধ্যমিক ও উচ্চ মাধ্যমিক স্তরের বেসরকারি শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠানসমূহে বিদ্যমান গভার্ণিং বডি বা, ক্ষেত্রমত, ম্যানেজিং কমিটি এই প্রবিধানমালার অধীন গঠিত হইয়াছে বলিয়া গণ্য হইবে এবং উহাদের মেয়াদের অবশিষ্টকাল অথবা প্রবিধান ৯ অনুসারে নির্ধারিত মেয়াদ, এই দুই এর মধ্যে যাহা আগে আসিবে সে মেয়াদ পর্যন্ত, দায়িত্ব পালন করিয়া যাইবে।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">৯। গভার্ণিং বডি ও ম্যানেজিং কমিটির মেয়াদ - প্রবিধান ৩৮ এর বিধান অনুসারে পূর্বে বাতিল করা না হইলে গভার্ণিং বডি বা, ক্ষেত্রমত, ম্যানেজিং কমিটির মেয়াদ হইবে উহার প্রথম সভা অনুষ্ঠানের তারিখ হইতে পরবর্তী দুই বৎসরঃ</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">তবে শর্ত থাকে যে, কোন গভার্ণিং বডি বা, ক্ষেত্রমত, ম্যানেজিং কমিটির মেয়াদ উত্তীর্ণ হওয়া সত্বেও উহার উত্তরাধিকার গভার্ণিং বডি বা, ক্ষেত্রমত, ম্যানেজিং কমিটির প্রথম সভা অনুষ্ঠিত না হওয়া পর্যন্ত উক্ত প্রথম গভার্ণিং বডি বা, ক্ষেত্রমত, ম্যানেজিং কমিটি উহার দায়িত্ব পালন অব্যাহত রাখিবে।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>For determination of the tenure of the provisions special managing committee. There is no gainsaying the fact that the Regulations of 2009 coming into effect on 16<sup>th</sup> June, 2009. From a combined reading of the provisions of Regulations 53 (1) and Regulation 9 of the Regulations of 2009. It appears to us that the tenure of the previous special managing committee was reduced all criteria to two years. In other words, the stint of the previous special managing committee expired on 21. 04.2009. In view of this scenario, there arose a necessary formation of a special type of managing committee as postulated by Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009. At this juncture, it may be recalled that the provisions of Regulation 20(2) of the Regulations of 1977 are almost identical with those of the provision 50 of the Regulations of 2009.  Since the earlier managing committee was special one, presumably it was not expedient and prudent to form a corresponding special type of managing committee under Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009. Besides after the result of the Regulations of 1977, it appears that it was though proper and desirable to constitute a special type of managing committee under Regulation 50. In this connection, it may be noted that since the school is being managed by the Chittagong Co-operative Society Limited the formation of its regular managing committee will be under Regulation 49 and in the Regulation under 7 of the Regulations of 2009 as contended by Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud since in the prevalent situation it was thought fit proper to form a special type of managing committee under Regulation 50 we need not interfere therewith in this Writ Petition.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>       However, though the previous special managing committee has become defunct by operation of the provisions of Regulations 53 and 9 proper of the Regulations of 2009 but the fact remains that the previous function of the  special type of managing committee have been kept arrived by the  proviso. In this regard, it is well-settled that a proviso is in nature of the exception. Anyway, by reason of the proviso to Regulation 9 the previous special managing committee had been carrying on duties and responsibilities till holding of the first meeting of the special type of managing committee on 24. 09.2009.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>       The minimum grounds of attacked vis-a-vis the formation of the special type of managing committee of Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud there make approval of the Government  to its formation and the absence of any situation or exigency as contemplated by Regulation 50 of the Regulations  of 2009  now let us address  these two grounds are attacked.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>       It is true that by Annexure-‘B’ series both the Board and the Government accorded their respective approval to the formation of the earlier special managing committee expressed terms. According to Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud in similar express terms the prior approval of the Government should have been accorded to the formation of the special type of managing committee as adverted to in Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009.

In reply to Annexure-‘D’ dated 12.07.2009 the Board addressed a Memo dated 29.07.2009 (Annexure-‘D1’ emphasizes the necessity for according prior approval to the constitution a   special type of managing committee under said Regulation 50. Responding to Annexure-‘D1’ dated 29.07.2009 the Government (Ministry of Education) requested the general of the Board to initiate steps under Regulations 53(1) and 9 of the Regulations of 2009. In this context, it is worthy of notice that although by Annexure-‘D1’ the Board lead envisages on the prior approval of the Government to the formation of a special type of managing committee under Regulation 50(1) by Annexure-‘E’ the Government did not   indicate its carefulness inability to acquire the prior approval to the formation of such a committee   under Regulation 50.  From a bare reading of Annexure-‘D’ series and Annexure-‘E’ conjointly it leaves no room for doubt about the Government accorded its prior approval to the formation of a special type of managing committee under Regulation 50 in an implied manner. This is because had the Government decided to not to accord  prior approval to the constitutes  of a special type of managing committee  under Regulation 50  then which have categorically, unambiguously and unmistakably terms  refused  to accord prior approval thereto. In the absence of any such refusal, it can be construed the prior approval of the Government to the formation of the special type of managing committee was implied to all intents and purposes.

It has already been referred to earlier that after the result of the previous Regulations of 1977 and came into force of the present Regulations of 2009 there was a sought of interregnum and this interregnum has been provided for by the proviso to Regulation 9 of the Regulations of 2009. It has also been discussed earlier that the provisions of Regulation 20(2) of the Regulations of 1977 to correspondence with those of Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009 substantially and in such view of the matter, it was thought expedient and prudent to form a special type of managing committee as enjoined by Regulation 50 of the Regulations of 2009. Although ‘¢h­no f¢l¢Øq¢a­a’ (special situation or exigency)  has not been spelt out in so many words  in Annexure-‘A’ but none the less, the special situation or exigency  has discussed above can not be lost sight of in any view of the matter. It is settled proposition of law that while construing a document the context should be kept in view and the contextual scenario is to be appreciated vis-a-vis the document. Against this backdrop, it is, we are led to hold that the special type of managing committee as contemplated by Regulation 50 was formed with a view to meeting the special situation or exigency as discussed hereinbefore. So the formation of the special type of managing committee under Regulation 50, as we see it, our immune from the grounds of attacked on the counts of non-according of prior approval of the Government and the non-explanation of the ‘¢h­no f¢l¢Øq¢a­a’ (special situation or exigency) for all the reason stated above. The Annexure-‘A’ can not be thrown out overbold.  Specially when the pre-existing value under Regulation 20(2) of the Regulations of 1977 have no  legal  right to be protected  by this Court after expiry of their tenure of two years  in view of the provisions of Regulations 53(1)  and 9 of Regulations of 2009. From a bare reading of Regulation 50, it does not appear that the Headmaster, or for that matter, the head of the Educational Institution must be the Member-Secretary of the special type of managing committee. Regulation 50 provides that amongst others there shall be a Member-Secretary it does not necessary mean that the Member-Secretary must be the Secretary of the school. Of course, Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud  by refereeing to Regulation 46(1) of the Regulations of 2009  has argued that the head of the Non-Government Educational Institution as the secondary level shall be the Member-Secretary of the managing committee for the manage  of funds and for reservation of document and with regards of the school. But it appears that of Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud has conveniently remained oblivious   of the provisions of Regulation 3 of the Regulations of 2009 as pointed out by Mr. A. F. Hassan Ariff. Sub-regulation (1) of the said Regulation expressly negates the applicability of Regulations 48, 49, 50 and 51 in so far Non-Government for the Educational Institution concerned and as the present special type of managing committee has been formed under Regulation 50, the provisions of this Regulations for the management and Regulation of the school will not be applicable, regard being had to the scheme of the Regulations of 2009 in general and the scheme of Regulation in particular. So it transpires that the provisions of Regulation 3 and those of Regulation 50 taken and read together we come to the definite conclusion that in a special type of managing committee as adverted to in Regulation 50 the headmaster of the school need not be the member-secretary of such a committee. What we are driving at boils down to this:  on this score, the special type of managing committee form under Regulation 50 has not fall and foul of the scheme of the Regulations of 2009. <br/> <br/><strong>27</strong>.       In the facts and circumstances of the case, it appears that since the school is being ran by the Co-operative Society Limited Regulation 7 of the Regulations of 2009 can not be invoked with a view to form a normal or managing committee, rather a regular can only be formed under Regulation 49 in the background of the facts and circumstances of the case. It appears to us that the formation of the special type of managing committee under Regulation 50 is a stop-gap arrangement to be more precise, it is stop-gap to the constitution of a regular managing committee under Regulation 49.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>       As to the contention of Mr. Md. Mutahar Hossain, the first meeting of the special type of managing committee held on 24.09.2009, that is, on the very day of formation of the committee is violative Regulation 34 of the Regulations of 2009. It seems that Mr. A. F. Hassan Ariff has rightly contended that the petitioner is a mere interloper in connection with the holding of the first meeting of the special type of managing committee form under Regulation 50. The petitioner, in our view, was not prejudiced  in way by giving  less than  24 hours notice upon  the members of that special type of managing committee and discussing  and more than one agenda item in that meeting. It transpires that the petitioner is a mere busy body on the question of holding of the first meeting of the special type of managing committee. No number of the special type of managing committee has come forwarded before this Court to dispute the validity and the legality of the notice and the holding of the first meeting of the committee on the very date on the formation of the committee on 24.09.2009. So the objections taken by the petitioner to the holding of the first meeting of the new managing committee on 24.0.2009 stands negative.<br/> <br/> <strong>29</strong>.      As to the submission of Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud that the order passed by the Government for holding  an enquiry into the submission of the committee negates the implied prior approval, if any, of the Government to the formation of special  type of managing committee under Regulation 50  we feel constrained to  hold that the enquiry has been set in motion  at the instant of the Headmaster of the school who appears to be aggrieved  by the formation of the special type of managing committee on 24.09.2009. The enquiry is still under way. The facts and circumstances of the case do not rule out the possibility that the incumbent Headmaster Mr. Md. Azizul Huq has been pulling well behinds. So as to impede the normal view of the special type of managing committee formed on 24.09.2009. Since the incumbent Headmaster Mr. Md. Azizul Huq has not been taken the formation of this new type of special type managing committee with a grace it transpires that he is banned upon undoing it.<br/> <br/><strong>30</strong>.       Admittedly, the special type of managing committee under Regulation 50 was constituted  under Regulations of 2009   and the Writ Petition  was filed on 04.10.2009 and the Rule issuing order was issued  upon the respondents  on 27.10.2009 this scenario,  indicates that the petitioner had no locus standi or standing to file the Writ Petition under Article 102 of the Constitution when the special type of managing committee had already started functioning  and the holding a first meeting on 24.092.009. In the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the foregoing discussions, we have no hesitation in holding that the petitioner being a member of the earlier special managing committee    has filed the Writ Petition by way of a smartrick in order to enable the previous managing committee may be operational and functional as far as possible far beyond the expiry of the term of the committee.<br/> <br/><strong>31</strong>.       In the light of what have been stated above, we find no merit in the Rule, the Rule, therefore, fails.<br/> <br/>            Accordingly, the Rule is discharged without any order as to costs.</div></div></div>

We are satisfied that all the legal formalities have been observed in this case by the Magistrate in recording the confessional statements marked as Exts. 5, 6, 7 and 8.

The  Death Reference, Jail Appeals as well as the Criminal Appeal have all been heard together and are disposed of  by this judgment.<br/><br/><strong>2</strong>.             The prosecution case, in short, is as follows:-<br/>One Md. Rajbul Hossain, on 1.11.2002 at 12-15 hours, being informant lodged ejahar with the Jhikorgachha Police Station to the effect that having gone to the house of his sister Monoara she informed him that the dead body of  Shilpi Khatun (brother’s daughter of the informant) was found nacked in the  Papaw garden of Hossain Ali of village-Nilkantha Nagar. Then the informent being accompanied by Sirajul (his younger brother), Alamgir (his sister’s son) and sister Monoara  went to the Jhikorgachha Police Station  and identified the dead body  to be of his brother’s daughter, Shilpi Khatun and found black marks on the throat of the deceased, Shilpi Khatun. Nearly, 1½  months ago  that Shilpi Khatun  was given  in marriage  with the accused  Noor Islam. After marriage Shilpi Khatun went to  her father-in-law’s house  twice with her husband, Noor Islam. After completing the pleasure trip in her father-in-law’s house the victim Shilpi Khatun  was taken  to her father’s house one  day before  the  Shab-E-Barat. On  25.10.2002,  Friday, Shilpi Khatun while staying in the house of the sister of the informant the accused Noor Islam  (victim’s husband) came there for fetching Shilpi Khatun. The accused Noor Islam stayed in that house for a week. Thereafter, on  31.10.2002  at 4-30 P.M. the accused Noor Islam got into a bus with the victim Shilpi Khatun  from Jhoudanga Bus-stand  for going to his own village  of Nilkantha Nagar. On that date, at about 6-30 P.M., the accused- Noor Islam  got down  from the  bus at Gadkhali Bus-stand  with the victim Shilpi. After crossing the Gadkhali Bazar on foot the accused Noor Islam,  without taking the short unmetalled  road to go to his village, chose the open field  as per his pre-meditation and took the victim, Shilpi Khatun  to the papaw garden of his brother, Hossain Ali. After taking the victim Shilpi Khatun to that Papaw  garden the accused, Noor Islam and his accomplices, namely, Jahangir alias Gani, Hajiluddin alias Azizur, Aizul alias Aaju and Zia gang-raped her one after another  and murdered her and left the dead body of Shilpi at that Papaw garden. At 9-30 P.M., on that very night on 31.10.2002, accused, Noor Islam reached home and mal-informed that the terrorists snatched away his wife, Shilpi Khatun from him on his way home. At that time  the accused, Noor Islam feigned to be physically ill. On the basis of that mal-information, the local people conducted search for Shilpi Khatun, and sometime after in that very night on  31.10.2002,  the local people discovered  the nacked dead body of Shilpi Khatun from the Papaw garden  of Hossain Ali. Then, the informant filed the F.I.R. with Jhikargacha Police Station whereupon the instant case was started. Police investigated the case and submitted charge-sheet against accused persons, Noor Islam, Jahangir alias Goni, Hajiruddin alias Azizur Rahman, Ziaur Rahman alias Zia, Aaizul alias Aazu  alias Azizur under Section 9(3) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjaton Daman Ain, 2000. At the beginning of the trial charge under Section 9(3) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjaton Daman Ain, 2000  was framed against all the above named 5 accused persons including the absconding accused  Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur . The charge was read over and explained to all the aforesaid  condemned prisoners except the absconding accused Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur  to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Because of his absconsion  charge could not be read over and explained to accused Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur .<br/><br/>3.             After closure of the  examination of the prosecution witnesses all the above named  condemned-prisoners except  the abasconding accused Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur  were examined under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to which they maintained  the same plea of innocence. Accused Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur could not be examined under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  as he was absconding. At this stage, all the condemned prisoners except the absconding accused Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur  have said that they are quite innocent  and that Police illegally arrested them in connection with this case and by inflicting physical torture  and showing threat of handing over them to the  Army for ‘Clean Heart Operation’ obtained the confessional statements under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  from them. The said confessional statements were neither true nor voluntary which they retracted subsequently.<br/><br/>4.             19 witnesses for the prosecution and none for the defence were examined in this case. The prosecution have also adduced evidence which are marked as exhibits and material exhibits . State defence was provided for the absconding accused Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur.<br/><br/>5.             The defence case as appears from the trend of cross-examination  of the prosecution witnesses  that all the accused persons are innocent and they have been falsely implicated in this case and they did not commit the offence as alleged and that the confessional statements  have been obtained from the confessing accused by exercising  threat  and coercion  upon them and the same are not at all true and voluntary.<br/><br/>6.             The learned Judge of the  Tribunal  below having heard both the parties and considering the evidence and materials on record passed the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence  dated 4.5.2005 convicting all the above named 5 accused persons including the absconding accused  Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur  under Section 9(3) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000  and sentencing them to death  by hanging by neck  and also sentencing of them to pay a fine of Tk.1,00,000/-  each.<br/><br/>7.             The instant Death Reference being No. 143 of 2005 arises out of the aforesaid judgment and order of conviction  and sentence  and, thereafter, being aggrieved  by the aforesaid  judgment and order of conviction  and sentence  the convict-appellants have preferred  the   Jail Appeals and the regular Appeal   as above.<br/><br/>8.             Mr. Md. Selim, the learned Deputy Attorney-General with Mr. Md. Ensanuddin Sheikh and Mr. Md. Nurul Islam Matobbor, the learned  Assistant Attorneys-General appearing for the State submits that in the instant case the victim, Shilpi Khatun  was gang-raped  and then brutally  done to death by all the condemned-prisoners alongwith the absconding accused  Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur  and that the alleged occurrence took place at the instance of condemned-prisoner, Noor Islam, husband of the victim,  Shilpi Khatun and that  all the condemned-prisoners voluntarily made confessional statements  recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure wherein they confessed that as per plan designed by convict, Noor Islam  all other accused including the absconding accused Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur gang-raped the victim Shilpi Khatun  in presence of her husband and, thereafter, she was done to death by strangulation  fastening her sharee on the neck. The learned Deputy Attorney-General further submits that all the aforesaid confessional statements made by the condemned-prisoners are consistent with each other wherein they gave a vivid picture  as to how the alleged occurrence took place which is also consistent with the Inquest Report, Post Mortem Report  and other evidence and materials on record and that the learned Tribunal Judge  considering all the aspects of the matter as well as  the evidence on record passed the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence and there is no reason  to interfere with the same and that in a case of this sort  of heinous offence all the condemned-prisoners  as well as the absconding convict  upon his securing arrest should be hanged.<br/><br/>9.             Mr. Md. Amir Hossain, the learned Advocate appearing for the condemned-prisoners submits that there is no eye-witness of the alleged occurrence in this case and that the conviction of the condemned-prisoners are solely based on the judicial confessional statements made by them  which have been extracted from them by exercising threat and coercion  upon them and the same have not been  voluntarily made  by them. The learned Advocate further submits that in the instant case all the condemned-prisoners were produced before the Magistrate for recording their confession from Police custody about after 2 days from their arrest  and that in the Post Mortem Report of the deceased, Shilpi Khatun no sign of rape was found and on these counts the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence is not sustainable in law. More so, there was no motive for committing murder of the victim even if the confessional statements made by the condemned-prisoners are taken to be true and voluntary. Mr. Hossain  further submits that all the condemned-prisoners  are  aged between 18-24 and this shows  that they  all are of tender age and that the condemned-prisoners have been in condemned cell for about 6 years. The learned Advocate, lastly, entreats submitting that if the Hon’ble Court is pleased to uphold the impugned judgment and order of conviction, in consideration of their tender age and long detention in the condemned cell and as they had no pre-meditation and initial motive to kill the victim, the sentence of the condemned-prisoners may be commuted to imprisonment for life from death.<br/><br/>10.          Mrs. Shahanara Begum, the learned Advocate, as State defence lawyer, appearing for the  absconding convict-Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur  adopted the submission  made by Mr. Md. Amir Hossain, the learned Advocate appearing for the condemned-prisoners as above.<br/><br/>11.          Now, let us see whether the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence is sustainable in law.<br/><br/>12.          Admittedly, victim Shilpi Khatun was married  to the condemned-prisoner Noor Islam  about one and a half months before the alleged occurrence and while she had been staying at the house of the informant’s sister, on 25.10.2002, Friday, Noor Islam went there to take Shilpi Khatun back and after staying there for one week, on 31.10.2002, Thursday at about 4-50 P.M. Noor Islam taking victim Shilpi Khatun  with him left  that house for his own house at village Nilkantha Nagar  and at Jhowdanga  they boarded  on a bus  and got down at Godkhali Bus-stand at about 6-15 P.M.  and at 9-30 P.M. on that date  Noor Islam  came home and disclosed  that his wife  Shilpi has been forcibly snatched away by miscreants   and on search  at about 9-50 P.M. the dead body of the victim, Shilpi Khatun  was found nacked  lying in the Papaw garden of Hossain Ali.<br/><br/>13.          It is alleged in the F.I.R. that having seen the dead body  of Shilpi Khatun information was given to the Jhikorgachha Police Station and, meanwhile, accused Noor Islam disclosed that as per pre-meditation he took Shilpi Khatun  to the Papaw garden of Hossain Ali where his accomplices Jahangir @ Gani, Hajiluddin @ Azizur Rahman, Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur (absconding)  and Zia  gang-raped her and then caused her death by strangulation fastening  sharee around her neck.<br/><br/>14.          The informant Md. Rajbul Hossain, uncle of the deceased Shilpi Khatun, appearing as P.W. 1 has corroborated the prosecution case in toto as given in the F.I.R. . His testimony regarding time, place and manner of the occurrence as given in the F.I.R. remains in tact and during cross-examination by the defence he could not be shaken on those vital points. In the instant case although the prosecution has examined as many as 19 witnesses but, in fact, there is no eye-witness to the occurrence amongst them and the prosecution case  leading to the conviction  and sentence of the contemned-prisoners  and the absconding  convict-Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur  is solely based on the inculpatory confessional statements made by the condemned-prisoners  as well as on the attending facts, circumstances, evidence and materials on record.<br/><br/>15.          Amongst the P.Ws., P.W. 16 Monoara  Khatun is the aunt of the deceased Shilpi Khatun who has said by corroborating  the informant P.W. 1  that on the alleged  date of occurrence at about 4-30 P.M. accused Noor Islam took Shilpi Khatun with him for going to his house  after staying about a week in her house  and on the next date at about 8 A.M. she came to know from Nazrul Islam, a  Police of Jhikorgachha Police Station, that Shilpi Khatun died. She came to Thana, saw the dead body  of  Shilpi Khatun  wrapped with a patti and also saw  accused Noor Islam at the Police Station and, on query,  he confessed that he killed Shilpi Khatun.<br/><br/>16.          P.W. 5 Md. Fazlur Rahman Foza, a Shop keeper, has said that  on 31.10.2002,  at about dusk, accused Noor Islam and Shilpi Khatun bought  Bidi and  Navy cigarette for one taka from his  shop and, thereafter, heard that  Shilpi Khatun has been murdered .<br/><br/>17.          P.W.2  Md. Alamgir, P.W. 3  Md. Akter Hossain (Ripon)  and P.W. 15 Rafiqul Islam have said that accused Noor Islam confessed  in  their presence that he caused the murder  of Shilpi Khatun at the Papaw garden of Hossain Ali.<br/><br/>18.          In the instant case, the alleged occurrence took place in between 18.50 and 21.30 hours on 31.10.2002 and the accused Noor Islam was arrested on 31.10.2002, immediately, after the occurrence.  Accused Jahangir @ Gani, Hajiluddin and Zia were arrested on 1.11.2002. The accused Noor Islam, on 2.11.2002, and accused Jahangir @ Gani, Hajiluddin and Zia, on 3.11.2002, were produced before the Magistrate (P.W. 17 Ashuk Kumar Debonath) who on the same date, after observing all the formalities  of law as provided under Section 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, recorded their confessional statements. The confessional Statements of  Noor Islam, Md. Ziaur Rahman,  Hajiluddin  @ Azizur Rahman and Md. Jahangir Alam are marked as Exhibits 5, 6, 7 and 8 respectively .<br/><br/>19.          The confessional statement  of accused Md.

The vivid picture of the  alleged occurrence as narrated by the condemned-prisoners in their aforesaid confessional statements appear to us to be natural. It appears from the aforesaid confessional statements that the Magistrate (P.W. 17 Ashuk Kumar Debonath)  while recording those statements it appeared to him that the said statements were true and made voluntarily  and there was no complaint of maltreatment or injuries  noticed on the person of the accused.<br/><strong> <br/>24.  </strong>        The Inquest Report of the deceased Shilpi Begum, markd as Ext.10, prepared by P.W. 19 Md. Abdur Rob Akond  who is also the Investigating Officer of the case, found  ligature mark  on the neck and sperm seemed to be present on the private parts. It is further mentioned in the Inquest Report that upon preliminary inquiry it was learnt that the  victim was gang-raped by miscreants  and then  she was done to death by strangulation fastening her  neck by cloth. The testimony of P.W. 19 Abdur Rob Akonda is quite consistent with the Inquest Report, marked as Ext.10, as well as the prosecution case as made in the F.I.R. The Post Mortem  Report of the dead body of Shilpi Khatun, marked as Ext.9, prepared by P.W. 18 Dr. A.R.M. Mostayeen Billah,  shows that there was one ill-diffused  circular and continuous  ligature mark present in the middle part of the neck, breadth  about 4 &amp; 2/3  floor  slightly abraded  and  each margin was congested.  However, it was mentioned in that Post Mortem Report against column  No.11 that vaginal  swab  and RBC  and spermatazoon -  not found. But against column No.9 urinal space  was found congested. If that be so, such congestion might be  the ultimate cause  of frequent penetration  which also  inclines to believe that the victim was gang-raped before she was done to death in the manner as alleged by the prosecution. The Inquest Report, marked as Ext. 10, and the Post Mortem Report, marked as Ext. 9, of the dead body of Shilpi Khatun are quite consistent with the prosecution case as well as with the inculpatory confessional statements made by the condemned-prisoners regarding the manner  of occurrence that the victim  was done to death after she being gang-raped. The confessional statements made by the condemned-prisoners appear to us to be true and voluntary and there is nothing to disbelieve those statements. From the aforesaid  confessional statements of the condemned-prisoners it is apparent that the victim, Shilpi Khatun was done to death  after she being gang-raped  by the condemned prisoners and the absconding convict-Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur. All the condemned-prisoners in their aforesaid  confessional statements have said corroborating each other  that at the place of occurrence the absconding  accused  Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur,  at first, fell the victim  Shilpi Khatun down on the ground at the alleged place of occurrence  and raped her and then the other condemned-prisoners gang-raped her one after another  and after the gang-rape  was over absconding convict-Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur strangulated the victim fastening  her neck by her sharee  which resulted in her death. The said  sharee was found lying beside the dead body which has been marked as material Ext.I. The confessional statements of the concemned-presinorens lend assurance to this independent material evidence whereby Shilpi Khatun was strangulated to death causing ligature mark on her neck which are sufficient to form the basis of conviction of the absconding co-convict Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur. Co-convict Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur has been in abscosion since inception of the case which is also a strong circumstance  to show that he was  concerned with the commission of the alleged gang-rape with murder.<br/><br/><strong>25.    </strong>      P.W. 18 Dr. A.R.M.Mostayeen Billah  was one of the members of the Medical Board who held  the Post Mortem Examination upon the dead body of  Shilpi Khatun and he put his signature on the Post Mortem Report, marked as Ext.9. It appears from the  deposition of P.W. 18 as well as from the Post Mortem Report that the post mortem upon the dead body of Shilpi Khatun was conducted by a Board  of three Medical Officers  of which he was a member. The concerned Doctors in the Board ought to have  given their utmost attention as experts on the physical and pathological condition of each part of the body and to give their  considered medical  opinion  in respect of any abnormality of limbs with possible explanation for such abnormality. An omnibus statement that the death was due to asphyxia  resulting from strangulation which was anti-mortem and homicidal in nature are not enough and not expected from the medical persons  who are presumed to be experts . They ought to be specific in their findings and to the point in indicating  the abnormalities  found in the urinal organ  to be congested  ascertaining it’s specific cause  when the Medical Board found the urinal organ of the dead body to be congested.  In this case, their own report ought to have  put  them on alert that  this might be  a case of rape , as such,  necessary further investigation ought to have been done  by them. But unfortunately, the Board did not even consider it necessary to examine the discharge from vagina  by a Chemical Examiner  and without doing so how could they opine that vaginal swab, RBC and spermatazoon – not found. This only highlights their inefficiency  and indifference to their professional work.<br/><br/><strong>26.  </strong>        However, in consideration  of the evidence on record including the inculpatory judicial confessional statements of the condemned-prisoners, the Inquest Report  being the first recorded version  of the offence based on actual observation as well as the Post Mortem Report, we have no hesitation  to hold, inspite of the findings of the Doctors  without any comment as to rape,   that the victim, Shilpi  Khatun was gang-raped  by the condemned-prisoners  alongwith the absconding convict- Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur before she met her death  which brings the offence under the ambit of Section 9(3) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000.<br/><br/>27.          In the instant case, conviction of the condemned-prisoners  and the absconding convict-Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur  is solely based on the inculpatory judicial  confessions of the condemned-prisoners supported by other material evidence and attending circumstances. Confession is manifestly a very important and convincing material for proving the offence committed  by such  persons  making confession. According to the Rule of Law conviction can  be based solely on the confession against it’s maker, if it is found voluntary and true though the Rule of Prudence may require some sort of corroboration with giving facts. It is not necessary  that each and every circumstances mentioned in the confession regarding complicity of the accused must independently be corroborated as it is necessary in the case of using the confession  of an accused against his co-accused. It is enough if the general trend of confession is substantiated by the evidence which would tally with what is contained in the confession. For ascertaining as to whether the confession is voluntary and true or not the Court  has to examine the confession itself and also to consider the same in the light of other materials on record and broad probabilities of the case.<br/><br/>28.     The next question arises, whether the confession can be the basis of conviction against the makers  if found retracted. It is well settled that once a confession has been found to be true and voluntary, the conviction of the confessing accused can be based on the said confession, even if it is retracted. This view of ours finds support from the decisions in the cases of Joygun Bibi Vs. The State reported in 12 D.L.R. (SC) 157 and Hozrat Ali and Abdur Rahman -Vs.- the State reported in 42 D.L.R,. (HCD) (1990) 177.<br/><br/>29.          It appears that, in the instant case, the alleged occurrence took place on 31.10.2002 at about 9-30 P.M. and, after the occurrence, on the same night at 12-30 P.M. the condemned-prisoner, Noor Islam was arrested and on the following day i.e. on 1.11.2002 the other 3 condemned prisoners were arrested by the Police. Thereafter, the condemned-prisoner, Noor Islam, on 2.11.2002, and the rest 3 condemned-prisoners, on 3.11.2002, were placed before the Magistrate- P.W. 17, Ashok Kumar Debonath for recording their judicial confessional statements and on those respective dates he recorded the confessional statements of all the 4 condemned prisoners. He has said that while recording their confessional statements he did not notice any mark of torture on their persons.  From the confessional statements of the condemned-presoners, marked as Ext. 5, 6, 7 and 8, we find that while making these confessional statements they also did not disclose to the Magistrate that they were forced, tortured and compelled by Police in making such confessional statements and the same were not voluntary and true. P.W. 19  Abdur  Ron Akand, the Investigation  Officer also denied the defence suggestion that the condemned-prisoners  were tortured after arrest and threatened  to make the confessional statements. We find no reason to disbelieve the evidence of the learned Magistrate. No material could be elicited by the defence that the confession was the result of torture  and maltreatment and hence these were not voluntary and not true as well. There is also nothing to show that the Police or any witness had any reason to falsely implicate the condemned-prisoners and the absconding convict in this case.<br/><br/>30.          Further  it appears that the learned  Magistrate while recording the confessional statements  of the condemned prisoners ascertained that the confessions were voluntary and true and there was also no complaint before him. We find that all the legal procedures were followed in recording the confessions and the learned Magistrate, P.W. 17 gave sufficient  caution and also time for reflection before recording the confessions marked as Exts.5, 6, 7 and 8. The Tribunal below also ascertained the truth as well as the  voluntariness  of the confessions made by the condemned-prisoners. The learned Magistrate  found that the condemned-prisoners gave a full and free account of the occurrence in order to satisfy  that they along with absconding convict were really involved in the commission of the alleged gang-rape  and murder of Shilpi Khatun. It appears from the record that the confession of the condemned   prisoner Noor Islam was recorded on 2.11.2002 and of the rest 3 condemned prisoners on 3.11.2002 and, thereafter, all of them retracted their confessions on 22.4.2003 i.e. after  four months alleging, for the first time, that Police upon torture compelled  them to make such confessional statements which are not at all voluntary and true. The allegation of torture  by the Police  was raised  at a very late stage and there having no material on record to substantiate the same,  we are unable to place any reliance on the allegations made in the said retraction petitions. Nothing could be elicited from the cross-examination of the witnesses that the aforesaid confessions were not voluntary and true and there was also nothing to show that the confessions were obtained by torture or maltreatment of the Police or that the same was the result of inducement.<br/><br/>31.          It is well-settled that once a confession is found to be true and voluntary, the conviction could be based solely on confession, even if it is retracted.<br/><br/>32.          In the absence  of any  positive material to the contrary, the presumption  of correctness  of recording the confessional statements  upon observing all the required legal formalities  can very well be inferred and we have reason to believe that P.W. 17, on being satisfied  that the accused would freely and voluntarily confess their guilt, recorded their confession and that accused also made no complaint before the Magistrate.  We do not find any cogent reason as to why self-implication of the condemned prisoners in the commission of offence cannot be taken as true. Retraction of confession   at an earliest opportunity some time may lend support to the defence plea that the confession was not voluntary one but for the bilated retraction of a confession as in the present case, without any material to support it, no such inference can be drawn. Rather, the consensus of judicial decisions are that an accused may be convicted even on retracted confession, if it is inculpatory and found to be voluntary and true. It has been further contended that prolonged Police custody immediately preceding the confession is sufficient, if not properly explained, to find the confession as involuntary. In the case of  Abdur Rouf and others versus the State reported in 38 D.L.R. 197, the delay in producing  the accused before  the Magistrate  from the Police custody was ignored and it is held, in the absence of any positive material to the contrary, the presumption of correctness of recording  the confessional statement upon observing  all formalities may very well be inferred . In the present case mere keeping three of the condemned prisoners  in Police custody for two days does not ifso facto make the confession involuntary in nature. We are satisfied that all the  legal formalities  have been observed  in this case by the Magistrate in recording the confessional statements marked as Exts. 5, 6, 7 and 8. There is nothing on record to show that the condemned-prisoners made the confessions out of fear or torture or maltreatment of the Police and or that the confession was the result of inducement.<br/><br/>33.          Thus, we are inclined to hold that the aforesaid inculpatory confessional statements made by the condemned-prisoners are voluntary  and true which can alone be the sole basis of their conviction.<br/><br/>34.          On careful consideration of the evidence  and materials on record we hold that the prosecution had satisfactorily  proved  by inculpatory  confessional statements made by the condemned-presioners, attending circumstances and materials on record that the condemned prisoners 1) Noor Islam, 2) Ziaur Rahman @ Zia,   3) Jahangir @ Gani, 4) Hazil Uddin @ Azizur Rahman. and absconding accused   Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur   killed Shilpi Khatun  instantaneously after  committing  gang-rape on her  and they have rightly been found guilty and as such convicted  by the  learned Judge of the Tribunal below under  Section 9(3) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000.<br/><br/>35.          As regards the sentence passed against the condemned prisoners and absconding convict  Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur the learned Advocates appearing for them prayed for commutation of their sentence on ground of long delay in disposal of the Death Reference  and other attending circumstances. Let us now consider as to whether  there are extenuating  circumstances for the commutation of sentence of death of the condemned prisoners  as well as  of the  absconding convict.<br/><br/>36.     It appears that at the time of making of confessional statements the age of the condemned prisoner, Noor Islam was 22 years, Ziaur Rahman, 18 years, Hajiluddin, 24 years and Jahangir Alam,  18 years. Furthermore, since arrest of the condemned-prisoners on 1.11.2002 they had been in custody for about 3 years prior to passing of their order of conviction and sentence on 4.9.2005 and they, having made true and full disclosure  of their guilt in their confessional statements have been languishing in the condemned cell  of the jail custody with much agony and anxiety. Moreover, from the date of making the Death Reference by the Tribunal  below on 5.9.2005  about 5 ½ years have already elapsed, not due to any laches of the condemned prisoners, in the making Death Reference and the Appeals ready for disposal as a result of which also the condemned prisoners have undergone the mental agony and  anxieties of gallows  around their neck for a long period.  Thus, on giving our careful consideration to the delay in disposal of the Death Reference  and Appeals  along with other factors as extenuating  circumstances, we think that the ends of justice would be sufficiently met if we commute the sentence of death  passed upon the condemned prisoners and the absconding convict Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur to imprisonment for life . Considering the circumstances  mentioned, we are not inclined to set aside the conviction  of the condemned prisoners 1) Noor Islam, 2) Ziaur Rahman @ Zia,   3) Jahangir @ Gani, 4) Hazil Uddin @ Azizur Rahman. and absconding accused   Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur and at the same time we are also not inclined to  accept the reference of death sentence while confirming  the conviction and hence we hereby  commute the sentence of death of all the aforesaid condemned prisoners  and the absconding convict  Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur to imprisonment for life. At the same time we consider it expedient to add with the sentence of fine that, in default of payment of such fine as awarded by the Tribunal below, all the aforesaid condemned prisoners and the absconding convict Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur  are to suffer rigorous imprisonment for  two years more each.<br/><br/>37.          All the condemned prisoners and the absconding convict  Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur are entitled to get the benefit as provided  under Sub-Section (1) of Section 35 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><br/>38.          For the reasons stated above we reject the Death Reference No. 143 of 2005 and also dismiss the Criminal Appeal No. 4095 of 2005 and the Jail Appeal Nos. 1060 of 2005, 1061 of 2005, 1062 of 2005 and 1063 of 2005 of the condemned prisoners with the modification of sentence of all the condemned prisoners  and absconding convict Aaizel @ Aazu @ Azizul Haque @ Azizur  from death to imprisonment  for life and, as to their  sentence   to pay a fine of Tk. 1,00,000/- each, in default to pay the fine, they are to suffer rigorous imprisonment for two years more each.<br/><br/><strong>                Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
