Learned Advocate further submits that plaint cannot be rejected on the ground of res-judicata and also submits that some of the findings arrived at by the learned trial judge in fact require evidence to settle the dispute as such the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside, Learned Advocate relied on the decision of Mahbubul Haque (Md) vs. Md. A. Kader Munshi, 52 DLR(AD)-49, the case of Shawkat Ali Chowdhury vs. G. Murshed Reza and others, 7 Law Guardian, 24 also the case reported in new publication law report, i.e. Nurul Islam Chowdhury vs. Morshedul Alam and others, I LNJ (AD)-3. Crux of all these decisions that a plaint cannot be rejected on the ground of limitation as well as on the ground of resjudicata as these are mixed question of law and fact.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     Mr. Tajul Islam Miajee, learned Advocate, appearing for the respondents, on reference to the judgment passed by the learned Joint District Judge, submits that, plaintiffs earlier filed suit against the decision of the partition suit and that suit was dismissed upto appellate forum and relief claimed being similar, learned judge committed no illegality in rejecting the plaint on the ground of resjudicata. Learned Advocate relied on the case of Chief Engineer Roads and Highways Department vs. Concord Engineers and Construction Ltd., 48 DLR-243 wherein it is settled that a plaint is liable to reject where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     In  the  instant case plaintiffs  instituted  the suit with two prayers, one for partition and another for declaration and for setting aside the judgment and decree obtained in Partition Suit No.61 of 1983 from the Court of Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court Comilla.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     It appears from the judgment and findings mentioned herein above that learned Judge did not at all go through the plaint itself rather it appears that learned judge rejected the plaintiff holding it barred by resjudicata on the defense materials.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure speaks that:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>The plaint shall be rejected in the following cases:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(a)    where it does not disclose a cause of action;<br/>(b)    where the relief claimed is under valued, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court fails to do so;<br/>(c)    where the relief claimed is properly valued, but the plaint   is   written   upon   paper   insufficiently   stamped, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to supply the requisite<br/>stamp-paper within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so;<br/>(d)    where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be bared by any law.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    If we gathered from the application filed by the defendants for rejection of the plaint that it attract Rule 11 Order VII of the Code of Civil Procedure on the ground of resjudicata but on reference to the plaint we do not find such type of statement by which it can be said plaint is barred by any law.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    In the case of Shawkat All Chowdhury vs. G. Murshed Reza and others, 7 Law Guardian-24, on reference many of the decision held that plaint cannot be rejected on the ground of resjudicata as it is mixed question of law and fact .<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    In the case of Jahura Bibi and others -vs- Mr. Habibur Rahman and others, 15 BLD 519, where it has been held in as much as from the statements made in the plaint the said suit does not appear to be barred by limitation.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    In the case of All India Reporter Limited, Bombay -vs- Ramachandra Dhordo Dater, AIR 1861(Bom)292 where the question arose whether the plaint can be rejected when there is irregularities in the plaint, i.e. if the plaint is not properly signed or verified, it has been held that "In this case it is necessary to note that order VII Rule 11 which refers to the rejection of a plaint, enumerates only four cases in which a plain has to be rejected, but it does not enumerate any of the defects or irregularities referred to in order VI rule 14, order VI rule 15 or order VI rule 2.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    In the decision of Secretary of State - Defendant – Appellant -vs- Golabrai Paliram-Plaintiff-Respondent, AIR 1932 (Cal.) 146 and ILR 34 (Bom) 250. The Firm of Gunnaji Bhawaji -vs- Makanji Khoosalchand and others Respondents and Defendants it has been held that where a plaint appears to be barred by limitation and no ground of exemption from limitation is mentioned therein the Court may in proper cases allow an amendment of the plaint under order VI rule 17 of the Code of the Code so as to make a plea of exemption, if any.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    In the case of Shafi A Chowdhury vs. Pubali Bank Ltd. and others, 54 DLR-311 it has been held that an issue of resjudicata can not be resolved in disposing of a petition under clause (d) of rule 11 of order VII of the Code, because in rejecting a plaint under the said provision, the Court cannot travel beyond the four corners of the plaint. The concluding portion of this judgment give a guideline for disposing of an application under order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure and I am tempted to quote the same:-<br/>“44. Before parting with the case I would like to observe that whenever a learned Judge is confronted with a petition to reject a plaint he must first assume that the plaint was legally filed, unless that defendant persuades him to hold that the plaint is liable to be rejected in limini under order VII rule 11 of the Code. In dealing with such a petition he should not be unnecessarily hasty, rather act judiciary in considering the plaint,"<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    In the case of Abdul Malek Sowdagar vs. Mahbubey Alam, 57 D.L.R (AD) 18 it has been held that "the question as to whether the plaint is liable to be rejected being barred by law, must be apparent from the statement made in the plaint itself and not from that written statement or any other materials other than that has been put in the plaint. Thus this provision applies when it appears from the statement in the plaint that suit is barred by any law either due to limitation, resjudicata or barred by law providing ouster of the jurisdiction of the Court."<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    In the case of Mohammad Ali vs. Lt. Col. (Retired) Habibullah Bahar and others, 58 DLR (AD) 245=26 BLD (AD) 273 it has been held that "on consideration of the facts and circumstances we hold that, the bar of section 56(k) of the Specific Relief Act non-production of document under rule 14 of order VII has no manner of application in considering petition under order VII rule 11 of the Code Nor on point of maintainability of the suit, the plaint is liable to be thrown away in limini as the question may be agitated in framing an issue to the point. Similarly, for alleged vagueness in the schedule, if any, the plaint is not liable to be rejected."<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    The crux of these decisions is that plaint can be rejected under order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. only on reference to the statements made in the plaint, not on defense material.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    Since all the authorises held that plaint cannot be rejected on the ground of resjudicata we find that learned judge committed gross illegality in rejecting the plaint on the ground of resjudi-cata. However, if the defendant wants to burie the suit earlier they can frame special issue as per order XIV Rule 2 the Code of Civil Procedure for a decision.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    In the result, this appeal i.e. F. A. No. 123 of 2008 is allowed with these observations. No cost.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    The impugned judgment and decree dated 9.10.2007 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 3rd Court; Comilla rejecting the plaint in Title Suit No. 9 of 2005 is set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>    Learned Judge   is directed to proceed with the suit in accordance with law.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>    In Civil Revision No. 32.27 of 2006 plaintiffs challenge the judgment and decree passed by the learned District Judge, Comilla in Title Appeal No. 60 of 2005 affirming those dated 5.3.2005 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Chouddagram Sadar, Comilla dismissing Title Suit No. 45 of 2002 of its maintainability.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>    The case of the plaintiffs is that, Asgar Ali alias Asgar Bepari was the owner and possessor of the land described in the schedule Nos. l and 2 to the plaint and before C.S. operation, Asgar Ali permitted one Akub Ali to live in one portion of his homestead with a view to manage and look after his property and Akub Ali also was allowed him to cultivate some of his land without any title. During C.R. operation most of the land was correctly recorded in the name of Asgar Ali in C.R. khatian Nos. 10 and 13 but in C.R. khatian No. 4 in respect of land described in schedule No. l and the land wherein Akub Ali was allowed to reside was recorded in his name in possession column in plot No. 1961 and 2188 and Akub Ali also managed to record his name in possession column of plot No. 1897, 1898 and 2181.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>    The land of 2nd schedule was also belonged to Asgar Ali During C.R. operation, Akub All managed to record his name in C.R. khatian No. 134. Asgar All died leaving sons namely, Ashraf Ali and Altaf Ali. Ashraf Ali died leaving three sons namely, Humayun Kabir, Abdul Sobhan and Abdul Majid and 4 daughters namely Meher Nigar and defendant Nos. 28-30. Mehar Nigar died leaving plaintiff No. 1 as husband, 4 sons as plaintiffs Nos. 2-5 and 2 daughters' plaintiff Mos. 6 and 7. Recently plaintiffs could know defendant got a decree in Partition Suit No. 61 of 1983 in respect of the suit land by practicing fraud hence the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>    The case of the defendant Nos. 1-23, in short, is that, Basi Gazi was the owner of 1st schedule land who died leaving 2 sons in Asgar Ali Bepari and Wali Gazi and one daughter, Anu Bibi who became owner of 2nd schedule land and were possessing in ejmali. During C.R. operation their names have been recorded in schedule 1. Wali Gazi died leaving wife and son, Akub Ali. Akub Ali inherited the land firm his parents and his paternal aunt, Anu Bibi, who gifted 0.26 acres of land orally to Akub Ali and thereafter, husband of Anu Bibi and two daughters transferred 17 kora to Akub Ali by registered deed dated 13.5.1914. Akub Ali mortgaged the said land to Zinnat Ali. Asgar Ali died leaving two sons in Ashraf Ali and Altaf Ali. Atokjan died issueless leaving cousin Akub Ali, Ashraf Ali and Altab Ali. Akub Ali got 106 decimals of land from 1st schedule and 0.44 acres of land from 2nd schedule by way of inheritance and gift. Jafar Ali died leaving defendant Nos. 1 to 3 as heirs. Aahraf Ali died leaving defendant Nos. 26 to 30 as sons and daughters. Defendant Nos. 1-23 filed Partition Suit No.61 of 1983 and got decree and after obtaining final decree in the suit, defendant Nos.26-40 of the present suit filed Partition Suit No. 98 of 2000. The suit was dismissed for default. Thereafter, this suit was filed as such it is liable to be dismissed with cost.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>    The case of defendant Nos.34 to 41 is that Asgar Ali and Akub Ali were the owners and possessors of schedule Nos.l and 2 in equal share. Asgar Ali died leaving 2 sons in Ashraf Ali and Altaf Ali. For arrears of rent 1st schedule land was went back to talukder. Jatindramohon Sengupta. Ashraf Ali took back the same on 1.5.1916. Ashraf Ali died leaving defendant Nos. 26-27 as sons and grandsons' defendant Nos.31 and 32 and four daughters, plaintiffs are the heirs of Meher Nigar. Defendants have no objection regarding title of the plaintiffs in respect of 0. 29 acres of land. Defendants are owners and possessors of 1.16 acres of land from schedule Nos. l and 2 by way of inheritance.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>    Both the Courts dismissed the suit, practically held that plaintiffs failed to prove that they are the heirs of Mehar Nigar and also failed to prove Mehar Nigar is daughter of Ashraf Ali.<br/> <br/><strong>30.    </strong>Mr. Mozamnel Hossain learned Advocate, appearing for the plaintiff-petitioner, submits thnt, Courts below concurrently and constantly were in error of law in shifting onus upon the plaintiffs to prove the fact that Mehar Nigar was daughter of Ashraf Ali and they are the heirs of Meharnigaras such, learned Advocate submits that, since onus have been wrongly shifted to the plaintiffs, the judgment and decree suffers from misreading of the facts, is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong>    Mr.   Bhishmadev  Chakraborty,   learned  Advocate,  on  the other hand, submits that, P.Ws. failed to prove they are heirs of Meharnigar who is a daughter of Ashraf Ali, the depositions of P.Ws on this score  are totally contradictory and not believable, as such, courts below committed no illegality in dismissing the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong>    To find the question of fact that whether Meharnigar was daughter of Ashraf Ali we may refer to the depositions of the witnesses. P.W. L Kabir Mian himself deposed that he is son of Meharnigar. When any one claim that he is the son of some one further prove  is  not necessary as  onus is shifter to the claimant who challenge his paternity to produce evidence that such person is not the son of such person whom he claim to his father or mother then and the person claim to be son of some one require to satisfy the fact of his paternity by aducing evidence. In the instant case when P.W 1 claim that he is son of Meher Nigar it is enough to hold P.W 1 is son of Mehar Nigar and onus entirely shifted to the defendants to prove whether Kabir Mian, P.W.I plaintiff No. 2, is son of Meharnigar and Meharnigar was daughter of Ashraf Ali. To this extent we find that Courts below committed gross illegality.<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong>    Issues were framed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge are that:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><sup>“</sup>1.Is the suit maintainable in its present form and forum ?<br/>2. Were the impugned judgment dated 15.3.99, the preliminary decree dated 21.3.99 and the final decree dated 8.7.01 passed in Partition Suit No. 61/83 by the Court of 2nd Sub-judge, Comilla obtained by practicing fraud upon the plaintiffs and court as well?<br/>3. Are the plaintiffs entitled to get the relief as prayed for ?<br/>4. To what other relief, if any, are the plaintiffs entitled ? "</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>34.</strong>    It appears that no issue was framed as to identity of plaintiffs' paternity as such, the finding on this score i.e plaintiffs have no locus standi to challenge the decree as they are not the heirs of Meharnigar and Meharnigar was the daughter of Ashraf Ali are not sustainable. Unless issue be framed no one is bound to prove such fact. Plaintiffs whether the heirs of Ashraf Ali is the prime question and dispute to be settled but it appears no issue on this score was framed which prejudice the plaintiffs. Since both the Courts below proceed in wrong promises we are not require to go deep into the decisions arrived at by the Courts below. We are of the view that this suit is required to be tried afresh with the observations made herein above. We are directing the learned Senior Assistant Judge to frame an issue on the identity of the plaintiffs paternity thereafter proceed with the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong>    In the result, this rule i.e. Civil Revision No. 3227 of 2006 is made absolute.
