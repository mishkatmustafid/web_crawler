These glaring inconsistencies between the existence of the injuries on the dead body of victim as found by the post mortem doctor and the evidence of the prosecution witnesses about the injuries caused by the appellants irresistibly lead us to a conclusion that the occurrence did not take place in the manner as alleged by the prosecution. Such failure to exhibit the original copy of the post-mortem report, the possibility of such carbon copy being a fabricated copy cannot be ruled out.

Case No.6 dated 14.11.1999 corresponding to GR No. 140 of 1999 convicting the appellants under section 10(2) and 14 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995  (hereinafter refer as Ain) and sentencing each of them to suffer imprisonment for life.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>     The prosecution case, in short, is that, the deceased Hasina Akhter alias Ratna was given in marriage on 16.05.2007 with the convict-appellant  Abul Bashar, that after 10/12 days of marriage, the co-accused Nos.3,4 and 5 including another convict Morium Bibi, mother of Abul Bashar, stared demanding dowry to the tune of Tk.70,000/= for arranging a Saudi Arabian visa for Abul Bashar; that the victim used to inform her father about the demand for dowry; that upon refusal by the family of the deceased Ratna to meet the demand for dowry, the two appellants Abul Bashar and his mother mounted torture on the deceased.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>     It is further stated that the allegation of beating and demanding dowry was taken to the local Salish where appellant in the presence of PW 1, PW 3 and PW 4 promised not to torture his wife and took her home; that in the night before the date of incident, appellants Morium Bibi and her son Abul Bashar on the excuse of delay in cooking food tortured  her again on different parts of her body; that the next morning on 29.07.1999 when Ratna was coming to her father’s home, then the appellant Abul Bashar with the order of co-accused Nos.3 and 5 forcefully brought her inside and on her request for water, they poisoned her and strangled her to death after beating.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     Sensing death of the victim, a boy from nearby house came to the home of her father Omar Ahmed Khondoker and informed him about the death of his daughter. He went there immediately and found the victim dead. Soon after, he along with the company of PW-3 went to Fatikchari police station and accordingly lodged the UD case No. 20 of 1999 dated 29.07.1999. Thereafter, the brother of the deceased came to know that, in fact, the convict-appellants and other co-accused killed her sister. Accused No, 4 and 5 forging signature of his father made out the said UD case No.20 of 1999 dated 29.07.1999. Stating the above, facts Ratna’s brother Abdul Halim submitted a written complaint to the Magistrate on 31.10.1999. Treating the above complaint  as FIR, Fatikchari P.S Case No.6 dated 14.11.1999 u/s 10 (1)and 14 of the Nari-O-Shisu Nirjatan (Bishes Bidhan) Ain, 1995 was recorded against these two convict-appellants and three others named in the ejahar that corresponds to G.R. No 140 of 1999.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     After investigation, police submitted the report being Charge sheet No. 12 dated 23.02.2000 against the 4(four) accused persons including the convict appellants and sent them up for trial for committing offence punishable  under section 10(1) and 14 of the  Nari-O-Shishu  Nirjatan Bishesh Bidhan Ain, 1995 stating, inter alia, that the allegations against the accused persons were prima facie  found to be true.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>       After being ready the case was transferred to the learned Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No. 3 Chittagong and renumbered as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Case No. 177 of 2003 (previously it was numbered as Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 63 of 2000).<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     The learned Tribunal, thereafter, framed charge against the accused Abul Basher under section 4/10(1) of the Nari-O-Shishu  Nirjatan ( Bishesh Bidhan) Ain 1995 and under section 4/10(1)/14 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan  (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain 1995 against the other accused Marium Bibi, Shahjahan and Bacchu Miah.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>       The trial of the case was held before the Tribunal Judge, Chittagong and in total 9 prosecution witnesses appeared before the Tribunal who were examined by the prosecution and cross-examined in part by the defence with the exception of prosecution witness No. 3 who was declared hostile.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     The appellants were examined under section 342 of the Code of criminal Procedure and they denied the charges brought and the allegations made against them. The defence did not call for any witness.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    From the trend  of cross examination  and  the defence case, it   appears  to be a case of innocence  of the accused and that there was no demand of any dowry from the  wife  and there was any attempt of kill the victim by the accused as alleged by the prosecution but that the victim died by taking poison.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    After considering the facts circumstances and evidence of the case, the learned Judge, Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Tribunal convicted the accused under section 10(2) and 14 of the Ain, 1995 sentencing them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life by the judgment and order dated 06.11.2007.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    Being aggrieved  by and dissatisfied  with the  impugned judgment and order of conviction under section 10(2)/14  of the  Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Bishesh Bidhan  Ain, 1995, the appellants have  come up  with the present appeal  which is opposed by the respondent state through  learned Deputy Attorney General.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    Mr. Hassan S.M. Azim the learned Advocate for the appellant  took us to the FIR, the charge so framed, the deposition of the prosecution witnesses, impugned judgment and the  material papers and documents which are available in the paper books and submits that the convict appellants are totally innocent and they  have  not committed the crime as alleged by the prosecution; that the learned Tribunal misinterpreted, misread and misunde-rstood the oral evidence as well as documentary  evidence in the case and erred in convicting and sentencing the appellants on such misreading and misapplication of evidence; that the learned Tribunal erred in failing to note the contradictions in the depositions made by the PWs in their own depositions as well as against each other and the learned court failed to apply his judicial mind in assessing the evidence and that the impugned  judgment is illegal and unwarranted by facts and circumstances  of the case as such the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    Mrs. Sakila Rowshan, the learned Deputy Attorney General for the state, on the other hand submit that the learned Judge, Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat No. 3 Chittagong was justified in convicting and sentencing the accused appellants Abul Basher and Marium Bibi on assessing the evidence on record. She further submits that the prosecution has  proved its case  against the accused by most consistent, corroborative and  overwhelming evidence; that the learned Judge was perfectly justified  in convicting  and sentencing  the accused  appellants on the basis of the most  cogent and reliable evidence and that his judgment does not suffer from any misreading and non-reading of evidence. The learned Deputy Attorney General further submits that all the prosecution witnesses are natural, probable and competent witnesses and there is no internal points of falsehood in their evidence on any point and as such the impugned judgment calls for no interference by the court.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    The only point for determination in the appeal is whether the  learned  Judge was justified in convicting and sentencing  accused appellants Abul Basher and Marium Bibi under section 10(2)/14 of the  Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman  Bishesh Bidhan Ain, 1995 .<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    In the face of arguments advanced by the learned Advocates of the contending parties, we are now called upon to scrutinize the material evidence on record to come to a proper decision in this appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    P.W.1, Omer Ahmed Khondaker is the father of the  victim who deposed that the inmates of the house of his son-in law informed him that his daughter  died taking poison; that his son, who is the informant, was in his duty at Rubber Garden,  that accused Abul Basher is also his brother’s son; that accused Sajahan is also his brother’s son and accused Bachu is his nephew; and that his son filed  this case  3 three months of his  after filing of his UD case.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    He categorically stated in his cross examination that  his son in law Abul Basher who is the accused did never  demand any dowry from his daughter and thus he does not solicit his punishment.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    P.W.2, Abdul Halim, is the informant of this case who deposed in his examination in chief that he heard that his sister Hachina Akter died taking poison; that he was not in the house as he served in Holudia Rabber Garden; that he does not know what was written in his case. At this stage the learned court warned this witness to say like the contents of the FIR and thereafter the learned Judge adjourned the case from 18.02.2001 to 20.05.2001. Thereafter he deposed like the contents of the FIR and this sort of attitude of the learned Judge is not desirable which indicates that the learned Judge compelled this witness to depose according to the contents of FIR.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    In the cross examination,  he stated that he filed the case three months after the occurrence; that he did not  see the occurrence; that he heard about the occurrence but he did not hear the occurrence  from any person who saw the occurrence from his own eyes. He categorically stated in his cross examination that the accused did not demand any dowery; that his father informed him that his sister  died taking poison and that no salish was held at school field.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    P.w. 3.Mohammad Hossain, deposed that the father of the victim, Omer Ali Khandaker informed him on 29.09.1999 at about 11/12 hour that his daughter died taking poison.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    In the cross examination, he denied the defence suggestion  that he told to the I.O. that the accused  killing the victim poured poison into her mouth; that he did not depose to the I.O. and his  statement under section 161 is concocted; that no salish was held regarding demanding of dowery by the accused  and that the father or the brother of the victim did never disclose about the demanding of dowery by the accused.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>    P.W.4, Alkas Mia, deposed in his cross examination that he knows nothing about the occurrence.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>    P.W.5, Kala Miah, deposed in his cross examination  that he heard that the victim died taking poison.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>    P.W.6, Dr. Prodip Kumar Chowdhury, deposed  supporting P.M. report that the victim M Hachina died due to assault and effect of poison.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>    P.W.7, Dr. Aditta Kumar Roy, is a local doctor who deposed that the accused Abul Basher called him in his house on 29.07.1999 at 10.00 as his wife was ill and going there he found that his wife took poison. He categorically deposed that he came to understand by observing her symptom that she took poison for which he washed her stomach by tube mixing potash and water and thereafter he pushed 5000 CC saline and thereafter the victim died in his presence.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>    In the cross examination, he stated that after taking poison, Kornia became small  and poison’s saint was coming  from her mouth and thus he came to understand that the victim took poison and he found no injury mark inside  her mouth.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>     P.W. 8, SI Sheikh Lutfor Rahman, was the in charge of Datmara Investigation Centre. He testified that on 29.07.1999 the father of the victim filed a written complaint to the effect that his daughter died drinking poison and on  the basis of such complaint, an UD case no. 20 dated 29.07.1999 of Fatikchari P.S. was started and the investigation was entrusted on ASI Abdur Razzak who held inquest of the dead body of the victim and prepared an inquest report and sent the dead  body  to the morgue  for holding post mortem examination.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>    In the meantime, the brother of the victim  filed a complaint before the Magistrate,1<sup>st</sup> class who sent the complaint to the Fatikchori PS for treating the same as  FIR and accordingly Fatik chori  PS case No.06 dated 14.12.1999 under section 10(1)/14 of the Nari-Shishu Nirjatan Daman (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain  1995 was started and this witness was entrusted with the  task of investigation of the case  and getting the task of investigation, he visited the place of occurrence  prepared the sketch map of the place of occurrence and also prepared  Index thereof, recorded the statement of witnesses under section161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and later on he handed over the case docket to the officer in charge.<br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong>    P.W.9, ASI Abdur Razzak held the inquest report of the victim and submitted a report marked exhibit-6 and his signature thereon is marked exhibit 6/1. He categorically deposed that he found no hurt in the dead body.<br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong>    In the cross examination, he deposed that he heard from local people that the victim committed suicide taking poison. <br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong>    These are all the evidence produced by the prosecution.<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong>    In the instant case, the appellants were convicted under section 10(2)/14 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman (Bishesh Bidahan) Ain, 1995.<br/> <br/><strong>34.</strong>    Now let us see the provision of section 10(2)/14 of the Ain which runs thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>‘‘ধারা ১০। যৌতুকের  জন্য মৃত্যূ  ঘটানো, ইত্যাদির শাসিত্ম- (১) যদিকোন নারীর স্বামী, স্বামীর পিতা, মাতা, অভিভাবক, আতনীয় বা স্বামীর পক্ষে অন্যকোন ব্যক্তিযৌতুকের জন্য  উক্ত  নারীর মূত্য  ঘটান  তাহা হইলে উক্ত স্বামী, পিতা, মাতা, অভিভাবক , আতনীয় বা ব্যক্তি মৃত্যূদন্ডে দন্ডনীয় হইবেন।<br/> ২।  যদিকোন নারীর স্বামী, স্বামীর পিতা, মাতা, অভিভাবক, আতনীয় বা স্বামীর পক্ষে অন্যকোন ব্যক্তি যৌতুকের জন্য উক্ত  নারীর মৃত্যু ঘটানোর চেষ্টা করেন তাহা হইলে  উক্ত স্বামী, পিতা, মাতা, অভিভাবক আতনীয় বা ব্যক্তি যাবজ্জীবন কারাদন্ডে দন্ডনীয় হইবেন’’।<br/><em>‘‘ধারা ১৪। অপরাধপ্ররোচনার শাসিত্ম- যদি কোন ব্যক্তি এই আইনের অধীনকোন অপরাধ সংঘটনের প্ররোচনা যোগায় এবংসেই প্ররোচনার ফলে উক্ত  অপরাধ সংঘটিত  হয়, তাহা হইলে ঐ অপরাধ সংঘটনের জন্য   নির্ধারিত  দন্ডে  প্ররোচনাকরী ব্যক্তি  দন্ডনীয় হইবেন</em><em> "</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>35.</strong>    Here in this case charge was framed against the accused Abul Basher under section10(2) of Ain and against accused Marium Bibi ( Mother of Abul Basher), Shajahan Mia and Bachu Miah under section 4/10(1)/14  of the Ain. Only accused Abul Bashar and his mother Marium was convicted under section 10(2)/14 of the Ain. No where in the judgment as well as  in the framing of charge stated which role was played by which   the accused were convicted basing on the lump allegation.    <br/><br/>        Now let us see how far the prosecution has succeeded in proving the allegation against  accused appellants under section 10(2) of the Ain, It is stated in this section if any person commits murder for doweryk he will be convicted under this section. First of all we see whether the allegation of dowery has been proved or not.<br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong>    P.W.2, Omar Ahmed Khonder, father of the victim deposed that accused Abul basher did not demand any dowery from his daughter.<br/> <br/><strong>37.</strong>    P.W.2 Abdul Halim as informant deposed in his cross examination that the accused Abul Basher did not demand any dowery at the time of marriage or later.<br/> <br/><strong>38.</strong>    P.W.3 Mohammad Hossain deposed that he did not do any salish as regards the demand of dowery.<br/> <br/><strong>39.</strong>    Scanning the evidence of PWs it is evident that the allegation regarding demand of dowery has not been substantiated. Thus we find that the alleged occurrence does not come within the ambit of section 10(2) of the Ain.<br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong>    In this connection we may profitable refer the decision in the case of Osena Begum vs. The State  reported in 55 DLR  299. It is held in the said decision “The Ain was promulgated to punish certain heinous offences against the children and women through special Adalat established by it. If the murder were committed for dowry, only then such Adalat would have exclusive jurisdiction to try such offence. Only sentence for such an offence under section 10(1) or section 14 of the Ain is death. No alternative sentence is prescribed . The Ain was no doubt made harsh and intended to prevent amongst others certain heinous offences committed for dowry. The motive for such offence will decide the jurisdiction of such Adalat. The moment the Adalt finds no proof of existence of such, motive of dowry for any offence within mischief of the Ain, it must take its hands off the case. In such situation only course will remain open for the Adalat to follow would be to send the case record to the Sessions Judge for trial.<br/> <br/><strong>41.</strong>    Now let us see whether there will be any fruitful result if the case is sent to Sessions Judge for trial. Before sending the case to sessions Judge for trial we should see whether the main allegation against the accused appellants that the accused assaulted the victim first and then poured poison into her mouth has been proved or not.<br/> <br/><strong>42.</strong>    In this case 9 PWs have been examined.<br/><br/>        P.W.1, Omar Ahmed Khondaker, is the father of the victim. P.W.2, Abdul Halim, is the brother of the victim as well as the informant of this case. P.W.3 Mohammad Hossain, P.W.4 Alkas Miah and PW.5 Kala Miah are neighbouring witnesses. P.W.7 Dr. Aditha Kumar Dey is local doctor who attended the victim immediately after  occurrence. P.W.8 is SI Sheikh Lutfor Rahman who prepared inquest report. As regards the main allegation, PW.1, father of the victim, at first informed the matter to Datmara Investigation  Centre in writing that his daughter died taking poison.<br/> <br/><strong>43.</strong>    P.W.2,  brother of the victim, who is informant at first deposed that he heard that his sister died taking poison  and later on he shifted his position by the warning of the court and again  in his cross examination he stated that he did not  see the occurrence but his father informed him that the victim died taking poison.<br/> <br/><strong>44.</strong>    P.W.3, Mohammad Hossain, deposed that PW.1 father of the victim informed him on 29.07.1999 at 11/12 hours that his daughter died taking  poison  and that PW.1  also informed such information to the police of Datmara Investigation Center in writing.<br/> <br/><strong>45.</strong>    P.W.4,  Alkas Miah deposed that he does not know any thing about the occurrence.<br/>P.W.5 Kala Miah deposed that he heard that the victim died taking poison.<br/> <br/><strong>46.</strong>    P.W.7 Dr., Aditia Kumar Dey, the local  doctor, deposed that accused Abul Basher,  the husband of the victim, went to  him on 29.07.1999  at 10 a.m. to bring him as his wife is ill and accordingly he went there and examined the victim and realized that the victim took poison and tried to wash her stomach and later she became weak and died  in his presence.<br/> <br/><strong>47.</strong>    P.W.8 SI Sheikh Lutfor Rahman stated that on the written information of PW1,   father of the victim, he held surathal of the victim and found no mark of injuries in the body of the victim and he heard from the local people that the victim died taking poison.<br/> <br/><strong>48.</strong>    On appreciation of the evidence on record it appears that the main allegation against the accused appellants that they firstly assaulted the victim and then poured poison into his mouth have not been proved.    <br/> <br/><strong>49.    </strong>In the case PW.6 Dr. Prodip Kumar Chowdhury opined and deposed that the victim died due to torture and forceful induction of poison. In this respect, are of the view that  the doctor PW.6 being Dr. Prodip Kumar Chowdhury while preparing the post mortem report  failed to state the age of injuries, such failure  on the  part of the doctor rendered the post mortem report very unreliable inasmuch as due to such failure it became very difficult to ascertain when those injuries were sustained by the victim, the same being the time of alleged occurrence. It is held in the case of  Abdur Rashid vs. State reported in 27 DLR (AD)- 1” The doctor while holding the post mortem examination did not record the age of the injuries. In a case of murder, the age of injuries is an important fact to determine the approximate time of occurrence.”<br/> <br/><strong>50.</strong>    The medical evidence is only corroborative in nature. It has no higher evidentiary value. As opposed to the ocular evidence of the P.W. 7 being Dr. Adittya Kumar Dey to the effect: “আমি ভিকটিমের মুখে কিংবা মুখ গহবরে কোন আঘাতে চিহ্ন দেখি নাই “ and also the ocular evidence of P.W.9 being A.S.I Md Abdur Razzak who prepared the inquest report to the effect that “No sign of hurt was found on the dead body”, Which essentially corroborates the evidence of P.W.7, the post-mortem report should  not be considered as being very doubtful rendering itself to be unworthy of reliance for a safe conviction.<br/> <br/><strong>51.</strong>    It also held in the case of Abdul Quddus vs. State, reported in 43 DLR (AD) 234. “It will not be out of place to mention that the medical evidence is only corroborative in nature. In that view, the ocular evidence of the eye-witness which substantially corroborates the major injuries on the person of the deceased must be accepted.” <br/> <br/><strong>52.</strong>    It is settled principle that the positive evidence in a case is that of the eye witness who had seen and narrated the occurrence. The evidence of a medical man or an expert is merely an opinion which only lends corroboration to the direct evidence. These glaring inconsistencies between the existence of the injuries on the dead body of victim as found by the post mortem doctor and the evidence of the prosecution witnesses about the injuries caused by the appellants irresistibly lead us to a conclusion that the occurrence did not take place in the manner as alleged by the prosecution. It would be seen from the evidence of the doctor (P.W.6) being Dr. Prodip Kumar Chowdhury that only a carbon copy of the post-mortem report was filed, not the original one, which the P.W.6 admitted as follows: ‘‘স্বাক্ষী বলেযে প্রদর্শিত  ময়না তদমেত্মর রিপোর্টের কার্বন কপি হইলেও ইহা তার লিখার কার্বণ কপি" Such failure to exhibit the original copy of the post-mortem report, the possibility of such carbon copy being a fabricated copy cannot be ruled out.<br/> <br/><strong>53.</strong>    In view  the facts and circumstances of  this case, we are view that the learned Judge of the trial court below substituted “moral conviction for legal evidence” which is not allowed in law and, thus the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 06.11.2007 is illegal and liable to be set aside. In this regard the convicts-appellants heavily rely on the decision of the Hon’ble Appellate Division as the fact of the instant case are almost similar to the fact of the case  reported in the case of  The State vs. Khadem Mondal, reported in 10 BLD (AD) 228. In the fact of the present case, it will be improper to substitute moral conviction for legal evidence. It may also be considered for ends of justice that the convict-appellant No. 1 has been languishing in jail since 15.11.1999  for about 11 years and the convict-appellant No. 2 is an old lady who have languishing in jail without any fault of them.<br/> <br/><strong>54.</strong>    The allegation against the accused appellants is that they collusively assaulted the victim and thereafter poured poison into her mouth and thus they killed the victim.<br/> <br/><strong>55.</strong>    The defence case is that the victim died taking poison.<br/> <br/><strong>56.</strong>    The fundamental and basic presumption in the administration of criminal law and justice delivery system is that the accused should be presumed to be innocent till the charges are proved beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of clear, cogent, credible or unimpeachable evidence. In a criminal trial, the burden of proving guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt always rests on the prosecution and on its failure, it can not fall back upon the accused. In a criminal case, it is for the prosecution to bring the guilt home to the accused.<br/> <br/><strong>57.</strong>    Though in a wife killing case, the husband is to explain how his wife died. Here in this case, the husband the appellant No. 1 took an alibi to the effect that his wife died taking poison. though the accused  appellants have not adduced any witness but his alibi has been substantiated by the evidence of PWs.<br/> <br/><strong>58.</strong>    Considering all the above facts and circumst-ances and evidence of the case and in view of our finding above we find that the prosecution has totally failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. So we find that the learned Judge Nari-O-Shishu Nirjataon Daman Tribunal No.3, Chittagong is not justified in convicting and sentencing the accused appellants by the impugned judgment. We therefore, find that the impugned judgment calls for our interference.<br/> <br/><strong>59.</strong>    In the result, the appeal is allowed  and the judgment and order of conviction and sentence  dated 06.11.2007 passed by the learned Judge, Nari-o-Shishi Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat No.3,  Chittagong  in Nari-O-Shishu Case No.177 of 2003 is  set aside. The accused appellants are acquitted from the charge under section 10(2)/14 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan ( Bishesh Bidhan) Ain 1995. We direct that the accused appellant Abul Basher be set at liberty forthwith if not wanted in connection with any other case and accused appellant Marioun Bibi is discharged from her respective bail bond.<br/> <br/><strong>60.</strong>    Let a copy of this judgment and order be sent to the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No.3, Chittagong for compliance.<br/> <br/>Send down the L.C.R at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Sessions case No. 858 of 2010.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>     Prosecution case, in short is that one Rejena Begum, proprietor of Nepa Enterprise, filed CR Case No. 300 of 2008 against AKM Fayekuz-zaman, proprietor of M/S. Khandoker  Business  International stating, inter alia, that  the complai-nant is a contractor and her husband Md. Eakub Ali is a 1<sup>st</sup> Class Government officer who is acquainted with the accused who  is a reputed 1<sup>st</sup> class contractor; that the accused approached to the complainant that he got five work orders whose contract value stands at Taka 13,17,36,515.60; that he needs some money for the completion of those works; that the accused expected to earn taka about more  than two crores out of those works and he would pay complainant half of the profit if she gave him some money and that the complain-ant  as per the proposal of the accused gave loan of Taka 2,25,00000/= within 23.09.2006 to 21.02.2008.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>     It is further stated that the complainant, later on, pressed the accused to repay his loan and accordingly the accused issued a cheque of taka 1,50,00,000.00 being No. NCCB/C 5710308 from his current account No. 01016899 of NCC Bank Ltd. Rangpur; that later on when the complainant again pressed the accused  to repay his loan with profit, then the accused again issued a cheque of Taka 75,00,000/= ; that the complainant placed the cheque of taka 1,50,00,000/=  in the relevant  bank  for encashment but the cheque was dishonored; that the complainant approached to accused for immediate repayment of loan but he failed for which  the complainant issued legal notice on 03.06.2008 to the accused through his lawyer which was received by the office of the accused on 08.06.2008 but the accused did not take any step to repay the loan; that in reply to the legal notice the accused stated  that there was a written contract between them, which is not correct and that when  the complainant presumed that the accused  would not repay the loan, then she was compelled to file the case against the accused petitioner under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     Thereafter the accused petitioner voluntarily surrendered before the Chief Judicial Magistrate and got bail. Subsequently the case was transferred before the Sessions Judge, Rangpur for trial and the accused petitioner got bail by the learned Sessions Judge, Rangpur and on 09.02.2009 was fixed for framing of charge. On behalf of the accused petitioner, an application under section 265C was filed which was rejected by an order dated 09.02.2009. Later on, by the order of High Court Division the case transferred to Metropo-litan Sessions Judge, Dhaka and now the case is pending before the Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Dhaka and last date of hearing was on 21.04.2010.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     The defence case as it appears from the record is that the accused petitioner is a bonafide businessman and he got some work orders for erecting some  buildings at Rangpur and at that time, husband of the complainant i.e. Yeakub Ali was the PIO (Project Implementation Officer) of the Rangpur who proposed to the accused petitioner that his wife had  a business  firm and she is able  to discharge the work and there  will be no problem if the works are given to the complainant. On good faith, the  accused petitioner on the basis of a deed of contract  supplied the works to the complainant along with sufficient cash and 10(ten) blank cheques of NCC Bank  Rangpur being  Nos. 5710301 to 5710310 were given to the complainant. Out of the 10 (ten) cheques, the complainant used 7 (seven) cheques i.e. cheque Nos. 5710301 to 5710307 and drew Taka 57,04,000/= and for getting back his  blank cheques,  the accused petitioner  filed a petition case No. 6 dated 17.06.2008 to recover the blank cheques. Simultaneously the accused wrote a letter to the Bank to stop payment because the 10% of the work was not done by the complainant but amount of more bills was already withdrawn by her.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>     In view of the above facts and circumstances of the case, the points for determination is whether the case of the complainant under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments act is at all maintain-able and whether the framing of charge dated  09.02.2009 against the accused petitioner is at all tenable  in law.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     There is no denying of the fact that the complainant, Rejina Begum, proprietor of Nepa Enterprise and the accused Petitioner AKM Fayekuzzaman, proprietor of M/S. Khondaker Business International  business man and women and the husband  of the complainant, Md. Yakub Ali,  was PIO ( Project  Implementation Officer ) of Rangpur area and there was acquaintance between the husband  of the complainant and the accused petitioner.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     Mr. M A Mazid, the learned Advocate of the opposite party No. 2  submits that the accused took loan of taka 2,25,00,000/= on different dates starting from 23.09.2006 to 21.02.2008 giving her assurance to pay her 50% profit of schedule work and on the demand and pressure of the complainant the accused  issued a cheque of Taka 1,50,00,000/=  from his current account of NCC Bank Ltd. Rangpur; that the complainant requested the accused  to repay the loan but he failed to repay the loan; that complainant issued legal notice through his lawyer  and in stead of getting the notice, the accused failed to repay the loan  for  which  she filed a case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and that matter has been decided by the High Court Division. He further submits that the charge framed against  the accused  petitioner being  legal will be maintained and  thus the application under section 439 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure are liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     Mr. Zahirul Haque  Zahir, Deputy Attorney General along with Mrs. Salma Rahman, Assistant Attorney General for the State has adopted the submission of the learned Advocate for the  complainant opposite party No. 2.<br/> <br/>10.    Mr. Habibur Rahman  with Mr. Delwar Hossain the learned Advocate for the  petitioner  submits that the charge against the accused petitioner  is not at all maintainable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act as there  is a Civil  contract between the complainant  opposite party and the accused petitioner in the following terms:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"১ম পক্ষের মালিকানাধীন প্রতিষ্ঠানের নামে শিক্ষা-প্রকৌশল অধিদপ্তর হইতে প্রাপ্ত ২টি কাজ সুষ্ঠু বাস্তবায়নের জন্য লিখিত শর্তে আমরা উভয় পক্ষ এই চুক্তিপত্রে আবদ্ধ হইলাম।</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;"><strong><u>শর্তাবলী</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">১। ১ম পক্ষের ব্যবসায়ীক ব্যস্ততা ও শারীরিক অসুবিধার কারণে শিক্ষা প্রকৌশল অধিদপ্তর, ঢাকার কর্তৃক ইস্যুকৃত কার্যাদেশ মেমোঃ নং ৪৯৪৯ তারিখ ০৭/০৮/০৬ইং ও ৪৯৩৮ তারিখ ০৭/০৮/০৬ইং। কাজের পরিমান টাকা ২,০৪,০৮,১৮৫-৩০ ও ৬৪৯৭৪৩২/৫৯। উক্ত কাজ ২টি সম্পন্ন করার জন্য আমার প্রতিষ্ঠানের পক্ষে মেসার্স নিপা এন্টারপ্রাইজ এর স্বত্বাধিকারী ২য় পক্ষ বরাবরে বর্ণিত কাজের চুক্তি মতে নিজ অর্থায়নে সম্পন্ন করার দায়িত্ব কর্তৃত্ব প্রদান করিয়া একটি পাওয়ার অব এটর্নি প্রদান করিয়াছি। যাহার তারিখ -- নোটারী নং--।<br/>২। ২য় পক্ষ এই চুক্তি পত্র অনুযায়ী বর্ণিত কাজ ২টি সম্পন্ন করিতে যাবতীয় বিনিয়োগ করিবেন এবং কর্তৃপক্ষের সিদ্ধান্ত অনুযায়ী কাজটি যথারীতি নিজ দায়িত্বে সম্পন্ন করিবেন। এই ব্যাপারে ১ম পক্ষের কোন দায় দায়িত্ব রহিল না। সংশিস্নষ্ট কাজরে যাবতীয় বিল এনসিসি ব্যংক লিঃ, রংপুর শাখায় ১ম পক্ষের নামে চলতি হিসাব নম্বর ০১০১৬৮৯৯ এর চেক নম্বর ৫৭১০৩০১-১০ মোট ১০টি পাতা ১ম পক্ষ স্বাক্ষর করিয়া ২য় পক্ষকে প্রদান করিলাম। যাহা দ্বরা তিনি শুধু মাত্র উপরোক্ত কার্যাদেশ বাবদ বিলের সমুদয় অর্থ ব্যাংক হইতে উত্তোলন করিয়া লইতে পারিবেন। ইহাতে ১ম পক্ষের কোন ওজর আপত্তি আইনগত ভাবে অগ্রাহ্য হইবে। ২য় পক্ষ এই চেকান্য কোন কাজে ব্যবহৃত করিতে পারিবে না।<br/>৩। উপরোক্ত ঠিকাদারী কাজ ২টি ব্যায় ও লভ্যাংশ বাবদ মোট ১৪,০০,০০০  চৌদ্দ লক্ষ) টাকা ২য় পক্ষ ১ম পক্ষকে প্রদান করিবেন। তার মধ্যে অদ্য ২৬/০৯/২০০৬&amp;ং তারিখে ২,৫০,০০০ (দুই লক্ষ পঞ্চাশ হাজার) টাকা নগদে পরিশোধ সহ বাকী টাকা আগামী অল্প সময়ের মধ্যে ২য় পক্ষ ১ম পক্ষকে পরিশোধ করিবেন।"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    He  further  submits that  on good faith the accused petitioner on the basis of contract  supplied the works to the complainant along with sufficient cash and 10 (ten) blank cheques of NCC Bank Ltd. Rangpur being 5710301 to 5710310; that out of the  10 (ten) cheques  the complainant used 7 (seven) cheques i.e. cheque Nos.5710301 to 5710307 and withdrew taka 57,04,000/= from the relevant account of the accused petitioner and  the accused  petitioner filed a petition case No. 6 dated 17.06.2008 to recover the blank cheques and simultaneously the accused wrote  a letter to the Bank concerned to stop payment in the case filed under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act because the 10%  of the work was not done by the complainant but more amount of bill was drawn.<br/> <br/><strong>12.    </strong>He further submits that the accused petitioner has filed the complainant petition being No. 3346 of 2008 under section 406/420/109 of the Penal Code by annexure–‘F’. The learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate forwarded the petition to O.C., Ramna PS for enquiry and report. Officer-in-charge, Ramna endorsed the matter to  SI Mr. Aksed, who enquired into the matter submitted enquiry report marked annexure-‘D’ stating  "ঘটনার ব্যাপারে জিজ্ঞাসাবাদ করি এবং বিষয়টি গোপনে ও প্রকাশ্যে জিজ্ঞাসাবাদ করি। আমার সঠিক তদন্ত মতে, প্রদত্ত স্বাক্ষ প্রমান, বিভিন্ন ডকুমেন্ট ইত্যাদিতে বাদীর আনীত দঃ বিঃ ৪০৬/৪২০/১০৯ ধারার অভিযোগ প্রথমিকভাবে প্রমানিত হইয়াছে।"<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    On  the finding  of the report  submitted by SI Akshed, Metropolitan Magistrate, Ms. Sayeda  Minhajum Munir without taking cognizance of the case against accused Yukub Ali and Rejina Begum  discharged them  relating to Ramna PS Case No. 45(7)08 and GR case No.382 of 2008  under section 420/406/109 of the Penal Code against which accused  petitioner  AKM Fayekuzzaman filed Naraji Petition being  Metropolitan  Criminal Revision case No.92  of 2009 which was  transferred to the learned Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Dhaka  for hearing who after detained discussion held that learned Metropo-litan Magistrate committed illegality in not taking cognizance of the case on the basis of  police   report dated 05.07.1008 filed by SI Aksed and illegally  discharged the accused Yeakub Ali and Rejina Begum from charge and consequently he allowed the Revisional application which stoutly  upheld that contention of the present accused petitioner  A.K.M. Fayekuzzaman to the effect that the accused petitioner did not take loan from the complainant opposite party Rejina Begum rather the accused petitioner gave 10 (ten) blank cheques being No.5710301 to 5710310 out of which the complainant  opposite party Rejina Begum used cheque Nos. 5710301 to 5710307 and withdrew Tk. 57,04,000/=  completing only 10% of the work violating the terms of contract dated 13.09.2006 between the parties . This fact clearly shows that the complainant opposite party Rejina Begum violating the terms of the contract illegally and fraudulently had written the huge amount of Taka 1,50,00,000 on the blank cheque and  filed the case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instrum-ents act for illegal gain. This fraudulent conduct of the complainant opposite party Rejina Begum cannot be encouraged allowing to proceed her case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The Negotiable Instruments Act  was enacted for  the holy  purpose relating to promissory notes, bill of exchange and cheques. But this law has not been enacted for materializing such fraudulent cheques. The above  facts clearly  proves that the complainant opposite party Rejina Begum has illegally taken the shelter of this law like Negotiable Instruments Act to materialize  her illegal gain. Record shows that the complainant  opposite party Rejina Begum  violating the terms of contract illegally withdrew Tk. 57,04,000/= using seven cheque Nos.5710301 to 5710307 and moreover she fraudulently and illegally attempted to snatch  away Taka 1,50,00,000/= from the accused petitioner A.K.M. Fayekuzzaman using blank cheque  No.5710308 misusing  the holy purpose of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Negotiable Instruments Act is a very hash law wherein it is to be seen  if whether cheque is dish-onoured  within stipulated  time whether legal notice  has been served  in time, and whether  case was filed  within specific time, then  there is every possibility of being convicted with heavy fine. In the instant case, when  the basic document like  cheque is fraudulent there is no scope to see other factors. Because fraud vitiates everything Negotiable Instruments Act cannot be  allowed to use  for fraudulent purpose and for  the illegal gain of the complainant opposite party  Rejina Begum. To get relief under this law, the complainant opposite party Rejina Begum has to come to the court with clean hand. The contract between the accused petitioner A.K.M. Fayekuzzaman and complainant opposite party Rejina Begum is civil in nature. She may get relief on the basis of the contract.  The contract between  parties is a secret document. No one can go beyond the contract. In the instant case, the whole thing is to be settled on the basis of contract which the parties solemnly signed. The complainant opposite  party Rejina Begum by passing the contract which she signed can not take  the shelter of fraud and her fraudulent cheque which she manufactured  illegally using the blank cheque which accused petitioner gave her in good faith to draw the  amount of bill  after completion of work but the complainant opposite party Rejina adopted illegal means under grab of Negotiable Instruments Act to get the huge amount from the accused petitioner AKM Fayekuzzaman in a easy way fraudulent converting the blank cheque.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    Mr. Habibur Rahman, the learned Advocate for the  accused petitioner A.K.M. Fayekuzzaman in reply to the question of Settlement of the matter of section 138 of the Negotiable  Instruments Act by the High court Division presided by  Mr. Afzal Hossain Ahmed,  submits that  commitment of fraud on the blank cheque by the complainant  Rejina Begum has surely escaped the notice of the learned Judge, otherwise the matter was not decided in such a mechanical way. He further stoutly submits that fraud always vitiates everything and that the present forum is different wherein this court can decide everything on the basis of the facts of the case. We find substance in the submission  of the learned Advocate for the petitioner. <br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    The accused  petitioner AKM Fayekuzzaman  filed  application  before the learned Sessions Judge, Rangpur under section 265C of the Code of Criminal Procedure  for discharging him from the  charge as the complainant opposite party fraudule-ntly converted the blank cheque into the alleged cheque.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    Now let us see whether the accused petitioner  may get  any relief under section 265C of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section  265C runs thus “265C – <strong>Discharge</strong>. If upon consider-ation of the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith and after hearing the submission of the accused and the prosecution in this behalf, the court considers that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused, it shall discharge  the accused and record the reasons for so doing.”<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    The section  has made a beneficent provision  to save  the accused from planned harassment which is a necessary concomitant of a protracted criminal trial. The object of section 265C of the Code of Criminal Procedure is to inquire into the materials on record for prima facie satisfaction of the court as to whether the accused should be  discharged or proceeded against   so that innocent persons may not be  harassed on false and frivolous allegations. If on the other hand, if the court finds that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence it shall frame necessary charges against him under  section 265D of the Code. Even if now cases are sent to the court of Sessions upon a charge sheet or otherwise under section 265C of the Code of Criminal Procedure it is the duty of the court of Sessions to discharge those accused against whom it appears  to the court from the record that there is no ground for proceeding after recording  its reasons upon a consideration of the materials on record and after hearing both the parties  so that frivolous cases and cases of no evidence do not occupy the time of the Sessions Court and innocent persons are not harassed unnecessarily by being put to the trouble and expense of undergoing a sessions trial. We find support of the above view in the case  reported in 11 DLR (SC)394.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    Trial court may discharge accused without framing charge if material on record is not sufficient. If before framing the charge, the Sessions court considers that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused, then it shall discharge the accused and record the reason for so doing under section 265C Cr.P.C.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    The legislature has enacted section 265C apparently to protect the accused from facing the agony of futile and useless trial when the statements of the complainant and evidence available on record do not make  out  any prima facie case against the accused. Just as the accused  is to be presumed innocent till he is proved to be guilty similarly the prosecution or the person wronged  can not be throttled by the court arbitrarily and capriciously and must be given due opportunity to prove his case against the alleged wrong doer if on initial scrutiny is found  that his allegation does disclose  the commission of a criminal offence against an accused.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    Under section 265C Cr.P.C.  it is duty  of the court of sessions upon consideration  of the materials on record and after hearing the parties, to discharge those accused persons against whom it appears to the court that there is  no ground for proceeding so that frivolous cases and cases of no evidence do not occupy the time of the court and innocent persons are subjected to the rigorous and expenses of a full scale trial.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    The Role of  High Court Division is to see whether thing are done rightly. High Court Division by its  inherent jurisdiction can impart justice and can also eliminate injustice. This Division is empowered to see whether the charge against the accused petitioner has framed rightly or not  under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure .<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    The revisional powers of the High court vested in it by section 439  read with section 435  do not create any right in the litigant,  but only conserve the power  of the High court  to see that justice is done in accordance with the recognized  rules of criminal jurisdiction and that subordinate  courts do not exceed their jurisdiction or abuse their powers vested in them by the code. In hearing and determining cases under section 439, the High Court  discharges its statutory function of supervising the administration of justice on the Criminal side.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>    The High Court Division may <em>suo motu</em> call for the record of the courts subordinate to it and set aside any order passed by such courts  in  any legal proceeding which has caused miscarriage of justice (Reazuddin Ahmed Md vs. State and another 1997 49 DLR (AD)64 1997 BLD AD 123.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>    The object  of this section to confer a kind of paternal or supervisory jurisdiction to correct flagrant miscarriage of justice in matters coming up for adjudication before a criminal court. The main question which the High court has to consider in revision is whether substantial justice has been done. This power is to be  exercised in aid of justice and to prevent injustice.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>    The discretion of High Court to interfere with the proceedings pending in a subordinate court is unfettered though this section cannot be interpreted to mean interference with each and every order passed by a subordinate court. The power of revision has to be exercised sparingly and only when grave injustice is likely to be done or where there has been clear miscarriage of justice or the order is illegal  or perverse or the impugned order is such that no reasonable court would pass it or when it appears that great injustice has been done by  the impugned order.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>    Power possessed by court under section 435/439 Cr.P.C. do not impinge, curtail or limit in any manner whatsoever. The powers under section 435/439 Cr.P.C. are independent and jurisdiction can be exercised under section 439, Cr.P.C to secure the ends of justice.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>    In view of the provision  of law on mentioned above and on perusal of the record it clearly appears to us that the learned Sessions Judge Rangpur illegally framed charge on 09.02.2009 without going to the root of the matter and the learned  Sessions Judge, Rangpur had done glaring irregularities materially affecting the proceeding and also committed paten impropri-eties vitiating the impugned order dated 09.02.2009. Since there is glaring defect and error in law  and since there is a flagrant miscarriage of justice in the impugned order, thus High Court Division has jurisdiction to cure the injustice.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>    The impugned order  dated 09.02.2009 for framing charge  is bad in law and fact and full of non consideration of vital point of law and also the trial court failed to consider that the complainant opposite party was employer of the  accused petitioner who came in a contract for discharging the work order of the accused petitioner.  The accused petitioner has become a victim of circumstances as the complainant filed this false, fabricated and concocted case to harass and humiliated the accused petitioner for momentary gain.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>    More over on perusal  of the record it clearly appears to us  that the present facts and circumstances  of the case does not attract section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act as the complainant  opposite party has  taken the shelter of fraud for materialsing her monetary gain and as such the case of complainant opposite party under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act does not attract at all.<br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong>    The accused petitioner AKM Fayekuzzaman filed application before the learned Sessions Judge, Rangpur  for discharging him under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments act as he framed the charge without considering the material facts  Section 265C of the Code of Criminal Procedure empower the court to discharge the accused if there is sufficient ground for not proceeding against the accused. The learned Sessions Judge ought to have discharged his power judiciously after applying his mind to the material facts and examining the evidence on record carefully. It is not open to a court to base its finding on the assumption. The learned Sessions Judge, Rangpur had based its decision on assumption without going through the facts of the case. On perusal of the record it is abundantly clear that the complai-nant opposite party manufactured the cheque in question under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments act interpolating the amount in the blank cheque which was given to the complainant opposite party by accused petitioner for official use. It is alleged by the complainant opposite party that  Tk. 2,50,00,000/= was given loan to accused petitioner, who is a stranger, without any written document and  the loan-money was alleged to have been sent  through  S.A. paribahan  in different dates but the complainant opposite party   could not submit any document of sending such amount and more over on the prayer of the accused petitioner  the SA Paribahan authority had denied the assertion of the complainant  opposite party Rejina Begum. On the other hand, from the document, enquiry report and other evidence on record, it clearly appears to us that the accused petitioner gave those 10 (ten) blank cheques on the basis of contract between the parties to facilitate to draw the bill amount after completion of work. It further reveals that  the complainant opposite party withdrew more money from  the account of the accused petitioner  through seven cheques  without completing the work as per contract and out of the rest three cheques, one blank cheque was given to a shop keeper from whom the complainant opposite party took construction materials but that  shop keeper on oath denies the assertion of the complainant opposite party and on the other hand admitted the case of the accused petitioner. It further  reveals from the facts and evidence on record of the accused  petitioner  that the complainant opposite party fraudulently converted  the rest  two cheques interpolating the amount filed two cases against the accused petitioner under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments  Act.<br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong>    The above facts were on the record before the learned Sessions Judge, Rangpur while he rejected the application of the accused petitioner under section 265C of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  Such non-consideration of the facts on the part of the learned Sessions Judge, Rangpur clearly shows  his non-application of judicial mind to the materials on record.<br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong>    As per decision cited in  the case  of Md. sami Ullah Khan vs. The State (1963) 15 DLR(SC)150, in the case of Firoj Khan vs. Captain Golam Nabi (1966) 18 DLR (SC)289 and in the case of Abdur Rashid Khondaker vs. Chandu Master (1964) 16 DLR (SC)505,High court’s power  under section 439 of the Code of criminal Procedure is very wide. It can revise the order passed by the inferior criminal court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction in a proper case. High court, in proper cases, can interfere with question of fact  wrongly decided by the trial court. Under  section 439, Cr. P.C.  High court exercises of its revisional Jurisdiction, in approp-riate case and can go into the fact and disturb the finding of fact as for example where the subordi-nate courts have  wrongly applied the law and procedure or not applied the correct principles relating to the appraisement of evidence or ignored the important pieces of evidence altogether High Court Division can interfere. Normally though a revisional court should not take upon itself the task of weighing the evidence a fresh, but its power can not be defined to question of law along and  in a fit case, the High court Division can also deal with question of facts where the finding of the court below are unreasonable, perverse and absolutely wrong against the weight of evidence. Considering the facts and circumstances and evidence on record, we are of the firm view that the impugned order dated 09.02.2009 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Rangpur is unreasonable, perverse and absolutely wrong in view of the prevailing facts and circumstances of the case.<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong>    We may profitably refer the decision in the case of State vs. Khondaker Md. Moniruzzaman reported in BLT (AD) 9 wherein it is decided that where there is no sufficient ground to proceed against the accused, the High court under section 265C of the Code of Criminal Procedure can discharge accused from charge. The facts of the present case clearly indicate the innocence of the accused petitioner and his false implication in this case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The learned Sessions Judge, Rangpur ought to have allowed the application of the accused petitioner under section 265C of the Cr.P.C. discharging accused petitioner A.K.M. Fayekuz-zaman from the charge under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act for ends of justice in view of the defence plea. The facts and circumst-ances require interference for correction of a manifest illegality or the prevention of a gross miscarriage of justice. The exercise of power under section 439/435 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is discretionary with the High Court. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case, we are of the view that this is a fit case for exercising its discretion as the complai-nant  opposite party Rejina Begum  has committed double fraud as she withdrew the excess money of the accused petitioner using seven cheques and secondly she converted the present two cheques inserting huge amount by different hand which is a manifest and patent injustice apparent on the face of the record which calls for prompt redress. High Court Division  will surely interfere where a person like accused petitioner is being harassed by an illegal and fraudulent proceeding.<br/> <br/><strong>34.</strong>    There is sufficient materials before the High court Division for believing that the accused petitioner committed no offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and as such we are of opinion that there will be substantial injustice if this court does not interfere in this case and there will be fragrant violation of justice. The High court Division under section 439 of the Code having supervisory jurisdiction can scrutinize and can go into the fact of a case to examine the propriety of the order passed under section 265C of the Code of  Criminal Procedure.  Hence the application by the accused petitioner under section 265C of the Cr.P.C.  is maintainable against the order of framing charge against the accused.<br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong>    In the present case we have already found that the learned Sessions Judge, Rangpur acted without jurisdiction in passing the impugned  order dated 09.02.2009 which is clearly illegal and we are of the view that in order to prevent the same for the ends of justice, the power vested in the High court Division under section   439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  should be exercised in the present case. We, therefore, find that the impugned order dated 09.02.2009 being illegal and without jurisdiction which is liable to be set aside.<br/>       <br/>        In the result, the Rule is, therefore, made absolute and the impugned order dated 09.02.2009  passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Rangpur  in  Sessions Case No. 383 of 2008 arising out of CR case No. 300 of 2008 is set aside. Accused AKM Fayekuzzaman be discharged from the charge levelled against him under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 as the present facts and circumstances of the case do not attract section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Complainant opposite party Rejina Begum may take shelter under appropr-iate law to redress her grievance, if any, if she wishes under actual facts.<br/> <br/>        Let a copy of this judgment be sent to the trial court at once for necessary action.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that respondent No. 10, despite being informed by the petitioner’s wife that she was unwell, acted in an irresponsible, rude and arrogant manner, causing serious mental agony and distress to her and embarrassment to the petitioner in public. Such action of respondent No. 10, Mr. Khan submits, is in clear violation of the provisions of The Police Act, 1861, Police Regulations Bengal, 1943 and The Dhaka Metropolitan Police Ordinance, 1976.            </strong><br/> <br/><strong>The police, as the law enforcing agency of the State, are to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed and followed by the general public. It is, therefore, not only a matter of utmost regret, but also of grave concern, when such acts of violation are committed by the police themselves. It is also a sad reality that although police excess occur regularly, such incidents are rarely challenged in a Court of law.         </strong><br/> <br/><strong>The facts stated in the writ petition, being uncontroverted, are, therefore, deemed to be correct in the eye of the law. Quite clearly, the conduct of respondent No. 10 not only falls within the ambit of the term ‘misconduct’, it is also violative of the other provisions quoted above. As such, the allegation of misconduct against respondent No. 10 has been established. The issuance of the impugned Charge Report dated 30.05.2001 is found to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect. Respondent No. 5 (Inspector General of Police, Bangladesh) and respondent No. 6 (Commissioner, Dhaka Metropolitan Police) are directed to initiate appropriate disciplinary action against respondent No. 10 in accordance with law. ...(3,9,46,52 &amp; 53)</strong><br/> <br/>Ghani .v.

Joynal. On reaching the Airport, the petitioner went inside while his wife, being unwell, waited in the car. When the petitioner saw his son coming out of the Airport, he signalled the driver to come to the pick up point. At that moment, on being informed that the police personnel were creating some sort of commotion in front of his car, the petitioner went there and found one police officer shouting  at the top of his voice, showing little care or respect for the  lady who was sitting inside the car.  Although the petitioner’s wife explained to the police officer (respondent No. 10) that as she was very ill, she was unable to get down from the car and she was waiting to pick-up her son who was on his way out, he paid no heed to her and created an unpleasant scene in public. The petitioner disclosed his identity and requested respondent no. 10 to show his identity, as he did not have any name tag on his uniform, as is usually done by all on-duty police personnel. Respondent no. 10 took a out name tag from inside his pocket bearing the name Ferdous. On being asked by the petitioner as to why he was behaving in such a rude manner, respondent No. 10, without caring to reply, asked for the documents of the car. The documents, including original fitness certificate, insurance certificate and a copy of the registration certificate were produced and he was told that the vehicle was a Government transport. Respondent no. 10 took the insurance certificate and the fitness certificate and left the place. Shortly thereafter, when the petitioner was about to leave the Airport along with his wife and son, another policeman came up to the car and handed over a piece of paper to him which turned out to be Charge Report under Section 105 of the Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1983 issued by said respondent No. 10 alleging contravention of sections 140, 152, 156 with a special note that he  has framed charge under the instruction of the OC, Cantonment Police Station and the Chief Security Officer of the Airport and also recommending realisation of full fine.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     The petitioner sent a Demand of Justice notice to the respondents through his lawyer on 13.06.01, but  the same remained  unresponded.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     It is in this back-drop that the petitioner moved this Court and obtained the Rule in the aforesaid terms.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>     Although it appears from the office note dated 15.07.02 of the case record that service of notice has been duly communicated, yet none of the respond-ents appeared to contest the Rule. On our query, the learned A.A.G. submits that she has no instructions in this matter.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     Mr. M. A. Aziz Khan learned Advocate, appearing for the petitioner, has taken us through the writ petition and its annexures as well as the relevant provisions of law.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     Mr. Khan submitted that the actions of the respondents, who are all public servants, are contrary to the provisions of Article 21(2) of the Constitution  of Bangladesh which  stipulates that every person in the service of Republic has a duty to strive at all times to serve the people.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     He submits that respondent no. 10, despite being informed by the petitioner’s wife that she was unwell, acted in an irresponsible, rude and arrogant manner, causing serious mental agony and distress to her and embarrassment to the petitioner in public. Such action of respondent no. 10, Mr. Khan submits, is in clear violation of the provisions of The Police Act, 1861, Police Regulations Bengal, 1943 and The Dhaka Metropolitan Police Ordinance, 1976.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    Mr. Khan refers to Regulation 260 of the Police Regulations Bengal, 1943 (hereinafter referred to as the Regulation) which is as follows :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“260: Investigation officers should carefully abstain from causing unnece-ssary harassment either to the parties or to the people generally. Only those persons who are likely to assist the inquiry materially should be summoned to attend. Where possible the investigating officer should himself go to the house of the witness to be examined. The proceedings should be as informal as possible. The questioning of witnesses should ordinarily be conducted apart, and in a manner that will not be distasteful to them”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    He also refers to Section 23 of The Police Act, 1861 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) which is as follows :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“23:  It shall be the duty of every police-officer promptly to obey and execute all orders and warrants lawfully issued to him by any competent authority; to collect and communicate intelligence affecting the public peace; to prevent the commission of offences and public nuisances; to detect and bring offenders to justice and to apprehend all persons whom he is legally authorized to apprehend, and for whose apprehension sufficient ground exists: and it shall be lawful for every police-officer, for any of the purposes mentioned in this section, without a warrant, to enter and inspect any drinking-shop, gaming-house or other place of resort of loose and disorderly characters”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    Mr. Khan then refers to Section 16(e) of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police Ordinance, 1976  (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Ordinance’) which runs as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“16(e) in dealing with women and children, to act with strict regard to decency and with reasonable gentleness”. (emphasis supplied)” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    Relying on the aforesaid provisions of law, Mr. Khan submits that although there is a clear stipulation to the effect that the  police personnel are not to cause unnecessary harassment to the public in general and to women and children in particular, there has been a gross violation of the same in the  instant case. He makes a pointed reference to clause 16(e) of the Ordinance quoted above, which requires the police to act with strict regard to decency and gentleness while dealing with women and children. He further submits that although the police is required by law to prevent the commission of public nuisance, in the instant case, it was respondent no. 10 who was solely responsible for creating public nuisance by his rude and arrogant behaviour.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    Mr. Khan next draws our attention to Annexure ‘Q’ to   the   writ petition and  submits that although the name of the accused person in the Charge Report has been mentioned as Driver Md. Zafar, the petitioner’s driver’s name was Md. Joynal Khan, which is evident from his driving licence, as evidenced by Annexure ‘G’ to the writ petition. It is further submitted that although there is a note that the Charge Report has been issued under the instruction of OC, Cantonment Thana and the Chief Security Officer of the Airport, there was no official endorsement. He submits that respondent no. 10 himself made the endorsement illegally to save his own self.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    Mr. Khan then submits that the action of respondent no. 10 in impounding valid documents of the car (i.e. the Fitness Certificate and the Insurance Certificate) was in gross violation of Section 161 of the Ordinance, which authorizes such an action only when there is reason to believe that such documents are false documents within the meaning of Section 464 of the Penal Code. In the instant case, respondent no. 10 had absolutely no basis to form such opinion since the vehicle in question was a Government vehicle. As such, the aforesaid actions of respondent no. 10 was not only in excess of his jurisdiction, but malafide too.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    Mr. Khan informs the Court that the petitioner, being a law abiding citizen, has duly paid the fine imposed by the impugned Charge Report dated 30.05.2001.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    Last, but not least, Mr. Khan urges that this Court to take note of  the situation that prevails in our society today. He argued, very strongly, that there are many incidents like this occurring everyday relating to police excess and non-compliance of Police Rules and Regulations by the police themselves, but such occurrences remain unreported mostly out of fear of further harassment by the police. More importantly, ordinary citizens neither have the resources nor the ability to stand-up against police excess and bring such incidents to the Court’s notice for redress. Hence, the instant case should not be dealt with leniently, but be an example against police excess considering the issues in a wider perspective relating to the non-compliance of the provisions of the Act, Regulations and the Ordinance by the police.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    Although the matter before us raises issues of considerable public importance, Mr. Khan has not referred to any decision in support of his case. Nevertheless, we made an endeavour to refer to some decisions from our own jurisdiction, but there was hardly any reported decision on the subject. We noted, much to our surprise and dismay, that a similar scenario prevails in the English jurisdiction. To quote Prof. H.W.R. Wade:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“It is impossible to examine the cases on the status of the police without marvelling at how few they are, and in how many respects their position and powers are still not clearly defined. The police have had remarkable success in avoiding challenge in the courts of law, even though they often stretch their powers and risk actions for trespass.” (Administrative Law, Fifth Edition, page 135)”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    In Ghani .v. Jones, reported in [1970] 1QB, 693 where the action of the police in impounding the passports and conducting unauthorized searches was challenged by the petitioner, a similar view was expressed by no less an authority than Lord Denning MR himself, when he observed :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The case raises matter of importance on which there is very little direct authority in our books.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    It is in this backdrop that we are called upon to decide this matter. We intend to do so, first by considering the relevant Rules and Regulations and the extent of their application and thereafter certain aspects relating to the concept of rule of law.<br/> <br/><strong>21.    </strong>At the outset, it would be appropriate to begin by examining the maintainability of an application of this nature.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    The pre-requisite of having a specific legal right before issuance of a writ of mandamous was laid down towards the end of the nineteenth century in R .v. Guardians of Lewisham Union, reported in (1897) 1 QB 498. However, since then, there has been a very significant shift, and, so much so, that by the end of the twentieth century, the Courts were inclined to issue mandamous even in cases where the applicant had no specific legal right.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>    In I.R.C. .v. Fed of Self-employed, [1981] 2 All E.R. 93, Lord Scarman observed: “The decision of the Divisional Court in R .v. Guardian of Lewisham Union was accepted as establishing that an applicant must establish ‘a legal specific right to ask for the interference of the Court by order of mandamous. I agree with Lord Denning MR in thinking this was a deplorable decision”.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>    In our own jurisdiction, the position has been summarized as under :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In England, the Lewisham Union Principle was given up as it would have the effect of allowing the public functionaries a free hand in ignoring their public duties. In countries like ours, it will have a far more serious effect as many instances of non-performance of legal duty by government and public functionaries will remain without remedy, thereby eroding the concept of rule of law and constitutionalism. This principle originated in England and when it has been discarded there, there is no rationale for insisting on the application of this principle in our country. Thus, if a person is going to be affected by the failure of a public functionary to do what he is required by law to do, he can claim performance of the legal duty of the public functionary whether or not he has a specific legal right to claim performance of the duty” (M. Islam, Constitutional Law of Bangladesh, Second Edition, page 529).”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>25.</strong>    A definite jurisprudential basis was laid down in S.P. Gupta v. President of India, reported in AIR 1982 SC  149 where Bhagwati, J, in according standing to the petitioners, observed :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Where a legal wrong or a legal injury is caused to a person or to a determinate class of persons by reason of violation of any constitutional or legal right or any burden is imposed in contravention of any constitutional or legal provision or without authority of law or any such legal wrong or legal injury or illegal burden is threatened and such person or determine class of persons is by reason of poverty, helpless-ness or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position, unable to approach the court for relief, any member of the public can maintain an application seeking judicial redress for the legal wrong or injury caused to such person or determi-nate class of persons.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>26.</strong>    As noted above, the various provisions in the Police Rules and Regulations are quiet clear in specifying guidelines for the police in their dealings with the public in general and women and children in particular. In this context, we may refer to Regulation 33 of the Regulations which deals with behaveiour of the police towards the public. It states :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“33 (a) No police force can work successfully unless it wins the respect and good-will of the public and secures its co-operation. All ranks, therefore, while being firm in the execution of their duty, must show forbearance, civility and courtesy towards all classes. Officers of superior rank must not only observe this instruction themselves but on all occasions impress their subordinates with the necessity of causing as little friction as possible in the performance of their duties. (b) Rudeness, harshness and brutality are forbidden; and every officer of superior rank must take immediate steps for the punishment of any offenders who come to his notice.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>27.</strong>    Similarly, Section 15(c) of the Ordinance provides :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“General duties of police officers. – It shall be the duty of every police officer –</em></div><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 40px;"><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>…………..</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>…………..</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>to the best of his ability to prevent commission of public nuisances ;</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>……………..</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>………………</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>………………..”.</em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>28.</strong>    Under the 1861 Act, a duty was cast upon the police by Section 23 to “prevent commission of offences and public nuisance.” Almost a century later, in 1943, the Regulations imposed further control on the police by requiring them to “abstain from causing unnecessary harassment either to parties or to the people generally.” Regulation 33(a) required all ranks to “show forbearance, civility and courtesy towards all classes”. As an additional measure, rudeness, harshness and brutality were forbidden by Regulation 33(b). More recently, in 1976, under the Ordinance, the police was required “to act with strict regard to decency and reasonable gentleness” in dealing with women and children.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>    On a careful analysis, it appears that the conduct of the police vis-a-vis the general public is regulated by certain positive enactments and negative stipulations. The words ‘decency’, ‘gentleness’, ‘courtesy’, forbearance’, ‘civility’, ‘rudeness’, ‘brutality’ etc. have been incorporated in various sections of the Act, Ordinance and Regulations with a definite purpose or intent. The Legislatures, being mindful of the unfettered power the police are considered to exercise, were quite clear in their intent to prevent any abuse or misuse of such powers. To quote Tindal, CJ in Warburton .v. Loveland (1832) 2 D and Cl. 480</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“……………. the words of the statute speak the intention of the Legislature.”</em><br/><br/>        In the words of the distinguished Jurist Sir John Salmond:<br/><em>“The Courts must in general take it absolutely for granted that the legislature has said what it meant, and meant what it has said. Ita scriptum est is the first principle of interpretation”. (Salmond, Jurisprudence, Twelfth Edition, page 132)</em><br/><br/>        Furthermore, as an additional measure, rudeness, harshness and brutality was not only forbidden, but every officer of superior rank was required to take immediate steps for punishment of any offender when it comes to his notice.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>30.</strong>    The imposition of such prohibition is, no doubt, significant. This is in consonance with the concept of ‘Rule of law’ as embodied in our Constitution where the preamble states that it shall be the fundamental aim of the State to secure the rule of law for all citizens.<br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong>    Walber, in his Oxford Companion to Law (1980 Edition, page 1093) explained the term rule of law as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The concept implies that the ruler must also be subject to law. It is the subordination of all authorities, legislative, executive and others to certain principles, which would generally be accepted as characteristic of law, such as the ideas of fundamental principles of justice, moral principles, fairness and due process. It implies respect for the supreme value and dignity of the individual”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>32.</strong>    As observed by Hilaire Barnett in Constitutional and Administrative Law (Third Edition, page 85):</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The rule of law insists that every person-irrespective of rank and status in society – be subject to the law. For the citizen, the rule of law is both prescriptive-dictating the conduct required by law – and protective of citizens – demanding that government acts according to law”. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>33.</strong>    In S.P. Gupta’s case, cited above, the Supreme Court of India held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“If there is one principle which runs through the entire fabric of the Constitution, it is the principle of the rule of law and under the Constitution, it is the judiciary which is entrusted with the task of keeping every organ of the State within the limits of the law and thereby making the rule of law meaningful and effective”. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>34.</strong>    The concept of rule of law has been upheld not only by the Courts, it has also been endorsed and adopted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights more than half a century ago and subsequently, in 1950, by The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The International Commission of Jurists, in the Delhi Declaration of 1959, stated:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The function of the legislature in a free society under the rule of law is to create and maintain the conditions which will uphold the dignity of man as an individual.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>35.</strong>    Having considered the theoretical aspects and the relevant provisions of the Act and the Rules, we now propose to consider one of the core issue in this matter, i.e., ‘the misconduct of the police’.<br/><br/>        The term ‘misconduct has been defined in 2(b) of ‘The Police Officers (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 1976’. It states :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“(b) ‘misconduct’ means conduct prejudicial to good order or service discipline or contrary to Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1966, or unbecoming an officer or gentleman.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>36.</strong>    Under the aforesaid Ordinance, if a police officer is found guilty of misconduct or inefficiency (Section 4(i) and 4(vii) respectively), then any one of the penalties mentioned in Section 5(a) to 5(e) may be imposed upon him. Section 5 provides as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Penalties.- The following shall be the penalties which may be imposed under this Ordinance, namely :-</em></div><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 40px;"><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>dismissal from service;</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>removal from service;</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>discharge from service;</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>compulsory retirement; and</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>reduction to lower rank.”</em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>37.</strong>    Furthermore, the provisions relating to an errant police officer has been laid down in Section 12 of the 1976 Ordinance, where clause (g) provides for forfeiture of pay not exceeding one month and Clause (h) provides for forfeiture of increment of pay. Section 48 of the Ordinance reads as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“48. Penalty for misconduct of police-officer.-  Any police officer who is guilty of cowardice or of any wilful breach of any provision of law or of any rule, regulation or order which it is his duty as such police-officer to observe or obey shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand taka, or with both.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>38.</strong>    Evidently, the provisions for dealing with an errant police officer are elaborate and stringent. This, in our view, is necessary for maintaining discipline in the force. It is equally important that Courts should enforce their application when called upon to do so, or else the provisions would become meaningless.<br/> <br/><strong>39.</strong>    Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes has clearly stated that if the language is clear and explicit, the Court must give effect to it (12<sup>th</sup> edition, page 1).<br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong>    We may also profitably refer to a passage from Broom’s Legal Maxims (10<sup>th</sup> Edition, page 384) where it has been stated:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“If the words of the statute are in themselves precise and unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound the words in their natural and ordinary sense. The words themselves alone do, in such case best declare the intention of the law giver”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>41.</strong>    Judge Colley, in his Constitutional Limitations, wrote that the police of a state, in a comprehensive sense, embraces, among others, its whole system of internal regulation, by which the state seeks to preserve the public order and to prevent offenses against the state. (Corpus Juris Secondum, Vol. LXXII, page 207).<br/> <br/><strong>42.</strong>    The term ‘Police Regulation’ is used to define a power which resides in the state. In its primary or narrow sense, it refers to the exercise of the police power to protect the health, lives and morals of the people. In its broader acceptation, it embraces everything to promote the general welfare; everything essential to the great public needs. (N.D.-State .v. Northwester Pac. Rail Co., 172 N.W. 324, 331).<br/> <br/><strong>43.</strong>    As to the question of binding force of such rules and regulations, it has been established by judicial pronouncements that rules made under a statute have the force of law.<br/> <br/><strong>44.</strong>    In Willingale .v. Norris (1909) 1 K.B. 57, the question of binding force of Regulations made under a Statute came up for consideration. It was held that where a Statute makes provisions for Rules to be made thereunder, such Rules have the force of law (per Lord Alverstone, CJ).<br/> <br/><strong>45.</strong>    Since the enactment of the Act in 1861, the Regulation in 1943 and the Ordinance in 1976, there has been significant change in the set-up and format of the police force. There is no longer one police force for the entire country. Rather, each Metropolitan city has a force of its own like the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, Chittagong Metropolitan Police, Khulna Metropolitan Police. Today’s police force is a far-cry from the police force of yester years. They are evidently much better equipped and, presumably, better trained. They have sophisticated arms, communications network and fast cars at their disposal and, very recently, a new uniform to go with their image. However, all the expenses are borne by the people of the country. It is, therefore, not only necessary, but also imperative that the police comply strictly with the provisions of the Act, Rules and Regulations which govern their dealing with the public. In C. Kalbagh .v. State of UP, reported in AIR 1989 SC 1452, it was aptly held :  “there is the imperative requirement of ensuring that the guardians of law and order in fact observe the code of discipline expected of them and that they function strictly as the protectors of innocent citizens” (Per Pathak, CJ).<br/> <br/><strong>46.</strong>    The police, as the law enforcing agency of the State, are to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed and followed by the general public. It is, therefore, not only a matter of utmost regret, but also of grave concern, when such acts of violation are committed by the police themselves. It is also a sad reality that although police excess occur regularly, such incidents are rarely challenged in a Court of law.<br/> <br/><strong>47.</strong>    We are inclined to accept Mr. Khan’s submission that most people are either reluctant to initiate any actions against the police or are very skeptical about any disciplinary action that may be taken against such errant officers. The petitioner deserves to be commended for bringing an issue of such public importance and relevance before this Court. This, no doubt, will serve to create awareness amongst the general public who, though being law abiding, paradoxically remain unaware or ignorant about the law itself. We are reminded of what Lord Donaldson, MR stated in Merkur Island Shipping Corporation .v. Laughton and Others [1983] 2 AC 570:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“The efficacy and maintenance of the rule of law, which is the foundation of any parliamentary democracy, has at least two pre-requisites. First, people must understand that it is in their interests, as well as in that of the community as a whole, that they should live their lives in accordance with the rules and all the rules. Secondly, they must know what those rules are ….”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>48.</strong>    We have considered the submission of the learned Advocate and have also given our anxious thoughts to the grounds taken in the petition. We also take note of the fact that no affidavit-in-opposition has been filed on behalf of any of the respondent nor has any one even entered appearance, although notice has duly been served on them. This is also indicative of their callous and arrogant attitude, to say the least.<br/> <br/><strong>49.</strong>    The facts stated in the writ petition, being uncontroverted, are, therefore, deemed to be correct in the eye of the law. Quite clearly, the conduct of respondent no. 10 not only falls within the ambit of the term ‘misconduct’, it is also violative of the other provisions quoted above. As such, we have no hesitation in holding that the allegation of misconduct against respondent No. 10 has been established.<br/> <br/><strong>50.</strong>    Regrettably, inspite of the matter having been brought to the notice of the superior officers, as is evidenced by Annexure ‘R’ to the writ petition, no action appears to have been taken against the deliquent officer. This, in turn, makes the superior officers liable for punishment as per the aforesaid provisions.<br/> <br/><strong>51.</strong>    In view of the discussions made above, we find substance in  the  Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>52.</strong>    Accordingly, the Rule is made absolute. The issuance of the impugned Charge Report dated 30.05.2001 is found to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/> <br/><strong>53.</strong>    Respondent No. 5 (Inspector General of Police, Bangladesh) and respondent No. 6 (Commissioner, Dhaka Metropolitan Police) are directed to initiate appropriate disciplinary action against respondent No. 10 in accordance with law.<br/> <br/><strong>54.</strong>    Respondent nos. 5 and 6 are further directed to ensure that all police personnel, in whatever  rank they are now serving, be made to be acquainted properly with the provisions of the 1861 Act, the 1943 Regulations and the 1976 Ordinance in dealing with the public in general and, in particular, with women and children and also comply with those provisions in letter and spirit.<br/> <br/><strong>55.</strong>    Let a copy of this judgment be sent to respondent Nos. 5 and 6 for implementation of the aforesaid directions and report compliance to the Registrar of this Court within 4 (four) weeks from receiving copy of this order.<br/> <br/><strong>56.</strong>    Let a copy of this judgment be also sent to respondent no. 1 Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of Bangladesh to ensure due treatment of the public by the police force.<br/> <br/><strong>57.</strong>    Although we were inclined to award costs to the petitioner, we refrain from doing so.<br/> <br/><strong>        Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Abdul Jabbar and Md. Abdur Rashid by deed on 19<sup>th</sup> Joishtha, 1315 B.S, who sold the suit land to Razzak Munshi, father of the defendant Nos.1 and 2. Subsequently Razzak Munshi transferred the suit land to Sree Mohini Mohan Lahiri who possessed the same but C.S. record was prepared wrongly in the name of Abdul Jabbar Munshi, Abdur Rashid Munshi, Moyen uddin Munshi, Mojibor Rahman Munshi inspite of that, Mohini Mohon possessed the suit land. Mohini Mohan died leaving 3 sons in Monomohan Lahiri, Monindra Mohan Lahiri and Upendra Mohan Lahiri and S.A. record was prepared in their names. During the continuation of their possess-ion, they proposed to the plaintiffs to make exchange the land with the land of the plaintiffs which is situated in India and they exchanged the land between them and on 11.9.1976 the Deputy Commissioner, Rajshahi gave registered title exchange kabala to the plaintiff vide kabala No. 31835 through Exchange Case No. 7 (Nato)75-76  but S.A. record was prepared in favour of the previous owner of the suit land and it was, further case of the plaintiffs that they borne in mind the mistake may be corrected during S.A. operation but S.A. record also prepared wrongly and collusively in the names of the defendants, hence the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     The petitioners, who are defendants Nos.1, 3 and 8 make out their case in written statement, that disputed holding of C.S. khatian No.30/31 was recorded in the name of Hayetullah and Mojo Fakir under the superior landlord who sold the suit land by separate kabalas to Abdul Jabbar Munshi, Abdur Rashid Munshi, Moyenuddin and Mojibur Rahman. Rojek Masud father of the aforesaid 4 brothers was the owner of 16 annas share of C.S. khatian No. 20. Rojek Mahmud with his 4 sons started permanently residing at village Kaichar, Bogra and possessed and enjoyed the suit property giving borga to the local people. Local people hatched conspiration to take the suit land as lease from the landlords, so Rojek Mahmud and his two sons, Abdul Jabbar and Abdur Rashid Munshi create benami kabala infavour of Mohini Mohan Lahiri only to protect the suit land. Mohini Mohan and his heirs as per said kabala did not claim the suit land at no point of time. C.S. record was prepared within the knowledge and co-operation of Mohini Mohan. After the death of Rojek Mahmud, total property devolved upon his 4 sons i.e. Abdul Jabbar, Abdur Rashid, Moyenuddin and Mojibor and they possessed the suit land as ejmali which caused some difficulties, so one of the son, Mojibur filed Partition Suit No.127 of 1959. The suit was finally decreed and each heirs of Rojek Mahmud took possession through Court. During possession and enjoyment of the suit, one of the son, Abdul Jabbar died leaving heirs who sold their share, 1 anna to Ashraf Ali and delivered possession. C.S. khatian No.30/31 was prepared in the name of 4 sons of Rojek Mahmud and they possessed the same by paying rent to the government and during their possession they sold their shares to others. In R.S. survey the suit property was recorded in the name of Mojibor Rahman, Dr. Moyenuddin and in the name of the heirs of Abdul Jabbar and purchaser, Haji Ashraf and Abdur Rashid in R.S. Khatian No. 68/79/70 /81/94/97. Tenant of C.S.No.30/31 khatian, Mojibor Rahman and Dr. Moyenuddin gifted 1.32 acres of land to Sukan Gari Madrasha by registered kabala dated 5.6.1958. S.A. khatian was prepared in the name of 4 sons of Rajek Masud but some portion of the suit land was incorporated in S.A. khatian No.34 in the name of sons of Mohini Mohan Lahiri which was wrong. One son Moni Mohan filed suit by using one Asmat Ali Fakir against the defendant under section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure but in vain. The suit property was sold by the heirs of Rojek Mahmud to several persons. The exchange deed and registered kabala created by the plaintiff is false and fabricated as such the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     Learned Assistant Judge, Singra, Natore framed 8 issues, issue No.1, whether the plaintiff has cause of action and <em>locus standi</em> for filing the suit, issue No.2, whether the suit is barred by limitation, issue No.3, whether the suit is bad for defect of parties, issue No.4, whether all the properties have been brought into hotchpotch and whether the suit is in proper form, issue No.5, whether the suit is barred by estoppels, waiver and acquisition and whether the plaint is vague, issue No.6, whether the plaintiffs have title and possession over the suit land, issue No.7 whether the suit has been filed properly and court fees have been properly paid and issue No.8, whether the plaintiffs are entitled to any other relief or reliefs.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>     Learned Assistant Judge dismissed the suit and in dismissing the suit learned judge found that plaintiffs have no <em>locus standi</em> to file the suit and the suit is bad for defect of parties as Dr. Moyenuddin was not made a party, the suit is barred by <em>res-judicata</em> and the plaintiffs failed to prove his possession over the suit property.<br/> <br/><strong>7.     </strong>Title Appeal No.152 of 1996 was taken by the plaintiffs. The appeal was heard by the learned Joint District Judge who by the impugned judgment allowed the appeal and on setting aside the decree of the trial court decreed the suit finding that exchange was made correctly, the suit is not bad for defect of parties and plaintiffs have able to prove their possession over the suit property.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     Mr. A.K.M. Nazrul Islam, learned Advocate appearing for the defendant-petitioners, submits that, Court of appeal below was wrong in not holding the suit is bad for defect of parties as Deputy Commissioner was necessary party and in absence of whom, factum of exchange can not be correctly assessed and decide. Learned Advocate further submits that under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure High Court Division although has limited power to set aside findings of fact arrived at by the learned Judge Court of Appeal below but when it is found that learned Judge of the Court of Appeal below misread the evidence and mis apply the law and thereby arrived at a contrary finding arrived at by the learned Judge of the trial Court then this Court have jurisdiction to set aside the judgment and decree passed by the Court of Appeal below. Learned Advocate elaborate his submission as Court of Appeal below did not at all consider the exhibits filed by the parties and depositions of the witnesses and by cursory manner allowed the appeal. Learned Advocate on reference to the finding of the trial Court on exhibit 7 that unless the property vest in the government Deputy Commissioner has no authority to exchange the property to a citizen but learned Judge of the court of Appeal below without adverting the findings of the trial Court held exchange as made was made correctly which is not legal and not supported by any law. Learned Advocate further submits that trial Court on consideration of series of exhibits i.e. two registered kabalas finds that defendant has proved possession over the suit land and plaintiff did not produced any evidence to that effect as such, learned judge of appellate Court committed gross illegality in reversing the finding of the trial Court on the question of possession. Learned Advocate in support of his submission relied on the decision of Hajee Khabiruddin Ahmed vs. Md. Salam Kabir, 34 DLR(AD)-271, the case of Sajeda Khatoon vs. Mostafa Khatoon and others, 28 DLR-221, the case of Ibrahim vs. Surendra Kumar Dhar, 9 DLR-16, the case of Atikullah and others vs. Zafala Begum and others, 54 DLR (AD)74, the case of Md. Abdus Sattar and others vs. Lalon Mazar Sharif and Seba Sadar, 24 BLD(AD)125.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     Mr. M. Yousuf, learned Advocate, appearing for the plaintiff-opposite parties, on the other hand, submits that, the decisions arrived at by the Court of Appeal below unless perverse is finding upon this Court under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Learned Advocate further submits that the learned Judge of the Court of the Appeal below on consideration of the entire materials before him found that plaintiffs have able to prove the case by adducing oral and documentary evidence as such the judgment being passed on materials on record should not be disturbed by this Court. Learned Advocate on the question of defect of parties submits that when genuinity of registered deed calls in question whether Sub-Register is a necessary party to be  impleaded in the suit as such Deputy Commissioner was not a necessary party in the suit as such the suit is not bad for defect of parties.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    Let me proceed with my judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    Plaintiffs in order to prove their case filed exhibits, certified copies of the deeds No.2238  and 2237 dated 1.6.1908 as exhibit 1 and 1(ka), certified copy of deed No.2272 dated 10.3.1914 as exhibit 1(kha), 3 rent receipts as exhibits 2-2kha, certified copies of C.S. khatian Nos.20, 30, and 31 as exhibits Nos.3 – 3(B).

E-E1.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    Plaintiffs case is that they got the suit land by exchange. I have read the judgment of the Court of appeal below very minutely, I find that learned judge in deciding the appeal find that it is admitted possession that Hayatullah Sarker and Mojfakir were owners of the suit land who sold the suit land to A. Jabbar and A. Rashid and A. Jabbar Munshi, A. Rashid Munshi and Razzak Munshi sold the suit land to Mohini Mohan Lahiri, upto this, case of the parties are similar but learned judge left aside from deciding whether the plaintiffs have proved their case or not. Before discussing on the findings of the trial Court, learned judge of the appellate court was of the opinion that:<br/><br/>           এই মোকদ্দমার তাদের উভয় পক্ষকেই তাহাদের স্ব স্ব দাবী প্রমান করিতে হইবে।<br/>        Thereafter learned judge left aside the plaintiffs case and observed that;<br/>           বিবাদীগনের দাবী যে আঃ জববার মুন্সী ও আঃ রশিদ মুন্সীর সহিত তাহাদের দুই ভাই ময়েন উদ্দিন ও মজিবর রহমান নালিশী সম্পত্তি খরিদ করিয়াছেন। এই মোকদ্দমায় বিবাদীপক্ষ উপরোক্ত দাবী কোন মৌখিক ও দালিলিক প্রমান দ্বরা প্রমান করিতে সমর্থ হন নাই।<br/>        Learned judge thereafter suddenly jumped on exhibit-7and without discussing the contends of the documents just in one line held that:<br/>           উক্ত বিনিময় দলিল হইতে ইহা সুষ্পষ্ট ভাবে প্রমানিত হয় যে, নালিশী সম্পত্তি বাদী আঃ গফুর বিনিময় সুত্রে প্রাপ্ত হইয়াছেন।<br/>        Learned Judge thereafter on the findings of the trial Court observed that trial Court believed the exchange deed but did not give any findings as to genuinity of the deed make and comment as-<br/>           বিজ্ঞ নিমণ আদালতের উপরোক্ত বক্তব্য সমুহ আদৌ সঠিক নহে বলিয়া আদারত মনে করে। কেননা বর্তমান মোকদ্দমাটি বিনিময় কেসের কার্যক্রমের বৈধতাকে চ্যালেঞ্জ করিয়া আনয়ন করা হয় নাই।<br/>        Learned Judge failed to consider that the entire case of the plaintiffs rests on exchange deed. Learned Judge considered possession of the plaintiffs and considered the depositions of P.Ws.1 to 5 and also observed P.Ws.1 to 5 and particularly that P.W.2 in his examination in chief stated that he saw plaintiffs possessed the suit land, P.w.3, in his deposition stated that he borga cultivated dag No.21 under the plaintiffs, p.w.4 in his deposition stated that he borga cultivated dag No.118 and P.W.5 in his deposition stated that he cultivated dag No.115 of the plaintiffs. Thereafter learned judge without discussing the depositions of the witnesses for the defendants held as:<br/>           পক্ষান্তরে বিবাদীগণের জবাবরে বর্ণনা হইতে দেখা যায় যে, বিবাদীগন নালিশী মৌজায় বাস করেন না কাজেই বিবাদীগনকে এই মোকদ্দমায় তাহারা নলিশী সম্পত্তি বিভাবে ফরস করেন তাহা প্রমান করিতে হইবে।<br/>        Learned Judge disbelieved 22 kabuliats, filed by defendants as:          <br/>           কেননা কেহ কোন কবুলিয়ত সম্পাদন ও রেজিষ্ট্রী করিয়া দিলে তাহা কোথায় করা হইয়াছে তাহা অবশ্যই বলিতে পারিবেনা।<br/>        And learned Judge further observed as: <br/>           উক্ত কবুলিয়ত গুলি ইং ৬৬ সালের কবুলিয়ত কিন্তু উক্ত কবুলিয়াত গুলির মেয়াদ ইত্তীর্ণ হওয়ার পর বিবাদী পক্ষর উপস্থাপিত সমর্থকারী স্বাক্ষীগনকে কত তারিখ হইতে নালিশী জমি বর্গা দিয়েছেন এবং কে কোন বিবাদীর অধীনে কতটুকু জমি বর্গা দিয়াছেন এই বিষয়গুলি বিবাদীগনের স্বাক্ষীগরেন সাক্ষ্যদান হইতে সুষ্পষ্ট নহে।<br/>        On these observations learned Judge held that plaintiffs are in possession of the suit property.   <br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    On the question whether the suit is barred by limitation and bad for defect of parties and on waiver and acquiescence, learned Judge just in one line find that:<br/>           যাহা আদৌ আইনানুগ হয় নাই। কেননা এই মোকদ্দমার বিনিময় দলিলের দাতা ডেপুটি কমিশনার রাজশাহী আদৌ অবশ্যকীয় পক্ষ নহে এবং মালিকের কারণ উদ্ভুব হওয়ার তারিখ হইতে বাদীপক্ষ যথাযথ সময়েরে মধ্যে মোকদ্দমাটি আনায়ন করিয়াছেন। Learned Judge on these findings decreed the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    Let me find on reference to the exhibits whether findings of the learned judge of the Appellate court, master of fact and final Court are justified or not.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    Exhibit-7 is the exchange deed dated 11.9.76. It appears that this deed was executed by the Deputy Commissioner, Rajshahi. On consi-deration of exhibit-7 it appears that in this exhibit-7 some lands of Dakshmin Sukhan gari under J.L. No.226, S.A. khatian No.33, dag Nos.1, 28, 354, 232, 228 in total 1.53 acres of land have been impleaded but these lands have not been properly mentioned or described properly. Next, I find in exhibit-7 that in total 5.61 acres of land including in the suit and some other non suited land have been included and Deputy Commissioner by his order registered the deed of exchange. In registering the exchange deed questions relating to registration envies i.e. whether Deputy Commiss-ioner has authority to register and execute the exchange deed in between the civilian, before registering exchange deed whether the Deputy Commissioner consulted S.A. and R.S. record, whether the power of attorney was genuine or not and whether Deputy Commissioner has jurisdic-tion to register exhibit-7 as such I am of the view that Deputy Commissioner is a necessary party.  From exhibit Nos.4-4(1), S.A. khatian Nos.56 and 34 it appears that in the remark column it has not been recorded plaintiffs have possessed the suit property. It is the case of the plaintiffs that R.S. khatian in preliminary form recorded the name of the plaintiffs but from the aforesaid exhibits filed by the plaintiffs I do not find any such exhibits from the side of the plaintiffs. On consideration of the depositions of the plaintiff's witnesses particularly from P.W.1 it appears he stated that he did not know when and in what year R.S. khatian was prepared and also admitted that he did not file R.S. khatian. P.W.1 i.e. plaintiff further stated that he did not know anything about revenue. P.W.1 also stated that: <br/><br/>P.W.1 further stated that এস/এ এ্যাক্ট এর ১৯(১), ১৯(২) ধারামতে আপত্তি দিয়াছেন কিনা তার মনে নেই। During pendency of the suit and continuation of the deposition of P.W.1, P.W.1 died and P.W.6, his son, deposed that R.S. record started in 1966 and finally recorded in 1970 and at that time he was 18 years old. He further deposed that his father collected the copy of R.S. khatian and also P.W.6 admitted that his father, P.W.1 knows about the recording of S.A. khatian but after knowing the fact that khatian has not been prepared in the name of his father, why his father did not file any case under section 19(1) -19(2) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act for correction of the same, he could not say. Exhibit 5 series are R.S. khatian dated 20.5.70, 5.8.70, 30.5.70, 2.5.70, these are the printed form which are found in possession of the plaintiff i.e. P.W.1 and admission of P.w.6, son of P.W.1, proved that cause of action as shown on 19.8.1976  is false. On a reading of the cause of action it appears that plaintiff does not stated from when his title and possession was threatened.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    Exhibit 7 is exchange deed, registered by the Deputy Commissioner on 19.9.76 as such cause of action shown on 19.8.76 is totally false as before registering the title deed no one can had any cause of action for title as it was not in his domine. It safely said that cause of action shows by the plaintiff was not correct one and false and also that S.A. khatian has been finally published in 1970, and since cause of action has not been proved this suit is barred by limitation.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    On a reading of exhibit 7 it appears that by this exchange deed the land of S.A. khatian Nos.33, 56 and 34 has been exchanged but in the plaint, plaintiff filed the suit for 14 dags and 57 decimals of land of dag No.118 has not been claimed, plaintiff claimed 5.90 decimals of land from dag No.115 but in dag No.115 it is clear the quantum of land is 5.68 as such plaintiffs claim .22 decimals of land more which has not been exchanged through exchange deed. It also appears from exhibit 7 that in dag No.10/402 quantum of land was 1.26 decimals but plaintiff claimed only .53 decimals of land. It also appears from exhibit 7 that in dag No.116 there is 1.33 acres of land but plaintiffs in the plaint claimed from dag Nos.50,51,52, 180, 184, (23+10+62+63+66) in Total 2.54 acres of land but it fact plaintiffs claimed 1.33 decimals of land. There is no explanation for the remaining land. It also appears from exhibit 7 that part of some dags has been exchanged but there was no specification for the same.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    On the question whether Deputy Custodian is a party in the suit learned judge of the trial Court consider memo No.10/73/710(19) dated 29.11.1973 wherein before 6.9.65 all exchange cases were divided in two classes i.e. exchange deed before 10.10.64 which was enemy property and exchange deed after 10.10.64 to 5.9.65 which was land under Disturbed Person Ordinance. For the first class, if the Assistant Custodian/Superintendent (land and buildings) be satisfied then he could register the exchange deed and give certificate to that effect. But for the 2<sup>nd</sup> class exchange deed, if Deputy Commissioner satisfied then on behalf of Government he promulgate a notification for 'confiscation' of the land and will settled the land to the landless people. On consideration of exhibit-7, the learned Assistant Judge found that this land belonged to the category/class of No.1 where Deputy Commissioner has no authority to register the same. Learned Judge of the trial Court found on exhibit-7 that it was registered by the Deputy Commissioner, Rajshahi in violation in the order under memo No.1108(18) E.P.236/70 dated 4.5.70 and memo No.6-10/73/710(91) dated 29.11.73. It also appears that exchange land has not been fallen either of the category of abandoned property or enemy property. Learned Judge also found from exhibit J series that in Case No.91/66 government did not issue any notice to the defendant for relinquishing the said land as no notice has been served upon the defendants and the case was dismissed. Exhibits C and D, are S.A and R.S khatian.  It appears that the suit land is not included either as enemy property nor as vested property as such government does not acquire any title over the suit land. It appears from the depositions of P.W.1 that he did not know about the government land. Plaintiff in his deposition stated that he came to this land in 1961/62 and he can not say about C.S to S.A. operation and who possessed the suit land. Before C.S khatian, the suit land was homestead of the predecessor of the defendants. P.W.1 further stated that he knew Monimohan who went to India but he did not prove that fact. In cross-examination, P.W.1, admitted that in khatian No.73 he has no land. But from exhibits Nos.2, 2(ka), 2(kha) it appears that he paid rents for 7.14 decimals of land of khatian No. 73 although khatian No. 73 does not belonged to him. P.w.1 in his deposition does not state whether defendants got decree against Monimohan, what is the result of the case filed under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, whether government admitted in Case No. 91/96 that suit land belonged to the defendant. P.W.3 in his examination in chief frankly stated that on the request of plaintiff he came to depose falsely. It appears from the deposition of P.W.4 that he borga cultivated the land of dag No.118 on behalf of the plaintiff. He could not say other dag Nos. of the adjacent land. P.W. 5 does not specifically state the quantum of land of dag No. 115. P.W. 5 stated that he got kabuliyat from the plaintiffs and he delivered crops to the plaintiffs but he did not produce any paper before the Court. Considering exhibits G – G(2) it appears that through Execution Case No.18/61 defendant got decree against Monimohan and decree is still in existence, neither plaintiff nor his predecessor challenge the decree. Since the decree stand plaintiff has no right, title and interest of the suit property by exchange deed. Even if it is found to be genuine then also plaintiffs have no ownership of the suit property as by the decree of the court title of the plaintiffs have been extinguished.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    Now the decisions filed by the learned Advocate for the petitioners. In the case of Md. Abdus Sattar and others vs. Lalon Mazar Sharif and Seba Sadan committee and others, 24 BLD (AD)-125 it has been held in paragraph 6 that the trial court after giving finding on all the 5 issues framed in the suit including the maintainability of the suit decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiffs and declared right, title, interest and possession of the plaintiffs in the suit land. The appellate court it appears without adverting to the findings given by the trial court reversed the findings of the trial court and sent back the suit on remand for trial afresh without assigning any cogent reason. It is needless to mention that remand can not be allowed as matter of course to fill in the lacuna of the case of any party. It appears that the appellate court relied upon inadmissible evidence namely report of the Advocate commissioner since the Advocate commissioner was not examined by the parties. It is to be mentioned here that the report itself of the Advocate Commissioner is not evidence, but if the Advocate Commissioner deposes on oath before the court then the same is evidence. It further appears that the appellate court mainly relied upon the evidence of P.W. 1 in coming to the conclusion that the defendants have homestead in the suit land and hence they are in possession of the same.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    In the case of Akitullha and others vs. Zafala Begum and other 54 DLR(AD) 74 it is held that in view of the clear finding of the trial Court regarding Hiba-bil-Ewaz as aforesaid we are of the view that this open remand order for a fresh decision in the suit allowing parties to adduce fresh evidence is designed to fill in the lacuna of the pleadings of the parties, which is not the intent and object of the order of remand contemplated under Order XLI rule 23 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    In the case of Dr. Razia Khatun  vs Bhanu Guha and others 1986 BLD(AD) 135, it is observed that “The long line of judicial decision is to the effect that the remand order should be avoided as far as possible and even the Privy Council in some cases observed that indiscriminate order of remand tantamounts to shirking the responsibility.”<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>    In the case of Abdus Sobhan vs. Anwar Rahim and others, 53 DLR(AD)110, it is held that we have gone through the judgment of the trial Court as well as of the High Court Division. It appears that the trial Court decreed the suit on consideration of the evidence on record and it was found that there is no truth in the defence version of the case. The trial Court also found that there was no scope for service of summons of the earlier suit upon the predecessor of the present plaintiff and that the plaintiffs are in possession of the suit property but the appellate Court found that in collusion with the defense lawyer decree was obtained. It also found that illegality has been committed in not calling for the record of the earlier Title Suit No. 21 of 1968 over which the present suit has been filed. The appellate Court also found that defendant ought to have been given a chance to adduce evidence in support of their claim and for that matter passed the order of remand. But from the perusal of the record it appears that the present petitioner took no step for giving additional evidence before the appellate Court and also has not taken any step for calling for the record of the earlier suit. What the appellate Court did was nothing but giving an opportunity to the defence to fill up the lacuna which law has not permitted. No step was taken before the appellate court by the present petitioner to adduce additional evidence or to call for the record of the earlier disposed of suit. There is nothing on record to show that there was collusion in between the plaintiff and the defence Advocate. In such a situation the High Court Division rightly found that the suit could not be sent back on remand for filing up lacuna. We have considered the submission made by the learned Advocate for the petitioner but we find nothing to interfere with the judgment of the High Court Division. The learned Advocate failed to point out any legal infirmity in the judgment of the High Court Division which may call for our interference.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>    In the case of Ibrahim vs. Surendra Kumar Dhar, 9 DLR-16 it is held that 'on examination of the record discloses that there is hardly any substance in this contention. It appears that in 1937 the defendant Surendrakumar Dhar brought a suit being S. C.C. Suit No.  219 of 1937, against the plaintiff, Ibrahim, for recovery of his dues under a pro-note. The plaintiff was then away in Burma and summons was served by hanging at his village residence in the district of Chittagong. There was no appearance on behalf of the plaintiff on the date of the hearing of the suit, and the result was that it was decreed ex parte. Thereafter the decree was put into execution and the plaintiff’s homestead was brought to sale and purchased by the defendant himself on the 9<sup>th</sup> November, 1943. Then on the 20<sup>th</sup> March, 1947, the plaintiff brought this suit for setting aside the ex parte decree and the sale held in execution thereof alleging that the decree had been brought about by fraudulent suppression of summons, and the sale held in execution thereof had been brought about by causing suppression of all the execution processes including sale-proclamation. In a case like this, the plaintiff in order to succeed must prove how, when and under what circumstances the fraud was practiced, but he has hopelessly failed to discharge it. In the plaint we find general allegations of fraud, but it is well settled that general allegations, however strong may be the words in which they are stated, are insufficient to an averment of fraud. Mr. Hakim having failed to make any headway in this direction proceeds to challenge the legality of the decree on the ground that the mode of service as reported by the peon was not in accordance with the rule of Order 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The same point was broached before the Subordinate Judge and the learned Judge overruled it with the following observations.  <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>        “According to the C.P.C. personal service has to be attempted, but if there is no possibility of it, there are alternate procedures of service which may be adopted to meet the situation. The first alternative procedure is the service on the empowered agent, but Abdul Latif, the cousin of the plaintiff, does not appear to have had any such authority. The next best way is to serve the summons on a male member living jointly with the person to be served. In the return of the process server; Abdul Latif to whom the summons was tendered at the first instance is described as having been in joint mess with the plaintiff. But of such a case, there is no evidence. On the other hand, the plaintiff has given the denial.  Under the Mohammedan Law again, there is no presumption of jointness in the case of a Muslim. The statement of the process-server is not of any value; in such a matter, he could not have any personal knowledge. The tender to Abdul Latif cannot accordingly be regarded as sufficient in law but there is still the last procedure of hanging up the summons to the dwelling house of the defendant under Order 5, rule 15, C.P.C.  From the peon’s return, it can be presumed that such a procedure was ultimately adopted in the case of the plaintiff. The incompe-tent witnesses on the side of the plaintiff can hardly have displaced the presumption raised by the service-return. It is significant that neither Abdul Latif nor the witnesses named in the  service return have been examined by the plaintiff, though to disprove the service they could furnish the best evidence; about the actual service by hanging up the summons to the residence of the plaintiff, there can, therefore, be no doubt. </em><br/><br/><em>        ‘But the question is whether under the circumstances of the present case it was sufficient Substituted service under Order 5, rule 20, C.P.C, might be adopted. In fact, in case of the execution proceedings one piece of processes was served under such special procedure. But it cannot be said as a matter of course that if the defendant be found absent, summons for him must be served under Order 5, rule 20, C.P.C. In the present case, the plaintiff had left his wife behind. Some arrangement for management of his affairs must have been made by him consequently the service of summons by hanging it up to his residence could not be regarded as insufficient. With his people the plaintiff was in communication then. It is only at a later stage that communication broke down due to war. Under such circumstances, the service by hanging up the summons to the residence of the plaintiff could not be regarded as insufficient and invalid. It might have been known that the plaintiff was away to Rangoon. But there is nothing to show that his address was known or could be known by the defendant. Consequently to serve the plaintiff personally with summons was hardly possible for the defendant. And to insist on personal service under such circumstances would be asking the defendant to perform impossibilities.</em><br/><br/><em>        “Such being the position, I cannot see how the service of summons in the S.C.C. suit could be regarded as bad or insufficient. Apart from the question of irregularity or otherwise of the summons, fraud must be established before, in a suit like this, the decree in question can be set aside. For it is only in case of a decree obtained by fraud that a suit to set it aside lies; in the present case, there is nothing to show that the claim was false. Rather the half admission of the plaintiff suggests otherwise”</em><br/><em>I do not find any lacuna anywhere in the finding Mr. Hakim contends that the service, not being in accordance with rule 17 of Order 5, Civil Procedure Code, is no service in the eye of law, and consequently the decree passed on the basis thereof cannot but be regarded as illegal and unenforceable."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>25.</strong>    Since I have decided on merit the judgment of the Appellate Court is not sustainable in law and dismissed the suit, the decision so referred are not required to be consider on the fact of the given case and the learned Advocate for the petitioner is advised to cite this in an appropriate case.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>    On an over all consideration of the entire materials on record I find substance in this rule.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>    In the result this rule is made absolute. No costs.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>    The judgment and decree passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Natore in Title Appeal No. 152 of 1996 is set aside. The Judgment and decree passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Singra, Natore in Other Class Suit No. 21 of 1994 is restored.<br/>       </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Send down the lower Court records at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Subsequently,   the   said   account number has been renumbered as 0101110000004092; that thereafter, at the request of the defendant No. 1, Company Bank sanctioned a letter of Credit Limit of Tk.90.00 million for opening irrevocable letters of Credit for import of Raw Materials and loan against Trust Receipt for retiring documents under the Letters of Credit vide its Sanction Letter No. DBBL/ LO/CO/3.03.01/97 dated 21.08.1997 in favour of the defendant No.l Company; that the Bank renewed and enhanced the facilities from time to time; that thereafter, the Bank re-arranged the aforesaid facilities in the manner such as reduction of regular Letter of Credit limit from Tk.300.00 million to Tk.270.00 million and allowing free option for opening sight and nuance letter of credit, LTR sub limit, Encash-ment of FC FUND / Term Deposit that has been built up over the period for adjustment of LTR outstanding and conversion of remaining liabilities into a term loan amount of Tk. 108.77 for adjustment purpose within a period of 5 years on 31.03.2004 which was duly accepted by the defendant. The said credit facilities sanctioned in favour of the Company were secured by the securities/charge documents executed by the defendant Company. In addition to the charge documents the Company mortgaged its landed property by mortgaged deed No. 8385 dated 15.10.1997 along with a registered power of attorney being No. 8386 dated 15.10.1997 empowering the plaintiff to sell the mortgaged property. The defendant Nos. 2 and 3 created equitable mortgaged on their landed property as collateral security against the aforesaid credit facilities by way of depositing title deeds dated 02.02.2000 and 17.02.2004.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>     Thereafter, on 19.10.2009 the Bank filed an application under Order XXXVIII, Rule 5 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for attachment of the schedule property before judgment stating, inter alia, that the plaintiff Bank filed the Artha Rin Suit for recovery of an amount of Tk.42,64,85,629.13. At the time of creating equitable mortgage of the schedule properties the defendants on several occasions promised to execute registered mortgage deed. The plaintiff for the assistance of the business of the Company disbursed the Credit facilities relying on the promise of the defendants but they failed to fulfill their commitment. The plaintiff has reliably learnt that having knowledge of the filing of the suit, defendants are trying to transfer the property.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     Thereafter, on 05.01.2010 the defendant Nos.2 and 3 filed a written objection against the aforesaid application stating, inter alia, that the said properties have more value than the amount claimed by the plaintiff Bank. Besides that the plaintiff carried out valuation survey on the said properties by its own effort. But the plaintiff did not mention how the Bank calculated the said loan accounts, stating clearly the amount of the interest of each force loan created or letter of credit facility. Moreover, the total value of the said properties are about 100.00 crore as per the present market value.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     Thereafter, on 02.02.2010 the petitioners as defendant Nos. 2 and 3 filed a written statement stating, inter alia, that the claim of the Bank is wrongly calculated; that plaintiff Bank sanctioned only Tk. 9(nine) crore; that on several occasions the defendant No. 2 personally requested the plaintiff Bank through several letters to waive 100% interest from insertion of loan created and allowed time period of l(one) year to adjust the liabilities and the defendant No.l Company requested the Bank to adjust the loan by selling the defendants mortgaged property including the stock inside the building on 17.03.2008 and the defendant Nos.1-3 requested the Bank to arrange a meeting with a view to discuss and resolve the matter amicably but the petitioner did not response.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>     On 16.02.2010, the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat after hearing, allowed the application under Order XXXVIII, Rule 5 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure and attached the scheduled properties.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     Thereafter, petitioner preferred this Writ Petition before this Court and obtained the present Rule Nisi.<br/> <br/><strong>8.     </strong>Respondent No. 2 (Bank) contested the rule by filing an affidavit-in-opposition contending, inter alia, that the learned Judge of the Adalat after proper consideration of the application filed by the Bank allowed the application and passed an order of attachment of the schedule property. It is further contended that the petitioners have been given ample time to adjust the outstanding dues but the petitioners have not taken any positive steps even after repeated requests and appeals vide a series of letter from the respondent Bank and miserably failed to adjust the rest of the outstanding dues with the respondent Bank; thereafter, the Bank on 11.01.2009 published auction notice in "The Financial Express" and on 09.02.2009 published auction notice in the "Daily Prothom Alo", under section 12 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. Since, there was no suitable participants, the mortgaged properties could not be sold; that the Bank has positive information that the Petitioner Barrower was trying to dispose of the schedule properties in order to defeat the decree which might be passed in the Artha Rin Suit and the learned Judge of the Adalat by his order dated 19.10.2009 issued show cause notice upon the defendant petitioners and, as such, the allegations made in the Writ Petition is not true that no show cause notice was served upon the petitioners; that the petitioners have preferred this Writ Petition only with a view to transfer of the schedule properties. As such, the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     Mr. Moudud Ahmed with Mr. A.M. Mahbub Uddin, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners submits, that the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat without complying with the provision of order XXXVIII, rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure passed the impugned order for attachment of the schedule properties. He further submits that the Bank sanctioned the loan of Tk.9.00 (nine) crore only but the Bank filed the Artha Rin Suit claiming Tk.42,64,85,629.13 which is much more than three times of the principal amount and so, is a violation of Section 47 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. He next submits that the learned Judge of the Adalat passed the impugned order without issuing any show cause notice upon the defendant petitioner as to why he should not furnish security which is required under order XXXVIII, rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure and as such, the impugned order should be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect. He next submits that the plaintiff Bank neither mentioned the particulars of the properties mentioned in the schedule including the value of the properties nor the learned Artha Rin Adalat directs the parties otherwise as per clause 2 of rule 5 under order XXXVIII of the Code of Civil Procedure and as such the impugned order should be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect. Finally, he submits that some valuable landed properties with building thereon and equipments inside the building are on mortgaged in favour of the bank and a power of attorney was also executed and registered empowering the bank to sell the properties but the Bank without complying with Section 12 of the Ain filed the Artha Rin Suit. Thus, the impugned order dated 16.02.2010 passed by the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat is liable to be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    In reply, Mr. Rokon Uddin Mahmud, the learned Advocate for the respondent No.2 appearing with Mr. Md. Ashraf Uddin Bhuiyan, has taken us through the affidavit in opposition and submits, that the petitioner borrower availed the loan facilities but despite repeated requests, remainders failed to repay the loan; that the Bank thereafter, requested the defendants to execute a mortgaged deed but the defendant petitioner without doing so tried to transfer the schedule properties and finding no other alternative Bank filed the Artha Rin Suit for recovery of the outstanding dues of Tk.42,64,85,629.13 and thereafter, filed an application for attachment of the schedule properties before judgment under order XXXVIII, rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. He next submits that the petitioner obtained the Rule by suppressing material facts and making incorrect statement that Section 12 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain was not complied with. He further submits that in fact auction notice published on 11.01.2009 in the Financial Express and on 09.02.2009 in the daily Prothom Alo. He further submits that the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat issued show cause notice upon the defendants and thereafter, on hearing the application filed by the bank passed the impugned order. He lastly submits that it is evident that the petitioner by suppressing the aforesaid facts and making false statement in the Writ Petition obtained the present Rule, which is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    We have heard the learned Advocates for both the sides, perused the Writ Petition, the affidavit-in-opposition and the impugned order and other materials on record.<br/> <br/><strong>12.    </strong>Admittedly, upon request of the petitioner, the Bank opened an Account with its principal Branch being Bank Account No. 10123004826 dated 06.10.1997 in the name of the petitioner company i.e. K &amp; K Tops Textile Mills Limited. Thereafter, at the request of the Bank, the petitioner disbursed and aggregate the loan facilities of Tk.34,08,19,287.95 only and enhanced and renewed the loan from time to time and the petitioner Company repaid Tk. 11,75,96,631.74 out of their total outstanding liabilities of Tk.42,64,85,629.13; that the said credit facilities sanctioned in favour of the defendants No. l Company were secured by several charge documents.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    In addition to the above mentioned charge documents, the defendant No. l mortgaged its landed property measuring 2.35 acres situated within District-Mymensingh, P.S and Sub-Registry Office-Valuka, Mouza-Kathali and 0.50 acres situated within District-Mymensingh, P.S and Sub-Registry Office- Valuka, Mouza-Kathali along with building thereon and all machinery and equipments installed thereon by way of executing a mortgaged deed being No.8385 dated 15.10.1997 along with a registered power of attorney being No.8386 dated 15.10.1997 empowering the plaintiff Bank to sell the mortgaged properties in favour of the plaintiff Bank. The defendant Nos.2 &amp; 3 described in the plaint in the schedule-B(2) &amp; B(3) of the schedule of the property as collateral security against the aforesaid credit facilities by way of executing a memorandum of deposit of title of deeds dated 02.02.2000 and 17.02.2004 and deposited the title deeds to the plaintiff Bank, when the defendants failed to repay the aforesaid outstanding loan facility; that the Bank on several occasions requested the defendants to execute a registered mortgaged deed of the schedule property mentioned in the schedule-B(2) &amp; B(3) but the defendants failed to do so. Eventually, the suit was filed for recovery of loan.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    In the Suit, Bank filed an application under order XXXVIII, rule 5 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for attachment of the schedule property before judgment. It appears from the order sheet annexed with the affidavit-in-opposition that on 19.10.2009 the learned Judge of the Adalat issued show cause upon the defendant Nos.2 and 3 and thereafter, defendant Nos.2 and 3 filed written objection against the application filed by the Bank (annexure-C to the Writ Petition) stating that due to non-cooperation and negligence of the plaintiff Bank the defendant Nos.2 and 3 failed to get loan facilities from other Banks as all deeds of personal properties of the defendants in custody of the plaintiff Bank and as such the defendant Nos.  2 and 3 failed to carry out the project and pay back the loan to the Bank on time.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    Thus the submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioner that no show cause notice was served upon the petitioner is not true.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    It further appears from the annexures-2(A) and 2(B) to the affidavit-in-opposition that auction notice was published under Section 12(3) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 in the Financial Express on 11.01.2009 and in the daily Prothom Alo on 09.02.2009. Thus, the argument advanced by the learned Advocate for the petitioner that no auction notices was published and no step was taken under Section 12(3) of the Ain before filing of the Suit, is also not true.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    For proper appreciation, let us consider the impugned order which is quoted blow:<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    We have considered the findings of the learned Judge, it transpires that the Bank requested the petitioner to execute a mortgage deed but he did not do so; that the Bank had a positive apprehension that the petitioner-borrower was trying to transfer of the schedule properties in order to defeat the decree which might be passed in the Artha Rin Suit.<br/> <br/><strong>19.    </strong>From the discussions made above and on consideration of the documents on record and the impugned order, we are of the opinion that the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat after proper consideration of the cases of the respective parties and following the provisions of order XXXVIII, rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, properly and lawfully passed the impugned order. Thus, we find no illegality in the impugned order passed by the learned Judge of the Adalat.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    Thus, the Rule has no merit.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    In the result, the Rule is discharged without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    The order of stay granted earlier by this Court stands vacated. Communicate the order to the respondent No. 1 at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Khatian No.145, Dag No. 1481. The plaintiff’s case, in short, is that the suit land was originally belonged to Bhawal Court of Wards Estate who  granted pattan in favour of the plaintiffs on payment of Tk. 26/- as salami; that the plaintiffs thereafter, on the basis of the said pattan mutated their name, paid rents to the Government regularly  and during last S.A. operation their names were rightly recorded in the S.A. Khatian No. 13; that when the pattan was granted in favour of the plaintiffs, the nature of the suit land was a pond and after taking pattan the plaintiffs filled up half portion of the suit land by earth-filling and built dwelling house thereon  and the rest being cultivable land under their possession; that during last R.S. operation the suit land was wrongly recorded as khas land of the Government as a result of which Settlement Case being No. 54/86-87 was started with Chandpara Shahi Moshjid and thereupon, notices were served upon the plaintiffs infringing their right and title. Hence, the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>     The defendant contested the suit by filing written statement denying most of the averments of the plaint  contending, inter-alia, that the suit land was  originally belonged to Bhawal Court of Wards Estate and subsequently, the same was recorded as khas land of the Government; that the suit is barred by limitation and during last R.S. operation the record of right was rightly prepared and published in the name of the Government and later on, the Government leased out the property in favour of the Chandpara Shahi Moshjid Comm-ittee  through  Settlement Case No. 54/86-87. The suit land was never gave pattan by the Bhawal Court of Wards Estate in favour of the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs have no right, title and interest of the suit land and as such the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     The trial Court on  the pleadings of the parties framed the following issues for determination  namely:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(i)   whether the suit is maintainable in its present form   and manner?<br/>(ii)  whether the case is barred by limitation?<br/>(iii) whether the plaintiffs have right, title and possession   in the suit land?<br/>(iv) whether the settlement case in question was void, illegal and beyond jurisdiction?<br/>(v)  whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get decree, as prayed for?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     During trial plaintiffs examined 3 (three) witnesses and exhibited a series of documents and defendant side examined 1 (one) witness to prove their respective cases.<br/> <br/><strong>6.     </strong>The  trial Court  below on consideration of the materials on record dismissed the suit by its judgment and decree dated 17.10.1999 (decree signed 27.10.1999) on the findings, inter alia, that the plaintiffs  neither proved  their right, title and possession in the suit land nor proved their pattan (Ext.1) by adducing evidence.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     The unsuccessful plaintiffs then  preferred   an appeal being Title Appeal No. 825 of 1999 before the learned District Judge, Dhaka which was ultimately heard by the learned   Additional District Judge, 5th Court, Dhaka,  who by his judgment and decree dated 9.11.2008 affirmed the decision of the trial Court below holding that the plaintiffs could not prove that the pattan (Ext.1) was granted by the Bhawal Court of Wards Estate in favour of the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 9.11.2008 the plaintiff-appellant-petitioners have come before this Court and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>       Mr. Mokhlesur Rahman, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners in the course of his argument after placing the judgments of two Courts below, deposition of witnesses, exhibits and other relevant materials on record submits that judgments of both the Courts below are not in fact based on correct evaluation of facts and materials of the case and as such the impugned judgment and decree  are liable to be set aside.  He next submits that the plaintiff-petitioners in support of their claim proved as many as 4(four) vital documents namely; (i) pattan dated 4.4.1939 (Ext.1), (ii) 5(five) rent receipts (Ext. 2-2Gha), (iii) S.A. Khatian (Ext.3) and (iv) rent receipt under S.A. Khatian (Ext.4) but both the Courts below mere on surmise and conjecture mechanically held that the plaintiffs could not prove their pattan  as well as  right, title and possession in the suit land by educing evidence.<br/> <br/><strong>10.    </strong>Referring to the deposition of sole D.W-1, Mr. Mokhlesur Rahman contends that it is apparent from the evidence of sole D.W-1  that this witness in his deposition admitted that the S.A. Khatian of the suit land was prepared in the name of the plaintiff-petitioners and there is nothing on record  to suggest that the Government leased out the suit property in favour of Chandpara Shahi Moshjid Committee and as such the judgment of both the Courts below are based on  gross misreading and misinterpretation of material evidence on record. He  also submits that both the Courts below ought to have decreed the suit inasmuch as the plaintiffs examined as many as 3(three) witnesses and all of them in their respective testimony categorically testified that the plaintiffs got the suit land by way of pattan dated 4.4.1939 granted by Bhawal Court of Wards Estate (Ext.1), mutated their name and  since then  the plaintiffs have been possessing the suit land by paying rent  regularly to the Government as direct tenant of the Government. Mr. Rahman, finally submits that taking rent from the plaintiff-petitioners it does not lie in the mouth of the defendant opposite party No. 1 that the suit property was vested in the Government and the plaintiffs are not in possession over the suit property.<br/> <br/><strong>11.    </strong>On the other hand, Mr. Md. Abdus Salam Mondal, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the Government by filing counter affidavit opposes the Rule. He submits that both the Courts below on due consideration of the entire materials on record rightly arrived at a finding that the plaintiff-petitioners could not prove their right, title and possession on the basis of their  so-called unregistered pattan. He further submits that both the Courts below rightly arrived at a concurrent finding that Pattan (Ext.1) was forged, collusive and illegal document which has never been acted upon and as such question of interference does not arise at all.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    I have heard the learned Advocate and the learned Deputy Attorney General at length and perused the judgments of two Courts below, deposition of witnesses and other materials on record. To appreciate the contentions of the learned Advocate and the learned Deputy Attorney General, it is necessary to scrutinize the material evidence on record  to arrive at a correct decision whether both the Courts below committed any illegality in holding that the plaintiff-petitioners having failed to prove their right, title and possession on the basis of Ext.1 (Pattan).<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    Plaintiff No. 1, Alauddin Kazi himself was examined as PW-1, who in his deposition stated that: নালিশী সম্পত্তি ভাওয়াল কোর্ট অব ওয়ার্ডস এর খাস সম্পত্তি চিল। আমি ৪/৪/১৯৩৯ তারিখে ২৬/- (ছাবিবশ) টাকা সেলামী দিয়ে নালিশী সম্পত্তি পত্তন নেই। আমি আমার নাম জারী করি। খাজনা দেই। পত্তন নামীয় খাজনার রশিদ ৪টি দাখিল করিলাম। বিগত এস, এ, জরিপের সময় এস, এ, খতিয়ানের আমার নাম সুদ্ধভাবে রেকর্ড হয়। এস, এ, পর্চার সহি মহুরী নকল দাখিল করিলাম। ৯৯২ ইং সন পর্যমত্ম খাজনা দিয়েছি। খাজনার রশিদ সমুহ দাকিল করেছি। নালিশী সমইত্ততে আমি দখলে আছি। This witness in his deposition also stated that earlier the suit land was a pond, who  by filling earth thereon  started cultivating and fishing. This witness in his cross examination  denied that the suit property has been leased out in favour of the Chandpara Shahi Moshjid. PW-2, Abdur Rahman Kazi,  stated in his deposition that the plaintiffs got the suit property by the Bhawal Court of Wards Estate by way of pattan and the suit property was mutated in their name and S.A. record was also prepared in the name of the plaintiffs. PW-3, Kazi Lehazu-ddin, stated in his deposition that: নালিশী সম্পত্তি আমার বাড়ী থেকে অনেক দুরে। আমি বাদীকে চিনি। বাদীগন নালিশী সম্পত্তি ভোগ দখল করে। নালিশী সম্পত্তিতে পুকুর করে ও কিছু জমিতে ফসল চাষ করে বাদীগন, নালিশী সম্পত্তি মসজিদ কমিটি ভোগ দখল করে না। This witness in his cross-examination denied the suggestion that Chandpara Shahi Mosjid Committee has been possessing the suit property.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    DW-1, Md. Zulfiqur Ali stated in his deposition that the suit property has been leased out in favour of Chandpara Shahi Mosjid Committee though Settlement Case No. 54/86-87. This witness also stated that pattan of the plaintiffs was forged, collusive and Bhawal Court of Wards Estate never granted pattan in favour of the plaintiffs. This witness in his cross-examination admitted that S. A. kahtian  of the suit property was prepared in the name of Alauddin Kazi and Shamsuddin Kazi (plaintiffs) being Dag No. 1481. This witness in his cross-examination also stated that: নালিশী জমি সরকারী খাস জমি হওয়ায় এটা চানপাড়া শাহী মসজিদকে বন্দোবসত্ম দেওয়া হয়েছে। উক্তরূপে এস, এ, রেকর্ড বাতিল হয়েছে। ঐ বন্দোসসেত্মর কোন কাগজ দাখিল করিণি। ইংরেজী ১৯৮৮ সনের বন্যায় নথি নষ্ট হয়। ইংরেজী ১৯৮৮ সনের বন্যায় নথি নষ্ট হবার সমর্থনে কোন কাগজ দাখিল করছি কি না তা মনে পড়ছে না।<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    On a close perusal of the evidence of PW-1, PW-2, PW-3 and DW-1 together with the Exhibits namely, (i) pattan dated 4.4.1939 (Ext.1), (ii) 5(five) rent receipts (Ext.2-2Gha), (iii) S.A. Khatian (Ext.3) and (iv) rent receipt under S.A. Khatian (Ext.4), it appears that the plaintiff-petitioners in support of their right, title and possession over the suit property adduced sufficient corroborative evidence both oral and documentary. It also appears that the defendant-opposite parties could not make the case shaky of the plaintiff-petitioners by way of cross-examination.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    Mr. Mokhlesur Rahman at the end of the day in support of his lengthy argument has referred to  some decisions reported in 2 BLC(AD) 134, 30 DLR(SC) 84, 48 DLR(AD) 160, 48 DLR(AD) 154, 43 DLR(AD) 130, Calcutta Weekly Notes (Volume 25) 165 and 35 DLR(AD) 216.<br/> <br/><strong>17.    </strong>Now, in order to appreciate the legal  aspects involved in this case, it would be useful if I consider the   cited decisions.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    In the case of Abul Bakar Siddique Vs. A.D.C. Kurigram and others reported in 48 DLR(AD) 154,  it has been held that:<br/><br/>      The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division having independently assessed the evidence and having found a case of non-consideration of material evidence on record and consequently non-reversal of material findings interfered with the finding of fact. To our mind, the revisional Court is competent to interfere in a case of non-consideration of material evidence which is specifically material for the determination of the material issue, namely, the issue of shifting of the school to the new mouza.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    In the case of Abdul Mazid Howlader and another Vs. Lahajuddin Howlader and others reported in 48 DLR(AD) 160, it has been held that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>There being a total non-consideration of all the witnesses of the pre-emptees, the learned Single Judge acted wrongly in refusing to exercise his revisional jurisdiction in a case where due to non-consideration of the material evidence on record an erroneous decision has been arrived occasionning a grave failure of justice.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    In the case of Rajkumari Baishnabi Vs. Shyama Bibi reported in Calcutta Weekly Notes ( Volume 25) 165,  it has been observed that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>Their Lordships passed the following judgment:- We are of the opinion that this appeal must be allowed. The learned District Judge has decided one question and one question only, namely, that the unregistered deed produced in the case was not admissible in evidence. On this ground he has held that the tenancy alleged to have been held by Shyama under Rajkumari has not been established. The District Judge, however, has overlooked that in this country it is possible to establish a tenancy without the production of a lease by proof of payment of rent by the tenant and acceptance of rent by the landlord.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    In the case of Bangladesh Vs. Tabarak Ali Mia and others reported in 43 DLR(AD) 130, it has  observed that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>Patni taluk had its origin on the estates of the Raja of Burdwan but has since been extended to other Zamindaris. The character of this tenure is that it is a taluk (etymologically, 'taluk' stands for some intermediate interest being derived from 'alak'= to suspend from) created by the Zaminder, to be held at a rent fixed in perpetuity by the lessee and his heirs for ever. Zaminder is the landlord, patnidar is his tenant. A patni although in form a lease, is not a mere lease-hold property. A patnidar may let out the lands in any manner conducive to his interest, provided his interest was subsisting.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    In the case of Akrab Ali and others Vs. Zahiruddin Kari and others reported in 30 DLR(SC) 81, it has been held that:<br/><br/>      According to section 103(B)(5) of The Bengal Tenancy Act every entry in a record of rights finally published shall be evidence of the matter referred to in such entry and shall be presumed to be correct until it is proved to be incorrect. The learned Judges of the High Court appear to have started with the view that the Court of appeal below was palpably wrong in presuming title in favour of the defendants from a mere entry in the records of right and that the defence having admitted title of the predecessor of the plaintiff, the plaintiff was relieved of the burden of proving the title of Aftabuddin Sarkar. Their Lordships were not correct in their view as to the effect of the entries in a finally published record of right and in relieving the plaintiff, in the face of the said entries of the burden of proving the title of Aftabuddin Sarkar. The entries in the Khatian Ext. A that Faizuddin Haji was in the occupation of the holding appertaining to the jote of Aftabuddin Sarkar on the basis of purchase for a consideration  of Rs. 50/- and that the land was fit for assessment of rent but there was no payment were not beyond the scope of the survey held under Chapter X Part 1 of the Bengal Tenancy Act, 1885.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>    In the case of Erfan Ali Vs. Joynal Abedin Mia reported in 35 DLR(AD) 216, it has been held that:<br/><br/>      The rent receipts were excluded from consideration by the lower Appellate Court taking the view that these are provisional receipts and that they carry little weight in that "any person interested in a land may pay rent to the Government Acquired Estate". This view is erroneous, for rent-receipts, though not documents of title, are important items of evidence of possession and may be used as collateral evidence of title since possession generally follows title. Again, plaintiff's name has also been recorded in the S.A. Khatian prepared in the period immedia-tely following the whole-sale state-acquisition in 1956 and all objections raised by defendant No.1 were overruled by the Revenue-officer and then by the appellate authority.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>    Thus, from all the decisions,  it is clear that a  patnidar may let out the lands in any manner conducive to his interest, provided his interest was subsisting. Rent receipts and  S.A. Khatian are evidence of possession and may be used as collateral evidence of title and a finding of fact whether concurrent or not, arrived at by the lower Court is binding on this Court, as a  Revisional Court  except in certain well-defined exceptional circumstances such as non-consideration or misreading of material evidence on record affecting the merit of the case.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>    I have already noticed that in this case, the plaintiff-petitioners in order to prove their right, title and possession in the suit property produced    so many important  documents namely, pattan dated 4.4.1939 (Ext.1), 5(five) rent receipts (Ext.2-2Gha), S.A. Khatian (Ext.3) and rent receipt under S.A. Khatian (Ext.4). The Court of appeal below by the impugned judgment affirmed the decision of the trial Court with the observation  that: পূর্বোক্ত আলোচনা ও সাক্ষ্য প্রমান পর্যালোচনামেত্ম আদালত এই অভিমতে আসে যে, নালিশী সম্পত্তি বাবদ বাদী ভাওয়াল কোর্ট অব ওয়ার্ডস ষ্টেট হইতে পত্তন গ্রহন করা এবং উক্ত পত্তনের আলোকে স্বত্ব প্রতিষ্ঠিত হওয়া এবং উক্ত স্মপত্তিতে স্বত্ববান ও দখলকার থাকার বিষয়টি বাদীপক্ষ প্রমানে সমর্থন হন নাই। সেইদিন থেকে বাদী তাহার স্বত্বের ঘোষনামুলক ডিক্রী পাইতে পারেন না। বিজ্ঞ নিমণ আদারত তদ্রম্নপ সিদ্ধান্ত প্রদান করায় আদালতের হস্তান্তর করার কোন কারন নাই্ নালিশী সম্পত্তি সম্পূর্ন অংশে বাদী পক্ষের নিরংকুশ দখল না থাকায় সুনির্দিষ্ট প্রতিকার আইনের ৪২ ধারা মতে স্বত্ব ঘোষনার মোকদ্দমা চলিতে পারে না মর্মে বিজ্ঞ নিমণ আদারত যে সিদ্ধামত্ম প্রদান করিয়াছেন তাহার সহিত অত্রাদারত একমত পোষন করেন।<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>    In the given facts and circumstances of the case and the uniform decisions of the highest Court as cited above,  I have no hesitation to hold that the above quoted finding of the  Court of appeal  below  is product of misreading and non considering the material evidence on record inasmuch as in this case the  plaintiffs had produced their kabala,  SA Khatian and rent-receipts in the trial Court to show their continuous possession but the Courts below  did not consider the same.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>    By the way,  it may be mentioned that in this case the learned Deputy Attorney General took time again and again lastly on 8.12.2011  by filing an application took time  till one week after the vacation for collecting the record of settlement case No.  54/86-87 though, he  failed to collect the same.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>    There is another aspect of the  case should also be looked into. Mr. Mokhlesur Rahman, the learned Advocate for the petitioners while elaborating his submission inviting my attention to Annexure  ‘C’ and ‘D series’ of the supplementary affidavit dated 29.11.2011  and submits that city survey khatian No. 16259,  dag No. 8219 &amp; 8222 respectively in respect of the suit property  have been prepared in the name of the petitioners and   the Appeal Case being No. 69700 of 2002 filed by the defendant-opposite parties  under section 31 of the Bengal Tenancy Act before the settlement officer was rejected with the observation that: "নালিশী জমি আর, এস, রেকর্ড তদন্তকালীন সময়ে কিভাবে অথবা কোন কাগজের ভিত্তিতে সরকারের ১ নং খতিয়ানে রেকর্ড হইয়াছে এই মর্মে প্রশ্ন করে জানতে চাওয়া হইলে আপীলকারী পক্ষ জানান যে, আর, এস, রেকর্ড কিভাবে নালিশী জমি রেকর্ড হইয়াছে তাহা তিনি জানেন না। এই মর্মে কোন কাগজপত্র দেখাইতে তিনি অপারগতা জানান। তিনি বলেন যে, যেহেতু আর, এস রেকর্ড চুড়ান্তভাবে প্রকাশিত ও গেজেট বিজ্ঞপিত্র মাধ্যমে সরকারের নিকট হস্তান্তর করা হইয়াছে, সেহেতু ইহা সরকারী খাস জমি হিসাবে গন্য হইবে। তিনি নালিশী জমি সরকারের ১নং খতিয়াণে রেকর্ড করার দাবী জানান। ......আপীলকারীপক্ষ দাবী ওেয়ক্তিক ভিত্তি না থাকায় তাহাদের নামে রেকর্ড করার দাবী বিবেচনা করা গেল না।"  And, as such at any rate judgments of both the Courts below do not deserve to be sustained.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>    To this, the learned Deputy Attorney General finds  it difficult to repel the  contention of Mr. Mokhlesur Rahman, the learned Advocate for the petitioners.<br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong>    For the reasons stated above, I am inclined to hold that both the Courts below erred in law in passing the judgments under challenge without following the correct principle relating to the appreciation of the evidence  and materials on record and the same has resulted in an error in the impugned decisions occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong>    In the result, the Rule is made absolute without any order as to costs. The impugned judgment and decree dated 9.11.2008 (decree signed on 9.11.2008) passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 5th Court, Dhaka in Title Appeal No.825 of 1999 affirming those dated 17.10.1999 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 1st Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No.16 of 1988 dismissing the suit is set aside and thus,   the suit is decreed.<br/><br/>        Let a copy of the judgment along with the lower Court's record be sent down at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

(12)</strong><br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Naraji</strong><br/><strong><em>Naraji</em></strong><strong> petition, almost without exception,</strong><strong> is filed by the informant of a case against the final report recommending release of any or all of the accused named in the first information report as a protest indicating flaws in the investigation and asking either for further investigation or judicial inquiry.<em> Naraji</em>, thus, came to be recognized by courts as a safeguard against ill-attempts directed to screening </strong><strong>offenders upon extraneous</strong><strong> considerations</strong><strong> or against an inefficient and perfunctory investigation leaving scope for the criminals to go scot-free and gradually assumed the status of a fresh complaint by consistent judicial expositions with all the attendant formalities of a complaint petition contemplated in the Code.     ...(13)</strong><br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Naraji</strong><br/><strong><em>Naraji</em></strong><strong> is not to be confused with a partisan document by reason merely of the fact that it owes its origin in the grievance of a party. It is a document </strong><strong>that works in aid of the court in its efforts</strong><strong> to ascertain the nature and </strong><strong>magnitude of the flaws, if any, in investigation</strong><strong> and suggests the next course of action in detection mechanism. <em>Naraji </em>thus <em>has</em> turned into an instrumentality of justice germane to criminal jurisprudence. Curtailing the power of the court to take notice of <em>naraji</em> cannot, therefore, be possible without significantly impairing </strong><strong>the power of a court to prevent investigation</strong> <strong>being misdirected with ulterior motive or</strong><strong> flawed by inefficiency or inexperience. . . . (14)</strong><br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Naraji</strong><br/><strong>The Ain has made the Code applicable to filing, investigation, trial and disposal of the <em>nari-o-shishu nirjatan</em> cases and as abundant caution has equipped Tribunal </strong><strong>with all the powers of the Court of Session</strong><strong> in matters of trial of offences under the </strong><strong>Ain. Nothing is there indicating exclusion</strong><strong> of <em>naraji</em> rather the  Tribunal is obviously better placed  than the Court of Session in matters of control and supervision of </strong><strong>investigation  so that it enjoys an additional</strong><strong> power to take steps for changing the investigating officer on the basis of an application, irrespective of <em>naraji</em>, or on information received from any source whatsoever.  . . . (20)</strong><br/><strong>Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain (VIII of 2000)</strong><br/><strong>Section 27</strong><br/><strong>A plain reading of the section suggests that cognizance can be taken through two procedures: one upon report submitted by ‘police’ or by ‘an authorized person’ and another upon inquiry- report submitted by the ‘Magistrate’ or ‘any other person’ assigned by the Tribunal so to do. Within the scheme of section 27 a proceedings under the Ain should ordinarily be initiated by lodging information in the police station. The second or, more appropriately, the alternative procedure sets in by default with a complaint-petition directly filed in the Tribunal subject to refusal by a police officer to accept the same. . . . (22)</strong><br/><strong>Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain (VIII of 2000)</strong><br/><strong>Section 27</strong><br/><strong>Sub-section (1) and (1Ga) of section 27 read with section 18 goes to show that the Tribunal is further equipped with power </strong><strong>more robust than that of an ordinary criminal</strong><strong> court in taking cognizance absolutely on its own satisfaction, <em>albeit</em> by assigning reason, gathered from any materials, irrespective of <em>naraji</em>, or information received in disregard of the final report submitted by police or the person authorized by the Government in this behalf. The enormously unqualified power of the Tribunal to take cognizance of offences on its own satisfaction in total disregard of everything means by necessary implication that the Tribunal enjoys power </strong><strong>to take into consideration anything including</strong> <strong>the naraji-petition for its satisfaction without</strong><strong> any formality attached to it in general law.                                                               . . . (22)</strong><br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Naraji</strong><br/><strong><em>Naraji,</em></strong><strong> in the circumstances, remains to be the most crucial document for the Tribunal to test the credibility of the inquiry-report. Strict literal interpretation of a contextually inconsistent provision and/or expression seeking to exclude <em>naraji</em> is, therefore, too ingenious to be accepted.    . . . (29)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 31</strong><br/><strong>In our jurisdiction Constitution is supreme and every piece of legislation made by Parliament must follow the parameters of the American due process principles enshrined in Art.31, in order to qualify as law as well as being enforceable by the Supreme Court. Law, therefore, cannot travel far beyond its context and afford to be arbitrary, discriminatory or unreasonable yielding absurd and illogical consequences.  When purpose of the enactment is clear strained construction may legitimately be put to any expression or phrase used inadvertently.                                                          . . . (32)</strong><br/><strong>Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain (VIII of 2000)</strong><br/><strong>Section 27(1)</strong><br/><strong>The language of clauses (1Ka) and (1Kha) must, therefore, be harmonized with the rest of the statute and be construed to include power not only co-equal with powers   provided by section 27(1) but also the Tribunal must be taken to include powers to take notice of <em>naraji</em> as well as   all other powers incidental to carrying out the purpose of the Ain.                                         . . . (32)</strong><br/><strong>Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain (VIII of 2000)</strong><br/><strong>Section 27 Clause (1ga)</strong><br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Naraji</strong><br/><strong>The controversy is set at naught by clause (1Ga) of section 27 which spelt out in no uncertain terms that notwithstanding any </strong><strong>recommendation made in the report submitted</strong><strong> either by police/authorized person or by </strong><strong>Magistrate/any other person as contemplated</strong> <strong>in sub-section (1) and clause (1Ka) respectively,</strong><strong> not sending the accused for trial, the Tribunal, if considers proper for ends of justice, may take cognizance of the offence against the accused assigning its reasons thereof.  The language of the law leaves no doubt that the Tribunal, as distinguished from the Court of Session or the Magistrate, enjoys an added statutory power to reject the investigation/ inquiry report and take cognizance on its own satisfaction. It follows, by parity of reasoning, that the Tribunal which is free to take cognizance regardless of the nature of the report is free to take into notice any information supplied under any name, <em>naraji</em> or otherwise, if the same proves to be of use in testing the veracity of the </strong><strong>report and by necessary implication enjoined</strong><strong> with power to direct a further investigation or inquiry (where practicable) regardless of how the proceedings was started, upon FIR or complaint.        . . . (33)</strong><br/><strong>Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain (VIII of 2000)</strong><br/><strong>Section 27</strong><br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Naraji</strong><br/><strong>It logically follows that Tribunal is well within its competence to entertain <em>naraji</em> leaving no room for argument that there is no scope of <em>naraji</em> petition in the scheme of section 27 of the Ain.       . . . (34)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 200 and 561A</strong><br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Naraji</strong><br/><strong>In the realm of almost unqualified power directed to achieving the object of law, <em>naraji</em> stands to lose its ordinary legal signification and is relegated merely to the status of a document supplying important information indicating flaws in the investig-ation or inquiry making the formalities in taking notice of it totally redundant. There is, therefore, no scope in the Ain, to ascribe the status of fresh complaint to <em>naraji</em>-petition.  In the same vein, examination or </strong><strong>non-examination of the informant/ complainant</strong><strong> under section 200 for taking <em>naraji</em>-petition into consideration is of no consequence.  Examination of complainant, thus, being unnecessary, non-examination under section </strong><strong>200 does not furnish any ground for quashing.</strong><br/><strong>. . . (36)</strong><br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Naraji </strong><br/><strong>An inquiry within the meaning of the Code, especially when follows a <em>naraji</em> petition,  is generally an <em>indoor </em>activity of <em>quasi</em> judicial nature conducted by a Magistrate or court that includes recording of oral evidence   adduced by a handful of witnesses, in most cases selected by the informant, in order to examine whether there is <em>prima facie</em> materials to justify cognizance which has nothing to do with visiting place of occurrence, search, </strong><strong>seizure, detection and tracking down accused,</strong><strong> arrest, interrogation, collection of  evidence on ground-level including expert opinion etc. as is done during investigation.. (39)</strong><br/><strong>Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain (VIII of 2000)</strong><br/><strong>Section 27 (1Ka)(Ka)</strong><br/><strong>“Inquiry” as contemplated under section 27(1Ka)(Ka) may fairly be construed to include spot- visit and  recording statements of witnesses at the field level before  preparing a report to be submitted in the Tribunal. Here the inquiry- officer is either a Magistrate or ‘any other person’ assigned so to do by the Tribunal. It is knowledge <em>a priori </em>that a Magistrate is not a professional investigator. So is the case with the persons generally assigned by the Tribunal to make the inquiry, such as, the local Upa-Zila </strong><strong>Chairman, Vice-Chairman (as is the case here)</strong><strong> or a Government officer.  Furthermore, it is difficult to ascribe an extended meaning to the phrase, “any other person” so as to include an officer belonging to police or any other investigating agencies for the simple reason that had the legislature, by the </strong><strong>phrase, meant to include any officer belonging</strong><strong> to any of those agencies it had no reason not to specify the name of the agency. More importantly, if it is an ‘inquiry’ with its legal </strong><strong>import as aforesaid, persons assigned matters</strong><strong> a little because of the fact that inquiry made even by a member of an investigating agency is an ‘inquiry’ not ‘investigation’ and being circumscribed by its inherent limitations is </strong><strong>incapable of making any significant difference.</strong><strong>. . . (40)</strong><br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Inquiry and investigation </strong><br/><strong>The words ‘inquiry’ and ‘investigation’ are not words meant to bear the same connota-tions in the Code as well as in the Ain. They finally remain to be distinctly </strong><strong>different in connotations to be taken recourse</strong><strong> to by the Magistrate or the Tribunal according as the nature of a particular case, they respectively sit on, permits.    . . . (41)</strong><br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Investigation </strong><br/><strong>Investigation is an independent discipline to </strong><strong>be mastered by long training and experience,</strong><strong> adequate knowledge of criminal law, law of evidence, forensic science, art of tracking down the suspects and of interrogation and priorities in collection of evidence (material, documentary and oral) including expert-</strong><strong>opinion enough to establish interlinkage between</strong><strong> the offence and the offender. Investigation may be hidden or open unbounded by territorial limits involving various scientific methods, instruments and devices to be used in order to unearth the secret behind the crime.  Investigation knows no time limit except sheer professionalism of performance and untiring efforts of the investigating officer directed to discovering the truth behind a crime, often clueless and shrouded with mystery.                                                          . . . (42)</strong><br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Investigation </strong><br/><strong>Investigation is a goal- oriented mission, like a tiger chasing a deer, not to stop short of the target and must be allowed exactly as much time as it needs in its bid to reach the target. Statutory limitation giving deadline for the report is, therefore, bound to produce abortive and distorted result to the </strong><strong>advantage of the true offenders. Investigation</strong><strong> being a process that follows its own rules must be allowed to go unhindered unless its goal is reached. What is important is not to </strong><strong>squeeze a report within a deadline but constant</strong><strong> vigilance by the supervisory authority to see whether the investigation is going in right order and in right pace and take drastic measures against the  investigating officer should any  laches, negligence or foul-play on his part  is noticed.   . . . (43)</strong><br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Investigation </strong><br/><strong>Investigation must be directed to be carried </strong><strong>out either by police or by any other specialized</strong><strong> agency where facts of a particular case requires the Tribunal so to do. A police officer is not police. Refusal by him to accept the complaint need not be construed as refusal by police. If in the peculiar facts of a case Tribunal is satisfied that nothing less than a threadbare investigation is needed for detection of the crime and the criminals it has no choice but to exercise its inherent power and send back the complaint- petition to the police station with direction to treat the same as an FIR and cause investigation to be made by any competent police officer (other than the one who refused to accept the complaint) or by an officer belonging to any other specialized investigating agency. The power to make such direction must not be limited to any stage or difference of title of the information upon which the proceedings was started, FIR or complaint precisely for the reason that justice is the <em>raison d’ệtre</em> of a court or tribunal and no law, however clear in meaning, seeking to deter the court/tribunal in passing any order for securing ends of justice can stand without being indicted. Direction may be made on receipt of the complaint-petition or even after receiving inquiry- report if the report, in the opinion of the Tribunal, suggests that the facts are not as obvious and plain as is narrated in the complaint petition and the inquiry-report is not enough to support a fruitful prosecution.         . . . (44)</strong><br/><strong>Nair-o-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain (VIII of 2000) </strong><br/><strong>Section 19(1)</strong><br/><strong>Police is duty bound to receive complaint alleging commission of cognizable offence and cannot refuse it without lawful excuse. Since all the offences under the Ain are cognizable arbitrary refusal by police to accept the complaint alleging commission of any of them amounts to misconduct. It is an absurd proposition to suppose that mere refusal by a police officer or in other words, dereliction of duty of a police officer or for that matter an authorized person may be taken to create a legal binding upon the </strong><strong>Tribunal to take recourse to inquiry-procedure</strong><strong> although, in its opinion, investigation should be directed in the peculiar facts of the case.  This is a proposition which militates against the ultimate authority of the Tribunal to take its own decision and runs contrary to the ‘last say’ doctrine.                                   . . . (45)</strong><br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Investigation </strong><br/><strong>It may not be out of place to mention here that a Magistrate or ‘any other person’ for that matter a Judge, how high soever, is not </strong><strong>an expert in investigation.

Moazzam Husain, J:</u></strong><br/>This Rule, at the instance of one of the accused,  was issued calling in question the legality  of the proceedings in Petition  (Nari-o-Shishu)  Case No.71 of 2014 u/s 7, 9(1) read with section 30 of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Ain, 2000, as amended up-to-date now pending in the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Tribunal No.1, Lalmonirhat. At the opening of the hearing  of the Rule before a Division Bench it appeared that the basic question upon which the proceedings was challenged is the question of maintainability of a <em>naraji</em> petition within the scheme of section 27 of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjaton Damon Ain, 2000. Since the question already gave rise to conflicting decisions the matter was referred to the Hon’ble Chief Justice for constituting a Full  Bench as per Rule 1 of Chapter VII of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh (High Court Division) Rules, 1973 so that the issue may be settled along with other related issues raised by the petitioner. Hon’ble Chief Justice in his turn was pleased to constitute this Bench for the purpose. </div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Back on facts, it appears that a victim of rape is the complainant. She first approached the local <em>thana</em> in order to lodge a complaint but having been refused therefrom took recourse to the second option and filed the instant complaint-petition in the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Tribunal (hereafter referred to as “the Tribunal”) No.1, Lamonirhat. In the complaint-petition she said, <em>inter alia</em>, that she was a student of Haziganj BM College. On 10.6.2014 after attending classes she made a detour to visit the house of her friend Hosne Ara. On her way back home present petitioner Anjuara took her to Lalmonirhat by persuasion and from there to an unknown house at Rangpur. Other accused including accused Bipul Chandra Barmon, the principal accused, joined them on the way. At Rangpur accused Anju (present petitioner) compelled the victim under threat to stay with accused Bipul in a room at night. As the night advanced Bipul insisted her to have sex with him but failed at the face of resistance. As the night advanced the victim got growingly tired and exhausted under persistent pressure meted out to her. Taking the advantage Bipul finally overpowered and raped her at late hours of the night. Accused Bipul thereafter stayed in the same room with her following three nights and raped her on several occasions. On 13.6.2014 Bipul went away and remained untraced. He came back on 15.6.14 and took the victim to Dhaka and stayed there in a rented house with the victim as husband and wife. The victim gradually accepted the incident as <em>fait accompli</em> but kept pressing the accused to complete the formality of marriage. As the pressure mounted accused Bipul suddenly disappeared leaving her alone in the house. On 15.8.2014 the victim was recovered by her brother from there and brought back home.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The Tribunal having received the complaint- petition sent the same to the Upa Zila Vice-Chairman to inquire and submit report. The Vice-Chairman inquired into and submitted his report against five out of the six persons against whom, according to him, a <em>prima facie</em> case was found established. The sixth one is the petitioner whose release from the case was recommended. Soon thereafter a <em>naraji</em> petition was filed by the complainant. Learned Judge having heard the parties and perusing the records found a <em>prima facie</em> case against the petitioner also. He accordingly rejected the recommendation for release and   took cognizance of offence against all the six accused persons named in the complaint petition including this petitioner. Learned Judge while taking cognizance against all the accused made the following observations:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">   ু<strong>নথি পর্যালোচনায় ও সার্বিক বিবেচনায় দেখা যায় যে তদমত্ম প্রতিবেদনে মামলার বাদিণীর অভিযোগের বাসত্মব প্রতিফলন ঘটে নাই। এইর্রদ অবস্থায় অত্র ট্রাইবুনালের নিকট সমেত্মাসজনক প্রতীয়মান না হওয়ায় তদমত্মকারী কর্মকর্তা কর্তৃক দাখিলী  আসামী আনজুয়ারাকে মামলার দায় হইতে অব্যহতির  সুপারিশ সম্বলিত অংশটুকু অগ্রাহ্য করা হইল। ’’</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The petitioner being the person grossly affected by the order obtained this Rule. The petitioner, in her bid to get the proceedings quashed raised basically three contentions. First<strong>,</strong> there is no scope for <em>naraji</em> petition within the scheme of section 27 of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjaton Damon Ain, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as <strong>“</strong>the Ain”), therefore,  the learned Judge, in taking cognizance of the offence on <em>naraji</em> petition committed an error of law occasioning failure of justice. Second, <em>naraji</em> petition is, for all practical purposes, a fresh complaint, therefore, taking cognizance without examining the complainant u/s 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as “the Code”) is illegal.  Third<strong>,</strong> had there been scope under clause (1Ka) of section 27(1) for investigation by police or any other specialized agencies having knowledge and experience of investigation truth behind the allegation could have been discovered on sufficient materials and the learned judge would have been satisfied about the innocence of the petitioner and finally, the complaint petition does not disclose any offence, hence, initiation and continuation of the proceeding is nothing but an abuse of the process of court.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Before we embark upon the merit of the contentions it would be apt to turn back on three of the series of decisions handed down by different Benches of this Division touching upon various questions-all, someway or other, relatable to  <em>naraji</em>.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In <strong><em>Abdul Halim (Md) v State</em></strong>, 60 DLR 393, the victim lodged an information with the local police station  alleging commission of rape. After investigation police submitted ‘final report’ (Referred to as such in the Police Regulations Bengal, 1943, when the investigation officer submits report recommending release of any or all of the accused having found no <em>prima facie</em> case justifying a sent-up for trial ). The informant filed a <em>naraji</em> petition against the final report. Learned Judge of the Tribunal accepted the <em>naraji</em> petition and took cognizance of the offence. Trial was held and the accused was found guilty of the offence and accordingly sentenced to suffer imprisonment. In appeal no question of legality as to cognizance taken on <em>naraji</em> was directly raised. A Division Bench of this Division while deciding the appeal in the positive did not see anything wrong in <em>naraji</em> petition filed in a Nari-o-Shishu Case rather explained the position of final report and <em>naraji</em> petition by reference to a number of cases (mostly under  the Penal Code decided in the context of the Code of Criminal Procedure) and held that <u>‘on receipt of <em>naraji</em> petition the Tribunal may take cognizance of the offence if it is found reasonable and proper or direct further investigation.</u>  (<em>Underlines are mine</em>)</li><li style="text-align:justify">Next comes the case of <strong><em>Ruma Khatun v Md. Abdun Noor</em></strong> (unreported), Cr. Appeal No. 7782 of 2011, a case of rape. The victim having failed to persuade the local <em>thana</em> to accept her complaint filed a petition of complaint in the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjaton Damon Tribunal. The Tribunal sent the petition back to the police station for investigation. The investigation yielded negative report recommending release of the accused. The report was responded by a <em>naraji</em> petition. Upon the <em>naraji</em> petition further investigation  was directed. Further inquiry yielded the same result recommending release of the accused.  Naraji petition was also filed against the second final report.  This time the Tribunal rejected the <em>naraji</em> petition and accepted the final report consequently the accused was discharged. <u>A Division Bench of this Division, while disposing of the appeal that was preferred by the complainant, took no exception of <em>naraji</em> petition rather in view of the facts disclosed in the <em>naraji</em> petition was satisfied about existence of a <em>prima facie</em> case to be tried and held  that the Tribunal rejected the <em>naraji</em> petition mechanically on the report tainted with bias and  in total disregard of the facts that there were enough materials on records, namely, medical report and affidavits sworn by the witnesses in support of the case</u>. (<em>Underlines are mine</em>.)</li><li style="text-align:justify">In both the cases courts appear to have dealt with naraji-petitions in a manner as if the same were filed in a case under the Penal Code leaving an impression that, so far <em>naraji</em> petition is concerned, there is no difference between cases under the Penal Code and under a special law like Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Ain.  <em>Naraji</em>, in <em>nari-o-shishu</em> cases, has thus derived indirect approval in almost all the cases decided by different Benches of this Court as the question of maintainability of <em>naraji</em> never came up directly as an issue in the context of the Ain, as it did, in the case of Hafizur Rahman (<em>infra</em>).</li><li style="text-align:justify">In <strong><em>Hafizur Rahman v State</em></strong>, (unreported), Cr. Miscellaneous Case No.27249 of 2013, the victim girl approached the local police station with an allegation of rape against the accused. The Officer-in-Charge refused to record a case on the complaint. <u>The Tribunal sent the complaint-petition  back  to police station with a direction to treat the same as first information report and investigate</u>. Police after investigation submitted final report recommending action against the alleged victim under section 17 of the Ain. This was followed by a <em>naraji</em> petition filed by the informant. In this case, amongst others, the question that came to the fore is the question of maintainability of <em>naraji</em> petition within the scheme of section 27 of the Ain.  A Division Bench of this court upon a comprehensive discussion took the view that in cases initiated upon complaint <u>Tribunal is not empowered to take cognizance upon <em>naraji</em> petition which being redundant in the context of the law.</u> The  Court proceeded further to hold that <u>question of examination of the complainant does not arise nor the Tribunal is empowered to send the complaint to police for inquiry and in that view the report submitted by police is no report within the meaning of section 27(1Ka) (Ka) of the Ain</u>. No cognizance, therefore, can lawfully be taken on such report. (<em>Underlines are mine</em>).</li><li style="text-align:justify">The cast-iron bar on the competence of the Tribunal to entertain <em>naraji</em> petition and of sending complaint petition to the police station with direction to record a case as put in   <em>Hafizur Rahman </em>has virtually denuded the Tribunal of a time-honored practice recognized by  the courts of this sub-continent as a mechanism to cure an otherwise flawed investigation and curtailed the inherent discretion of the Tribunal, as a court, to send the complaint-petition to police station for recording a regular case, should necessity arise. At the same time the judgment not being comprehensively focused on the total scheme of section 27 virtually allowed  many other questions, often raised, specially touching upon power of the Tribunal in proceedings initiated on information given to the police station and in proceedings  initiated on complaint, <em>vis-à-vis, </em>scope of <em>naraji</em> in the scheme of section 27, to remain unanswered. Such as, <strong>a)</strong>  if cognizance is taken on the report contemplated under sub-section (1) of section 27  is <em>naraji</em> maintainable,  <strong>b)</strong> is the Tribunal competent to reject the report as aforesaid  and direct further investigation or,  where expedient,  judicial inquiry,  <strong>c) </strong>so far as the power of the Tribunal is concerned,  is there any difference between the proceedings started on <strong>Awf‡hvM</strong> (referred to hereinafter as “FIR”) as contemplated under  sub-section (1) and the one started on <strong>Awf‡hvM</strong>  (shortly, “complaint”) contemplated under clause (1Ka) of sub-section (1), <strong>d)</strong> is  the Tribunal  powerless  in matters of sending  back the complaint   to the police station even, in its  opinion,  an investigation should be made<strong> e) </strong>in a case started upon complaint,  is the Tribunal bound to be confined to  ‘inquiry-report’  and the ‘complaint’  for taking cognizance and devoid of power to take notice of <em>naraji</em>. </li><li style="text-align:justify">The Ain is silent about the term ‘<em>naraji’</em>.  So is the case with the Code. But <em>naraji</em> is there to play its role as an important tool at the hands of the courts to test the <em>bona fide</em> of the police investigation and take necessary correctional measures in order that the true offenders cannot escape trial.</li><li style="text-align:justify">If I am not far wrong, <em>naraji</em> is largely a sub-continental phenomenon which owes its origin to the ever declining public confidence in police investigation and  found favour with the courts as a document specially focused on the flaws in investigation indicating possible ways to set things right. </li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>Naraji</em> petition, almost without exception, is filed by the informant of a case against the final report recommending release of any or all of the accused named in the first information report as a protest indicating flaws in the investigation and asking either for further investigation or judicial inquiry. In our socio-economic reality, lack of professionalism and susceptibility of the investigating officer to undue influence seems as much likely as to make it difficult for the courts to ignore the objection raised by the informant and rely on the credibility it ideally deserves.  <em>Naraji</em>, thus, came to be recognized by courts as a safeguard against ill-attempts directed to screening offenders upon extraneous considerations or against an inefficient and perfunctory investigation leaving scope for the criminals to go scot-free and gradually assumed the status of a fresh complaint by consistent judicial expositions with all the attendant formalities of a complaint petition contemplated in the Code. </li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>Naraji</em> is not to be confused with a partisan document by reason merely of the fact that it owes its origin in the grievance of a party. It is a document that works in aid of the court in its efforts to ascertain the nature and magnitude of the flaws, if any, in investigation and suggests the next course of action in detection mechanism. <em>Naraji </em>thus <em>has</em> turned into an instrumentality of justice germane to criminal jurisprudence. Curtailing the power of the court to take notice of <em>naraji</em> cannot, therefore, be possible without significantly impairing the power of a court to prevent investigation being misdirected with ulterior motive or flawed by inefficiency or inexperience. </li><li style="text-align:justify">With the jurisprudence in mind, let us see whether section 27 of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjaton Damon Ain, 2000, (as amended upto date) can be construed to exclude <em>naraji</em> from its scheme as is sought to be canvassed on behalf of the petitioner. But before we turn to the scheme, we need to have a look through  the preamble of the Ain and two other sections having direct bearing upon the issue.  </li><li style="text-align:justify">The preamble reads as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>  যেহেতু নারী ও শিশু নির্যাতনমূলক অপরাধসমূহ কঠোরভাবে দমনের উদ্দেশ্যে প্রয়োজনীয় বিধান প্রণয়ন করা সমীচীন ও প্রয়োজনীয়;</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify"><u>Section 18 of the Ain says</u>:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>১৮।  অপরাধের তদন্ত। (১) ফৌজদারি কার্যবিধিতে ভিন্নতর যাহা কিছুই থাকুক না কেন, এই আইনের অধীন কোন অপরাধের তদন্ত-</strong><br/><strong>(ক) অভিযুক্ত ব্যক্তি অপরাধ সংঘটনের সময়ে হাতেনাতে পুলিশ কর্তৃক ধৃত হইলে বা অন্য কোন ব্যক্তি কর্তৃক ধৃত হইয়া পুলিশের নিকট সোপর্দ হইলে, তাহার ধৃত হইবার তারিখ হইতে পরবর্তী পনের কার্য দিবসের মধ্যে সম্পন্ন করিতে হইবে;

The Ain is in the sense a mixed legislation sought to be made as far as possible self-contained.  The preamble of the Ain suggests that the   law was enacted in order to effectively curb the crimes against women and children.  Under the enabling provisions of section 18(8) the Tribunal, <em>albeit</em> after examination of witnesses, may direct the controlling authority of the investigating officer to take necessary action against him, if it is satisfied that he, with intent to shield any offender, refrained from collecting evidence required to be collected or willfully omitted to examine any important witness. Sub-section (9) of the section empowers the Tribunal to issue direction to change the investigating officer and appoint a new one in his place if it finds expedient so to do <u>‘on the basis of an application’</u> or <u>‘any other information received’</u> from any source whatsoever.   Subject to anything   to the contrary appearing in the Ain section 25 makes the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure applicable to filing, investigation, trial and disposal of cases under the Ain. Under the section Tribunal is deemed to be a Court of Session and will have all powers of a Court of Session in matters of trial of any offence under the Ain. (<em>Underlines are mine</em>).</li><li style="text-align:justify">The aforesaid two sections read with the preamble and limitation clauses of the Ain  makes it amply clear that the legislature while making the law has taken adequate care to devise a more effective mechanism for detection of criminals responsible for commission of offences against women and children and ensure punishment of the offenders through speedier investigation and trial.  Furthermore, the Ain has made the Code applicable to filing, investigation, trial and disposal of the <em>nari-o-shishu nirjatan</em> cases and as abundant caution has equipped Tribunal with all the powers of the Court of Session in matters of trial of offences under the Ain. Nothing is there indicating exclusion of <em>naraji</em> rather the  Tribunal is obviously better placed  than the Court of Session in matters of control and supervision of investigation  so that it enjoys an additional power to take steps for changing the investigating officer on the basis of an application, irrespective of <em>naraji</em>, or on information received from any source whatsoever.  </li><li style="text-align:justify">Down to section 27, the centerline of the controversy.

Within the scheme of section 27 a proceedings under the Ain should ordinarily be initiated by lodging information in the police station. The second or, more appropriately, the alternative procedure sets in by default with a complaint-petition directly filed in the Tribunal subject to refusal by a police officer to accept the same. Sub-section (1), providing the first procedure, read with section 25 suggests that the Tribunal has been clothed with power wide enough to cover all the power of a Magistrate and of the Sessions judge rolled together in ignoring investigation-report with concomitant power to entertain <em>naraji</em> and sending back the case for further investigation or, (where practicable)  judicial inquiry. Sub-section (1) and (1Ga) of section 27 read with section 18 goes to show that the Tribunal is further equipped with power more robust than that of an ordinary criminal court in taking cognizance absolutely on its own satisfaction, <em>albeit</em> by assigning reason, gathered from any materials, irrespective of <em>naraji</em>, or information received in disregard of the final report submitted by police or the person authorized by the Government in this behalf. The enormously unqualified power of the Tribunal to take cognizance of offences on its own satisfaction in total disregard of everything means by necessary implication that the Tribunal enjoys power to take into consideration anything including the naraji-petition for its satisfaction without any formality attached to it in general law.</li><li style="text-align:justify">While draftsmanship went halfway through well enough in dressing-up the Tribunal with powers in keeping with legislative policy to effectively suppress the ever increasing offences against women and children the drafters suddenly  lapsed  into contextual oblivion and embarked upon a drastic cut-back on power  depriving  the Tribunal of its important armory  required for detection of crime and the criminals : a new segment of provisions including  clauses (1Ka) to (1Kha) were  engrafted in section 27  introducing procedure of cognizance to be taken on report submitted by a Magistrate or any other person assigned by the Tribunal so to do, on materials collected through ‘inquiry’ apparently leaving no scope for the Tribunal to make a direction for ‘investigation’ by police or other specialized investigating agencies, even in the peculiar facts of the case, the Tribunal is of the opinion that nothing less than an investigation is enough to discover the truth behind the offence. This paradigm shift  taken through semantically   incoherent  provisions   has practically given rise to two types of prosecutions in similar cases: one equipped with adequate materials collected through investigation conducted by professional investigators leaving the other only with a report submitted by a Magistrate or any other person assigned by the Tribunal, almost without any exception,  prepared on statements made by a handful of witnesses and the complaint, that too, if the report does support the allegations made in the complaint. In any case, if inquiry-report does not support the allegations made in the complaint the Tribunal is left with only complaint, nothing else as prosecution materials upon which trial may be held -an occasion in which success of prosecution may hardly, if ever, be expected. The textual shift or error fairly attributable to inept draftsmanship in effect divided the victims into clear two classes: fortunate and unfortunate. The victim whose case is accepted by police is fortunate as the trial, if any, would be held on enough materials collected through investigation whereas the one whose complaint was not accepted by police would have to depend on prosecution-materials at best comprising of statements of few witnesses recorded by Magistrate<u>/</u> any other person and the complaint-petition, <em>a</em> <em>fortiorari<u>,</u></em> if the report so submitted lends support to the complaint-version<strong>.</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify">Save as the exception made in clauses (1Ka) and (1Kha) of sub-section (1) of section 27  the phraseologies regained its contextual upbeat just from the next section, namely, section 28, which says, <em>inter alia</em>: ‘any party aggrieved  by an order, judgment or sentence passed by the Tribunal  may prefer an appeal in the High Court Division against the order, judgment or sentence adversely affecting him or her   which by its plain meaning suggests that the Ain, unlike the Code, did not limit  the right to  appeal only to the formal parties of the case instead has widened the same to the extent of persons directly affected by the order passed or any decision taken by the Tribunal exactly in keeping with the overriding power otherwise vested in the Tribunal.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The reason for sudden exclusion of investigation and drastic curtailment of power  of the Tribunal made by clauses (1Ka) and (1Kha) is nothing but refusal of ‘a police officer’ or an authorized person to receive the complaint alleging cognizable offences (all offences under the Ain are cognizable) where such refusal by police, without lawful excuse, is itself a  misconduct. The apparent ineptitude of the drafters in harmonizing the provisions with the context even with sub-section (1) of section 27 has not only stood in contrast with the legislative intent but also begged the question mooted here and many more crowding the courts with avoidable litigations. We think it apt to carve out the exclusionary clauses  from section 27 (already quoted) and reproduce here once again for a ready glance.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(১ক) কোন অভিযোগকারী উপ-ধারা (১)-এর অধীন <u>কোন পুলিশ কর্মকর্তাকে বা ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তিকে কোন অপরাধের অভিযোগ গ্রহণ করিবার জন্য অনুরোধ করিয়া ব্যর্থ হইয়াছেন মর্মে হলফনামা সহকারে ট্রাইব্যুনালের নিকট অভিযোগ দাখিল করিলে</u> ট্রাইব্যুনাল অভিযোগকারীকে পরীক্ষা করিয়া-</strong><br/><strong>(ক) সন্তুষ্ট হইলে <u>অভিযোগটি অনুসন্ধানের (রহয়ঁরৎু) জন্য কোন ম্যাজিস্ট্রেট কিংবা অন্য কোন ব্যক্তিকে নির্দেশ প্রদান করিবেন এবং অনুসন্ধানের জন্য নির্দেশপ্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তি অভিযোগটি অনুসন্ধান করিয়া সাত কার্য দিবসের মধ্যে ট্রাইব্যুনালের নিকট রিপোর্ট প্রদান করিবেন;</u></strong><br/><strong>(খ) সন্তুষ্ট না হইলে অভিযোগটি সরাসরি নাকচ করিবেন।</strong><br/><strong>(১খ) উপ-ধারা (১ক) এর অধীন রিপোর্ট প্রাপ্তির পর কোন ট্রাইব্যুনাল যদি এই মর্মে সন্তুষ্ট হয় যে,</strong><br/><strong>(ক) <u>অভিযোগকারী উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন কোন পুলিশ কর্মকর্তাকে বা ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত ব্যওিুকে কোন অপরাধের  অভিযোগ গ্রহণ করিবার জন্য অনুরোধ করিয়া ব্যর্থ হইয়াছেন এবং অভিযোগের সমর্থনে প্রাথমিক সাক্ষ্য প্রমাণ আছে সেই ক্ষেত্রে  ট্রাইব্যুনাল উওু রিপোর্ট ও অভিযোগের ভিত্তিতে অপরাধটি বিচারার্থ গ্রহণ করিবেন;</u></strong><br/><strong>(খ) অভিযোগকারী উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন কোন পুলিশ কর্মকর্তাকে বা ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত ব্যওিুকে কোন অপরাধের অভিযোগ গ্রহণ করিবার জন্য অনুরোধ করিয়া ব্যর্থ হইয়াছেন মর্মে প্রমাণ পাওয়া যায় নাই কিংবা অভিযোগের সমর্থনে কোন প্রাথমিক সাক্ষ্য প্রমাণ পাওয়া যায় নাই সেই ক্ষেত্রে ট্রাইব্যুনাল অভিযোগটি নাকচ করিবেন;</strong><br/><strong>(<em>Underlines are mine)</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">If we take a bit of pains in reading through the provisions particularly of  sub-clauses (Ka) of both the clauses (1Ka) and (1Kha) of sub-section (1) we notice a legal obligation created for the Tribunal to take recourse to ‘inquiry’ for collection of evidence without leaving option for investigation to put in place,  in case it is needed. This means the Tribunal, which was supposed to be fortified by power more robust than usual, is relegated to a position weaker than that of a Magistrate who, in the circumstances, can direct the police to treat the complaint as first information report and investigate. The proposition upon which the   Tribunal’s discretion exercised <em>ex debito justiciae </em>is curtailed stands sharply opposed to criminal jurisprudence. Secondly, sub-clause (Ka) of clause (1Ka) and sub-clause (Ka) of clause (1Kha) read together may fairly be taken to mean that the Tribunal is confined to the report submitted by a Magistrate or any other person in taking cognizance and holding trial on the basis of aforesaid two documents. It is totally unclear how on earth a clueless, secret or mysterious crime which needs in-depth investigation by professional investigator or an specialized agency for detection can be detected by a Magistrate, more so, through ‘inquiry’ within the meaning of the Code and for that matter how the Tribunal, meant to be instrumental to curbing dreadful, organized and sometimes high-tech crimes against women and children, will proceed with trial depending on the meager  materials, if any,  that can be collected within the limit  of ‘inquiry’ by a Magistrate or any other lay person as indicated in the law. </li><li style="text-align:justify">The apparent power  imbalance between the  two segments of section 27 created by textual shift has made room, amongst others,  for  argument that in the scheme of section 27, at least so far as it relates to the alternative procedure, there is no scope for <em>naraji</em>.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The Ain being a social defense legislation (as the similar statutes are often so called) the Tribunal created under it is designed to effectively curb the growing crimes against women and children by ensuring flawless investigation or (where practicable) inquiry and speedy trial. No contextually defiant and discordant phrases, expressions and terminologies found place in the law, however clear in meaning, cannot be put to strict literal construction divorced from context, without betraying the cause of the legislation. It is precisely for the reason, sub-clauses (Ka) of both clauses (1Ka) and (1Kha) need be put to strained construction so as to be synchronized with the rest of the statute for that matter the purpose of the  Ain. Any otherwise a number of absurd and illogical consequences is bound to follow.  <strong>Fi</strong>r<strong>st, </strong>if the report is in the negative the Tribunal would be left with no materials except the complaint to decide the fate of the case. Thus a hardened criminal committing the offence alleged may find an easy exit to walk away from punishment or even trial. <strong>Second</strong>, making the Tribunal confined to two documents only would invariably enhance the importance of the report and thereby render the inquiry more susceptible to undue influence often difficult to ward off resulting in miscarriage of justice.  <strong>Third</strong>, Tribunal’s power as a court to circumvent the vices of inquiry with the help of other materials, like <em>naraji</em>, or any information received would be significantly impaired for no good reasons. <strong>Finally</strong>, and most importantly, the opinion of the Tribunal would be subjected to the opinion of the inquiry- officer if the Tribunal is bound down to the inquiry-report-a proposition unknown to criminal jurisprudence.   </li><li style="text-align:justify">Furthermore, in the alternative procedure the proceedings is basically dependant on ‘inquiry’ as against ‘investigation’ where there is no arrest, interrogation,  police dossier, case diary, <em>alamats</em>, expert opinion, inquest, post-mortem reports etc. <em>Naraji,</em> in the circumstances, remains to be the most crucial document for the Tribunal to test the credibility of the inquiry-report. Strict literal interpretation of a contextually inconsistent provision and/or expression seeking to exclude <em>naraji</em> is, therefore, too ingenious to be accepted.</li><li style="text-align:justify">One of the basic principles of common law is, law should serve the public interest. By the same strain, Parliament, as a body representing the people, is presumed not to intend absurd or illogical result from the applications of its enactments. Consequently, interpretation of statute finally turns on discovery of the intention of legislature.  In this juncture I might well borrow the words of Fancis Bennion in <strong><em>Understanding Common Law Legislation: Drafting &amp; Interpretation</em></strong><em> (First Indian Reprint, 2004, Page 39-41):</em> ‘The historic purpose of statutory interpretation is to arrive at the presumed intention of the legislators in promulgating the enactment… The so-called literal rule of interpretation nowadays dissolves into a rule that the text is the primary indication of legislative intention.. .There are occasions when, as Baron Parke said, the language of the legislature must be modified to avoid inconsistency with its intention…There are four reasons which justify stretching the literal meaning 1) where consequences of applying a literal construction are so obviously undesirable that Parliament cannot really have intended them 2) an error in the text which falsifies Parliament’s intention 3) a repugnance between the words of the enactment and those of some other relevant enactments and 4) changes in external circumstances since the enactment was originally drafted.’ </li><li style="text-align:justify">Decisions of the superior courts of the common law world including our sub-continent reflecting the aforesaid principles abound the pages of law reports. The following are but few: </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In <strong><em>Attorney General for Canada v Hallet &amp;Carey Ltd</em></strong>. [1952] AC 427, it is held that- ‘Of all the rules of interpretation, the paramount rule remains, laws should be construed to carry out the intention of legislature,’ and where in the ordinary grammatical meaning of the words legislative intent is missing it must be construed by reference to the context of the whole Act.  In the words of Francis Bennion occurring in ‘<em>Understanding Common Law Legislation</em>’ (<em>supra</em>, page 50):<br/><em>‘Where the literal meaning of the enactment goes narrower than the object of the legislator, the court may need to apply rectifying construction widening that meaning. Nowadays it is regarded as not in accordance with legal policy to allow a drafter’s ineptitude to prevent justice (sic) being done and the legislator’s intention implemented’ </em><br/>         In<em> <strong>SA Haroon v Collector of Customs, </strong></em>11 DLR (SC) 200, Pakistan Supreme Court held:<br/><em>“All rules of interpretation have been devised as aids to the discovery of the legislative intents behind an enactment. Where the words are plain and unambiguous, that intent can best be judged by giving full effect to the ordinary grammatical meaning of those words. But when this is not the case an attempt should be made to discover the true intent by considering the relevant provisions in the context of the whole Act in which it appears and by having regard to the circumstances in which the enactment came to be passed. The previous state of law, the mischief sought to be suppressed and the new remedy provided are relevant factors to be given due consideration</em>”<br/>         In a relatively recent case, <strong><em>K Anbazhagan v Superintendent of Police</em></strong><em>, AIR 2004 SC 524,</em> Indian Supreme Court observed:<br/><em>“Every law is designed to further the ends of justice and not to frustrate it in technicalities. The court should construe a statute to advance the cause of the statute not to defeat it.”</em></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Apart from what is said above, strict literalism, one of the principles of statutory interpretation deeply rooted into the parliamentary supremacy in England, is difficult to be fitted into our constitutional dispensation, even though the language of law is clear beyond doubt but produces absurd and illogical result.   Here in our jurisdiction Constitution is supreme and every piece of legislation made by Parliament must follow the parameters of the American due process principles enshrined in Art.31, in order to qualify as law as well as being enforceable by the Supreme Court.   Law, therefore, cannot travel far beyond its context and afford to be arbitrary, discriminatory or unreasonable yielding absurd and illogical consequences.  When purpose of the enactment is clear strained construction may legitimately be put to any expression or phrase used inadvertently. It is held in <strong><em>Sutherland Publishing Co. v Caxton</em></strong> <strong><em>Publishing Co</em></strong><em>. [1938] ch 174,</em> that‘- ‘ Where the purpose of an enactment is clear, it is often legitimate, to put a strained interpretation upon some words which have been inadvertently used’.  Reverting to Bennion: “ The truth is that, sometimes the argument against a literal construction are so compelling that even though the words are not, within the rules of language, capable of another meaning they must be given one”. [<strong><em>Understanding Common Law Legislation, </em></strong><em>supra p 43</em>].  Since the enactments in question apparently go narrower than the purpose of the law we have no hesitation to reject the contentions built upon strict literalism in interpretation totally isolated from the context. The language of clauses (1Ka) and (1Kha) must, therefore, be harmonized with the rest of the statute and be construed to include power not only co-equal with powers   provided by section 27(1) but also the Tribunal must be taken to include powers to take notice of <em>naraji</em> as well as   all other powers incidental to carrying out the purpose of the Ain.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Be that as it may, the controversy is set at naught by clause (1Ga) of section 27 which spelt out in no uncertain terms that notwithstanding any recommendation made in the report submitted either by police/authorized person or by Magistrate/any other person   as contemplated in sub-section (1) and clause (1Ka) respectively, not sending the accused for trial, the Tribunal, if considers proper for ends of justice, may take cognizance of the offence against the accused assigning its reasons thereof.  The language of the law leaves no doubt that the Tribunal, as distinguished from the Court of Session or the Magistrate, enjoys an added statutory power to reject the investigation/ inquiry report and take cognizance on its own satisfaction.  It follows, by parity of reasoning, that the Tribunal which is free to take cognizance regardless of the nature of the report is free to take into notice any information supplied under any name, <em>naraji</em> or otherwise, if the same proves to be of use in testing the veracity of the report and by necessary implication enjoined with power to direct a further investigation or inquiry (where practicable) regardless of how the proceedings was started, upon FIR or complaint.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Viewed in the light of expositions made hereinabove, it logically follows that Tribunal is well within its competence to entertain <em>naraji</em> leaving no room for argument that there is no scope of <em>naraji</em> petition in the scheme of section 27 of the Ain.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Now two different but closely interrelated questions that fall to be addressed, that is, whether <em>naraji</em> is to be treated as a fresh complaint and if so whether the complainant is required to be examined u/s 200 of the Code when it is filed in a case under Nari-o-Shishu Nirjaton Damon Ain.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The answer is not very far to seek. It is implicit in the language of sub-section (1Ga) of section 27 of the Ain. As we have already stated, the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjaton Damon Ain, 2000, is a special and stringent legislation made with intent to detect the persons alleged to have committed crimes against women and/or children and to suitably punish them   through speedier investigation, inquiry and trial. With the end in view the Ain, unlike the Code, has taken care to equip  the Tribunal, as far as possible,  with unqualified power to take cognizance of offences on its own satisfaction gathered from any materials (<em>naraji</em> or otherwise) regardless of what is said in the report. In the realm of almost unqualified power directed to achieving the object of law, <em>naraji</em> stands to lose its ordinary legal signification and is relegated merely to the status of a document supplying important information indicating flaws in the investigation or inquiry making the formalities in taking notice of it totally redundant. There is, therefore, no scope in the Ain, to ascribe the status of fresh complaint to <em>naraji</em>-petition.  In the same vein, examination or non-examination of the informant/complainant under section 200 for taking <em>naraji</em>-petition into consideration is of no consequence. Examination of complainant, thus, being unnecessary, non-examination under section 200 does not furnish any ground for quashing.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The contention finally raised is whether section 27(1Ka) of the Ain takes away power of the Tribunal to send back the petition of complaint  to the police station, for recording a regular case and proceed with investigation. The issue incidentally came up and already decided down the line, however, without any special reference to the question pointedly raised. Mr. Raquibul Haque, learned Advocate, tried to argue by reference to the special wordings of  section 27(1Ka), that the section puts a clear bar on the Tribunal’s power to send back the petition to the police, as according to him, fair investigation cannot be expected from an agency that refused to accept the complaint as a case.  He sought to lend support from the case of <strong><em>Sirajul Islam v State </em></strong>reported in 17 BLC 740.</li><li style="text-align:justify">No doubt the point raised demands independent treatment in view of its importance. Nevertheless, before we go for addressing the contention we need to dwell in the concept of ‘inquiry’ and ‘investigation’ at a certain length. </li><li style="text-align:justify">The Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Ain, 2000, does not define any of the terms. Naturally, the pre-existing law i.e., the Code of Criminal Procedure, will come into play in filling up the gap as per settled principles of interpretation. So far as the word’ investigation’ occurring in the Ain is concerned, the Code will apply specially by virtue of section 25 of the Ain.  Section 4(k) of the Code describes ‘inquiry’ as one- ‘<em>that includes</em> <em>every inquiry other than a trial conducted under the Code by a Magistrate or Court.’ </em> Section 4(l) describes ‘investigation’ as one<strong>-‘</strong><em>that</em> <em>includes all the proceedings under the Code for the collection of evidence conducted by a police officer or by any person (other than a Magistrate) who is authorized by Magistrate in this behalf</em>. Since the meaning of the words ‘inquiry’ and ‘investigation’ appearing in the Ain borrow their meaning from the Code there is no difference of meaning of those words occurring in the Code and in the Ain. Nevertheless, the word ‘inquiry’ appearing in section 27(1Ka) (Ka), in view of its special wordings, seems to differ, if at all, in degree from ‘inquiry’ within the scheme of the Code. An inquiry within the meaning of the Code, especially when follows a <em>naraji</em> petition, is generally an <em>indoor </em>activity of <em>quasi</em> judicial nature conducted by a Magistrate or court that includes recording of oral evidence adduced by a handful of witnesses, in most cases selected by the informant, in order to examine whether there is <em>prima facie</em> materials to justify   cognizance which has nothing to do with visiting place of occurrence, search, seizure, detection and tracking down accused, arrest, interrogation, collection of evidence on ground-level including expert opinion etc. as is done during investigation.</li><li style="text-align:justify">On the other hand, “inquiry” as contemplated under section 27(1Ka)(Ka) may fairly be construed to include spot- visit and  recording statements of  witnesses at the field level  before  preparing a report to be submitted in the Tribunal. Here the inquiry- officer is either a Magistrate or ‘any other person’ assigned so to do by the Tribunal. It is knowledge <em>a priori </em>that a Magistrate is not a professional investigator. So is the case with the persons generally assigned by the Tribunal to make the inquiry, such as, the local Upa-Zila Chairman, Vice-Chairman (as is the case here) or a Government officer<strong>.  </strong>Furthermore, it is difficult to ascribe an extended meaning to the phrase, “any other person” so as to include an officer belonging to police or any other investigating agencies for the simple reason that had the legislature, by the phrase, meant to include any officer belonging to any of those agencies it had no reason not to specify the name of the agency. More importantly, if it is an ‘inquiry’ with its legal import as aforesaid, persons assigned matters a little because of the fact that inquiry made even by a member of an investigating agency is an ‘inquiry’ not ‘investigation’ and being circumscribed by its inherent limitations is incapable of making any significant difference.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It is, thus, clear that the words ‘inquiry’ and ‘investigation’ are not words meant to bear the same connotations in the Code as well as in the Ain. They finally remain to be distinctly different in connotations to be taken recourse to   by the Magistrate or the Tribunal according as the nature of a particular case, they respectively sit on, permits.  </li><li style="text-align:justify">As is suggested by its definition read with chapter XIV of the Code investigation is an independent discipline to be mastered by long training and experience, adequate knowledge of criminal law, law of evidence, forensic science, art of tracking down the suspects and of    interrogation and priorities in collection of evidence (material, documentary and oral) including expert-opinion enough to establish interlinkage between the offence and the offender. Investigation may be hidden or open unbounded by territorial limits involving various scientific methods, instruments and devices to be used in order to unearth the secret behind the crime.  Investigation knows no time limit except sheer professionalism of performance and untiring efforts of the investigating officer directed to discovering the truth behind a crime, often clueless and shrouded with mystery.  With the progress of science and technology crimes are also gaining newer and newer dimensions. Dreadful offences against women and children, including killing and grievous hurt throwing acid or other corrosive substance are being regularly recorded.  Cases of rape and gang-rape have risen to an epidemic scale. Routine rape over months under constant threat of posting nude images of young girls in the website often resulting in suicide committed by the victims has become a regular phenomenon. Women and children trafficking is now a subject of gang operation having international network. Extra-marital conception of unmarried girls, question of paternity of the baby and identification of the real criminal have posed a threat to social harmony. The offences are often so complicated, clueless and deep- rooted into influential quarters that nothing less than a full-scale investigation by a professional investigator is enough to unearth the truth behind them.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Investigation is a goal- oriented mission, like a tiger chasing a deer, not to stop short of the target and must be allowed exactly as much time as it needs in its bid to reach the target. Statutory limitation giving deadline for the report is, therefore, bound to produce abortive and distorted result to the advantage of the true offenders. Investigation being a process that follows its own rules must be allowed to go unhindered unless its goal is reached. What is important is not to squeeze a report within a deadline but constant vigilance by the supervisory authority to see whether the investigation is going in right order and in right pace and take drastic measures against the  investigating officer should any laches, negligence or foul-play on his part  is noticed.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The factual perspective illustrates the difference between the two terms and makes it amply clear that they are not mechanisms to be used interchangeably irrespective of the nature of the cases. Investigation must be directed to be carried out either by police or by any other specialized agency where facts of a particular case requires the Tribunal so to do. A police officer is not police. Refusal by him to accept the complaint need not be construed as refusal by police. If in the peculiar facts of a case Tribunal is satisfied that nothing less than a threadbare investigation is needed for detection of the crime and the criminals it has no choice but to exercise its inherent power and send back the complaint- petition to the police station with direction to treat the same as an FIR and cause investigation to be made by any competent police officer (other than the one who refused to accept the complaint) or by an officer belonging to any other specialized investigating agency. The power to make such direction must not be limited to any stage or difference of title of the information upon which the proceedings was started, FIR or complaint precisely for the reason that justice is the <em>raison d’ệtre</em> of a court or tribunal and no law, however clear in meaning, seeking to deter the court/tribunal in passing any order for securing ends of justice can stand without being indicted. Direction may be made on receipt of the complaint-petition or even after receiving inquiry- report if the report, in the opinion of the Tribunal, suggests that the facts are not as obvious and plain as is narrated in the complaint petition and the inquiry-report is not enough to support a fruitful prosecution. </li><li style="text-align:justify">Over and above, police is duty bound to receive complaint alleging commission of cognizable offence and cannot refuse it without lawful excuse. Since all the offences under the Ain are cognizable arbitrary refusal by police to accept the complaint alleging commission of any of them amounts to misconduct. It is an absurd proposition to suppose that mere refusal by a police officer or in other words, dereliction of duty of a police officer or for that matter an authorized person may be taken to create a legal binding upon the Tribunal to take recourse to inquiry-procedure although, in its opinion, investigation should be directed in the peculiar facts of the case.  This is a proposition which militates against the ultimate authority of the Tribunal to take its own decision and runs contrary to the ‘last say’ doctrine. </li><li style="text-align:justify">It may not be out of place to mention here that a Magistrate or ‘any other person’ for that matter a Judge, how high soever, is not an expert in investigation. They are not persons, merely because of their higher credibility in the society, to act as a substitute for a competent police officer or a member of other investigating agencies nor a direction for inquiry by one or more of them may be given interchangeably with investigation regardless of the nature of the case. </li><li style="text-align:justify">The case of <strong><em>Sirajul Islam</em></strong> (<em>supra</em>), sought to be relied upon by the learned Advocate is clearly distinguishable because the issue in that case was whether the phrase “any other person” occurring in section <em>27(1Ka) (Ka) includes</em> a police officer or not and their Lordships answered the question in the negative. We see no difference between the view taken by their Lordships and the one taken by us on the point in the sense, in our view, if it is ‘inquiry’ a person merely by virtue of being a police officer is of no consequence.  Learned Advocate seemingly missed the position that here we are not on interpretation of the phrase “any other person” occurring in section 27(1Ka) (Ka) but on acceptability of the proposition that mere refusal by   a police officer leaves the Tribunal with no choice but to go for inquiry. The citation, therefore, is misplaced in the context and is of no avail for the petitioner.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The last and the final contention raised as a faint attempt to show that the allegation does not constitute any offence fades away as a cry in wilderness.  We have meticulously gone through the complaint petition. Unfortunately for the petitioner, we notice her name consistently appearing throughout the complaint-petition indicating her direct involvement (true or false) in the commission of the offence. There is obviously a strong <em>prima facie</em> case against the petitioner to be tried.  The report submitted by the Vice-Chairman of the local Upa-Zila Parishad is clearly biased and the Tribunal has rightly taken cognizance of the offence against the petitioner by rejecting   the report. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>To sum up:</u></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify"><em>Naraji</em> petition filed by the informant/complainant or any other person aggrieved against any report within the meaning of section 27 of the Ain,   submitted by police, Magistrate or any person authorized by the Government or appointed by the Tribunal is maintainable and the Tribunal is competent to take notice of the <em>naraji</em>-petition for its own satisfaction about the acceptability of the investigation or inquiry-report and as an aid to the process taking cognizance. </li><li style="text-align:justify">The informant/complainant or person aggrieved filing <em>naraji</em> petition against investigation/inquiry report within the meaning of section 27 of the Ain is  not required to be  examined u/s 200 of the Code for any purpose.</li><li style="text-align:justify">On receipt of the complaint the Tribunal may, if thinks fit, withhold direction for inquiry as contemplated under sub-clause (Ka) of section 27(1Ka) and send the complaint-petition back to the police station for recording a regular case, with direction to cause the investigation to be made by any competent police officer, other than the one who refused to accept the complaint, or direct any other investigating agency to investigate.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Without prejudice to the findings made in the preceding paragraph, the Tribunal may, if it appears after receiving the inquiry-report that the facts are not as plain and obvious as narrated in the petition of complaint and an inquiry is not enough for discovery of truth behind the offence, send the complaint-petition to the local police station with direction to cause an investigation to be made by a competent police officer, other than the one who refused to accept the same, or otherwise direct any other investigating agency to investigate, and report.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">For what we have stated above, we see no merit in the Rule. In the result, the Rule is discharged. The order of stay granted earlier is hereby vacated. The Tribunal is directed to proceed with the trial of the case in accordance with law.<br/>         Communicate at once.<br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The defendants on that date also failed to file written statements. The learned court thereafter passed the judgment for failure of the defendants to file written statements. This judgment comes within the purview of Order 8 Rule 10 of the C.P.C. Order 8 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as under: </em><em>“ Where any party from whom a written statement is so required fails to present the same within the time fixed by the Court, the Court may pronounce judgment against him, or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit.” </em>…(17)<br/> <br/><em>The learned Advocate for the petitioner on the contrary has submitted that against an order passed under Order 8 Rule 10 of the C.P.C. is appealable under Order 43 Rule 1 (b) of the C.P.C but in India the provision of Rule 1(b) of Order 43 of the C.P.C has been deleted in 1976 by an amendment and there is no provision in the Indian C.P.C for filing an appeal against the order passed under Order 8 rule 10 of the C.P.C . So, in all the aforesaid cases referred on behalf of opposite party  it was held that Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure is entertainable against an order passed under Order 8 Rule 10 of the C.P.C . But in our C.P.C the provision of Rule 1(b) of Order 43 of the C.P.C has not been amended. According to our C.P.C Rule 1 (b) of Order 43 is the specific provision for filing an appeal against an order passed under Order 8 Rule 10 of the C.P.C if the defendant fails to present the written statements on the date fixed by the Court. The learned Advocate for the petitioner has referred the case of Gopi Charan Bajpai and others Vs. Ramprashad Awasthi and others reported in AIR 1957 (Allahbad) 283. The case was decided before amendment of the C.P.C. in India and it has been held that an order passed under Order 8 Rule 10 of the C.P.C is an appealable order and appeal lies under the provision of Order 43 Rule 1(b) of the C.P.C. Before amendment of C.P.C in India the provision of Order 43 Rule 1(b) was the procedure for filing an appeal against an order passed under order 8 Rule 10 of the C.P.C. But after amendment the provision of appeal has been deleted in India. In the case of M/S. M. Manick Peter and others Vs. K. Surendranathan reported in AIR 1988 Kerala 161 it has been held:</em><em> ..........” A right of appeal provided Under Order 43 Rule 1 (b) was taken away by deletion of sub clause (b). The decree passed in the present case is in conformity with the requirements of Order 8 Rule 10 as amended in 1976. For the absence of the defendnats and their Counsel, it is also a decree exparte.

He took four adjournments for filing written statements but ultimately they failed to file the same and the Court passed the ex-parte judgment which comes within the meaning of Order 8 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure  and the same was appealable under the provision of Order 43 rule 1(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure. So, the learned Joint District Judge was not justified in rejecting the petitioner’s prayer for rejecting the miscellany-eous case as being not entertainable. ...(26)</strong><br/> <br/>Damodar Das Vs.

The learned Joint District Judge by order No. 12 dated 22.1.2006 as last chance allowed time and fixed up 6.2.2006 for filing written statements with a cost of Tk. 700/-, in default, for exparte hearing and decision. On 6.2.2006 the defendants appointed a new lawyer and again filed an application for 15 days adjournment to file written statements. The Court rejected the prayer for adjournment and took up the case for exparte hearing and decreed the suit exparte.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     Against the said exparte decree the defendant opposite parties have filed  a case being Miscellaneous Case No. 24 of 2006  under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure stating that defendant-opposite parties could not prepare the written statements as the Head Office of the Bank did not supply the necessary facts and documents in support of their case and that they  engaged a new Advocate but he could not prepare the written statements and as such prayed for time, the learned Court rejected the prayer for time and passed the exparte decree. In the miscellaneous case the petitioner filed an application stating that the impugned exparte order was passed under Order 8 Rule 10 of the code of Civil Procedure which is appealable, so, the miscellaneous petition under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not maintainable.<br/> <br/><strong>5.     </strong>The learned Joint District Judge by order No. 20 dated 3.7.2006 rejected the  application for rejection of the miscellaneous case on the finding that in order to avoid delay and for expeditious disposal of the case the provision of   Rule 13 (A) of Order 9 has been inserted in the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>     Being aggrieved thereby, the petitioner moved this court and obtained the present Rule.  <br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     The defendant-opposite parties have filed a counter affidavit controverting the statements made in the revisional application and stated that  in their miscellaneous case they  stated that for bonafide reason they failed to file written statements within the time granted by the Court and that as per  provision of Rule 13A of Order 9 of the Civil Procedure Code, to ensure the expeditious hearing of the case the learned court rejected the petitioner’s application for rejection of the miscellaneous case and that the said miscellaneous case is maintainable.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     Mr. Abdul Quayum with Mr. Probir Halder, learned Advocates appearing on behalf of petitioner-company have submitted that the exparte order was passed as per provision of Order 8 Rule 10 which is appealable under Order 43 Rule 1(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure and as such the miscellaneous case is not maintainable.  Mr. Probir Halder thereafter has submitted that petitioner took specific ground that an appeal lies against the order passed under Order 8 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the learned Judge quoted the submission of the petitioner in his judgment but without considering the said provision of law illegally rejected the petitioner’s application for rejection of the miscellaneous case.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     Mr. Ajmalul Hossain, learned Senior Counsel appearing with Mr. A.B.M. Siddiqur Rahman Khan and Mr. Mamun Chowdhury learned Advocates have submitted that the order passed by the Joint District Judge in the money suit is an exparte decree within the meaning of Order 9 Rule 6 of the C.P.C and as such an application under Order 9 Rule 13 of the C.P.C is attracted. Mr. Ajmalul Hossain thereafter has submitted that the judgment passed  in the money suit deemed to be a decree under Order 17 Rule 2 of the C.P.C and the remedy lies under Order 9 Rule 13 of the C.P.C. He further has submitted that 1<sup>st</sup> part of the Order 9 Rule 13 of the C.P.C defines that in case of every exparte decree an application under Order 9 Rule 13 is maintainable and the present miscellaneous case being an application against the exparte decree under the 2<sup>nd</sup> limb of the Order 8 Rule 10 the proper forum is an application under Order 9 Rule 13 of the C.P.C.  He lastly has submitted that the exparte judgment passed in the Money suit being not a judgment within the  meaning of Section 2 (9) and Order 20 Rule 4 of the C.P.C the  application under Order 9 Rule 13 is entertainable.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    Certified copy of the entire order sheet of the Money Suit No. 6 of 2005 have been annexed with the revisional application as Annexure-B. From  order No. 12 dated 22.1.2006 it appears that previously on 4 occasions adjournment were allowed for filing written statements but the defendant did not file any written statements. The Court by that order again granted adjournment for the last time and fixed up 6.2.2006 for filing written statements with a cost of Tk. 700/-, in default, fixed for exparte disposal and decision of the case.  The defendants without filing any written statements and without depositing the cost money filed an application for time to file written statements. This application was filed by a new lawyer who stated that the previous lawyer of the defendants retired from the case. The defendants then and there deposited the cost amount and made a prayer for adjournment. The learned Court rejected the said prayer and took up the case for exparte hearing and disposed of the case by an exparte judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    The learned Advocate for the opposite party has submitted that the  exparte decree was passed in absence of the learned Advocate and that the learned court debarred him from appearing in the case. So, the miscellaneous case under order 9 Rule 13 of the C.P.C is maintainable . In support of his submission he referred three decisions.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    In the case of Damodar Das Vs. Raj Kumar Das reported in AIR 1922 (Patna) 485 the suit was decreed exparte on 20.9.1919. The defendant applied Under Order 9 Rule 13 of the C.P.C to have the decree set aside. The High Court found that the trial took place on the 11<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>  and 13<sup>th</sup> August, 1919 and on the 11<sup>th</sup> the defendants pleader appeared and asked for an adjournment which was refused. He renewed the application on the following day stating that he had no instruction from his client to cross-examine the plaintiff whose evidence had been taken on the 11<sup>th</sup> . His application was again refused.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    In the case of Bothra and others Vs. Kedar Nath Bothra and others reported in A.I.R. 1938 (Calcutta) 74 the plaintiffs in the suit at a late stage applied for the issue of a commission. The learned Counsel for the plaintiffs, when the suit was called on, applied for an adjournment, in order that he might be in a position to tender the commission evidence after the commission had been executed. The court rejected the application. Thereupon  Counsel stated that he was not in a position to proceed. The suit was accordingly dismissed. It has been held that if the plaintiff’s counsel confines himself to asking for an adjournment and when it is refused, retires from the case and states that he has no further instruction in that case it cannot be said that in presence   of the plaintiff decree was passed.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    In the case of Md. Nurul Haque Vs. Sonali Bank of Bangladesh and another reported in 39 DLR 223 their Lordships held :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">........... “It is apparent that after rejection of the prayer for adjournment when the suit was called on for hearing the plaintiff did not appear within the meaning of Order 9 Rule 8 read with Order 17 Rule 2 of the C.P.C and the learned Subordinate Judge dismissed the suit for default”........</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    In all the aforesaid cases there was an application for adjournment which was rejected by the court. The learned Advocate thereafter withdrew him from the suit and intimated the court that he has no further instruction from his client . So, it was held that the suit was disposed of in absence of the Advocate and miscellaneous case under order 9 Rule 13 were entertained.  <br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    The exparte judgment shows that the learned Judge rejected the defendants’ application for adjournment and thereafter took up the case for exparte hearing. It does not appear from the order that the newly appointed lawyer thereafter filed any application for further adjournment or that the learned Advocate intended to appear for taking part in the hearing of the suit. Even he did not retire from the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    On 6.2.2006 was fixed for filing written statements, in default, for taking exparte decision on the suit. The defendants on that date also failed to file written statements. The learned court thereafter passed the judgment for failure of the defendants to file written statements. This judgment comes within the purview of Order 8 Rule 10 of the C.P.C. Order 8 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“ Where any party from whom a written statement is so required fails to present the same within the time fixed by the Court, the Court may pronounce judgment against him, or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    So, the order passed by the Court clearly comes within the perview of Order 8 Rule 10 of the C.P.C. An order passed under Order 8 Rule 10 of the C.P.C. is an appealable order under the provision of Order 43 Rule 1(b) of the C.P.C. The provision of Order 43 Rule 1(b) of the C.P.C reads as under :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“ 1. An appeal shall lie from the following orders under the provisions of section 104, namely:- </em><br/><em>(a) ..............................</em><br/><em>(b). an order under Rule 10 of Order 8 pronouncing  </em><em>  judgment against a party.”  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    According to learned Advocate for the opposite party the impugned judgment having been passed  under the provision of Order 17 Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure the application under Order 9 Rule 13 is maintainable and that  the exparte judgment passed in money suit can be considered as an order under the second limb of Rule 10 of Order 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In case of failure to file written statement the court can take two courses: (1) pass an exparte judgment and (2) can make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. In support of his submission he relied on the cases of Narendra Patra Vs. Shiba Narayan Taldi and another reported in A.I.R. 1995 Orissa 45, Innovation Apartments Flat Owners Association, Secundrabad Vs. M/S. Innovation Associates, Secundrabad reported in AIR 1991 Andhra Pradesh 69, N. Jayaraman Vs. M/S. Glaxo Laboratories India Ltd. reported in AIR 1981 Madras 258, M/S. Kuvarp industries Bangalore Vs. State Bank of Mysore reported in AIR 1985 (Kant) 77 and the case of M.S. Manick Peter and others Vs. K. Surendra nathan reported in AIR 1988 Kerala 161. In all these cases it has been decided that an order passed under Order 8 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure can be challenged by an application under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    The learned Advocate for the petitioner on the contrary has submitted that against an order passed under Order 8 Rule 10 of the C.P.C. is appealable under Order 43 Rule 1 (b) of the C.P.C but in India the provision of Rule 1(b) of Order 43 of the C.P.C has been deleted in 1976 by an amendment and there is no provision in the Indian C.P.C for filing an appeal against the order passed under Order 8 rule 10 of the C.P.C . So, in all the aforesaid cases referred on behalf of opposite party  it was held that Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure is entertainable against an order passed under Order 8 Rule 10 of the C.P.C . But in our C.P.C the provision of Rule 1(b) of Order 43 of the C.P.C  has not been amended. According to our C.P.C  Rule 1 (b) of Order 43 is the specific provision for filing an appeal against an order passed under Order 8 Rule 10 of the C.P.C if the defendant fails to present the written statements on the date fixed by the Court. The learned Advocate for the petitioner has referred the case of Gopi Charan Bajpai and others Vs. Ramprashad Awasthi and others reported in AIR 1957 (Allahbad) 283. The case was decided before amendment of the C.P.C. in India and  it has been held that an order passed under Order 8 Rule 10 of the C.P.C is  an appealable order and appeal lies under the provision of Order 43 Rule 1(b) of the C.P.C. Before amendment of  C.P.C in India  the provision of Order 43 Rule 1(b) was the procedure for filing an appeal against an order passed under order 8 Rule 10 of the C.P.C. But after amendment the provision of appeal has been deleted in India. In the case of M/S. M. Manick Peter and others Vs. K. Surendranathan reported in AIR 1988 Kerala 161 it has been held :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>..........” A right of appeal provided Under Order 43 Rule 1 (b) was taken away by deletion of sub clause (b). The decree passed in the present case is in conformity with the requirements of Order 8 Rule 10 as amended in 1976. For the absence of the defendnats and their Counsel, it is also a decree exparte. Order 9 Rule 13 C.P.C. enable the defendants to apply to the court to set aside an exparte decree against him”............... </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    Mr. Probir Halder also referred the case of Most. Hakumat Bibi Vs. Imam Din and others reported in PLD 1987 (S.C.)-22. In that case exparte decree was passed for not filing the written statements on the date fixed by the Court. An appeal was filed against that order under the provision of Order 43 Rule 1(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure. In Pakistan the provision of Order 43 Rule 1(b) neither has been amended nor deleted. The provision of appeal Under Order 43 Rule 1(b) against an order passed Under Order 8 Rule 10 still is present in Pakistan like Bangladesh.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    It has been argued on behalf of opposite parties that the exparte judgment passed by the lower Court is not a judgment as defined in Section 2(9) read with Order 20 Rule 4(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure as the learned Court did not consider the case of the parties, the documents and the evidence cited by the plaintiff-petitioner in support of his case. In the case in hand the Court passed a short judgment disposing the suit in favour of plaintiff and did not at all consider the facts of the case and a decree was drawn. As per provision of Rule 10 of Order 8 the Court had two options open to it to deal with the situation arising out of the failure of the opposite party to file written statements despite they having been allowed several opportunity to do so. One of the options was to decide the suit forthwith, (ii) to make such order in relation to the suit as it thought fit. As per the provision of Order 8 Rule 10 the court can pass a judgment if the defendant fails to file written statements on the date fixed by the Court. In the present case the judgment passed by the Court is an order and the Court was not required to draw a decree in support of the said judgment. In this point we get support from the case referred by the learned Advocate for the petitioner in the case of Sarder Sakhwat Ud-Din and others Vs. Muhammad Iqbal and others reported in PLD 1983 (Lahore)-448. In that case it was held that “ after making the impugned order the learned Senior Civil Judge had drawn up a decree sheet as well. It was perhaps through inadvertence that the decree sheet was prepared because, as held above the order passed by him was an order and not a decree. The mere fact that he had erroneously drawn up the decree sheet would not change the true character of the order under review. In that case the case of the provice of Punjab and others ruled by the Pakistan S.C. was considered and wherein it was held :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“...... an order pronouncing the judgment against the defendants for failure to file written statements is an appealable order but not a decree. The use of the ward “Judgment”  in Rule 10 of Order 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure is of little avail to the respondents because according to the  definition of the “judgment” as given in clause 9 of section 2 of the above code a decree as well as an order is a judgment. It is therefore, not correct to say that only that adjudication of the court which is followed by a decree is a judgment and that any other adjudication, though appealable, is not a judgment” ............. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>23.</strong>    The Court has drawn up a decree in terms of the judgment but the same was not necessary and for drawing up such decree it cannot be said that it is a decree within the meaning of section 2 (9) of the C.P.C and the judgment  comes within the perview of Order 9 Rule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure and against the said judgment the miscellaneous case under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure is maintainable.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>    Referring the 1<sup>st</sup> part of the Order 9  Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure the learned Advocate for the opposite party has submitted that in any case in which an exparte decree is passed against a defendant, he may apply to the court for setting aside the exparte decree by an application Under Order 9 Rule 19 of the C.P.C. In support of his submission he referred the case of Innovation Apartments Flat Owners Association, Secundrabad Vs. M/S. Innovation Associates Secundrabad reported in AIR 1991 (Andhra Pradesh) 69. From plain reading of the entire provision of  rule 13 of order 9 it appears to us that if the Court is satisfied that the summons was not duly served upon the defendant or that he was prevented by sufficient cause from appearing at the hearing, the  court can set aside an exparte decree. Specific provision has been made for preferring an appeal under Order 43 Rule 1(b) of the CPC when an order is passed under Order 8 Rule 10 of the CPC and an application Under Order 9 Rule 13 will not be entertainable in the garb of “ in any case” mentioned in the provision of Order 9 Rule 13 of the C.P.C. Moreover, the decision referred in AIR 1991 (Andhra Pradesh) 69 was passed on 30.8.1990 when the Indian C.P.C. was amended in 1976 and Rule 1 (b) of Order 43 was deleted. ‘In any case’ mentioned in rule 13 of order 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure can only be entertained when it is found is that the summons of the suit was not properly served or that the defendant was prevented by sufficient cause in appearing on the date of hearing of the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>    By amending Rule 1 of Order 8 of the C.P.C. provision has been made to file written statement within the time not exceeding two months from the 1<sup>st</sup> date of hearing. But before amendment there was no specific time limit in the CPC for filing written statement.  Before amendment it was in the discretion of the Court to allow time to the defendant to file written statement but after amendment the written statement is required to be filed before the first hearing or within 2 months. The defendants on 11.9.2005, 18.10.2005,24.11.2005 and 22.1.2006 took four adjournments for filing written statements and the court by order No. 12 dated 22.1.2006 allowed time with a cost of Tk. 700.00 and directed the defendant to file written statement on 6.2.2006 with a direction that the suit would be taken up for exparte decision in case of failure of the defendant to file written statement on that date. On the fixed date on 6.2.2006 the defendant appointed a new lawyer who again prayed for time to file written statement. On the previous date they were allowed time to file written statements with cost even then on the next date without filing any written statement they again prayed for adjournment.The defendants had the opportunity to avoid exparte judgment by filing a written statement with some facts and thereafter they could file additional written statement but the defendant without filing written statements prayed for adjournment, so, the Court did not allow time and proceeded with the exparte hearing. It does not appear from the order sheet that the learned Advocate thereafter prayed for any adjournment or that he retired from the case. When the Court proceeded for hearing of the case exparte the learned Advocate for the defendant-opposite party was present in Court but did not take any step. It has been urged that the learned Advocate for the defendant was debarred from appearing in the suit when the same was taken up for hearing but there is no evidence before us to show that learned Advocate of the defendant was not allowed to appear in the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>    From the impugned order it  appears that the learned Joint District Judge refused to reject the miscellaneous case on referring the amended provision of Rule 13 A  of Order 9 of the C.P.C.  The new provision of Rule 13A of order 9  has been brought in the C.P.C. to avoid delay and expedite disposal in setting aside the exparte decree with cost without requiring the defendant to adduce evidence if an application for setting aside decree is filed within thirty days from the date of decree.   But in the present case, the defendant was very much before the Court. He took four adjournments for filing written statements but ultimately they failed to file the same and the Court passed the exparte judgment which comes within the meaning of Order 8 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure  and the same was appealable under the provision of Order 43 Rule 1(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure. So, the learned Joint District Judge was not justified in rejecting the petitioner’s prayer for rejecting the miscellaneous case as being not entertainable. We find substance in the Rule.              <br/> <br/>        In the result, the Rule is made absolute without any order as to cost. The impugned order No. 20 dated 3.7.2006 is set aside. The miscellaneous case No. 24 of 2006 of the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of joint District Judge,  Khulna is rejected as being not maintainable. The defendant opposite parties have the opportunity to prefer an appeal as per provision of law.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The application is being opposed by the sole respondent, namely Roads and Highways Department, Ministry of Communications, Government of People’s Republic of Bangladesh, Sarak Bhavan, Dhaka, Bangladesh.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>     Arbitration Application No. 03 of 2004 filed under section 42(2) read with section 43(1)(a)(iv) of the Arbitration Act, 2001, is at the instance of Roads and Highways Department, Ministry of Communication, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, Sarak Bhaban, Ramna, Dhaka for setting aside portion of the Award dated 13.05.2004 (as modified by Award dated 23.06.2004) passed by the Arbitration Tribunal in an arbitration proceeding between the petitioner and the respondent/opposite-party. The aforesaid application is being opposed by Startus Construction Company, the petitioner of Arbitration Application 2 of 2004.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>     Since both the applications arise out of the Award dated 13.05.2004 (as modified by order dated 23.06.2004) passed by the Tribunal, Dhaka in an arbitration proceeding between Startus Construction (claimant) and Roads and Highways, Government of People’s Republic of Bangladesh and furthermore, since both the petitioner and the respondent in the aforesaid two Arbitration Applications are the same, both the applications were taken up and heard simultaneously and they will be disposed of by this single judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     A brief summary of the relevant facts is required to be stated for the purpose of disposal of the two applications before this Court.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     Startus Construction Company (hereinafter referred to as the company) entered into a contract with the Roads and Highways, Government of People’s Republic of Bangladesh (hereinafter referred to as the Department) for construction/ rehabilitation of roads and highways between Joydebpur and Kaliakair measuring approximately 26.60 km. After completion of necessary formalities, the company commenced work under the contract and duly completed part of the work upto 5 km. However, while undertaking the work in the first 5 km of the project, the company faced certain obstacles with regard to underground gas pipe lines and requested the Department to take necessary steps for removal of the gas pipe lines in order to enable the company to undertake and complete the project work without any hindrance. Despite assurance from the respondents, the matter was not resolved and at one stage, the project work was suspended. The parties engaged in discussion and exchange of correspondences, which also invoved various other Ministry/Departments of the Government.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>     Ultimately, since there was no further progress in the matter which had comes to a standstill, the company issued a notice dated 14.08.2001 determi-ning the contract and claiming compensation as well as requesting for return of the Bank Guarantee which was furnished earlier. Subsequently, the company also served a notice of Arbitration on 20.08.2001. On the other hand, the Department by its letter dated 16.08.2001, approved various orders and voluntarily extended the contract period upto 06.05.2002, but three days later, it terminated the contract by letter dated 19.08.2001.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     The dispute between the parties was referred to a three members Arbitration Tribunal compri-sing of Mr. Justice Sultan Hossain Khan as Chairman and Mr. Justice M.A. Karim and Mr. Justice M.M. Hoque as members of the Tribunal. The Department duly entered appearance and participated in the arbitration proceeding.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     Upon commencement of the arbitration proceeding, the Tribunal framed the following issues</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“(1)    Has the Employer committed breach of contract in not removing the gas pipeline and thus prevented SCC from performing the latter’s promise?<br/>(2)    Has the Claimant sustained any loss in consequence of its non-performance of the contract ? If so, what compensation it is entitled to?<br/>(3)      Is the certification of default of the Contractor issued by the Engineer baseless and illegal?<br/>(4)      Is the contract liable to be terminated at the instance of SCC in view of Section 53 of the Contract Act ?<br/>(5)      Has the termination of the contract by the Employer been legal and valid ?<br/>(6)      Has the valuation of the variations by the engineer been legal and valid?<br/>(7)      Is the Claimant entitled to get the Award as prayed for including the additional claim against bitumen and cost of the proceeding ?”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     Both sides filed written statements, replies, additional and further statements and replies thereto, documents and other related papers. The Tribunal also examined witnesses.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    Upon conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the Tribunal, by order dated 13.05.2004, dismissed the claim of the company and made a Award of Tk. 6,25,46,127.66 (Taka Six Crore Twenty Five Lac Forty Six Thousand One Hundred and Twenty Severn and Paisa Sixty Six) only in favour of the Roads and Highways Department. The Tribunal also ordered the release of the Bank Guarantee in favour of the company.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    Subsequent thereto, upon an application filed by the company for correction of the Award dated 13.05.2004. Consequently, the Tribunal, by order dated 23.06.2004, allowed the application and corrected the Award by reducing the Award amount to Tk. 3,29,82,629.56 (Taka three corer twenty nine lac eighty two thousand six hundred twenty nine and pais fifty six) in favour of the Department. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid Award dated 13.05.2004 (as amended by order dated 23.06.2004), the company filed Arbitration Application No. 2 of 2004 praying for setting aside the award.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    At the same time, the Roads and Highways Department, as petitioner, also preferred Arbitr-ation Application No. 03 of 2004 praying for correction of the Award by setting aside a part of the Award darted 13.05.2004 (as amended by order dated 23.06.2004), in particular, paragraph 18.6, 18.7, 18.8, 18.9, 22, 24, 25.4 26 and 27 of the Award under section 42 (2) read with section 43 (i)(a)(iv) of the Act and also for passing a corrected Award in terms of prayers A to E of paragraph 7 of the application.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    At the very outset, this Court takes note of the fact that the pleading and documents annexed in the two arbitration applications runs into hundred, if not thousands of pages. In fact, the related documents had to be brought into the Court in a trunk, which at first sight, made the Court slightly apprehensive. However, having gone through most of the documents and papers, this Court was remind of an age old Bangla saying “যত গর্জে তত বর্ষে না।”<br/> <br/>14.  Dr. Kamal Hossain, learned Senior Advocate appears for the Startus Construction Company in Arbitration Application No. 2 of 2004, while Mr. A.F. Hassan Ariff, Senior Advocate appears with Mr. Md. Ashik Al Jalil in support of the Arbitra-tion Application No. 3 of 2004.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    During the course of his submission, Dr. Kamal Hossain has challenged the Award primarily on the issue of jurisdiction. Dr. Hossain submitted emphatically that although the respon-dents in the Arbitration proceeding i.e. the Roads and Highways Department did not make any counter claim before the Tribunal, the Tribunal, on its own volition, made an Award in favour of the Department upon rejecting the claim of the claimant. Dr. Hossain refers to the issues framed at the commencement the arbitration proceeding and submits categorically that no such issue relating to any counter claim was filed by the Department and therefore, in the absence of any claim in that respect, the Award made by the Tribunal allowing counter claim under several heads in favour of the Department is quiet clearly an Award which is beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    Dr. Hossain has also argued with some considerable force on the merit of the Award itself. However, I do not wish to enter into the merit of the Award for reasons that I shall state at a subsequent stage of this judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    Dr. Hossain has also referred to two expert’s opinions, which were framed before the Tribunal by the claimant company given by one Engineer A.B.M. Fazley Elahi, former Managing Director, Rupantorito Pakritik Gas Limited RPGL, Petro Bangla and former General Manager, Tital Gas Transmission and  Distribution Company Limited as well as the evidence of one Mr. Md. Mobarak Ali, former Chief Instructor of Explosives, Government of Bangladesh. Dr. Hossain has argued that the Tribunal erred and misconducted itself in not considering these two vital pieces of evidence upon which the claimant company had placed considerable reliance. Therefore, according to Dr. Hossain, the impugned Award in question is liable to be set aside, having been passed without jurisdiction and also because of the failure of the Tribunal to consider material evidence which was placed before the Tribunal.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    Mr. A.F. Hassan Ariff, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the respondent in Arbitration Application No. 02 of 2004 and for the petitioner in Arbitration Application No. 3 of 2004 submits that the impugned Award does not call for any interference from this Court save and except to the extent to which it relates to issues not submitted before the Tribunal. Referring to the provision of section 42 and section 43(i)(a)(iv) of the Act, Mr. Ariff submits categorically that the Act itself makes provision for such cases and allows the Award to be separated from the issues which were not submitted before the Tribunal and empowers the Court to set aside the Award so far it relates to matter not referred to the Tribunal. Mr. Ariff argues with some force that having regard to the provision of section 43(i)(a)(iv), the Court has ample power and jurisdiction to severe the Award and set aside such portion of the Award which has been passed by the Tribunal beyond its jurisdiction.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    During the course of his argument, Mr. Hassan Ariff acknowledged that the Tribunal had indeed acted beyond its jurisdiction to some extent by allowing the counter claim of the Department when, in fact, no such issues were framed before the Tribunal. Elaborating his submission, Mr. Hassan Ariff contends that although the claimant company had not referred certain disputes such as claim for refund against bitumen, the Tribunal allowed such claim in favour of the claimants, thereby acting beyond its jurisdiction. Mr. Hassan Ariff further submits that the issue of retention money or return of the same was not referred for adjudication before the Tribunal as per clause 67 of GCOC and therefore the Tribunal travelled beyond its jurisdiction in allowing the same in favour the claimant company. Similarly, according to Mr. Hassan Ariff, the Tribunal erred and consequently travelled beyond its jurisdiction in awarding a reduction of VAT or its return in favour of the claimant company as well as return of the Bank Guarantee submitted by the claimant company.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    Lastly, Mr. Hassan Ariff contends that having regard to the provision of section 43(i)(a)(iv) of the Act, the Court is vested with ample power to correct and modify the Award in accordance with the prayer made by the petitioner in Arbitration Application No. 3 of 2004.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    The moot question which calls for determin-ation by this Court relates to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal itself. A Tribunal is to decide only such issues as are referred to them by the contending sides. In fact, the power of the Tribunal is confined within the terms of reference made to it by the parties under the contract. Consequently, any deviation therefrom is bound to invoke the question of jurisdiction, as has been done in the instant case.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    In the instant application before this Court, the petitioner i.e. the company has challenged the Award mainly on the ground that the Tribunal has travel beyond its jurisdiction by deciding issues which were not referred to it. This contention advanced by the company gains support from the affidavit-in-opposition dated 01.11.2009 filed by the respondent itself. In paragraph 4 of  the aforesaid affidavit-in-opposition, it has been stated as follows :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The calculation made under the heading “Final Position” is not an outcome of any counter claim made by the respondent rather it is outcome of an unwarranted arithmetic calculation made by the Tribunal on the basis of its discussion on the valid as well as invalid determinable disputes and Annexure 17 to the Award submitted by the claimant/petitioner before the Tribunal. The calculation under the head “Final Position” is not consequential of the adjudication of 3 (three) valid referred dispute under clause 67 of GCOC. The said calculation therefore is not relatable to the three valid referred disputes under clause 67 of GCOC. The “Final Position” is therefore relatable to issue, which were not referred to arbitration as dispute following the mechanism /procedure under clause 67 of GCOC. The “Final Position” is extraneous to the 3 (three) valid referred dispute.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>23.</strong>    There is further corroboration of the issue in the impugned Award itself, where the Tribunal observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“We have noticed that the Respondent had claimed various amounts as shown by way submissions of summary of additional cost and amount due from the Contractor. <u>These claims were not referred to the Arbitrators in terms of Clause 67 of the Contract</u>”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(emphasis added)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>24.</strong>    Moreover, from the dissenting Award dated 13.05.2004 passed by one of the Arbitrators (Mr. Justice M.M. Haque), it appears that the learned Arbitrator found as under :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“It may be mentioned here that there is no counter claim by the said ……………..” </em><br/>(page 29 of the Award)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>25.</strong>    From the observation quoted above, it appears that no counter claim was filed by the Roads and Highways Department, but the Tribunal nevertheless proceeded to make an Award in their favour which was beyond their terms of reference. It is also admitted by Mr. Hassan Arifff, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the Roads and Highways Department that only three disputes were referred to the Tribunal and upon commencement of the proceeding, the Tribunal framed as many as seven issues, as has been quoted earlier in this judgment. However, from a reading of the same, it does not appear that it relates to any counter claim filed by the Department.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>    It also appears that certain issues, which were not referred to the Tribunal, were taken up and decided by the Tribunal on its own accord. In my view, it would be reasonable to infer that in such circumstances, the Tribunal had indeed acted beyond its jurisdiction. The Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by abrogating to itself issues which were not referred to it by the contending sides. The issues relating to, advance, cost of bitumen, retention of advance money, advance income tax are some of the issues which, admittedly, were not referred to the Tribunal, but upon which the Tribunal made a pronouncement and gave an Award in favour of the Department.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>    From the supplementary affidavit dated 17.08.2009 filed by the petitioner, it has been stated on behalf of the petitioner that the expert evidence which was adduced on behalf of the claimant company, was also provided to the Department. From the Tribunal’s order sheet dated 06.02.2003, there is affirmation of the aforesaid statement made by the claimant company. However on a close scrutiny of the Award itself, it appears that the Tribunal has not referred to the expert evidences referred to above. On the issue of non-consideration of the expert report referred to above, it was argued forcefully by Mr. Ariff that such consideration will not invalidate the Award in view of the fact that the Tribunal is not bound to comply strictly with the provision of the Code of Civil Procedure and the provisions of the Evidence Act. Therefore, according to Mr. Hassan Ariff, even if the contention of the claimant company is accepted as to non-consideration of the expert opinion by the Tribunal, that, ifso facto, will not be a ground for setting aside the Award. In support of his contention, Mr. Hasan Ariff referred to section 24 of the Act, which provides that the Arbitral Tribunal was not bound to follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and the Evidence Act in disposing of a dispute under this Act.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>    To take up Mr. Hassan Ariff’s last contention first, in the case of Varat Cooking Coal Limited, reported in 200 C 8 SCC 154, the Supreme Court of India held that while making the Award, the Arbitrator cannot ignore very material and relevant documents relevant for determining the controversy, so as to render a just and fair decision.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>In that case referred to above, it was further held :<br/><br/><em>“there lies a trial distinction between a year within the jurisdi-ction and error in excess of jurisdiction.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>29.</strong>    The case of West Bengal Industrial Infra-Strictire Development Corporation, v. M/s. Star Engineering Co., reported in AIR 1987 Calcutta 126 related to a matter which had similar issues as in the present case pending before this Court in that no counter claim was filed in the reported case referred to above and the Court adjudicated on a imaginary counter claim. While setting aside the Award, the Court held :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In my opinion, this gross mistake has arisen from culpable negligence amounting to legal misconduct in part of the arbitrator in making the Award and as such this Award cannot be upheld.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>30.</strong>    In the case of Chetandas and others v. Radhakrisson Ramchandra and others, reported in AIR 1927 Bombay 553, it was held as under :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In cases where an arbitrator enters into the consideration of matters which are not referred to him, or which he has no jurisdiction to try, Blackburn, J. in Ringland v. Lowndes (1) (1864) 12 W.R. 1010) said that</em><br/><em>The question is not one of waiver or of estoppel, but of authority,</em><br/><em>and a party continuing to attend the reference after objection taken and protest made down not give the arbitrator authority to make an award. Even if a party under protest continues to attend before arbitrators and cross-examines witnesses, he does not thereby waive his objection, nor is he stopped from saying that the arbitrators have exceeded their authority by awarding on the matter :”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>31.</strong>    In my view, the aforesaid decision referred to above, falls squarely with the scope and nature of the matter before this Court. As to Mr. Hassan Ariff’s contention that this Court has ample power under section 43(1)(a)(iv) of the Act to severe the Award and only set aside that portion of the Award which relates to issues not referred to the Tribunal, it has to be said that the Award which has been passed in the instant case stands embodied under the head “final position” as contained at page 58 of the Award, whereby an Award of Taka 6,00,00,000/- and odd (which was subsequently reduced to Tk. 3,00,00,000/- and odd by order dated 23.06.2004) was made in favour of the Roads and Highways Department, despite the absence of any counter claim filed on their behalf. The Roads and Highways Departments itself stated in their affidavit-in-opposition dated 01.11.2009 that</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The calculation made under the head “Final Position” is not an outcome of any counter claim made by the respondent rather it is outcome of an unwarranted arithmetic calculation made by the Tribunal on the basis of its discussion on the valid as well as invalid determinable disputes and Annexure 17 to the Award submitted by the claimant/petitioner before the Tribunal. The calculation under the head “Final Position” is not consequential of the adjudication of 3 (three) valid referred dispute under clause 67 of GCOC.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>32.</strong>    Therefore, the statement made by the Department itself indicates that the Award made under the head of “Final Position” relates to issues, some of which have been referred under clause 67 of the GCOC. In my view, it would became difficult, if not impossible, to sever the determinable issues from the non determinable issues referred to the Tribunal from the final Award which is not before this Court.<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong>    I am fortified in my view by a decision pronounced more than half a century ago in the case of Bengal Jute Mills vs. Jewraj Heeralal, reported in AIR 1943 Calcutta 13, where it was held, and I quote:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Whilst it is correct that since the recent Arbitration Act there need to be no form of submission, and the authority and jurisdiction of the arbitrator is to be ascertained from the agreement for arbitr-ation, which in this case is contained in the contract, nevertheless when the parties set out specifically what disputes have arisen and what relief is sought in consequence of the alleged default by one party, it seems to me that those are the only matters upon which the arbitrators are required to inquire and to adjudicate. The only relief claimed in the present case was confined to an allowance being made in the price on account of the defective quality. The buyers never sought to have other awards given dealing with rejection and fresh tender of the goods. By adding to their award Para. 2(b) and (c), above, it seems to me that the arbitrators have gone beyond what the required for their consideration and have decided questions beyond which they were required to adjudicate. This being the case it must follow that the award is void in toto and must be set aside.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>34.</strong>    Having regard to the statements made in the application before this Court, the relevant provision of law, the submissions advanced by the learned Advocate for the contending sides and last, but not least, having considered the decisions referred to above, with which I find myself in total and respectful agreement, I am inclined to hold that the Arbitral Tribunal travelled beyond its jurisdiction by entertaining and deciding issues which had not been referred to by the contending sides and the impugned order is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong>    Accordingly, Arbitration Application No. 2 of 2004 stands allowed.<br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong>    The impugned Award dated 13.05.2004 (as modified by order dated 23.06.2004) is hereby set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>37.</strong>    Consequently, in view of the judgment and order passed in Arbitration Application No. 2 of 2004, Arbitration Application No. 3 of 2004 stands dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>38.</strong>    There will be no order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>39.</strong>    The parties are at liberty to take necessary steps in the matter, if so advised, in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>Before parting with case, this Court would like to put on record its profound appreciation for the valuable assistance rendered by the learned Advocates of the contending sides.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

More so, the recording Magistrate did not fill up the column Nos. 8, 9 and 10 of the form for which it is difficult to hold that the confessional statement made under sections 164, Cr.P.C. is a voluntary and same was recorded in compliance with the mandatory provision of law....(57, 59, 61 and 66)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 161 and 164</strong><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 30</strong><br/><strong>From the evidence of PWS. 4,7,8 and 12 it manifests that the witnesses made contradictory statements regarding the presence of witnesses in whose presence the alleged extra-judicial confession was made and they also contradict one another .

Learned judge acted illegality in relying on such extra-judicial confession of the condemned prisoner without having any independent corroborative evidence. Confession of an accused cannot be treated as substantive evidence against another co-accused but it can only be used to lend assurance to other evidence. There was absolutely no legal and trustworthy evidence against any of the non confessing accused persons and thus the conviction of the non-confessing accused persons relying on such confessional statement of co-accused is illegal and cannot be sustainable in law. The absconsion of accused Saiful Islam and Abdul Jalil cannot be treated as corroborative evidence of judicial and extra-judicial confession of condemned prisoner Ashraf Ali in the absence of any other direct evidence....

Enayetur Rahim, J: </strong></u><br/><br/>        This reference under section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been made by the learned Judge, Druta Bichar Tribunal, Rajshahi for confirmation of sentence of death imposed upon accused Ashraf Ali son of  late Abesh Ali, Ataur Rahman son of late Idris Ali @ Idi Fakir, Ashraf alias Raja son of late Ahad Ali, পালক পিতাঃ Rajab Ali, Saiful Islam alias Ripon, son of A. Jabber, A. Jalil alias Shimul, son of late Kapir Mondal on their conviction for the offence punishable under section 302/34 of the Penal Code passed on 05.07.2005 in Druta Bichar Tribunal Case No.16 of 2005 arising out of G.R. No. 170 of 2003 corresponding to Naldanga (Nator) Police Station Case No.03 dated 05.04.2003. Condemned-Prisoner Ashraf Ali, Ataur Rahman and Ashraf alias Raja have also preferred Criminal Appeal No.3243 of 2005 and Jail Appeal Nos.770 of 2005, 769 of 2005 and 768 of 2005 respectively. All the cases are taken together to dispose of by this common judgment. <br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>     Prosecution case, in short, is that P.W. 1 Md. Abdul Malek Miah, Officer in Charge of Naldanga Police Station, Nator himself on 05.04.2003 lodged a First Information Report stating, inter alia, that on 05.04.2003 at 2.35 hours he received a wireless message that a dead body was laying beside the railway line at Madhnagar. Receiving the said information he made a G.D being No.136 dated 05.04.2003 and he along with his companion forces reached to the place of occurrence at about 3.50 hours and found the dead body of Majedur Rahman Mridha alias Maju beside the rail line, 500 yards away from Madhnagar rail station. Matenur Rahman, younger brother of Majedur Rahman Mridha alias Maju, identified the dead body and found Majedur Rahman in slaughtered condition, caused by sharp cutting weapons. The informant in presence of witnesses A. Jabber, Lutfar Rahman, Soleman, Belal, Lutfar Rahman, A. Kuddus prepared the inquest report. From witnesses Moulana Mohammad Ali Dewan, Al-haj Azizur Rahman Mridha, A. Jabber Mridha, Akter Hossain, Akkas Ali and Matenur Rahman, the informant came to know that deceased Majedur Rahman along with Azizur Rahman Mridha, A. Jabber Mridha and Akter Hossain were returning back from ‘Islami Jalasha’ at about 1.00 A. M on 05.04.2003 and when they reached 30 yards away from the west side of the rail line, they saw that three unknown persons were sitting in a position as if they were making water and they asked them who they were and one of them suddenly dealt a blow on the head of Majedur Rahman by sharp cutting weapon and instantly he felt down on the paddy field on the  southern side of the road and thereafter other persons, who were waiting besides the road, came forward and participated in slaughtering Majedur Rahman Mridha alias Maju with sharp cutting weapon. The miscreants pointed arms to Azizur Rahman and Akter Hossain and asked them to keep silent and eventually the said Azizur and Akter Hossain managed to escape from the place of occurrence. At that time, the accused-persons went on raising slogans in the name of Purbabangla Communist Party and fled away. Akter Hossain and Azizur Rahman informed the said fact to the village people and the villagers came forward to the place of occurrence. One Shahidul Islam Bachchu informed about the occurrence to the Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>     On the basis of the said First Information Report, Naldanga Police Station Case No.3 dated 05.04.2003 under section 302/34 corresponding to G.R.No.170 of 2003 was started.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     P.W 19 S I Abdul Hai started the initial investigation but ultimately P.W 20 Dina Bandhu Das had completed the same and submitted the charge sheet being No.64, dated 24.09.2003 under sections 120-B/302/34 of the Penal Code against 9(nine) persons. In the instant case although charge sheet was submitted against nine persons but 4 (four) accused persons of them have filed two separate Criminal Revision before this Court and obtained rule and order of stay and eventually the present convicts were put on trial before the learned Judge, Druta Bichar Tribunal, Rajshahi and the learned Judge of the Tribunal by his order dated 03.04.2005 framed charges against 5(five) persons including the condemned prisoners under section 302/34 of the Penal Code to which the accused persons, who were on dock pleaded not guilty and prayed for trial. <br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     At the time of the trial, the prosecution examined as many as twenty (20) witnesses out of twenty nine (29) charge sheeted witnesses to prove it’s case. Defence cross-examined them but did not adduce any witness or evidence.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>     From the trend of cross-examination the case of the defence in short, is that, they have been implicated in this case falsely. They were not in any way connected with the alleged murder and the alleged extra judicial and judicial confession of accused Ashraf Ali is not a true and voluntarily one, rather the same was obtained by torture.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     After closing of the evidence, the accused persons present in the dock were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and they again claimed their innocence and made their respective statement.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     The learned Druta Bichar Tribunal after considering the evidence and materials on record by it’s judgment and order dated 05.07.2005 found accused (1) Ashraf Ali, (2) Ataur Rahman, (3) Ashraf alias Raja, (4) Saiful Islam alias Ripon and (5) A. Jalil alias Shimul guilty under section 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentencing them to death.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     It is to be mentioned here that convict-Saiful Islam and A. Jalil alias Simul were all along absconding during trial and they were defended by the state defence lawyer and still they are absconding and also in this Court they have been defended by the State defence lawyer.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    Mr. F.R.M. Nazmul Hasan, learned Deputy Attorney General with Mr. Md. Moniruzzaman, A.A.G, Mr. S. M. Asad Ullah Tarique, A.A.G and Mrs. Noor Jahan Mukta A.A.G appeared in support of the reference. Learned Deputy Attorney General submits that the reference may be accepted as the prosecution successfully has proved it’s case beyond all reasonable doubt. The extra judicial and judicial confession of accused-Ashraf Ali is rightly found true and voluntarily by the trial Court and P.W. 17 Md. Nazmul Haque, the Magistrate, who recorded the confessional statement of accused-Ashraf Ali under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, proved the statement as true and voluntary and there is no scope to disbelieve P.W 17. He further submits that judicial confessional statement, made by Ashraf Ali, is corroborated by his extra judicial confession and P.Ws. 4, 7, 8, 12 and 16 in their deposition categorically stated about the substantiality of the extra judicial confession made by Ashraf Ali. He further submits that the absconsion of accused-Saiful Islam and A. Jalil is an incrementing circumstance and corroborative evidence of confessional statement of accused-Ashraf Ali. He also contends that minor discrepancies or variance in adducing the evidence will not make the prosecution case doubtful and discrepancy has to be distinguished from contradiction. In support of his said contention he cited the case of Shibu Pada Acharjee – Vs- State reported in 56 DLR(HC), Page-285.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    He also refers the case of State –Vs- Moslem reported in 55 DLR, Page-116, where it has been held that conviction can be based on judicial confession if it is established that it is true and voluntary and is substantiated by other evidence, whether direct or circumstantial and materials on record.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    Learned Deputy Attorney General also submits that non filling of some columns or partly filling of columns 8, 9 and 10 of the prescribed form does not render the confession in admissible and in support of his said submission he refers the case of Salauddin –Vs- the State reported in 32 DLR, Page-227and regarding extra judicial confession he also refers the case of State –Vs- Md. Abdus Samad Azad alias Samad and another case reported in 9 BLC, Page-39.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    Mr. Reaz Uddin Khan appeared for the appellants in Criminal Appeal No.3243 of 2005. Mr. Khan assailing the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence submits that in the instance case there is no eye witness though P.W 2, P.W 5 and P.W 9 were accompanying the deceased at the time of occurrence and they failed to identify the accused-persons. He submits that judicial and extra judicial confession of condemned-prisoner Ashraf Ali can not be said true and voluntarily and same is the act of torture by the police. In support of his said submission he refers the deposition of P.W 17, Md. Nazmul Haque, the Magistrate, who recorded the statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and submits that from the cross-examination of said P.W 17, it would be evident that while accused-Ashraf Ali was on police remand he was seriously tortured and several marks of injury were found on his body. His further contention is that the conviction of condemned prisoner Ataur Rahman and Ashraf Ali can not be sustained as there are no corroborative evidence of alleged confessional statement of co-accused-Ashraf Ali and confession of an accused can not be treated as substantive price of evidence against another accused person and in support of his said contention he refers the case of Lutfun Nahar Begum –Vs- State reported in 27 DLR(AD), Page-53, the case of Babor Ali Molla and others –Vs- State, reported in 44 DLR(AD), Page-10, the case of Mofazzal Hossain Mollah and others –Vs- State, reported in 45 DLR(AD), Page-175, the case of Ustar Ali –Vs- State, reported in 3 BLC(AD), Page-53.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    Mr. Reza Uddin Khan, also submits that provision of sub-section (3) of section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is mandatory one and non filling of some column by the Magistrate is clear violation of the said law and failure to comply with the provision of law makes the confession of no value and any defect of it is not curable under section 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In this connection he also refers the case of Mrs. Jobaida Rashid –Vs- the State, reported in 1997 B.L.D, Page-352.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    Mr. Hafizur Rahman Khan, the State defence lawyer adopted the argument made by the learned Advocate Mr. Reza Uddin Khan and further submits that the Druta Bichar Tribunal acted illegally in convicting the accused-Saiful Islam and A. Jalil relying upon the confessional statement of accused-Ashraf Ali and the learned Tribunal also erred in law in holding that the circumstance of absconsion is a corroborative evidence of confessional statement and in this connection he refers the case of Amir Hossain Hawlader –Vs- the State reported in 1984 BLD(AD), Page-193 where Appellate Division held that mere abscondence is not corroboration. He also refers the cases cited by learned Advocate Mr. Reza Uddin Khan.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    Now let us scan the evidence on record to ascertain whether the learned Tribunal rightly awarded the conviction and sentence.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    P.W 1 Md. Abdul Malek Miah, the Officer-in-Charge of Naldanga Police Station in his deposition reiterated the statement made in the First Information Report and he proved the same and identified his signature on it as exhibits-1, 1/1, 1/2, 1/3.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    In his cross-examination he stated that he prepared the inquest report through S.I Abdul Hai. Wife and younger brother of the deceased did not lodge the First Information Report as their mental conditions were not found sound. He asked about the occurrence to the witnesses named in the First Information Report and prepared inquest report but the witnesses did not mention any name of suspected accused persons. In the First Information Report there was no name of any suspected accused-person.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    P.W 2 Md. Akter Hossain Mridha in his deposition stated that on 04.04.2003 at 1 O’clock at night he along with deceased Majedur Rahman Maju, Mohammad Ali Dewan, Aziz Mridha, Jabber Mridha were returning home after ending of <em>‘Islami Jalsha’.</em> Majedur Rahman was the chief guest of said ‘<em>Jalsha’ </em>and when they came 20-30 yards from the <em>Mosque</em>, they saw that two persons facing western side and two persons facing eastern side were sitting in a position as if they were making water. Then they asked them about their identity. In reply to that they said that they were in the “Shava” and Maju told them that he did not see them in “Shava” and thereafter he along with deceased Maju and others again started to walk and after sometimes he heard a sound like ‘W¡p' and when he looked back two persons came to him and asked him to remain silent, otherwise he would be killed but he managed to escape from the place of occurrence and went to the village and raised hue and cry and when the village people came forward, he asked them to go towards the rail line. He saw the slaughtered body of deceased Maju and he did not mention any name to the police.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    P.W 3 Most. Ferdosi Begum, wife of the deceased in her deposition narrated the First Information Report story and further stated that she heard the name of the accused persons from the villagers and she failed to disclose the name of the accused persons definitely. In cross she stated that P.W 2, Md. Akter Hossain and other witnesses who were accompanying her husband, disclosed the name of the accused persons and at the time of occurrence he was at Natore town and hearing the news she came to her home and saw the dead body in the morning.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    P.W-4 Md. Matinur Rahman alias Matu Mridha, the younger brother of the deceased, in his deposition stated that while he was in the house at the time of occurrence, one of his neighbour Fajila shouted ‘ও বাবা মাজুকে মেরে ফেলল’ and hearing the same he came out from the house and he went to the place of occurrence and found the dead body of Majidur Rahman on the road. He could not realize who killed his brother. Sometimes after the aforesaid occurrence, again in night some persons were focusing light from the side of ‘Halatir Bill’ towards their village while the village people, after the occurrence of the previous occurrence on 05.04.2003, had arranged for petrol duty (¢hV f¡q¡l¡) for there security and the village people apprehended accused-Asharaf Ali with a torch light and took him at the college field and where Ashraf disclosed and admitted that he was a party to the killing of Maju and Ripon was with him, who dealt a rod blow on the head of Maju and Ataur Rahman had slaughtered Maju by sharp cutting weapon. Shimul was also with him. Hasanuzzaman, Majibur Rahman Mridha, Momtaz and Wares had made a plan to kill the deceased Maju and for that purpose Ataur Rahman took Tk.1,00,000/- from Hasanuzzaman, Mozibur Rahman, Momtaz 4 (four) days before the occurrence and after 12 days of the said killing they also took Tk.1,00,000/- from Hasanuzzaman. This witness identified accused-Ashraf Ali on the dock. In cross-examination he stated that on reaching at the place of occurrence he found the dead body of his brother and he heard about the incident from Azizur Rahman Mridha, Akter Hossain and Mawlana Mohammad Ali. He was not available around when Ashraf was apprehended. He got the news from reading the news paper and Daroga about the confessional statement of Ashraf and he also heard from Ashraf directly about the said killing. He said that he might have given the statement on 30.05.2003 to the police and he could not remember when Ashraf made confessional statement.

They could not identify the accused persons neither at the time of the occurrence nor after the occurrence. The learned Druta Bichar Tribunal in fact awarded the conviction relying upon the Judicial and extra Judicial confession of condemned prisoner Ashraf Ali and the learned Tribunal found that the confessional statement of accused-Ashraf Ali made before the Magistrate was true and voluntarily, as the same was recorded by the P.W 17 Md. Nazmul Haque, Magistrate 1<sup>st</sup> Class with due compliance of law. <br/> <br/><strong>56.</strong>    Now let us consider whether the statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure made by condemned prisoner Ashraf Ali is true and voluntary one.<br/> <br/><strong>57.</strong>    From the cross-examination of P.W 17, the Magistrate, who recorded the statements under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, of condemned prisoner Ashraf Ali, it is manifested that when Ashraf Ali was produced on 11.06.2003 before him by the police after remand, several marks of injury were found on his body, although he stated that said injuries were caused on his person when he was apprehended by the villagers. This explanation of P.W 17 is not acceptable to us. When accused-Ashraf was first produced before him on 08.06.2003 in the order sheet he did not mention anything about such injury/ injuries and P.Ws 4, 7, 8, 12 and 16, who stated about the extra judicial confession made by the accused-Ashraf Ali, neither in their deposition nor in cross-examination they stated like that when accused-Ashraf Ali was apprehended by the villagers the unruly villagers assaulted accused-Ashraf Ali, but they deposed clearly and consistently that Ashraf Ali was taken by the police from college filed. <br/> <br/><strong>58.</strong>    P.W 20, the investigating officer in his cross-examination admitted that accused-Ashraf Ali was placed before him on 07.06.2003 at 15.10 by S.I. Zahangir Alam and A.S.I Asadul Haque. Said police officers were not produced before the Court and examined by the prosecution as P.Ws, which also creates doubt about the manner of very arrest of the condemned prisoner Ashraf Ali. If we carefully scrutinize the cross-examination of the P.W 17 and P.W 20, a reasonable suspicion would give rise in the mind of a prudent man that accused-Ashraf Ali might have been tortured, when he was under police remand. The confessional statement was allegedly made after 3 days of police remand and after remand when accused-Ashraf Ali was produced before the Magistrate, several marks of injury were found on his body and in such attending facts and circumstances of the case, the truth and voluntariness of the confessional statement, exhibit-5 becomes highly questionable and doubtful and it would not be safe and legal to convict a person relying upon only a such doubtful and questionable confessional statement and sentence him to death by awarding capital punishment.<br/> <br/><strong>59.</strong>    Moreover, it appears from exhibit-5, the confessional statement, that the recording Magistr-ate did not fill up the column Nos. 8, 9 and 10 of the form. Column No.8 of the form reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“8. Brief statement of Magistrate’s reason for believing that the statement was voluntarily, made. </em><br/><em>[Note.- Any complaints of ill-treatment of injuries noticed on the accused or referred to by the accused should appear under paragraphs 6 and 7 but should be specifically noticed here and the action taken by the Magistrate thereon should be mentioned. When the confession is recorded otherwise than in the Court building and during Court hours the Magistrate’s reasons are likewise to be recorded here.]”</em><br/>And column 10 of the form reads as follows:<br/><em>“10. The accused is forwarded to ………………..at.” </em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>60.</strong>    Regarding the non filling of the said columns of the form, the learned Deputy Attorney General referred the case of Salauddin –Vs- State, reported in 32 DLR(HC) Page-227 and submits that it is a mere irregularity and failure to comply with requirement of column 8, 9 and 10 of the form at best it will mean violation or non-compliance of same circulars and same is curable under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On the other hand the learned Advocate of the defence submits that the mandatory provision of law as contemplated in section 164(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been violated in not filling the said columns under the requirement of law and in support of his confession he referred to the case of Abul Hossain and others –Vs- The State, reported in 13 BLD, Page- 311wherein it has been held that:<br/>“This sub-section speaks of the manner as to how a confession of an accused is to be recorded by a Magistrate and this is a mandatory provision and failure to comply with it shall make the confession invalid and unreliable. This provision of law along with provisions of section 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires to be strictly observed and followed to make the confession voluntary and true in the real sense to be fit for reliance for convicting an accused on his confession.”<br/> <br/><strong>61.</strong>    Column 8 of the form bears important significant. A Magistrate after recording statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure should have given a certificate that it appears to him that the confession made by the accused is true and voluntary and in a case where mark of several injuries were found on the body of the accused person, he should have satisfied himself that the statement was true and voluntary and it was not the result/ act of any torture and he ought to have given a certificate in his own hand in column 8 of the form as to the truth and voluntariness of such statements and in not giving such certificate, in this particular case, also creates a doubt that the learned Magistrate might have recorded the confessional statement in a casual manner and mechanical way without making necessary endeavour to ascertain the truth and voluntariness of the statement. Column 10 is found blank, which is not desirable and it shows the non application of mind of the recording Magistrate. Omission to fill up column 10 of the Form creates a presumption that accused was under the threat of being sent back to the police remand instead of sending him in jail hajat. P.W 17, the recording Magistrate in his cross-examination admitted to the effect:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"আপনি দোষ স্বীকার না করলে পুনরায় পুলিশের কাছে দেয়া হবেনা  প্রশ্নে উল্লেখ নেই।''</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>62.    </strong>In such facts and circumstances is very difficult for us to hold that statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is voluntary one and same was recorded complying the mandatory provision of law.<br/> <br/><strong>63.</strong>    In this connection we may refer the case of Sarwan Singh Rattan Singh –Vs- State of Punjab, reported in P.L.D 1957(SC)555, where it has been observed as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The act of recording confession under Section 164 Criminal P.C. is a very solemn act and, in discharging his duties under Section 164, the Magistrate must take care to see that the requirements of sub-section (3) of Section 164 are fully satisfied. It would, of course, be necessary in every case to put the questions prescribed by the High Court circulars but the questions intended to be put under Sub-section(3) of Section 164 should not be allowed to become a matter of mere mechanical inquiry. No element of casualness should be allowed to creep in and the Magistrate should be fully satisfied that the confessional statement which the accused wants to make is in fact and in substance voluntary. The whole object of putting questions to an accused person who offers to confess is to obtain an assurance of the fact that the confession is not caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person as mentioned in section 24 Evidence Act.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>64.</strong>    In case of Mrs. Jobaida Rashid –Vs- State, reported in 17 B.L.D, Page-352 their Lordships held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Columns 3, 4 and 8 of the prescribed form for recording confessions have not been filled up by the Magistrate. Therefore this piece of paper (confessional statement of the petitioner) is highly doubtful having no credibility and as such unworthy of consideration by any Court.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>65.</strong>    In the case of Mst. Saida Begum –Vs- The State, reported in P.L.D 1958(Lahore) Page,559, wherein it has been observed as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Beside putting the set questions the Magistrate is required to make a real endeavor to find out the voluntary nature of confession, it is a solemn duty which should be performed with great care and caution, and not mechanically.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>66.</strong>    Having discussed as above and considered the above reported cases together with the cross-examination of P.W.17, the recording Magistrate and P.W 20, the investigating officer and the statement of accused-Ashraf Ali before the Court at the time of examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, we are of the view that the exhibit-5, the confessional statement is not true and voluntary one and the Magistrate recorded it mechanically and failed to perform his solemn duty.<br/> <br/><strong>67.</strong>    Now let us consider how far the extrajudicial confession of condemned prisoner Ashraf would be taken to consideration as evidence in the facts and circumstances of the present case.<br/> <br/><strong>68</strong>.    P.W 4 Md. Matinur Rahman, in his cross-examination stated to the effect:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“তবে ঘটনার দেড় মাস ২ মাস পার হতে পারে। মাধনগর ডিগ্রী কলেজে সে স্বীকার করেছিল। তখন আজিজুর রহমান, আকতার হোসেন, মোহাম্মদ আলী দেওয়ান ছিলনা।”<br/><br/>And P.W 7 Md. Azizul Haque alias Madhu in his cross-examination stated to the effect:<br/>“আমরা যারা বিটে ছিলাম তাদের নাম বলতে পারি। আসামীকে কলেজ মাঠে নিয়ে আসি। তখন প্রন্সিপাল, আজিজুর রহমান মৃধা ছিলনা। আঃ জîার, ফেরদৌসী বেগম ছিলনা। মাতেনুর রহমান ছিলেন। মওলানা মোহাম্মদ আলী ছিলেন কিনা জানি না। ------- আমাকে দারোগা জিজ্ঞেস করলে তাকে বলেছি। এর পূর্বে আসামী স্বীকার করেছে আমি কাউকে বলিনি। আমি গ্রামের লোককে বলিনি।''<br/><br/>And P.W 8 Md. Sabed Ali, in his cross-examination stated to the effect:<br/>“মাঠে আসামী আশরাফকে ধরার পর আমাদের কাছে স্বীকার করে। আসামী ধরা পরার পর দারোগা পরবর্তীতে জবানবন্দি নেয়। তখন আসামী আশরাফ স্বীকার করে তখন আজিজুর রহমান আঃ জîার মৃধা ছিল। তারা ঘটনা শুনেছে। তখন মৃতের সত্রী ছিল। মওলানা মোহাম্মদ আলী দেওয়ান ছিল। প্রিন্সিপাল আফাজ উদ্দিন ছিল। তারাও শোনে আমিও শুনি।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>69.</strong>    P.W 12 Md. Siddique in his cross-examination stated to the effect:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"দারোগা এসে কলেজ মাঠ থেকে আশরাফকে দিয়ে যায়। তখন  আক্তার, আজিজুর, মাতিনুর, মহাম্মদ আলী, আফাজ উদ্দিন, সোলায়মান, বেলাল হোসেন ছিল। সবেদ আলী ছিল। মধু ছিল।''</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>70.    </strong>From the said evidence, it manifests that the witnesses made contradictory statements regarding the presence of witnesses, in whose presence the alleged extrajudicial confession was made.<br/> <br/><strong>71.</strong>    Further P.W 12 Md. Siddique admitted in his cross-examination that he was examined by the police after 2 months of the arrest of accused-Ashraf Ali. P.W 20, the Investigating Office in his cross-examination admitted to the effect:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"আমি ৭/৬/২০০৩ তারিখ থেকে ১১/৬/২০০৩ তারিখ সময়ের মধ্যে যারা আসামী আশরাফকে ধরেছিল ও আশরাফ তাদের সামনে স্বীকার করেছিল তাদের ১৬১ ঐ সময়ের মধ্যে করিনিz ১১/০৬/২০০৩ তারিখ আসামী আশরাফ আলীর ম্যাজিষ্ট্রেটের কাছে জবানবন্দি দেয়ার পর সাক্ষীদের ১৬১ করেছি।''</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>72.</strong>    This delay in recording the statement under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of witnesses particularly P.W 4, 7, 8 and 12, who stated about the extrajudicial confessional of Accused-Ashraf Ali, renders their evidence shaky and chance of embellishment can not be ruled out. It also appears to us that P.W 4, 7, 8, 12 and 16 narrated the extra judicial confession of the Ashraf Ali in different way and the said witnesses contradict each other. In view of the above discussion, we are of the opinion that the learned Judge of Druta Bichar Tribnal acted illegally relying upon the alleged extra judicial confession of accused- Ashraf Ali which was not corroborated by any other legal evidence.<br/> <br/><strong>73.</strong>    We have already found exhibit-5, the confessional statement of accused-Ashraf Ali is not true and voluntarily and not free from doubt and thus the questionable extrajudicial confession of Ashraf Ali can not be said a corroborative evidence of the same and as such the conviction of accused-Ashraf Ali relying upon those is unwarranted in law.<br/> <br/><strong>74.</strong>    As we have already discarded the judicial and extrajudicial confession of accused-Ashraf Ali as legal evidence, the conviction of other accused namely Ataur Rahman, Ashraf alias Raja Saiful Islam alias Ripon and A. Jail alias Simul relying on the same can not be sustained. Further it is well settle principle of law that confession of an accused can not be treated as substantive evidence against another accused but that it can only be used to lend assurance to other evidence. In this connection we can rely upon the case of Lutfun Nahar Begum –Vs- The State, reported in 27 DLR(AD), Page 29, Babor Ali Molla and other –Vs- State, reported in 44 DLR(AD), Page 10 and the case of Ustar Ali -Vs-State, reported in 3 BLC(AD), Page 53 respectively.<br/> <br/><strong>75.    </strong>In the instant case we found that there was absolutely no legal and trust worthy evidence against any of the non-confessing accused persons and total absence of such legal and trust worthy evidence against them, the confession of their co-accused persons could not be collect in aid to lend assurance to non-existent evidence on which conviction could be passed and thus, the conviction of accused-Ataur Rahman, Ashraf @ Raja, Saiful Islam @ Ripon and A Jalil @ Simul relying upon the confessional statements of co-accused Ashraf Ali is illegal and same can not be sustainable in law.<br/> <br/><strong>76.    </strong>In the case of Amir Hossain Hawlader –Vs- The State, reported in 1984 BLD(AD), Page 193, it has been observed as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In the case of Gul Hassan and another V. The State, PLD 1969 SC 89, the absconsion of an accused was considered to be a corroborating evidence against him, but in that case there was no confessional statement of any co-accused in support of which absconsion of another accused was held to be a corroborating evidence. In that case, one Karim Khan was shot dead by one of the accused within the sight of three witnesses who gave direct evidence that one of the accused had fired a double barrel gun and another accused a pistol after which they absconded. In that case the absconsion was considered to be corroboration to the direct evidence of the eye-witnesses connecting the accused with the murder. Reference to this case has no bearing with the question raised in the instant case. In the case of Md. Bashir V.l The State, Supreme Court Monthly Report (1970) Voll. III, 351, the assailant shot the victim with a pistol, pursued him when the latter ran and again fired two shots and then absconded; he was arrested from a distant place and his absconsion was held to be corroboration of the direct evidence of four witnesses who claimed to have seen him firing upon the deceased victim. In the case of Md. Rafiq V. The State, PLD (1974) SC 65 the assailant killed his victim by firing a pistol thrice, absconded and was arrested after a year from a distant place; his absconsion was considered to be a corroboration to the direct evidence of three witnesses who claimed to have seen him firing the pistol shots. I fail to understand why these cases have been cited by the learned Deputy Attorney General seeking corroboration in this case of the confessional statement of Sattar Mir so as to implicate thereby these appellants who absconded but against whom there is no evidence except the co-accused Sattar’s confession. No decision could be cited by the learned Deputy Attorney General showing that the absconsion of an accused has been held to be corroboration to the confessional statement of another accused so as to base thereon conviction of the absconding accused.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>77.</strong>        In view of the said observation of our Appellate Division we are of the opinion that in the attending facts and circumstance of the instant case the absconsion of accused-Saiful Islam and Abdul Jalil can not be treated as corroborative evidence of judicial and extrajudicial confession of accused-Ashraf Ali, in absence of any other direct evidence.<br/> <br/><strong>78.</strong>        The learned State defence lawyer submits that notification as per provision of section 339B(1) of Code of Criminal Procedure published in Daily Ajker Kagoj News Paper is defective one as the police station case number had wrongly mentioned in the notification. We have perused the notification published in the newspaper and found that in the notification Police Station case number had been mentioned as Nator Police Station but the present case is Naldanga Police Station Case No.3 dated 05.04.2003. Thus, this notification can not be said a proper and legal notification and subsequent proceeding is illegal and it vitiates the trial, so far the absconding accused persons are concerned.  <br/> <br/><strong>79.</strong>        In the instant case convict Ashraf Ali and Ataur Rahman at the time of examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure made statement in support of their innocence and also as to their respective confessional statement, but the learned Druta Bichar Tribunal did not at all take notice of those and did not consider the same with reference to the evidence on record. The learned Tribunal is not justified in ignoring the statements of the said accused persons recorded under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and by such non-consideration the merit of the case had been materially affected.<br/> <br/><strong>80.</strong>        In view of our above discussion we hold without any hesitation that the learned Druta Bichar Tribunal erred in law in passing the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence and we are inclined to interfere which the same.<br/> <br/><strong>81.</strong>        Accordingly, the Death Reference No.96 of 2005 is hereby rejected. Criminal Appeal No.3243 of 2005 and Jail Appeal No.768 of 2005, 769 of 2005 and 770 of 2005 are allowed. The impugned judgment and order dated 05.07.2005 passed by the learned Judge, Druta Bichar Tribunal; Rajshahi in Druta Bichar Tribunal Case No.16 of 2005 is hereby set aside. All the convicts are acquitted from the charge brought against them and the condemned prisoners are set at liberty at once, if not wanted in connection with any other case.               <br/> <br/><strong>82.</strong>        The learned State defence lawyer submits that the conviction warrant issued by the Trial Court against the absconding accused-Saiful Islam alias Ripon  son of A. Jabber, and A. Jalil alias Shimul son of late Kapir Mondal, may be withdrawn. On submission of the learned State defence lawyer, the trial Court is directed to re-call the conviction warrant issued earlier against the above named absconding accused-Saiful Islam alias Ripon and Abdul Jalil alias Shimul.<br/><br/>Send down the lower Court record at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
