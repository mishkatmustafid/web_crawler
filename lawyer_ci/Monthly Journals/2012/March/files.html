It appears that appointment of Mutwalliship in the absence of any deed has been continued through linenal decendants. The Administrator of wakf has althrough been recognizing the Wakf a private Wakf and the right of Mutwalliship is belonging to the decendants of the great saint and the Wakf is being maintained through the Mutwalli nominated by the said beneficiaries of the Wakf.   ....(2,3,6, to 8)</strong><br/><br/><em>35 DLR (AD) 108</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Mr. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 120px;"><em>.....For the petitioner</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 120px;"><em>....For the respondent no. 2.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong> <br/><span style="font-size:14px">Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1398 of 2003</span></strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:22px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><u><strong>Mohammad Fazlul Karim, J.</strong></u><br/> <br/><strong>1.</strong>         This petition for leave to appeal at the instance of Alhaj Md. Chowdhury Alam, Commissioner , Ward No. 56, Dhaka City Corporation and Secretary, Pir Yameni Market Shop Owners Association and others is directed against the judgment and order dated 25.5.2003 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 1350 of 2003.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>         The respondent No. 1 as the writ petitioner moved the High Court Division challenging the Memo No. O: Pro: Dha: U/239(6) dated 7.1.2003 issued by the petitioner No. 2, the Administrator of Waqf of Bangladesh Constituting the managing committee of Hazrat Malek Pir Yameni (R) Nazar Waqf Estate (E.C No. 11276) stating, inter alia, that Hazrat Malek Shah Pir Yameni  (R) Mazar Waqf Estate (E.C. No. 11276) has been run and managed by members of writ petitioner’s family since its creation. The first Mutwalli of the said Waqf  Estate was Mohammad Raja Shah, after his death his son Samiruddin Shah was the Mutwalli and after the death of said Samiruddin Shah, his son Bashiruddin Shah was Mutwalli and therafter son of Bashiruddin Shah and father of the writ petitioner Bashiruddin Shah was Mutwalli till his death. That it was also stated that Serajuddin Shah nominated the writ petitioner as his successor-in-Mutwalli during his tenure of Mutwalliship of the Estate and vested the responsibilities of managing the affairs of the Waqf Estate  and since then the writ petitioner is performing his duties as Mutwalli as if a successor nominated by the predecessor in office. Moreover, writ petitioner was making correspondences with the respondent No. 2 and other persons. That while the writ petitioner is performing his duties as mentioned Mutwalli of the said Waqf Estate , his father Serajuddin Shah Died on 22.1.2002 and the writ petitioner as nominated Mutwalli filed an application before the respondent No. 2 annexing a power of attorney of the members of the family of his father for approval of his nomination as Mutwalli by his deceased father. That the father of the writ petitioner developed the Waqf Estate by constructing a multi-storied market building and allotted the same to different shop keepers who are the tenants of the Waqf Estate and some land are lying vacant behind the said market building and another market building could be constructed. The petitioner as a designated Mutwalli is trying to do so and some tenants of the Estate are making obstruction to the said program to have illegal gain. The respondent Nos. 4 and 5 of the writ petition are creating serious obstruction hampering the development work and also interfering with the normal affairs and management of the Waqf Estate. That when the writ petitioner was waiting for approval of his Mutwalliship the respondent No. 2 of the writ petition all on a sudden issued a letter vide Memo No.O:Pro:Dha:U:239(6) dated 07.01.2003 violating the law and constituted a Managing Committee of 6 members making the respondent Nos 4 and 5 of the writ petition as Chairman Secretary respectively of the said Committee and the writ petitioner was made a member of the said Committee.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>         The High Court Division made the rule absolute declaring the impugned order to have been passed without lawful authority and setting aside the same and directing the Administrator of Waqf petitioner No. 2 to appoint the respondent No. 1 as the Mutwalli of the Waqf Estate to manage the same forthwith.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>         Mr. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that having regard to the fact that there is no deed of Waqf or other instrument relating to the instant Waqf spelling out mode of succession to the office of Mutwalli and in view of definition of Mutwalli provided in section 2(6) of the Waqf Ordinance, 1962 and the provision of section 43 and 44  thereof the High Court Division has erred in making the rule absolute . The learned  Counsel further submitted that Mutwalli of the instant public Waqf having been appointed by the Waqf Administrator whenever there had been a vacancy, exercising authority under section 43 of the Ordinance  and there being no legal obligation to appoint any one from the family of the last Mutwalli, High Court Division has erred in making a direction to the petitioner as the Mutwalli on the principle enunciated in the case reported in 35 DLR (AD) 108. The learned Counsel lastly submitted that the Estate is a public Waqf without any instrument to govern appointment/succession of Mutwalli, family members of the last having no special claim to the office in preference to any other, High Court Division has erred in terming such others as “stranger” to give preference to the petitioner.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>         Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent No. 1 has, however, submitted that in view of the appointment of Mutwalli of Waqf Estate through linenal descendents and that there is no objection of the beneficiaries to the appointment of a competent linenal descendent as a Mutwalli of the Waqf Estate, the 6 Member Committee constituted by the Administrator of the Waqf is illegal, malafide and without jurisdiction in presence of full ,capable and competent members of the Waqf family for appointment as a mutwalli out of them.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>         It appears from the record that Hazrat Malek Shah Pir Yameni (R) Mazar Waqf Estate was enrolled for the first time with the Administrator of Waqf by order dated 29.11.1947 as EC No. 11276 ; though there is no Waqf deed but Mohammad Raja Shah was the first Mutwalli of the said enrolled Waqf Estate being a member of Waqif’s family. After his death his son Samiruddin Shah was the Mutwalli and after his death his son Bashiruddin Shah was the Mutwalli and after his death his son Serajuddin Shah become Mutwalli. During his life time he was illegally removed as a Mutwalli by the Administrator of Waqif for which he moved the High Court Division wherein the rule was discharged ; against which he moved  the Appellate Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1175 of 1999 and leave was granted but during the pendency of the appeal, appeal abated. The writ petitioner was nominated by the heirs including Serajuddin Shah as Mutwalli of the Waqf to succeed him and he had been carrying on the day to day business during ailment of his father and also filed an application for his appointed as Mutwalli to the Administrator of Waqf mostly illegally by memo dated 7.1.2003 constituted a 6 Member Committee for Managing Director of the Administrator of Waqf Estate.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>         Mr. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed though alleged that the Waqf Estate is a public Waqf  and referred to C.S. Khatian showing that the same as Lakharaj Waqf of Salimullah and used to manage by Court of  Wards appertaining to District Dhaka Mouza Sadar J.L. Khatian No. 16817 P.S. Kotowalli Pargana Jahangirnagar, Touji No. 5227 Khatian Mighata under certain Plots being therein Nos. 177, 178, 179, 180, 189, the description of which pucca building cutcha road D.V.  pond and  D.B. but subsequently the subject -matter of the said Waqf estate centering round the Mazar of Hazrat Malek Shah and its adjuncts was enrolled as a Waqf Estate being E.C. No. 11278 and that appointment of Mutwalliship in the absence of  any deed has been continued through linenal decendants.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>         The Administrator of Waqf has althrough been recognizing the Waqf as a private Waqf and the right to Mutwalliship is belonging to the decendents of the great saint and the Waqf is being maintained through the Mutwalli nominated by the said beneficiaries of the Waqf.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>         In view of the above, we do not find any substance in the submission of the learned Counsel for the petitioner.<br/> <br/>The petition is, accordingly, dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> <br/> </div></div></div>

Moazzam Husain, J.</strong></u><br/> <br/>          This rule was issued at the instance of the plaintiffs calling in question the judgment and order dated 11.3.2008 passed by the joint district judge, , 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka in Misc. Case No. 30 of 2007 under Order IX rule  13 of the Code of Civil Procedure (“the Code” for short) setting aside a decree passed <em>ex parte  </em>in Title Suit No. 724 of 1985.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>   The case, technically though, concerns nothing more than a question of legality of an order of restoration of a suit earlier decreed <em>ex parte, fitness of things requires </em>an extensive treatment of the plaint.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>    The suit is for declaration of title and recovery of <em>khas</em> possession of 5.18 acre land described in schedule “B” of the plaint which forms part of 7.25 acre land in mauza Sahar Dhaka (latterly Mauza Ramna).  The land appertaining to the suit <em>khatian</em> originally belonged to one Gobinda Chanra Basak, shortly, “GC Basak”. His name was initially shown in the CS record as ga¨mZ¡vwaKvix out of mistake. Later by a correction case No. 24 of 1918 under section 198A of Bengal Tenancy Act his right was recorded as ‘owner-in-possession’. G C Basak settled 5.18 acre agricultural land out of the land of said <em>khatian</em> with Gowranga Chandra Das, the original plaintiff and one Md. Noor Hossain, his benamdar by an <em>amalnama</em> executed on 24rh Falgun, 1339 BS which is covered by CS plot Nos. 36, 40, 47, 48, 52 and 82 as described in schedule B at an annual rent of Tk. 57/-.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>   As the right of said G C Basak was wrongly recorded in the <em>amalnama as</em> ga¨mZ¡vwaKvix the <em>amalnama</em> was defective as such the same was cancelled on 18<sup>th</sup> Chaitra, 1339 BS by said GC Basak by way of making an endorsement on the back of the same and on the same day he issued a fresh <em>amalnama</em> in favour of plaintiff No.1 and his <em>benamdar</em> granting settlement of said B schedule land in favour of Plaintiff No.1 (since dead) on acceptance of rent and granted rent receipt therefor. Accordingly said GC Basak delivered possession of the suit land to plaintiff No.1.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     It appeared that the whole area of suit land <em>was not covered by </em>CS plot Nos. 40, 48 and 36.  GC Basak upon a wrong impression executed <em>amalnama</em> by reference to the said plots only.  Surveyor was appointed by both in 1944 who submitted report on 5.3.1944 which revealed that area of plot Nos. 40 and 48 was wrongly recorded in the <em>khatian</em> as 4.00 acre and 1.75 acre respectively instead of 2.61 and 1.55 acre respectively.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>    It was then detected that the land settled with the plaintiffs had been wrongly described in the <em>amalnama</em>. GC Basak accordingly corrected his mistake in the description of the land settled with the plaintiff by inserting plot numbers in the <em>dakhila</em> granted by him and thus confirmed his settlement of schedule B land in favour of the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>      One Azizul Hoque, father of plaintiff No. 2 contributed 1/10<sup>th</sup> of the <em>salami</em> of the settlement pursuant to which plaintiff no.1 transferred .48 acre land by executing a <em>nadabipatra</em> in favour of plaintiff No. 2.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>    Since settlement plaintiff No. 1 has been in possession of the B schedule land as a tenant by paying rent to the <em>sherista</em> of GC Basak upto 1362 BS.  He did the act of possession by rearing and caching fish in low-lying area while in the remaining land he used to grow crops sometimes by himself and sometimes through <em>bargadars</em>. He also developed a portion of land by spending huge amount of money. GC Basak left for Calcutta around 1359 BS where he died shortly thereafter. His only son Rashik Lal Basak also permanently settled in India. The property belonging to GC Basak used to be looked after by Sudhangshu Shekhor Chatterjee who also left the country after acquisition of rent receiving interest. In the aforesaid premises the plaintiffs acquired an indefeasible title in B schedule property by virtue of settlement and by adverse possession in assertion of hostile title for a period much more that 12 years.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>   During SA operation the suit land was wrongly recorded in the name of the government and C &amp; B department of the government. Plaintiff No. 1 filed an objection case, No. 2079 of 1963, under Rule 30 of the SAT Rules, and the Settlement Officer passed an order dated 16.5.1963 for correction of record by opening a separate <em>khatian </em>in the name of the plaintiff No.1 and his <em>benamdar</em> said Noor Hossain in respect of plot Nos. 512 and 570 measuring an area of 3.00 acre and 1.76 acre land respectively. Unfortunately said order of the ASO was not complied with and the defendant Nos, 1, 3-30 recorded their names in the SA <em>khatian</em> by undue influence. Plaintiff having come to learn about such recording filed three objection cases on 16.6.1978 bearing Nos. 10, 11 and 12 of 1978.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    In course of the proceedings plaintiff came to know that defendant Nos. 10-17 obtained a decree dated 7.2.1975 in Title Suit No.  31 of  1966 from 6<sup>th</sup> Court of Munsif, Dhaka,   for permanent injunction in respect of .98 acre land of CS plot No. 40 against the government and another on the plea of settlement taken from Rashik Lal which was affirmed in appeal although the plaintiff was the rightful owner and have all along been in possession of the same. The said decree is fraudulent and collusive.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    The defendant No. 1  served notice in 1980 upon defendant Nos. 3-9 under Act X of 1953 for surrendering possession of 20 acre of CS plot Nos. 82; .17 acre of CS plot No. 1 and .15 acre of CS plot No. 48 treating the same as government <em>khas</em> land and the said defendant  Nos.3-9  instituted Title Suit No. 37 of 1981 in the 5<sup>th</sup>  Court of Sub Judge, Dhaka, for permanent injunction on the plea that they got the land by <em>korfa</em> settlement from Rashik Lal and Mohadev Chandra Goala. They got .70 acre of the disputed CS plot 40 by <em>amalnama</em> and <em>dakhila. This </em>claim of the said defendants on the basis of <em>amalnama</em>/<em>dakhila</em> <em>is</em> false as those documents are forged. Rashik Lal or Mohadev had no saleable/transferable rights in the suit land. Said suit is still pending.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    In the first part of 1975 defendant No.2 with police force dispossessed the plaintiffs from the disputed land measuring 5.18 acre described in C- schedule land. In the early part of February, 1978 defendant Nos. 3-6 who have their residential houses on the land adjacent  to plot 40 and 82 started encroaching upon the disputed land and by now encroached .90 acre of the suit land; .17 acre from CS plot No. 48; 28 decimal from plot No. 82 ie, total 1. 26 acre land described in schedule D. Their claim of settlement from Rashik Lal or Mohadev Goala or Kashem is false.  They are in wrongful possession of the suit land.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>   Defendant No.11, another person having no title to the suit land raised a tin-shed in 1981 with <em>pacca</em> plinth on .03 acre of the disputed land and constructed another structure in the middle of plot No. 40 described in schedule No. E and delineated in the sketch map attached and marked as Y of the plaint.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>   In collusion with defendant-2, said defendant being an employee of Dhaka Municipal Corporation managed to mutate his name under holding No. 5/6 Topkhana Road .Defendant No.12 also being an employee of said corporation managed to have another holding number ie, 6/5 Topkhana Road in his name without having title and possession therein.  He has raised another CI sheet structure attached to the structure of defendant No-11 in the last part of 1982.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>  That defendant No 31-40 every now and then trying to enter into the B- schedule land and threatening the tenants of the plaintiff with dispossession. Some of them are claiming that they have purchased the portions of land in plot 40 and 48 described in schedule B from defendant No-11.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    The land described in schedule C, D and E comprises the whole of the land described in schedule B.  Cause of action of the suit has arisen in last part of 1975 and then on 16.6.1978. The property is agricultural low land and value of which is Tk. 5 (five) crore.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    The case sought to be canvassed by the plaintiff-petitioners before us is that  defendant No.1 appeared in the suit on 16.9.85 and took several adjournments for filing Written Statements (‘WS’ for short) but ultimately did not file any. Finally, the petitioners got a compromise decree on 28.11.99. The decree was put to execution in Execution Case No. 31(G)/2000 in the court of Subordinate Judge Artha Rin Adalat, 3, Dhaka. Summons of the execution case was duly served upon the defendant Nos.1 and 2 on 9.2.02 and 14.02.02 respectively and they appeared on 25.3.03 and contested the execution case. Subsequently the said execution case was transferred to the court of Joint District Judge 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka, and renumbered as Execution Case No. 12 of 2003.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>   On 3.4.07 defendant No. 1 filed Miscellaneous case No.6 of 2007 in the execution court under Order IX rule 13 of the CPC for setting aside the <em>ex parte</em> decree stating, <em>inter</em> <em>alia,</em> that the summons/notices of the suit was not duly served upon the defendant government; plaintiff  successfully sidetracked the government and obtained a compromise decree in collusion with some other  set up defendants; government  having come to know about the execution case appeared on 26.2.2005 and came to learn about the fraudulent compromise  decree dated 28.11.1999 and for setting aside the said <em>ex-parte</em> decree filed the instant Miscellaneous Case which was renumbered on transfer as Miscellaneous Case No. 30 of 2007.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>   Plaintiffs contested the miscellaneous case filing written objection wherein they have denied all the allegations made in the Miscellaneous Case.  In the written objection the maintainability of the same was challenged in terms of its form and manner including its non-maintainability on the score of limitation. Plaintiffs seriously objected to the plea of the government raised in terms of its absence of knowledge and stated that the government contested the suit for long 14 years from 16.9.1985 to 26.6.1998 and took numerous adornments  for filing written statement in the suit , though finally did not file written statement. Government also appeared on 25.3.2003 in the execution case filed by the plaintiffs and continued upto 11.8.2003 taking adjournments. Long thereafter, ie, on 26.2.2005 government filed an application informing the execution court that it would file Miscellaneous Case against the <em>ex-parte</em> decree passed in TS No, 113 of 1999. Two years 2 months thereafter the instant Miscellaneous Case under Order IX rule 13 of the CPC was filed by suppressing material facts only to deprive the plaintiffs of the fruit of decree they got through sustained legal battle. <br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    The miscellaneous case was heard by Mr. M.S. Saiful Islam, Joint District Judge 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka, who allowed the same by his order dated 11.03.08 and restored the suit to its original file and number by setting aside the decree <em>ex-parte</em> which is impugned before us.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    During hearing of the instant revisional application a supplementary affidavit was filed on behalf of the petitioners bringing on records a number of documents, namely, certified copy of the judgment passed in Title Suit No. 550 of 1984 filed by one A. Malek Hawladar &amp; otheres against the government and others (Annexure-G) in which another Title Suit ie, Title Suit No. 551 of 1984 was also disposed of; certified copy of the decree passed in Title  Suit  No. 550 of 1984 (Annexure-G-1); certified copy  of the common  judgment  and  decree  passed  in  Title  Appeal  Nos. 52  and  53  of 1985 preferred  by  the  government  against  the judgment and decrees passed  in aforesaid  two suits (Annexure-H); appellate decree (Annexure-H-1);  certified copy of the judgment  passed  in Civil Revision  No. 531 and 532 of 1988 by a Single Bench of the High Court Division preferred by the government against the aforesaid appellate decrees (Annexure-I) and a judgment and order dated 12.3.1992 passed by the Appellate Division in Civil Petition No. 224 and 225 of 1991 filed at the instance of the government challenging the aforesaid judgment and order of the High Court Division(Annexure-J).<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    By   all these documents what the present petitioners basically tried to show that the <em>amalnama</em> on the basis of which the present suit was filed was one upon which other persons claimed their respective title against the government and others in respect of some portions of the land of suit khatian and succeeded up to the Appellate Division.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>     A counter-Affidavit was filed on behalf of the Government (OP-1) wherein it is stated, amongst other things, that the original suit was twice renumbered and the third time when the same was renumbered as Title Suit No. 113(G) of 1999 no notice was given to the government or its pleader. It was further stated that 26.10.1998 was fixed for hearing of the suit but the plaintiff took adjournment. The next date was fixed on 24.11.1998 for final hearing but records were not produced before the court on that date. Meanwhile the suit was transferred by the District Judge to another court by his order dated 02.11.1998 of which no notice was received by the government. Thus keeping the government in dark a compromise decree was obtained practicing fraud upon court. Learned judge, therefore, committed no illegality in allowing the miscellaneous case.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>   Mr. Khalilur Rahman, learned Advocate, appearing for the petitioners, submits that government admittedly contested the suit for 14 years and then appeared in the execution case. At a stage of the execution case government informed the court that it would file miscellaneous case for restoration of the suit. Long two years thereafter government filed the instant Miscellaneous Case under Order IX rue 13 of the Code for setting aside the decree passed <em>ex-parte</em> against it that too without filing any petition under section 5 of the Limitation Act explaining the delay incurred in filing the same. He submits that after contesting the suit and execution case for so many years it does not lie in the mouth of the opposite party that the decree was passed behind its back. Mr. Rahman seriously raised the contention that the learned judge while sitting over an application under Order IX rule 13 of the Code has traveled beyond his jurisdiction and dwelt in the merit of the case which is not permissible in law.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>   Mr. Mahbub-e-Alam, learned Attorney General, appeared on behalf of the Government and submited before us that a bare glance through the records of the suit, way of prosecution, nature of claim set up and sudden culmination of design in a compromise decree <em>ipso facto</em> suggest that this is a suit filed at the behest of a land grabbers syndicate operating in Dhaka city who having taken a decree <em>ex parte</em> resort to blackmail and earn money.  It is not unlikely, he argued, that a class of government and court insiders has tacit involvement in the deal. It is not also unlikely, he stressed, that the plaintiffs, ie, the present petitioners who claim to be sons of Gauranga are imposters set up by those gang masters. He drew our attention to the peculiar facts of the instant case. The case, he submitted, was filed in 1985 and continued upto 1999 without any positive steps taken for its speedy disposal as is usually done by a <em>bona fide</em> claimant.  Firstly one Gauranga and one Syed Maynul  Hoque as plaintiffs  and after alleged death of Gauranga two other persons claiming to be his sons along with said Maynul Hoque allowed the suit to be continued for more than  14 years without showing any efforts put in for disposal. Records, as learned Attorney General pointed out,   will suggest that they spent more than a decade just in a wait for an opportune moment. They finally came out successful in getting the suit transferred to another court keeping the government in dark. And under a new and peculiar number managed to obtain a compromise decree in collusion with the set up defendants behind the back of the government though government is the principal defendant in the suit.  Learned Attorney General contended that the sequence of events as is evident in the impugned order also, will suggest that the <em>ex-parte</em> decree against the Government was effected by practicing fraud upon the court and the government.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>    Learned Attorney General further pointed out that 5.18 acre  land situated in the city centre, ie, in Ramna <em>Mauja</em> and admittedly recorded in the <em>khas</em> khatian of the government. He apprised us that there are at least four important public buildings and installations situated in the suit land including old bungalows built during British period.  The claimants of the entire invaluable property are mainly two persons of village Sreedharpur, Munshiganj posing to be sons of one late Gauranga Chandra Das so-called original plaintiff by virtue of an unregistered <em>amalnama</em> of 1339 BS which did not work out on account of series of mistakes and finally rested in a <em>dakhila</em> allegedly granted by GC Basak. In view of the peculiarities, he contended, the suit itself is meritless, frivolous and not maintainable. If the government is not given a chance to contest the suit multiplicity of litigation will follow.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>    It appears from records, that the suit was pursued for more than a decade without any noticeable concern of the plaintiff for ending it up. The suit was fixed on 26.10.1998 for hearing but the plaintiff took adjournment. Learned court fixed 24.11.1998 for final hearing.  There was no trace in the conduct of the plaintiff indicating loss of confidence in the court. On the date fixed for final hearing of the suit the records were found not available before court. This seems to be unusual. Meanwhile on 2.11.1998 the suit was   transferred by the District Judge to a new court seemingly beyond the knowledge of the trial court. And in the new court under a new and peculiar number it was decreed on compromise on 28.11.1999 allegedly beyond knowledge of the government the principal defendant in the suit. We have good reasons to believe that this episode was staged surreptitiously keeping both the government and the courts in dark. Our suspicion is hardened by a statement made in paragraph No. 10 of the revisional application. A portion of the paragraph reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“10. That it is stated that title suit No. 42 of 1988 was transferred vide administrative order of the learned District Judge, as such, no notice is required to be served upon either parties of the suit...”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>28.</strong>     A bare reading of the statement <em>per se</em> suggests that the suit was transferred by the learned District Judge within the knowledge of the plaintiffs of which no information passed to  the government nor was the trial court  aware of the transfer at least  upto the date of  final hearing  fixed by it. The plea of “transfer by administrative order” taken by the plaintiff-petitioners lends colour to the claim of the Government that the transfer was made behind its back. <br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>      Transfer of a suit pending for trial before a competent court is a judicial act to be done judicially allowing reasonable opportunity to the parties to be heard. Should any exigency arise necessitating <em>suo</em> <em>motu</em> transfer of any suit or proceedings or a class of suits or proceedings from one court to another it must of necessity be done in a manner that the parties cannot reasonably plead ignorance.<br/> <br/><strong> 30.</strong>     Be that as it may, the instant suit is found to be  transferred and  renumbered as Title Suit No. 113(G) of 1999, which, as the learned Attorney General rightly pointed out, is a peculiar number which  finally ended in decree on compromise as against some and <em>ex-parte</em> as against the government. The facts around transfer made for whatever reasons is unclear and the ignorance pleaded by the government is fairly justifiable.<br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong>    In this respect few lines from the impugned judgment of the learned Joint District Judge are relevant:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">".....নথি পর্যালোচনায় দেখা যায় যে মূল দেওয়ানী ৭২৪/৮৫ নং মোকদ্দমাটি বদলী সূত্রে দেঃ ৪২/৮৮ (১ম সাবজজ আদালত) নং মোকদ্দমায় সূচীত হয় এবং পরবর্তীতে আবার বদলী সূত্রে অত্রাদালতের দেওয়ানী ১১৩/৯৯ (জি) নং মোকদ্দমায় সূচীত হয়। নথি পর্যালোচনায় দেখা যায় যে  মজহর সরকার পক্ষ তদকালীন প্রথম সাবজজ আদালতে দেঃ ৪২/৮৮ নং মোকদ্দমায় ২৬/১০/১৯৯৮ তারিখ পর্যমত্ম আদালতে মামলায় হাজিরা দেন। ২৬/১০/৯৮ ইং  তারিখের পর ২৪/১১/৯৮ ইং তারিখে মামলার চুড়ামত্ম শুনানীর দিন ধার্য করা হয়। তবে ঐ  তারিখে নথি আদৌ উপস্থাপন করা হইয়াছে মর্মে  দেখা যায়না।   মাননীয় জেলাজজ  মহোদয়ের ২/১১/৯৮ ইং তারিখের আদেশ মূলে মোকদ্দমাটি অত্রাদালতে বদলী করা হয়  এবং ১৭/২/৯৮ ইং তারিখে  নথি প্রাপ্তির পর     মোকদ্দমাটি আদালতের দেওয়ানী ১১৩/৯৯ জি নং মোকদ্দমা হিসাবে রেজিষ্ট্রিতুক্ত করা হয়।   আদালতে মোকদ্দমাটি দেওয়ানী ১১৩/৯৯ জি নং মোকদ্দমায় সূচীত হওয়ার পর মজহর সরকার পক্ষকে আর অত্র মোকদ্দমায় হাজির দেখা যায় না। মোকদ্দমাটি বদলী সূত্রে আসার বিষয়টি সরকার পক্ষের বিজ্ঞ কৌসুলীকে কখনো কোনভাবে অবগত করানো হইয়াছিল মর্মে দেখা যায়না।  যে সোলে সূত্রে মোকদ্দমাটি ডিক্রি প্রদান করা হয় ঐ সোলেনামার  কোন অণুলিপি সরকার পক্ষের  বিজ্ঞ কৌসুলীকে দেওয়া হইয়াছিলো মর্মে দেখা যায় না। ....ফলে মূল মোকদ্দমাটি  শুনানীকালে মজহর সরকার পক্ষের আদালতে অণুপস্থিত থাকার সংগত কারণ ছিলো বলিয়া বিবেচিত হয়।......."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>32.</strong>      The portion of findings of the learned Joint District Judge also suggests lack of fairplay on the part of the plaintiffs and the <em>ex-parte</em> decree involving huge tract of land in the downtown Dhaka city was obtained against the principal defendant in a surreptitious manner. We find ample elements of abuses of judicial process by the plaintiffs and relaxed exercises of judicial power in decreeing <em>ex parte</em> in total disregard of the question of merit of the suit, executability of the decree and other incidents of the suit involving such a vast tract of land crowded with public and private buildings and installations.<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong>   Decree <em>ex parte</em> is passed in a manner as if absence of defendant <em>ipso facto</em> confers title of the suit land upon the plaintiff. And the plaintiffs are absolved of their duty to discharge their onus to prove their own case. Routine decree passed <em>ex parte</em> on account merely of absence of the defendant has never found favour with the superior courts. In Bangladesh v A. Wadud, 25 DLR (SC) 90, it is held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Absence of defendant cannot give the plaintiff an occasion to obtain an ex parte decree without producing evidence in support of his claim. This view is consistently subscribed by the superior courts in a long line of cases. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>34.</strong>     The case appears to be one in which justice is defeated by fraud. The peculiar facts of the case speak of an unholy alliance between the parties and the defendants <em>inter se</em> in carrying into effect a secret design that finally succeeded. Once fraud is detected in the process of justice no technicality should stand on the way to setting things right. We, therefore, find the contention raised by Mr. Khalilur Rahman plainly unacceptable.  We are in the firm view that the government, regardless of infirmities, if any, in pursuing the restoration matter, is deprived of the opportunity to contest a suit having had far reaching consequence.   The learned Joint District Judge has rightly set aside the <em>ex parte</em> decree. No justifiable reason is there to interfere with his findings.<br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong>       For all the reasons stated above we hold that the rule is devoid of merit and the order of restoration of the suit must be maintained giving the government an opportunity to contest the suit. While we so hold the peculiar facts set out in the plaint do not escape our sight.<br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong>       A close reading of the plaint cannot but draw attention of judicial mind to the basic question that whether the plaint at all discloses any cause of action; is the suit apparently meritless and frivolous and its continuation tantamount to abuse of the process of court.  If the suit is so found is there any justification to allow a futile litigation to continue at the cost of the parties as well as of public money and time. The answer is most squarely given in the case of Chowmuhuni<em> College v Ismail Hossain (Md) </em>reported in 26 DLR 10. In this case High Court Division was in <em>seisin</em> of an injunction matter in a suit for declaration and permanent injunction. Sitting upon the legality of the temporary injunction granted by the courts below High Court Division traveled beyond the issue at hand and rejected the plaint with the following observations:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The question of maintainability of the suit goes at the root of  a matter in issue to be adjudicated upon. If the mere reading of the plaint it is found that the suit is not maintainable the court has to decide the said point even when it is called upon to consider the question of issuing a temporary injunction...”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>37.</strong>        In the case of <em>Sazzadul Haque v Sardar Anwar Hossain reported in </em><em>57 DLR 273 </em>High Court Division rejected the plaint while sitting in an interlocutory matter.   In this case a suit was filed by a chairman candidate in the Union Parishad election challenging the validity of changing and setting up new polling stations. Temporary injunction was granted by the trial court which was affirmed in appeal by the District Judge. In revision against an order of injunction High Court Division rejected the plaint as the suit was found not maintainable holding:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“Though the instant revision has arisen out of an interlocutory order, yet this court is in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction can very much see and decide the question of maintainability of the suit.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/> <br/><strong>38.</strong>        The next point that comes in is whether plaint can be rejected beyond the scope of Order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The question is long settled and also adequately answered in the positive in the two authorities referred to above.  In Chowmuhuni College case (<em>supra</em>) it is held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“I have already held the suit as framed is not maintainable under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act ….Now the question is whether I should reject the plaint or not in exercise of my jurisdiction under section 150 read with section 151 of the Code does not disclose any cause of action I am clearly of the view that in the facts and circumstances of the case the plaint should be rejected here and now in exercise of my inherent jurisdiction.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>39.</strong>       And in the other case, ie, the case of <em>Sazzadul Haque</em> <em>(supra)</em> plaint was rejected in exercise of the courts revisional jurisdiction at an interlocutory stage as it was felt necessary so to do in the fitness of things.  There is hardly, if ever, any controversy about the proposition of law that Order VII rule 11 of the Code is not exhaustive. And if the Order VII rule 11 of the Code cannot be called in aid plaint can be rejected to prevent abuse of the process of the court in exercise of the court’s inherent jurisdiction.<br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong>      The case of   <em>Rasheda Begum v Nurussafa, MM &amp; others, 24</em> BLD (AD) 223, is on point. In this case our Appellate Division held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The</em><em> law is more or less settled that matter of rejection of plaint is not confined to Order VII rule11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In a fit or appropriate case, i.e., while the proceeding initiated is an abuse of the process of the court or a contrive to achieve something which the party failed upon proceeding under the law provided for or in any other case  akin to cases as mentioned above the court taking recourse of the provision of section 151 would be competent to reject the plaint…”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/> <br/><strong>41.</strong>     In <em>Guinness Peat (Trading) Ltd. v Md. Fazlur Rahman</em>, 12 BLD (AD) 247; 44 DLR(AD)242, defendant sought rejection of plaint on ground that the plaintiff does not reside nor any part of cause of action of the suit arose  within the  jurisdiction of the court. Our Appellate Division held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"We must make it clear that the question of jurisdiction does not come within the purview of Order VII rule 11 of the Code….A resort to section 151 of the Code may be made in the interest of jurisdiction only in an exceptional case where the suit is foredoomed, and if it is allowed to be proceeded with, it will amount to an abuse of the process of court”  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/> <br/><strong>42.</strong>        Initiation of suit is not seen by the superior courts as an unrestricted right to be exercised at pleasure. It must disclose a ‘cause of action’ within the meaning of ‘right as to any property’ or ‘legal character ‘so far as section 42 of the Specific Relief Act is concerned.  A suit may be barred by law ie, by express letters of law and barred ‘under the law’ which presupposes that Order VII rule 11 is not exhaustive.<br/> <br/> <br/><strong>43.</strong>       The famously known <em>Burma Eastern case, ie, Burma Eastern Ltd. V Burma Eastern Employees Union &amp; others reported</em> in 18 DLR 709 is the case on point.  In this case Murshed,C J,   speaking for the court held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“A suit may be specifically barred by law and in such event the matter would come under express terms of clause (d) of Rule 11 of Order VII of the Code. But, even in a case where a suit is not permitted by necessary implication of law in the sense that a positive prohibition can be spelt out of legal provision, the court has an inherent jurisdiction to reject the plaint. This really amounts to saying that Order VII rule 11, is not exhaustive….If, as a result of the provision of law, the suit is barred, it would be barred under law, although strictly speaking, it may not be specifically barred by law in express terms. The court should, in such a case reject the plaint, under its inherent power.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>44.</strong>      In the case of <em>Aminur Rahman Khan v Trade Aris Insurance </em>reported in 7 BLC 330   (DB) a Division Bench of the High Court Division expressed similar view in the following words:   </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“We are, therefore,  of the opinion that recourse to section 151 for rejection of plaint can be resorted to in exceptional cases where if the suit is allowed, it would amount to an abuse of the process of the court…”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>45.</strong>     In a recent case ie, in <em>Abdul Zalil &amp; others v Islamic Bank Bangladesh Ltd &amp; others</em> reported in 53 DLR (AD) 12 our Apex court has gone as far as to hold:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“It is well settled that when a plaint cannot be rejected under Order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure the court may invoke its inherent jurisdiction and reject the plaint taking recourse to section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure…. As the ultimate result of the suit is as clear as daylight such suit should be properly buried at its inception so that no further time is consumed in a fruitless litigation”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>46.</strong>    With all the questions about the nature and extent of our jurisdiction in rejecting a plain while in seisin of an interlocutory matter are settled we do not see any reason why the present suit shall be given a goby if the fitness of things requires our interference. <br/> <br/><strong>47.</strong>    In the instant  case a vast tract of land in the central area of Dhaka city (Topkhana Road) measuring an area of 5.18 acre (five acres and eighteen decimal) is claimed by two persons from a village of Munshiganj district on the basis of a Zamindari <em>dakhila</em> of 1944 as against record of rights admittedly standing in the name of the government and admitted possession of the Government at least from 1975, let alone, by construction of five public buildings thereon as claimed by the learned Attorney General as well as admitted possession of a good number of private defendants by virtue of decrees of  law courts and various registered and other  title documents.<br/> <br/><strong>48.</strong>    The land is shown to be partially agricultural and partially low-lying in which condition the plaintiff allegedly used to possess by developing part of it. His nature of possession was rearing fish and cultivating crops till 1975.  The land as disclosed in the plaint is situated in Topkhana Road. This means by necessary implication that the possession of the plaintiff in the suit land came to an end as the urbanization of Dhaka got underway with the creation of the erstwhile Pakistan in 1947. There is no clear case pleaded that the plaintiffs have ever had any building or dwelling house of any description in the suit land or the descriptions of their tenants in respect thereto.   The statement that the government has forcibly dispossessed them in 1975 from the entire suit land comes in sharp contradiction with their claim that their tenants are being threatened by defendant Nos. 31-40 with dispossession and defendant Nos. 3-9 or defendant No.11 have trespassed into the land and living there erecting dwelling houses. <br/> <br/><strong>49.</strong>      Admittedly government served notice to defendant Nos.3-9 asking them to surrender possession of the suit land. No such notice is claimed to have been served upon the plaintiff which means that they were not found in possession of any portion of the of the suit land. There appear to be a long blackout on the question of possession of the plaintiff since his settlement in 1339 BS till 1975. No tangible or meaningful efforts are seen to have been taken by the plaintiff in preventing the government and/or other defendants in possession from changing the nature and character of the suit land over these three decades, if not more.<br/> <br/><strong>50.</strong>       We have closely gone through supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of the petitioners and the judgment and decree Annexed thereto passed in Title Suit Nos. 550 and 551 of 1984 (analogously tried) obtained by one Abdul Malek Howladar &amp; others and one Syed Md. Hanif and others respectively allegedly on the basis of the common <em>amalnama </em>upon which the plaintiff petitioner sought to place heavy reliance. Firstly, every suit has its own peculiar merit. The suit brought by the plaintiff must stand on its own merit. Furthermore, decree passed in some other suit brought by independent and separate individuals allegedly on the selfsame <em>amalnama</em>, even if true, is of no avail for the petitioner for the precise reason that the  <em>amalnama</em> sought to be relied upon by the petitioner admittedly  trailed away by series of mistakes affecting area and description of land sought to be settled with the plaintiffs’ predecessor and finally their title, as pleaded, rested on a <em>dakhila</em> issued by the original owner to effect the settlement. The <em>amalnama</em>, therefore was relegated to a vanishing point forming no more basis of the title of the plaintiffs. The factum that the government   lost up to the Appellate Division in those suits is not correct in the sense it is sought to be portrayed.  Both the High Court Division and the Appellate Division dismissed the appeals by the government exclusively on limitation ground not on merit. Over and above the <em>amalnama</em> relied upon in those suits does not tally in material particulars with the <em>amalnama</em> used in the instant suit.<br/> <br/><strong>51.</strong>     Order VII rule 11 of the Code says, <em>inter alia,</em> that- ‘the plaint shall be rejected where it does not disclose any cause of action’. ‘Cause of action’ is nowhere defined in the Code. Nonetheless, it is viewed by the superior courts as the ‘bundle of essential facts which is necessary for the plaintiff to prove before he can succeed in the suit.’ It not only includes the facts necessary to support the plaintiff’s title but also the facts which entitle him to relief against a particular defendant. ‘Cause of action’ as is held in <em>Barikara Narasayya v R. Basavana</em> reported in (1985) 2 Civ LJ 649, ‘ means all that bundle of facts which would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right to the judgment of the court’.<br/> <br/><strong>52.</strong>        In the instant suit no ‘cause of action’ appears to have been disclosed so as to support the plaintiff’s right to the judgment they ask for.  The piece of an olden <em>dakhila</em> of 1944 which remains to be the sole basis of the title of the plaintiffs, even if proved on oath,   cannot stand the test of credibility after so long years. The piece of <em>dakhila</em> even if taken to be true does not outweigh the preponderance of probabilities weighing in favour of the Government and other private defendants who are admittedly in possession of the suit land for decades by virtue of their continuous possession and title documents like registered deeds. A piece of private <em>dakhila</em> allegedly issued by an erstwhile Zamindar in 1944 can hardly, if ever, carry the suit through and finally bring success for the plaintiff.  It is in the sense that the plaint does not disclose any ‘cause of action’ and the suit is virtually vexatious and meritless and the end result of the suit by the same token is clearly foreseeable<strong>.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>53.</strong>   Taking cue from <em>Burma Easter</em> case (<em>supra</em>),  it may also be said the plaintiff’s claim does not constitute ‘any right to property’ of ‘legal character’ as contemplated in Section 42 of the Specific Releif Act for each and every claim of property does not give rise to a cause of action for a law suit. This has found more appropriate expressions in the language of Murshed, J in Burma Easter case: -<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“ ......Mere wishing to claim a property- long occupied by the government under the claim of title and other individuals, if any, under the color of title-   on the basis of a scrap of paper representing a transactions between two or more private individuals long ago unsupported by any act of possession does not constitute cause of action and in that sense the suit would be barred under law, although strictly speaking, it may not be specifically barred by law.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>54.</strong>     The question of want of cause of action apart, we have reasons to hold that the suit itself is frivolous designed to grab government property and it has no prospect whatsoever to succeed. It is in that sense that the plaint may be rejected in exercise of our inherent power under section 151 of the Code.<br/> <br/><strong>55.</strong>       From our discussions made above we are of the view that this is eminently a fit case for rejection of plaint though not strictly under Order XII rule11 of the Code, in exercise of our inherent power under section 151 of the Code.  The rule is accordingly discharged and the plaint of the suit is rejected. The order of stay earlier granted is hereby vacated.  There shall, however, be no order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>56.</strong>    Before we part with the case, we wish to leave an observation that, as is borne out by records, there was an investigation earlier initiated by CID on suspicion of some foul play at the behest of land-grabbers syndicate active around the city courts.  For reasons not known the investigations faded into silence. We are of the view that the investigation may further be initiated to ascertain the identity of the plaintiff-petitioners and of the giant design to grab, if at all, such a huge tract of land in the city centre.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Communicate a copy of the judgment at once.<br/> <br/><strong><em>Ed.</em></strong></div></div></div>

In view of the stated position of fact pourashava election of Cox’s Bazar particularly Cox’s Bazar Sadar, Teknaf, Moheshkhali and Chakaria  was not held on 27.1.2011 with update (nvjbvMv`) revised electoral roll. However, proviso to section 11(1) of the Act No. 6 of 2009 says if the electoral roll is not revised as per clause (a),(b) and (c) the validity or continued operation of the electoral roll shall not thereby be affected. Said provision of law is not under challenge in the present Rules. As such even though electoral roll of 2007-2008 has not been updated the validity and the continued operation of the earlier electoral roll shall remain in force.</strong><br/><strong> Upon scrutinizing the information and excluding the false voters the Deputy Secretary (Election) fixed 21.03.2010 for hearing objection thereto in view of section 7(2) of the Act No. 6 of 2009.

As such, allegation of the petitioners of holding pourashava election of Cox’s Bazar district without publishing final electoral roll under section 7(4) of the Act No. 6 of 2009 falls through.

In the year 2007 the Commission had prepared a draft electoral roll for the Cox’s Bazar District. The District administration of the said district observed that in the aforesaid draft voter list a huge number of citizen of Myanmar (Rohingas) had been included. To that effect the Deputy Commissioner, Cox’s Bazar vide memo no. Jeni-au/Cox/10(1)/Chha: Sa:Bho:Ta:Ho;/2009/226 dated 22.06.2010 (Annexure-B) and memo no. Jeni-au/Cox/10(1)/Chha:Sa:Bho: Ta:Ho;2009/344 dated 23.10.2010 (Annexure-C) addressing the respondent no.3 as well as the Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested to take necessary steps towards exclusion of disqualified electors, but the Commission did not pay any heed to the same. The Commission, however, adopted a new special Form only for Cox’s Bazar district to examine the genuineness of the listed voters in the year, 2009 by issuing a circular bearing memo no. নিকস/নি-১/ভোতা-১/হালনাগাদ/২০০৯(অংশ-১)৫৮৯ dated 01.09.2009. In the process of re-examination of the voters held in 6 (six) upazillas of Cox’s Bazar district 62,509 voters were examined under random sampling and amongst the said numbers 45,859 voters were found as citizen of Myanmar. Accordingly, the said number of voters were excluded from the said list. That in the meeting of District Law and Order Committee of Cox’s Bazar district held on 28.11.2010 the issue of inclusion of huge number of citizen of Mayanmar (Rohingas) in the present voter list had been discussed and a resolution had been duly adopted by the said Committee for taking necessary steps towards rectifying the present voter list of Cox’s Bazar district. Several other organizations as well as the inhabitants of Cox’s Bazar Pourashava gave their representations to the Chief Election Commissioner, respondent no. 2 to take effective steps in the matter, but there was no response. Ultimately, the Commission without correcting the existing electoral roll declared the schedule of pourashava election of Cox’s Bazar district on 02.12.2010. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the petitioner has preferred the instant application and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>6</strong>.             The petitioner in writ petition no. 601 of 2011 reiterating the statements so made in writ petition no. 9748 of 2010 further contended that about 1000 (one thousand) Bangladeshis along with the said petitioner though are qualified to be enlisted as voters but till date they have not been included in the electoral roll inspite of the fact that on the application of the petitioner and others the Registration Officer issued receipts of registration for enlisting their name as electors (Annexure-B). Hence, the application. <br/> <br/><strong>7</strong>.             Mr. Rafiqul Hoque, the learned Senior Advocate appearing with Mr. Ahsanul Karim and Mr. Jahangir Kabir, the learned Advocates for the petitioner in writ petition no.9748 of 2010 submits that from the correspondences (Annexure-2 and 3 respectively to the affidavit-in opposition filed by the respondent 2) it is evident that more than 4 (four) lacs Rohingas, the citizen of Myanmar, have encroached Bangladesh territory and are now residing in the country on obtaining voter list, even passports. Accordingly, he submits that since they are not the citizen of Bangladesh hence, they cannot be enlisted as voters in order to apply the right of franchise being violative of section 7(1)(ka) of the Act no. 6 of 2009 as well as section 17(2)(ka) of the Act no. 58 of 2009. He further goes to submit that although the Deputy Commissioner, Cox’s Bazar vide memo dated 22.06.2010 brought it to the notice of the Commission contending, inter-alia, that about 10% voters of Cox’s Bazar district in the voter list of 2007 are Rohingas, but the Commission did not take any steps for up dating the same. He next contends that the Commission has held the pourashava election on 27.1.2011 on the basis of electoral roll prepared in the year 2007 whereas under section 7(4) of the Act no. 6 of 2009 it was incumbent on the part of  the Election Commission to publish final voter list after amendment or revision to that effect. Referring to the annexures so have been annexed to the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondent no.2 he submits that the voter list prepared in the year 2009 though has been amended, but no final list has yet been published. The said defect was within the knowledge of the Commission, in spite of that the Commission has held the paurashava election of Cox’s Bazar District in clear violation of section 7(4) of the Act no.6 of 2009. He further goes to submit that section 17(1) of the Act no.58 of 2009 clearly provides that for every ward the Commission shall frame a voter list; section 17(2) further provides that no person shall be entitled to be a voter unless he is a citizen of Bangladesh; rule 4(1) of the act in this regard provides that subject to sub-section (2) the District Election Officer shall frame voter list for every pourashava; rule 4(2) also states that the voter list has to be framed in such a manner that there must be separate voter list for male and female for every ward. In this context he contends that the electoral roll prepared in the year 2007 is meant for ‘‘নির্বাচন এলাকা’’; whereas rule 4 of the said Rules means ‘‘ভোটার এলাকা’’. Accordingly, he argues that no such voter list has been prepared by the Commission in compliance of the said provision of law. Hence, holding of pourashava election of the respective pourashavas of Cox’s Bazar District with the voter list prepared not in accordance with law suffers from malice in law, consequent thereto the election held on 27.01.2011 is without jurisdiction. The learned Advocate further contends  that by the impugned notification dated 02.12.2010 the Commission having decided to hold the election of 4 (four) Pourashavas of Cox’s Bazar district declared the schedule with time frame for stages such as submitting nomination papers, withdrawal of nomination paper and the date of election. The petitioner has challenged the said notification for holding of election without preparing a fresh voter list in accordance with law. During the pendencey of the Rule Nisi the subsequent notification dated 20.12.2010 was issued, which is, in fact, the continuation of the original notification giving revised time frame for holding the self-same election. From the said sequence of facts it is clearly apparent that the subsequent notification being continuation of the original schedule as such the Rule has not become infructuous. In this regard drawing attention to Annexure-G to the supplementary affidavit he contends that the petitioner has annexed the new notification by way of supplementary affidavit. Accordingly, he submits that this Hon’ble Court for the cause of justice may consider the subsequent events. In support of the said contention the learned advocate has referred the decisions in the cases of  Abul Kalam Shamsuddin Vs. Anti-Corruption Commission, represented by its Chairman, Head Office; Segunbagicha, Dhaka and others reported in 14 MLR (AD)153; and the case of Basic Engineering Limited Vs. Bangladesh and 3 others reported in 2006 (XIV) BLT(HCD)328. Mr. Hoque further goes to submit that the petitioner is a citizen of Bangladesh and as a citizen of the country he has every right as well as interest in every part of the land to secure the electoral roll. In this regard referring to Article 7(1) of the Constitution he submits that all powers in the Republic belongs to the people, the citizen of Bangladesh and as such if any foreigner is included in the electoral roll of any part of Bangladesh the supreme right of the citizen as guaranteed in Article 7 of the Constitution will be infringed. Therefore, as citizen of Bangladesh the petitioner has locus-standi to maintain this writ petition. In support of the said contention the learned Advocate has referred the decision in the case of Kazi Mukhlesur Rahman Vs. Bangladesh and another reported in 26 DLR(AD) 44.<br/> <br/><strong>8</strong>.             Mr.Md Hafizur Rahman Khan the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner in writ petition no.601 of 2011 adopts the submission so have been advanced in writ petition no. 9748 of 2010.<br/> <br/><strong>9</strong>.             Conversely, Mr. Fida M.Kamal, the learned Senior Advocate appearing with Mr. Kaiser Kamal for the added respondent nos.11-16, Mr. A.J. Mohammad Ali the learned Senior Advocate appearing with Mr. Rubaiyat Hossain for the added respondent no.10 and Mr. Md. Bodruddoza the learned Advocate appearing with Mr. Earul Islam, for the added respondent no.9 made  similar line of arguments contending, inter-alia, that it is the settled principle of law that once the notification is published declaring election schedule, the process of election commences and according to the dictum of the Appellate Division once process of election is initiated it cannot be challenged under writ jurisdiction except in the case of quorum-non-judice and malice in law. In the present case, it has been contended that the pourashava election of Cox’s Bazar Sadar, Teknaf, Moheshkhali and Chakaria having been held in accordance with law with publication of election result in gazette this Rule is liable to be discharged as being not maintainable since the petitioner has failed to show that there has occasioned malice in law or that the election was held without jurisdiction. It has further been contended that the petitioner has challenged the notification dated 02.12.2010 for holding the election of the respective pourashavas of Cox’s Bazar district, but the order of stay of the notification passed by one of the Benches of this Division having been stayed by the Appellate Division a fresh notification was published on 20.12.2010 pursuant to which election of the respective pourashavas was held on 27.01.2011. Hence, in effect the first part of the Rule has become infructuous. So far the second part of the Rule so as to exclude the Rohingas from the voter list it has been argued referring to sections 10 and 11 of the Act no.6 of 2009 that correction and revision of the electoral roll is an on going process to be undertaken by the Election Commission in every year at a certain period excluding the period during which the process of election is going on and if there be any allegation of inclusion of a disqualified person in the electoral roll the Commission either following the prescribed form as mentioned in the  ‘‘ভোটার তালিকা বিধিমালা, ২০০৮’’  or adopting its own special method on recording its reason under section 11(2) of the Act no. 6 of 2009 shall delete the name therefrom. But for wrong inclusion of disqualified person shall not go to invalidate the voter list. As such, the pourashava election held with the said electoral roll cannot be called in question.<br/> <br/><strong>10</strong>.          The moot question to be resolved in the present Rules is whether pourashava election of Cox’s Bazar Sadar, Teknaf, Moheshkhali and Chakaria, district Cox’s Bazar held by the Election Commission allegedly with defective electoral roll without publishing final voter list as is required under section 7(4) of the Act no. 6 of 2009 ; for having included Rohingas as voters in the respective areas in violation of section 7(1)(ka) of the Act no. 6 of 2009; and also for having not prepared separate electoral roll for pourashava in compliance of “ সহানীয় সরকার (পৌরসভা) নির্বাচন আইন,২০০৯ ” (Act 58 of 2009), can be termed as lawful.   <br/> <br/><strong>11</strong>.          ‘‘স্থানীয় সরকার (পৌরসভা) নির্বাচন আইন, ২০০৯’’ (Act, 58 of 2009) promulgated on 06.10.2009 regulates pourashava election of Mayor as well Counsellors. Section 17(1) of the said Ain provides as under-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>১৭। ভোটার তালিকা।-(১) প্রতিটি ওয়ার্ডের জন্য নির্বাচন কমিশন কর্তৃক প্রণীত একটি ভোটার তালিকা থাকিবে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>12</strong>.          For every ward there shall be an electoral roll prepared (প্রণীত) by the Election Commission. Section 120 of the said Act authorises the Commission to frame rules for the election of Mayors and Counsellors. In exercise of that power the Commission has framed ‘‘সহানীয় সরকার (পৌরসভা) নির্বাচন বিধিমালা, ২০১০’’ vide notification dated 05.10.2010 where rule 2(24) defines the word ‘‘ভোটার’’  which means:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>২(২৪) ‘‘ভোটার" অর্থ এমন একজন ব্যক্তি যাহার নাম সংশ্লিষ্ট ওয়ার্ডের ভোটার তালিকায় অন্তর্ভুক্ত আছে;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>13</strong>.                          The word “  ভোটার তালিকা ” has been defined in rule 2(25) as- ‘‘২(২৫) ‘‘ভোটার তালিকা’’ অর্থ ভোটার তালিকা আইন, ২০০৯   (২০০৯ সনের ৬নং আইন) এর ধারা ৩(ছ) এ সংজ্ঞায়িত ভোটার তালিকা;’’<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>                          In other words, the final electoral roll prepared under Act no. 6 of  2009 is the ‘‘ভোটার তালিকা’’  of the ‘‘সহানীয় সরকার (পৌরসভা) নির্বাচন বিধিমালা, ২০১০” framed on 5.10.2010. Rule 4 further provides as under-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>‘‘৪।       ভোটার তালিকা প্রণয়ন।-(১) উপ-বিধি (২) এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, জেলা নির্বাচন কর্মকর্তা, পৌরসভার অমত্মর্ভুক্ত এলাকাসমূহের ভোটার তালিকা প্রণয়ন করিবেন।<br/>উপ-বিধি (১) এ উল্লিখিত ভোটার তালিকা এইরুপে প্রণয়ন করিতে হইবে যেন প্রতিটি ওয়ার্ডের পুরুষ ও মহিলা ভোটারগণের জন্য পৃথক পৃথক ভোটার তালিকা থাকে।’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>15</strong>.          The District Election Officer shall on behalf of the Commission prepare (cÖYqb) electoral roll for the areas included in the Pourashava and for every ward there shall be separate voter list for male and female.<br/> <br/><strong>16.          Rule 9 further states-</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>৯।         ভোটার তালিকা সরবরাহ।- (১) কমিশন প্রত্যেক নির্বাচনী এলাকার রিটার্নিং অফিসারকে নির্বাচনী তফসিল ঘোষনার অব্যবহিত পরেই উক্ত এলাকার ভোটার তালিকা সরবরাহ করিবে।<br/>(২)  রিটার্নিং অফিসার উপ-বিধি (১) এর অধীন প্রাপ্ত ভোটার তালিকা সংশ্লিষ্ট ভোটকেন্দ্রের প্রত্যেক প্রিজাইডিং অফিসারকে সরবরাহ করিবে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>17</strong>.          With the declaration of election schedule the Commission shall sent electoral roll to the concerned Returning Officer appointed under the rules for one or two pourashavas of the respective “নির্বাচনী এলাকা”, the constituency. The emphatic  contention of the petitioners in this regard is that pursuant to section 17(1) of the Act no.58 of 2009 and rule 4(2) of the ‘‘স্থানীয় সরকার (পৌরসভা) নির্বাচন বিধিমালা’ ২০১০’’  for pourashava election the Commission has to prepare separate electoral roll under the said Rules. It has already been noted above that the word “ভোটার তালিকা ”referred in those provision relate back  to rule 2(25) which precisely prescribes that the voter list prepared under Act no. 6 of 2009 is “এই আইনের অধীনে চূড়ামত্ম ভোটার তালিকা”. Moreover, on proper examination of the entire provisions of the Act no.  58 of 2009 and the Rules, 2010 we failed to find any provision whatsoever dealing with the procedure of preparation of voter list of the respective pourashava. The procedure for preparation, amendment and revision of electoral roll have been categorically dealt with under the Act no. 6 of 2009 and “ভোটার তালিকা বিধিমালা, ২০১০.” However, the learned Advocate for the petitioners in this regard has drawn our attention to section 2(kha) of the Act no.6 of 2009 and submits that since the legislature has used the words “সংসদের নির্বাচনের জন্য ” as such Act no. 6 of 2009 is only applicable for parliament election. We do not any find substance thereto inasmuch as section 2(Ga) has included the word “ সংসদ বা কোন সহানীয় সরকার সংসহা ”  while defining the word “ নির্বাচিত সংসহা ” (elected body).

The relevant ‘‘জখ-(১)’’ covering district Cox’s Bazar is quoted hereinbelow-<br/> <br/><strong>31</strong>.          Accordingly, the learned Advocate submits that taking the issue of inclusion of Rohingas as voters effective measures had been duly undertaken by the Election Commission for revision of electoral roll’ 2009 with additional special information form and that with the said revised electoral roll Pourashava election of Cox’s Bazar district has been held on 27.01.2011 in accordance with law.<br/> <br/><strong>32</strong>.          At this juncture the emphatic contention of the petitioners is that as per direction of the Election Commission the Upazilla Special Committee re-scrutinized the special information form filled up by the voters as per “ভোটার তালিকা আইন, ২০০৯” for the year 2009-2010, adopting the procedure as stated in clause 4 of the circular dated 31.09.2009. But the said special process, “পুনঃপরীক্ষা” was not made applicable for those enlisted in the electoral roll of 2007-2008 and with the said defective electoral roll pourashava election of Cox’s Bazar district was held on 27.01.2011.<br/> <br/><strong>33</strong>.          The said assertion of the petitioner has found substance in view of clause 6 of the circular dated 01.09.2009 which states as under-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ ৬।       যারা ২০০৮ সালের জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনে ভোট দেওয়ার জন্য ২০০৭-২০০৮ সময়কালে ভোটার তালিকাভুক্ত হয়েছেন কিংবা যাদের অনুকূলে বাংলাদেশের পাসপোর্ট জারী করা হয়েছে তাদের জন্য ৪নং অনচ্ছেদ বর্নিত বিধান প্রযোজ্য হবে না। ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>34</strong>.          Moreover, from clause 9 of the said circular it is evident that said special scrutinizing method adopted for the year 2009-2010 voter list did not cover Moheshkhali pourashava, district Cox’s Bazar. In view of the stated position of fact pourashava election of Cox’s Bazar particularly Cox’s Bazar Sadar, Teknaf, Moheshkhali and Chakaria  was not held on 27.1.2011 with update (nvjbvMv`) revised electoral roll. However, proviso to section 11(1) of the Act no. 6 of 2009 says if the electoral roll is not revised as per clause (a),(b) and (c) the validity or continued operation of the electoral roll shall not thereby be affected. Said provision of law is not under challenge in the present Rules. As such even though electoral roll of 2007-2008 has not been updated the validity and the continued operation of the earlier electoral roll shall remain in force.<br/> <br/><strong>35</strong>.          As to the allegation of not publishing final voter list, from Annexure-4 particularly memo dated 16.02.2010 as well as 18.02.2010 respectively issued by the District Election Officer, Cox’s Bazar it appears that the process adopted was for “ Ec‡Rjv we‡kl KwgwU KZ©„K Z_¨ dig cybt hvPvB msµvš— Z_¨ I Qwemn †fvUvi ZvwjKv nvjbvMv` Kvh©µg, 2009.” Upon scrutinizing the information and excluding the false voters the Deputy Secretary (Election) fixed 21.03.2010 for hearing objection thereto in view of section 7(2) of the Act no. 6 of 2009. Ultimately upon hearing the objection on 21.03.2010 final voter list have been published on 09.09.2010 (Annexure-8). As such, allegation of the petitioners of holding pourashava election of Cox’s Bazar district without publishing final electoral roll under section 7(4) of the Act no. 6 of 2009 falls through.<br/> <br/><strong>36</strong>.          Be that as it may the pourashava election of Cox’s Bazar Sadar, Teknaf, Moheshkhali and Chakaria, district Cox’s Bazar held on 27.02.2011 is declared as valid and lawful in the eye law.<br/> <br/><strong>37</strong>.          It is fact that by notification dated 02.12.2010 the Election Commission decided to hold the election for pourashava and as such declared schedule with time frame for the steps. The operation of the said notification, stayed by the High Court Division in writ petition no. 9748 of 2010 at the time of issuance of the Rule Nisi, was ultimately stayed by the Appellate Division and considering the position as prevailing in the present writ petitions the Election Commission published another notification on 2012.2010 (Annexure-G) which is quoted as under-“</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয়<br/>শেরে বাংলা নগর, ঢাকা<br/><br/>নং-নিকস/পৌর-১/কক্স-কক্স/২০০৪/২৪৯                 তারিখ০৬ পৌষ ১৪১৭<br/> <br/>            নং-নিকস/পৌর-১/কক্স-কক্স/২০০৪/২৪৯।- নির্বাচন কমিশন সচিবালয় হইতে ০২ ডিসেম্বর ২০১০ তারিখে নিকস/পৌর-১/১(২৪)/পৌরঃ সাধাঃ নির্বাঃ পরিঃ/২০১০/ ১৭৮ নম্বর প্রজ্ঞাপনের মাধ্যমে কক্সবাজার জেলার কক্সবাজার, টেকনাফ, চকরিয়া এবং মহেশখালী পৌরসভা নির্বাচনের জন্য ঘোষিত সময়সূচী মাননীয় সুপ্রীম কোর্টের হাইকোর্ট বিভাগের রীট পিটিশন নং ৯৭৪৮/২০১০ এর ১৫ ডিসেম্বর ২০১০ তারিখের আদেশে স্থগিত করা হয়। উক্ত আদেশের প্রেক্ষিতে নির্বাচন কমিশন কর্তৃক ১৫ ডিসেম্বর ২০১০ তারিখে উল্লেখিত ৪টি পৌরসভার নির্বাচন স্থগিত করা হয়। পরবর্তীতে মাননীয় সুপ্রীম কোর্টের আপীলেট ডিভিশনের সিভিল মিসসিলিনিয়াস পিটিশন ফর লিভ টু আপীল নং-১০৮০/২০১০ এর ১৯ডিসেম্বর ২০১০ তারিখের আদেশে মাননীয় হাইকোর্ট বিভাগের আদেশ স্থগিত করার প্রেক্ষিতে নির্বাচন কমিশন এতদ্বারা কক্সবাজার জেলার কক্সবাজার, টেকনাফ, চকরিয়া এবং মহেশখালী পৌরসভার মেয়র, সংরক্ষিত আসনের কাউন্সিলর এবং সাধারণ আসনের কাউন্সিলর নির্বাচনের উদ্দেশ্যে নিম্নেবর্ণিত সময়সূচী ঘোষণা করিতেছেঃ<br/>                                                                                                 <br/>(ক)   রিটার্নিং অফিসারের নিকট মনোয়নপত্র দাখিলের শেষ তারিখ: ২৯ ডিসেম্বর, ২০১০ (বুধবার) ১৫ পৌষ, ১৪১৭<br/>(খ) মনোয়নপত্র বাছাইয়ের তারিখ ঃ০১-০২ জানুয়ারী,২০১১ (শনিবার–রবিরার) ১৮-১৯ পৌষ,১৪১৭<br/>(গ) প্রার্থিতা প্রত্যাহারের শেষ তারিখ: ১০ জানুয়ারী,২০১১ (সোমবার) ২৭ পৌষ, ১৪১৭                                <br/>(ঘ) ভোট গ্রহণের তারিখ: ২৭ জানুয়ারী,২০১১ (বৃহস্পতিবার) ১৪ মাঘ, ১৪১৭<br/> <br/>নির্বাচন কমিশনের আদেশক্রমে<br/>(সৈয়দ মোঃ খুরশিদ আনোয়ার)<br/>উপ-সচিব (পৌর)<br/>ফোনঃ ৮১১ ৬০ ২৬ (অফিস)<br/>        ৮৩৬ ৩৫ ৮৮(বাসা)<br/> <br/>অদ্যকার তারিখে বাংলাদেশ গেজেটেরে অতিরিক্ত সংখ্যায় প্রকাশ করিতে এবং২০০ (দুইশত) কপি গেজেট বিজ্ঞপ্তি সরকারী কাজে ব্যবহারার্থে সরবরাহ করিতে অনুরোধ করা যাইতেছে।<br/> <br/>প্রাপক<br/>উপ-পরিচালক<br/>বাংলাদেশ সরকারী মুদ্রণালয়<br/>তেজগাঁও, ঢাকা।’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;">               <br/><strong>38</strong>.          From the chronology of facts as noted above there is no doubt that the subsequent notification dated 20.12.2010 is the continuation of the original schedule hence, first part of the Rule has not become infructuous.<br/> <br/><strong>39</strong>.          In the case of Kazi Mukhlesur Rahman vs. Bangladesh, reported in 26 DLR (SC) 44, the Appellate Division while giving findings as to locus standi of the respective petitioner observed as under:<br/>“Locus standi was granted to the appellant even though he was not a resident of the southern half of South Berubari Union no. 12 or adjacent enclaves involved in the Delhi Treaty because he had raised a constitutional issue of grave importance involving an international treaty affecting the territory of Bangladesh and posing an impending threat to his fundamental rights under Article 36 of the Constitution and his right of franchise. These rights, attached to a citizen, are not local. They pervade and extend to every inch of the territory of Bangladesh stretching upto the continental shelf.”<br/> <br/><strong>40</strong>.          In the instant case, the petitioner in writ petition no. 9748 of 2010 is the elector of Cox’s Bazar Sadar, District- Cox’s Bazar who agitates the issue of inclusion of Rohingas in the electoral roll violating his right to franchise, which, in our concerned view, involves national interest.  As such, in the given facts and circumstances the petitioner has locus-standi to press the issue before us for judicial review.<br/> <br/><strong>41</strong>.          Vote is a sacred trust of the nation and the correct use of ballot is a national obligation. In the Act no.6 of 2009 the Commission has been provided with authority to include qualified voters or to exclude/delete the name from the electoral roll who is disqualified for enrolment either  in the prescribed manner at any time, except from the date of declaration of election schedule till completion of election process, under sections 10 and 11(1) or even at any time direct a special revision of the electoral roll for the said electoral area or constituency in such manner as it may deem fit, under section 11(2) of the Act no.6 of 2009.<br/> <br/><strong>42</strong>.          In the light of Annexure-2 and 3 respectively of the affidavit-in opposition filed by the respondent no.2 it is an admitted position of fact that across Bangladesh-Myanmar border many citizens of Myanmar (Rohingas) have encroached Bangladesh territory (un-officially more than 4 lacs) with a view to be enlisted in the electoral roll; even to obtain national I.D. card and to certain extent they have become successful. Since the pourashava election of Cox’s Bazar district has already been held, at this stage it is rather difficult to find by this court who are the dis-qualified electors, which involves serious question of fact and hence, cannot be entertained exercising writ jurisdiction. As noted above, the electoral roll of 2007-2008 was not scrutinized under special method adopted by the Commission; also the electoral roll of 2009-2010 with regard to Moheshkhali pourashava. As such, in order to protect our economic, social and above all national security Election Commission is hereby directed to initiate process immediately under section 11(2) of the Act no. 6 of 2009 towards deletion of the name of Rohingas from the finally published electoral roll of 2007-2008 of Cox’s Bazar Sadar, Teknaf, Moheshkhali and Chakaria pourashavas of district Cox’s Bazar and also the electoral roll of 2009-2010 of Moheshkhali pourashava in accordance with law and to complete the said process within a period of 6 (six) months from the date of receipt of this judgment and order. On completion of the said process the Election Commission is also directed to intimate this Court the result thereof through the office of the Registrar.   <br/> <br/><strong>43</strong>.          The qualified persons who are, however, entitled to be enlisted in the electoral roll may have their name included in the electoral roll in compliance of section 10 of the Act no. 6 of 2009.<br/> <br/><strong>44</strong>.          With the above observations and directions both the Rules are disposed of.<br/> <br/>The order of status-quo granted earlier on 06.02.2011 is hereby vacated.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Since he is in the service of the Republic, he cannot hold his present office because of the  absolute  embargo imposed by Article 129(4) of the Constitution.</strong><br/> <br/><em>It is an indisputable fact that the respondent no. 2 is a former Comptroller and Auditor-General of Bangladesh. Needless to say, he was a constitutional office-holder before his appointment as the Chairman of the BERC under the impugned Memo dated 11.10.2009. Article 129(4) of the Constitution contemplates that on ceasing to hold office, the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall not be eligible for further office in the service of the Republic. ... (47)</em><br/> <br/><em>It is obvious from the long title and the preamble of the Act No. 13 of 2003 that the BERC is an independent and impartial regulatory body.  It is a statutory public body short of a constitutional body. .... (60)</em><br/> <br/><em>The BERC is an independent and impartial regulatory authority, albeit it has to function within the parameters of the policy directives of the Government. However, the finality of the decisions or orders of the BERC as contemplated by Section 55 of the Act No. 13 of 2003 can not in any way impel us to hold that the respondent no. 2 is not performing functions in respect of the Government of  Bangladesh. Besides, as conceded by Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam, the decisions or orders of the BERC are subject to judicial review under Article 102 of the Constitution. ..... (69)</em><br/> <br/><em>The Chairman of the BERC is deemed to be a public servant within the meaning of Section 21 of the Penal Code as per Section 61 of the Act No. 13 of 2003. Indisputably the Government is the appointing authority of the Chairman. In view of the provisions of Section 10 of the Act No.13 of 2003, it is clear that the status, pay and allowances and other terms of the Chairman and the Members of the BERC shall be determined by the prescribed rules. But since no rules have been framed under Section 58 of the Act as yet, those of the Chairman and the Members of the BERC shall be determined by the Government. In the absence of any rules framed under Section 58, the terms and conditions  of the service of the respondent no. 2 have been determined by the Government as evidenced by the impugned  Memo dated 11.10.2009. .... (70)</em><br/> <br/><em>So our interpretation of Article 129(4) of the Constitution is that on ceasing to hold office, the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall not be eligible for any office in the service of the Republic.

It has been providing pro-bono legal services to various energy customer groups of Bangladesh and has been involved in other energy and power-related issues. The respondent no. 2 was appointed as the Chairman of the BERC under the impugned Memo No. বিজ্বাখস(প্র-৩)/বাএরেক/নিয়োগ(চেয়ারম্যান)-১৪/২০০৯ dated 11.10.2009  and has been continuing  to hold that  office as such. He is a former Comptroller and Auditor-General of Bangladesh.  He held the constitutional office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of Bangladesh from 08.08.1999 to 04.02.2002. However, the BERC was established by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission Act, 2003 (Act No. 13 of 2003) as a neutral and independent commission for dealing with several issues  pertaining to power, energy  and mineral resources as detailed in the Act.  After the establishment of the BERC under the Act No. 13 of 2003, it has engaged itself in its statutory duties and responsibilities including holding of public hearing in respect of proposed enhancements of tariff for electricity and other such charges. The BERC is the only such statutory body in the energy sector of the country. Anyway, the Chairman and the Members of the BERC in the past were appointed by the President following the procedure that applications were first invited by the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources from qualified candidates through public advertisements in various national dailies. Those advertisements detailed the qualifications required for the appointment   and also mentioned the salaries and other benefits and allowances of the Chairman and the Members of the BERC. The second step was the formation of Selection Committees by the Administrative Ministry (Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources) and such Selection Committees consisted of the most prominent top brass of the Republic. Those Selection Committees forwarded the names of the suitable candidates to the President of the Republic through the Administrative Ministry for final appointment. But curiously enough, by the impugned Memo No. বিজ্বাখস(প্র-৩)/ বাএরেক/নিয়োগ (চেয়ারম্যান)-১৪/২০০৯ dated  11.10.2009,  the President through the Administrative  Ministry appointed the respondent no. 2 as the Chairman of the BERC under certain terms and conditions  enumerated therein without adhering to the said procedure.  However, as per Section 6(2) of the Act No. 13 of 2003, the Chairman and the Members of the BERC are its full-time officers. Their tenure, emoluments, seniority, removal etc. are all regulated by the relevant provisions of the Act No. 13 of 2003. Their offices are offices in the service of the Republic. Because of the absolute embargo imposed by Article 129(4) of the Constitution, the respondent no. 2 being an ex-Comptroller and Auditor-General of Bangladesh can not hold the office of the Chairman of the BERC.  So his purported appointment as the Chairman of the BERC and his holding of that office are without any lawful authority and void abinitio.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>             In the Supplementary Affidavit dated 04.05.2010 filed on behalf of the petitioner, it has been averred that the petitioner was registered as a trust  with the office of the Sub-Registrar, Uttara, Dhaka on 30.07.2008 with the specific objects and purposes and under the terms and conditions mentioned in the deed of trust. An employment notice was published in the Daily New Age on 07.12.2003 by the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources inviting applications from qualified and intending persons to fill up the posts of the Chairman and the Members of the BERC.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>             In the Supplementary Affidavit dated 29.09.2010 filed on behalf of the petitioner, it has been stated that the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources published an employment notice in the Daily Star on 19.08.2010 inviting applications from qualified and interested Bangladeshi citizens for appointment as Member  of the BERC.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>             The respondent no.2 has contested the Rule by filing an Affidavit-in-Opposition. His case, as set out in the Affidavit-in-Opposition, in short, runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>The respondent no. 2 is not in the service of the Republic as the post of the Chairman of the BERC does not come within the scope/ambit of ‘the service of the Republic’ as defined in Article 152(1) of the Constitution. The Administrative Ministry issued the impugned Memo dated 11.10.2009 on behalf of the President of the Republic purely in exercise of  the executive power as mandated by Article 55(2) of the Constitution. The BERC is neither an Attached Department nor a Wing nor a Division of the Administrative Ministry and as such the Chairman is not in the service of the Republic. The Act No. 13 of 2003 contains explicit provisions regarding the mode of appointment of the Chairman and the Members of the BERC. The Act lays down that they shall be appointed by the President on the basis of the proposal of the Ministry of Energy, Power and Mineral Resources. This provision is unqualified and is not subject to any other condition. It is beyond the scheme of the Act No. 13 of 2003 that in appointing the Chairman and the Members of the BERC, neither any advertisement nor any recommendation to that effect by any Selection Committee is required. It is solely done by the executive authority of the State in exercise of its lawful power by the President considering the qualifications and competence of the aspirants as laid down in the Act itself. The procedure for appointment to the posts of the Chairman and the Members of the BERC has been left to the best judgment of the appointing authority and is, therefore, subjective in nature. The past practice of giving public advertisements in daily newspapers and formation of Selection Committees, in the absence of any statutory sanction, does not necessarily have any binding effect. The appointing authority is the best Judge of determining the method of appointment at any given point of time. Furthermore, the Writ Petition being in the nature of public interest litigation, no procedural legitimate expectation has accrued to the petitioner with regard to the deviation in the method of appointment. In the absence of any allegation of infringement or violation of any right inhering in the petitioner, the alleged deviation has not defeated any substantive legitimate expectation likely to accrue in his favour. By virtue of the definition of ‘the service of the Republic’ as given in Article 152(1) of the Constitution, the respondent no. 2 as the Chairman of the BERC can not be  said to be within the mischief of Article 129 (4) of the Constitution.  That being so, the impugned Memo dated 11.10.2009 is valid and lawful.  The appointment of the respondent no. 2 as the Chairman of the BERC is clearly in keeping with the provisions of the Act No. 13 of 2003. It goes without saying that the BERC is an independent and neutral regulatory body. The BERC is a bridge serving as a referee in between the Government, private sector and energy consumers.  The petitioner has not come up with the Writ Petition bonafide and with clean hands.  The daughter of the Chairman of the petitioner, namely, one Dr. Tureen Afroze used to serve as a panel lawyer of the BERC. Having been appointed as the Chairman of the BERC, the respondent no. 2 proceeded to review the tenure of its various personnel including that of the lawyers. On such review, the BERC decided to dispense with the service of Dr. Tureen Afroze. Against this backdrop, actuated by ill-will and malice, the Writ Petition has been filed. As such, the Writ Petition is not maintainable. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>6.</strong>             In the Affidavit-in-Reply dated 24.05.2010 filed on behalf of the petitioner, it has been stated that Dr. Tureen Afroze was all through a brilliant student. She has been practising in the High Court Division since 2001. Since 2007, she has been involved with the rights and issues of energy consumers of Bangladesh. She was once engaged by the BERC to conduct the hearing of the Writ Petition No. 7159 of 2008 filed thereagainst vide its Memo dated 23.11.2008; but she declined to do so due to her personal  difficulties as is evident from her Memo No.LDA/BERC/2008/2 dated 20.11.2008. Afterwards the BERC sent another Memo being No. BEERC/Prosha-075/5696 dated 04.12.2008 to Dr. Tureen Afroze purportedly appointing her as a Counsel therefor, but she never accepted any brief, remuneration and emolument therefrom.  So the question of taking any decision of relieving her of the alleged duties to the BERC did not arise at all. The petitioner has filed the Writ Petition bonafide and not malafide. No malice or ill-will has prompted the petitioner to file the same. As the Writ Petition has been filed bonafide, it is very much competent.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>             At the outset, Dr. Shahdeen Malik, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner, submits that admittedly the respondent no. 2 is a former Comptroller and Auditor-General of Bangladesh, but he was appointed as the Chairman of the BERC by the impugned Memo No. বিজ্বাখস(প্র-৩)/ বাএরেক/নিয়োগ (চেয়ারম্যান)-১৪/২০০৯ dated 11.10.2009  in flagrant contravention of the provisions of Article 129(4) of the Constitution  and in that view of the matter, the appointment  of the respondent no. 2 as the Chairman of the BERC is without lawful authority.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>             Dr. Shahdeen Malik next submits that as per Article 152(1) of the Constitution, ‘the service of the Republic’ means any service, post or office whether in a civil or military capacity, in respect of the Government of Bangladesh, and any other service declared by law to be a service of the Republic and the scheme of the Act No. 13 of 2003 clearly indicates that the office of the Chairman of the BERC is an office in the service of the Republic and as such the appointment  of the respondent no. 2 as the Chairman of the BERC  and his holding of that office are void abinitio.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>             Dr. Shahdeen Malik next submits that the terms ‘Republic’ and ‘the service of the Republic’ as used in the Constitution have been extensively dealt with by the High Court Division in the case of Ruhul Quddus, Advocate and others .…Vs…Justice M. A Aziz and others reported in 60 DLR (HCD) 511 and having regard to the ‘ratio’ enunciated in that case, it is ex-facie clear that the service or post or office is not confined to the Executive Government only and in that view of the matter, the functionaries of the BERC including its Chairman are necessarily in the service of the Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>          Dr. Shahdeen Malik further submits that the BERC is a ‘statutory public authority’ as defined in Article 151(2) of the Constitution and it is independent and neutral in a limited sense inasmuch as according to the Act No. 13 of 2003, the Government gives all policy decisions and directives to the BERC within the parameters of which it has to work and it has no authority or jurisdiction to go beyond those parameters.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>          Dr. Shahdeen Malik also submits that the Chairman of the BERC is appointed by the President under certain terms and conditions determined by him and a special procedure for removal of the Chairman of the BERC is laid down in the Act No. 13 of 2003 and following that procedure, the President may remove  the Chairman  and such being the position, the office of the Chairman of the BERC is an office  in the service of the Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>          Dr. Shahdeen Malik further submits that to deal with the energy resources of the Republic is essentially a function  of the Government of Bangladesh and the BERC being empowered by the Parliament  to deal with some of the aspects and functions in  relation  to the energy  resources of  Bangladesh is performing  functions which are  clearly and obviously ‘in respect  of the Government  of Bangladesh’  as  gas (a mineral) is vested in the Government as provided by Article 143 of the Constitution and therefore the office of the Chairman of the BERC is, no doubt, an office in the service of the  Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>          Dr. Shahdeen Malik next submits that the functions which are now being performed  by the BERC under the Act  No. 13 of 2003  were performed directly by the Government through the relevant Ministry;  but the Parliament  in its wisdom  thought it  expedient and desirable  to entrust those functions to an independent body to ensure accountability  and public/private involvement in regulating  the energy sector and mere establishment  of the BERC to that effect does not mean that the Government has completely divested itself  of its sovereign and  executive rights and power over mineral resources such as gas in that the BERC can not dilute the power and  authority  of the Republic under Article 143 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>          Dr. Shahdeen Malik also submits that Section 58 of the Act No. 13 of 2003 authorizes the Government to frame rules for the fulfillment of the objectives of the Act and Section 24 thereof provides for the powers and functions of the Government in regulating the energy sector of the country and that being so, the functions of the BERC are functions in relation to and in respect of the Government of Bangladesh.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>          Dr. Shahdeen Malik also submits that the present case is quite distinguishable from that of Aminul Haque Helal (Md)…Vs… Justice Sultan Hossain Khan and others reported in 11 BLC (HCD) 339 where the appointment of the Chairman of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) was by a Selection Committee chaired by a Judge of  the Appellate Division and other Members of the Selection Committee consisted of a Judge of the High Court Division,  Comptroller and Auditor-General  of Bangladesh, Chairman of the Public Service Commission and the last retired Cabinet Secretary and it was rightly held that as the committee selected the Chairman of the ACC, the Government  did not  control  or influence his selection and  he is removable  in the manner prescribed in Article 96 of the Constitution which ensures that the Government  does neither control nor exercise any influence in removing the  Chairman of the ACC and in this perspective, the post of the Chairman  of the ACC was not deemed to be in the service of the Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>          Dr. Shahdeen Malik further submits that the fund of the BERC has been created as per Section 17 of the Act No. 13 of 2003 and it is a public fund and the BERC is not the owner of that fund which is fortified by Section 17(4) of the Act and this aspect of the case can not be disregarded at all and this is a pointer to the fact that the office of the respondent no. 2 is  an office in the service of the Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>          Dr. Shahdeen Malik also submits that the necessity of giving public advertisements in daily newspapers and formation of Selection Committees for appointment of competent persons to the posts of the  Chairman and the Members of the BERC stems from the language of the relevant  provisions  of the Act No. 13 of 2003, but the President, through the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, without complying  with the procedure, appointed the respondent no. 2 as the Chairman of the BERC in a clandestine and non-transparent manner.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>          Dr. Shahdeen Malik lastly submits that the petitioner has brought the Writ Petition bonafide and not malafide and as per Article 102 (2) (b)(ii) of the Constitution, any person can come up with a writ of quo warranto provided he has bonafide  intention in bringing the same and  this is why, the  Writ Petition is very much competent.  <br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>          Per contra, Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 2, submits that the Writ Petition has been filed with a view to challenging the constitutional validity  of the appointment of the respondent no. 2 as the Chairman of the BERC primarily on the ground that the respondent no. 2 is a former Comptroller and Auditor-General of Bangladesh  and as such he is not eligible for holding any  further office in ‘the service of the Republic’ as postulated by Article 129(4) of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>          Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam  further submits that Article 152(1) of the Constitution  provides that ‘the service of the Republic’ means any service, post or office whether in a civil or military capacity, in respect of the Government of Bangladesh, and any other service declared by law to be a service of the Republic and evidently there are two categories  which may be recognized as the service of the Republic, one which falls within the definition of  service in respect of the Government and the other category  which may be declared by law to be treated as  service of the Republic and since there is no such declaration under the law (Act No. 13 of 2003),  it is important to consider  the words  ‘in respect of the Government of Bangladesh’  as  used in  the definition of ‘the service of the Republic’ given in Article 152(1) of the Constitution and the scheme of the Act does not indicate that the respondent no. 2  is  performing  functions in respect of the Government of Bangladesh.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>          Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam further submits that  it is  a case  not only of absence  of such a declaration as contemplated by the definition of ‘the service of the Republic’ in Article 152(1),  there is,  on the other hand, a declaration in the reverse direction prominently  displayed in the long title of the law (Act No. 13 of 2003) itself proclaiming the object of the law to make the BERC an independent and neutral body and the all-important question in this case is whether this Court  can treat the office of the Chairman of the BERC  as an office in ‘the service of the Republic’ ignoring a declaration by the Parliament  otherwise.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>          Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam  also submits that the Constitution defines the term ‘the State’ in Article 152(1) which includes Parliament, Government and Statutory  Public Authorities and the term ‘the State’ is a genus  which has  three species, namely, Parliament, Government and  Statutory Public Authorities and this definition by identifying ‘Statutory Public Authorities’ separately from ‘the Government’ itself indicates that Statutory Public Authorities are not part of the ‘Government’ both being two distinct species of the genus ‘the State’  and by that reason, the Chairman of the BERC  (a Statutory Public Authority) can not be said to be in ‘the service of the Republic.’<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>          Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam further submits that the BERC is an independent and impartial regulatory body for the energy sector and in view of the preamble of the Act No. 13 of 2003, it is crystal clear that the functions and responsibilities of the BERC as detailed in the said Act are to be performed independently, impartially and neutrally  by the Chairman and the Members of the BERC in the relevant fields and regard being had to the independent, impartial and neutral character of the BERC,  its Chairman (respondent no. 2) can not be regarded as a person in the service of the Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>          Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam also submits that the respondent no.2 does not hold the office of the Chairman of the BERC under the ‘pleasure doctrine’ of the President and the independence of the office of the Chairman has been achieved through legal protection to the tenure of his office and through establishing an exhaustive list of grounds for removal which are internationally acceptable and according to Section 11 of the Act No. 13 of 2003, the Chairman of the BERC can not be removed at the sweet will of the President and since  the  ‘pleasure doctrine’ of the President   is not applicable  as to his removal, his office is not an office in  the service of the Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>          Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam next submits that the BERC is not funded by the Consolidated Fund of the State, but by its  own fund known as “Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission Fund” under Section 17 of the Act No. 13 of 2003  and that Section provides that the pay and allowances etc.  of Members and employees shall be paid  and all other expenditures of the BERC shall be borne out of this Fund and  this being the state of affairs, it necessarily follows  that the Chairman of the BERC (respondent no. 2)  is not in the service of the Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>          Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam also submits that Section 55 of the Act No. 13 of 2003 provides that any decision or order given by the BERC under the Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder shall be deemed  to be final and  in consequence, the same is not subject to review by any authority (excepting judicial review)  which clearly  demonstrates  the independent  and separate character of the BERC from the Government and in this perspective, the office of the Chairman of the BERC  is not an office in the service of the Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>          Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam further submits that Section 26 of the Act No. 13 of 2003 lays stress on the independent and distinct existence of the BERC  from the Government providing that in case of difference of opinion or dispute between the BERC and the Government on any matter,  the Government shall discuss the same with the BERC and if necessary, the Government shall resolve the difference of opinion or the dispute with the assistance  of experienced professionals and this is how the Act No. 13 of 2003 makes a clear dividing  line between the Government and the BERC  leading us to conclude that the respondent no. 2 is not holding any office in the service of the Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>          Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam also submits that the Act No. 13 of 2003 distinguishes  and differentiates  the BERC  from Government Authority and Local Authority as defined  in  Section 2 of the Act and since the BERC is  neither a Government  Authority  nor a Local Authority as per Section 2, logically it follows that it is not part of the  Executive Government or any Local  Government authority and  from this standpoint, the respondent no. 2 is not in the service of the Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>          Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam  next submits that according to Article 129(4) of the Constitution on ceasing to hold office, the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall not be eligible for further office in the service  of the Republic, and to construe  the meaning of ‘further office’, the principle of ‘ejusdem generis’ is to be applied  meaning thereby that on ceasing  to hold office, the respondent no.2  shall not be  eligible  for further office in any constitutional post  and admittedly the post of the Chairman of the BERC is not a constitutional post and from this point of view, the constitutional validity of the appointment of the respondent no. 2 as the Chairman of the BERC can not be challenged by the petitioner.<br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong>          Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam also submits that the Writ Petition has been brought by the petitioner not in vindication of any public right but for vindication of a coterie right and as the Writ Petition has been filed  malafide and out of oblique motives,  it is incompetent.<br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong>          Mr. Korunamoy Chakma, learned Deputy Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 1, adopts the submissions advanced by Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam.<br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong>          We have heard the submissions of the learned Advocate Dr.  Shahdeen Malik and the counter-submissions of the learned Advocate Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam and perused the Writ Petition, Supplementary Affidavits, Affidavit-in-Opposition, Affidavit-in-Reply and relevant Annexures annexed thereto.<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong>          Article 102(2)(b)(ii) of the Constitution provides that on the application of any person,  the High Court Division  may inquire whether a person holding or  purporting to hold any public office  is holding it under a legal authority. This is a jurisdiction to issue writ in the nature of quo warranto. This writ is used to ensure that no one can hold any public office without having a valid claim to that office.<br/> <br/><strong>34.</strong>          The writ of quo warranto lies “against a person who claimed or usurped an office, franchise or liberty, to inquire by what authority he supported his claim, in order that the right to the office or franchise might be determined. It also lies in cases of non-user, abuse, or long neglect of a franchise.” (Halsbury- Laws of England, 4th Edition, Volume 1, Paragraph, 169)<br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong>          Broadly speaking, the quo warranto proceeding affords a judicial inquiry in which any person holding an independent substantive public office, or franchise, or liberty, is called upon to show by what right he holds the said office, franchise or liberty; if the inquiry leads to the finding that the holder of the office has no valid title to it, the issue of the writ of quo warranto ousts him from that office. In other words, the procedure of quo warranto confers jurisdiction and authority on the higher judiciary to control executive actions in making appointments to public offices against the relevant constitutional or statutory provisions. It also protects a citizen from being deprived of a public office to which he may have a right. (University of Mysore v. Govinda Rao, AIR 1965 SC 491)<br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong>          In order that the writ of quo warranto may issue, the office must be a public office of a substantive character created by the Constitution, statute or statutory power. A public office is a right, authority and duty, created and conferred by law, by which an individual is vested with some portion of the sovereign functions of the Government to be exercised by him for the benefit of the public, for the term and by the tenure prescribed by law and thus it is an office in which the public have interest. The expression ‘substantive character’ means that the holder of the office must be an independent official and not merely one discharging the function as a deputy or servant at the will and pleasure of others. But the writ will lie in respect of an office held at pleasure, provided that the office is one of a public and substantive character.<br/> <br/><strong>37.</strong>          The writ of quo warranto will issue where there is a clear violation of any constitutional provision or any provision having the force of law as distinguished from an administrative instruction in entering or holding the public office. A person will be found to hold the public office without lawful authority if he is not qualified to hold the office or some mandatory provision of law which can not be cured as an ‘irregularity’ has been violated in making the appointment or in entering the office or when the appointment has been made by a person who had no authority to appoint.<br/> <br/><strong>38.</strong>          Article 102 (2) of the Constitution does not require that the applicant for a writ of quo warranto must be an aggrieved party. Any person may apply as the inquiry relates to a matter in which the public are interested. Any member of the public acting in good faith whose conduct does not disentitle him to an equitable relief may apply for the writ of quo warranto without showing any violation of his legal right. The relief is discretionary and hence in an application for quo warranto, it is legitimate for the Court to examine the bonafides or good faith of the applicant. Where the applicant is found to have an ulterior motive, or is not playing his own game and has filed the writ petition not for vindication of any public right or for redress of any public wrong, no relief will be granted.    <br/> <br/><strong>39.</strong>          In the case of Md. Idrisur Rahman …Vs… Md. Shahid Uddin Ahmed and others; 19 BLD(HCD)291, it has been held that any citizen of the State can maintain an application in the nature of quo warranto if  he finds that anybody is holding any public office in flagrant violation of any constitutional provision or any other law (paragraph-9). <br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong>          The upshot of the above discussion is that any member of the public acting in good faith whose conduct does not disentitle him to the equitable relief of quo warranto may apply to the High Court Division without showing any violation of his legal right. <br/> <br/><strong>41.</strong>          It is on record that Dr. Tureen Afroze is the daughter of the Chairman of the petitioner and once by the Memo No. বিইআরসি/প্রশা-০৭৫/৫৫৩৩ dated 13.11.2008, she was appointed as a Panel Lawyer on a retainer of Taka 1000/- per mensem and she declined to work by her letter dated 20.11.2008. Of course, the earlier Memo dated 13.11.2008 was subsequently modified by the Memo No বিইআরসি/প্রশা-০৭৫/৫৬৯৬ dated 4th December, 2008. By the Memo dated 04.12.2008, the BERC decided that the monthly retainer  would not be provided to her; but if she renders any legal assistance to the BERC, a reasonable honorarium  may be given to her through mutual negotiations and as per prevalent rate. These correspondences have been marked Annexure-‘H’ series to the Affidavit-in-Reply.<br/> <br/><strong>42.</strong>          It transpires that the Annexure-‘H’ series are prior to the issuance of the impugned Memo dated 11.10.2009. The petitioner has challenged the constitutional validity of the appointment of the respondent no. 2 as the Chairman of the BERC under the said Memo dated 11.10.2009. Since the Annexure-‘H’ series are prior to the impugned Memo dated 11.10.2009, it can not be said that the father of Dr. Tureen Afroze (Chairman of the petitioner) was actuated by any ill- will or malice in coming up with the Writ Petition.<br/> <br/><strong>43.</strong>          There is no gainsaying the fact that Dr. Tureen Afroze had some relationship with the BERC before the appointment of the respondent no. 2 as its Chairman. This relationship with the BERC at some point of time, as we see it, can not be construed to disentitle the petitioner to come up with the Writ Petition. Given this scenario, we hold that the Writ Petition is maintainable.<br/> <br/><strong>44.</strong>          At this juncture, the most important question is whether the office of the Chairman of the BERC is an office in the service of the Republic. The other pertinent question is whether the respondent no. 2 was appointed as the Chairman of the BERC in violation of the provisions of Article 129(4) of the Constitution. These are very vital questions to be answered either in the affirmative or in the negative for proper and effectual adjudication of the Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>45.</strong>          In the case of Ruhul Quddus, Advocate and others …Vs…Justice M. A Aziz and others reported in 60 DLR (HCD) 511, it has been held in paragraphs 254, 255 and 256:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>২৫৪. এখানে আরও উল্লেখ্য যে , ‘প্রজাতন্ত্রের খল-হ এই শব্দদ্বয়ের সংজ্ঞা ভারতীয় সংবিধানের ন্যায় কোন বিশেষ অধ্যায়ের সহিত সংযুক্ত করা হয় নাই বরং সংবিধানের শেষ পর্যায়ে সাধারণ ভাবে প্রদান করিয়াছে । ফলে  উক্ত সংজ্ঞা কোন বিশেষ অধ্যায়ে বর্ণিত শব্দের সংজ্ঞা হিঢ়েলয পরিচিত হইবে না । বরং সকল অধ্যায়ের লৎলণঈ সার্বঝব£ব হিসেবে প্রশেবঝণ্ঠ হইবে। সেইক্ষেত্রে সংবিধানের ১, ২, ৭(১), ২৯(১) (২), ৫৯, ৬০ ইত্যাদি বিভিন্ন অনুচ্ছেদে উপস্থিত ‘প্রজাতন্ত্র’ শব্দটির ব্যাপকতা স্মরণ রাখিতে হইবে এবং সেই প্রেক্ষাপটে ‘কর্ম’ কথাটির অর্থ সংবিধানের বিভিন্ন ভাগে এমনকি অনুচ্ছেদে বিভিন্নরুপ হইবে। সেই কারণে স্পষ্টতঃ ‘প্রজাতন্ত্রের কর্ম’ শব্দদ্বয়ের মধ্যে ‘কর্ম’ কথাটি ‘প্রজাতন্ত্র’ কথাটির ব্যাপ্তি ও ঢ়বয-ঝব£বধব কখনও সীমিত বা ঢ়খিমভছধ করেনাু বরঞ্চ সংবিধানের বিভিন্ন অংশের প্রেক্ষাপটে যণ্ঠযয়ক্ষ্মধ  ‘প্রজাতম’¿ শব্দটির প্রকৃত আঙ্গিকে ওকর্মহ কথাটির অর্থ অবম্ফবযব করিতে হইবে। অর্থাৎ ‘কর্ম’ শব্দটি ‘প্রজাতন্ত্র’ শব্দকে নিয়ন্ত্রণ করেনা, বরং ‘প্রজাতন্ত্র’ শব্দটি ‘কর্ম’ শব্দকে নিয়ন্ত্রন কষে। এই কারণেই ‘প্রজাতন্ত্রেষ কর্মে’ শব্দদ্বয় সংবিধানের নবম ভাগে ব্যবহার করতঃ সরকারি কর্মচারী বুঝাইয়াছে । কিন্তু ঐ একই শব্দ ৯৯ ও ১১৮(৩) অনুচ্ছেদে ব্যযয়ক্ষ্মধ হইয়া যথাক্রমে বিচারক বা নির্বাচন কমিশনারের সমপর্যায়ভুক্ত বা উপরস্থ বা ১৪৭(৪) অনুচ্ছেদে বর্ণিত কর্ম, চাকুরী বা পদ বুঝাইতেছে, কিন্তু সেক্ষেত্রে কখনই সরকারি কর্মচাষ£ বা তাহাদেষ  কর্ম বুঝাইতেছে না। প্রেক্ষাপট বা পড়হঃবীঃ পরিবর্তনের সংগে সংগে প্রজাতন্ত্রেষ ‘কর্ম’ শব্দটির অর্থের ও ব্যাপকতার পরিবর্তন ঘটিতেছে, তাহা অনুধাবণ করিতে হইবে।<br/>২৫৫. তাহাছাড়া, সংশ্লিষ্ট পেক্ষাপটের আলোকে ‘প্রজাতন্ত্র’ শব্দটির প্রকৃত অর্থ উপলব্ধি করিতে হইবে।<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“a word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged; it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in colour and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.” (Justice Holmes in Towne vs Esner, 1917).</em><br/> <br/>এই কারণেই নবম ভাগে উপরোক্ত শব্দদ্বয় যণ্ঠযয়ক্ষ্মধ হইলে নির্বাহী সরকাষে নিয়োগ প্রাপ্ত কর্ম, চাকুরী বা পদ বুঝাইবে । কিন্তু ষষ্ঠ  ও সপ্তম ভাগে উক্ত শব্দদ্বয় যণ্ঠযয়ক্ষ্মধ হইলে ১৪৭(৪) অনুচ্ছেদে বর্ণিত পদ সমূহ বুঝাইবে।<br/> <br/>২৫৬. তাহাছাড়া, ‘প্রজাতন্ত্রের কর্ম’ কথাটির ব্যাখ্যায় বাংলাদেশ সরকার শব্দদ্বয়ের পর ‘সংক্রান্ত’ শব্দটি বসান হইয়াছে। ইংরেজি ভাষায়  ‘Government of Bangladesh’ কথাগুলির পূবে ‘in respect of’ শব্দগুলি বসান হইয়াছে। ইহাতে প্রতীয়মান হয় যে, সংশ্লিষ্ট কর্ম, চাকুরী বা পদ শুধুমাত্র সরকারেই নয় , সরকার সম্পর্কিত সকল প্রকার কর্ম, চাকুরী বা পদ বুঝাইবে। ইহাতেও প্রতীয়মান হয় যে, উক্ত কর্ম, চাকুরী বা পদ (service, post or office) শুধুমাত্র ভবর্যাহী সরকারে সীমাবদ্ধ নয়। ইহার আরও ব্যাপক ভিত্তি ও ব্যবহার রহিয়াছে শবয়ব সংবিধানের বিভিন্ন অংশে ব্যক্ত সংশ্লিষ্ট প্রেক্ষাপট অনুসারে অর্থ বুঝিতে হইবে.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>46.</strong>          In the case of Aminul Haque Helal (Md)…Vs… Justice Sultan Hossain Khan and others reported in 11 BLC (HCD) 339, it has been held in paragraph 12:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“12. This Court in the case of Abu Bakar Siddique vs Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed and others considered the meaning and ambit of the expression ‘the service of the Republic’ and also in the case of Shamsul Huq Chowdhury vs Justice Mohammad Abdur Rouf where similar arguments were advanced that they render service towards the Republic and get their remunerations from the Public Exchequer and, therefore, they hold office in the service of Republic. A Division Bench of this Court rejected the contentions holding that Judges of the Supreme Court are not holding any office of profit in the service of Republic under Part IX of Chapter 1 of the Constitution. In that case, this Court also considered the case of Abdus Shukur vs Rikab Chand reported in 1958 AIR 52 and another decision at page 937 of the same report. The case of the Guru Gobinda Basu vs Sankari Proshad Ghosal, reported in AIR 1964(SC) 254 was also considered. In those decisions, the point as to the service of the Government of India was argued and it was held that the decisive tests in the matter of appointment in the service of the Government are generally five in number: </em><br/><em>Government must be maker of appointment of the persons.  </em><br/><em>The authority has got the right to remove the holders of office. </em><br/><em>Government must pay remuneration to them from the Public Exchequer. </em><br/><em>The holders of office must perform duties for the Government. </em><br/><em>The Government has control over the performance of the duties of the holders of office.  </em><br/><em>It was held in the case of Guru Gobinda Basu vs Sankari Prasad Ghosal and others reported in AIR 1964 (SC) 254 that for holding an office of profit under the Government, one need not be in the service of Government and there need be no relationship of master and servant between them. The Constitution itself makes a distinction between the holder of an office of profit under the Government and the holder of a post or service under the Government. The Constitution has also made a distinction between the holder of an office of profit under the Government and the holder of an office of profit under a local or other authority subject to the control of the Government. The decisive test for determining whether a person holds any office of profit under the Government is the test of appointment. It is not correct to say that the several factors which enter into the determination of this question–the appointing authority, the authority vested with power to determine the appointment, the authority which determines the remuneration, the source from which the remuneration is paid, and the authority vested with power to control the manner in which the duties of the office are discharged and to give directions in that behalf must all co-exist and each must show subordination of the Government and that if one of the elements is absent, the test of a person holding an office under the Government, Central or State, is not satisfied. The circumstance that the source from which the remuneration is paid is not from public revenue is a neutral factor not decisive of the question. Whether stress will be laid on one factor or the other will depend on the facts of each case. However, where the several elements, the power to control and give directions as to the manner in which the duties of the office are to be performed, and the power to determine the question of remuneration are all present in a given case, then it must be held that the officer in question holds the office under the authority so empowered.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>47.</strong>          It is an indisputable fact that the respondent no. 2 is a former Comptroller and Auditor-General of Bangladesh. Needless to say, he was a constitutional office-holder before his appointment as the Chairman of the BERC under the impugned Memo dated 11.10.2009. Article 129(4) of the Constitution contemplates that on ceasing to hold office, the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall not be eligible for further office in the service of the Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>48.</strong>          Now let us have a look at the debarring clauses, if any, in respect of employment of other constitutional functionaries after expiry of their terms.<br/> <br/><strong>49.</strong>          Article 139(4) of the Constitution  provides  that on ceasing to hold office, a Member of a Public Service Commission shall not be eligible for further employment in the service of the Republic, but, subject to the provisions of clause (1)-(a)  a Chairman so ceasing shall be eligible for re-appointment for one further term; and (b) a Member (other than the Chairman) so ceasing shall be eligible for re-appointment for one further term or for appointment as Chairman of a Public Service Commission.<br/> <br/><strong>50.</strong>          Article 99(1) of the Constitution provides that except as provided in clause(2), a person who has held office as a Judge otherwise than as an Additional Judge shall not, after his retirement or removal therefrom, plead or act before any court or authority or hold any office of profit in the service of the Republic not being a judicial or quasi-judicial office or the office of Chief Adviser or Adviser.<br/> <br/><strong>51.</strong>          Article 99(2) of the Constitution contemplates that a person who has held office as a Judge of the High Court Division may, after his retirement or removal therefrom, plead or act before the Appellate Division.<br/> <br/><strong>52.</strong>          Article 118(3) of the Constitution  postulates  that subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the term of office of an Election Commissioner shall be five years from the date on which he enters upon his office, and a person who has held office as Chief Election Commissioner shall not be eligible for appointment in the service of the Republic and any other Election Commissioner shall, on ceasing  to hold  office as such, be eligible for appointment as Chief Election Commissioner but shall not be otherwise eligible for appointment in the service of the Republic.  <br/> <br/><strong>53.</strong>          So it is seen that the Legislature has not used any uniform clause debarring the constitutional functionaries from appointment or holding any office in the service of the Republic after expiration of their terms. Precisely speaking, the language of the debarring clauses is not identical; but the inner spirit of the language seems to be more or less one and the same.<br/> <br/><strong>54.</strong>          Article 152(1) of the Constitution provides that ‘the service of the Republic’ means any service, post or office whether in a civil or military capacity, in respect of the Government of Bangladesh, and any other service declared by law to be a service of the Republic. Again Article 152(1) of the Constitution defines ‘the Republic’ as the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. It is worthy of notice that the service of the Republic does not mean any service, post or office whether in a civil or military capacity in the service of the Government of Bangladesh. But it means any service, post or office whether   in a civil or military capacity in respect of the Government of Bangladesh. The term ‘service in respect of the Government of Bangladesh’ is undoubtedly wider and more comprehensive than the term ‘service in the Government of Bangladesh.’  <br/> <br/><strong>55.</strong>          Part IX of the Constitution deals with the services of Bangladesh. Apart from Part IX, there are other services like the defence services (Chapter IV of Part IV) and judicial service (Chapter II of Part VI) which are also services of the Republic. In other words, the defence personnel and judicial officers are in the service of the Republic, though Article 133 of the Constitution is not applicable to them. So Part IX of the Constitution, we are led to hold, is not all-inclusive about the services of Bangladesh.<br/> <br/><strong>56.</strong>          Article 152(1) of the Constitution envisages that “the State” includes Parliament, Government and Statutory Public Authorities. It transpires that Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam has rightly submitted that the State is a genus and Parliament, Government and Statutory Public Authorities are three species of that genus. In this context,  a vital question  crops up: whether the Secretary and other functionaries manning the Parliament (excepting the Speaker and Members of Parliament) and the functionaries manning Statutory Public Authorities are persons in the service of the Republic or not?<br/> <br/><strong>57.</strong>          A Statutory Public Authority as defined in Article 152(1) of the Constitution means any authority, corporation or body the activities or the principal activities of which are authorized by any Act, ordinance, order or instrument having the force of law in Bangladesh. It is an admitted fact that the BERC has been established under the Act No. 13 of 2003 and its activities are authorized thereunder.  So the BERC is a Statutory Public Authority. <br/> <br/><strong>58.</strong>          In the case of the Secretary, Ministry of Finance…..Vs….Md. Masdar Hossain and others reported in 52 DLR (AD) 82, it has been held in paragraph 27:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“27. We shall answer what is meant by “Government” in the definition of “the service of the Republic” by taking note of the fact that the Constitution uses that word both in the sense of Executive Government and in a generic sense. Chapters I, II, IIA and III of Part IV use the word in the sense of Executive Government. But Chapter II of Part V. “Legislative and Financial Procedure” uses the word “Government” in a generic sense, meaning the Republic as a whole. Part IX is concerned with “the Services of Bangladesh”, not just one service. In the definition of “the service of the Republic”, a broad distinction has been drawn between civil service and military service. All those who are civilian public officers are entitled to the protection of Article 135. The Constitution in Article 152(1) defines “public officer” as “a person holding or acting in any office of emolument in the service of the Republic”. Persons appointed to the Secretariat of Parliament and the Staff of the Supreme Court, although governed by separate terms and conditions of service, are entitled to the protection of Article 135 because they are public officers holding or acting in an office of emolument in the service of the Republic. They are not in the executive administrative service of the Executive Government of Bangladesh, but broadly, and in a generic sense, in a service in respect of the Government of Bangladesh. The definition of “the service of the Republic” uses the word “Government” in a generic sense. Hence on that ground, the members of the judicial service can not be excluded from the ambit of “the service of the Republic”. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>59.</strong>          It is admitted by the parties that the service of the BERC has not been declared by the Act No. 13 of 2003 to be a service of the Republic as per the definition of ‘the service of the Republic’ in Article 152(1) of the Constitution. In the absence of such a declaration, we are to scrutinize the scheme and the relevant provisions of the Act No. 13 of 2003 to arrive at a correct decision as to whether the respondent no. 2 is holding any office in the service of the Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>60.</strong>          Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam has drawn our attention to the long title and  the preamble of the Act No. 13 of 2003. The long title is to the effect that it is an Act to make provisions for the establishment of an independent and impartial regulatory commission for the energy sector. The preamble indicates that  it is expedient to make  provisions for the establishment  of an independent and impartial  regulatory commission  to create an atmosphere conducive to private investment in the generation of  electricity,  and  transmission,  transportation and marketing of gas resources and petroleum  products,  to ensure transparency  in the management, operation and tariff determination in these sectors; to protect consumers’ interest and to promote  the creation of a competitive market. It is obvious from the long title and the preamble of the Act No. 13 of 2003 that the BERC is an independent and impartial regulatory body.  It is a statutory public body short of a constitutional body.<br/> <br/><strong>61.</strong>          In Section 2 of the Act No. 13 of 2003, ‘energy’ has been defined as electricity, gas and petroleum product. As per that Section (Section 2), ‘Government Authority’ means the Power Development Board established by the Presidential Order, the Rural Electrification Board established under the Rural Electrification Act, the Dhaka Power Supply Authority established under the DESA Act and any other organization fully owned by the Government and ‘Local Authority’ means the local government authority constituted under a statute for the fulfillment of the purpose of Article 59 of the Constitution. Hence it is abundantly clear that the BERC is neither a ‘Government Authority’ nor a ‘Local Authority’ as defined in Section 2 of the Act. But it should be borne in mind that the term “Government Authority” has been given a very restricted meaning in Section 2. This restricted meaning of the term ‘Government Authority’, according to us, can not place the functions of the BERC outside the ambit of those in respect of the Government of Bangladesh. Moreover, as per Section 27(2) of the Act No. 13 of 2003, the BERC is a licensing authority of those Government Authorities for the purposes of the Act.<br/> <br/><strong>62.</strong>          In view of non-obstante clause in Section 3 the Act No. 13 of 2003, it is an overriding law. Section 6(2) of the Act provides that the Chairman and the Members shall be appointed by the President on the basis of the proposal of the Ministry (Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources) and they shall be full-time officers of the BERC. As per Section 6(4), the Chairman shall be the Chief Executive of the BERC. Section 10 provides that the status, pay and allowances, seniority and other terms of the Chairman and the Members of the BERC shall be determined by the prescribed rules provided that until such rules are framed, those shall be determined by the Government.  The procedure for removal of a Member of the BERC on certain specified grounds has been laid down in Section 11. Section 16(1) postulates that a Member of the Commission, without the written permission of the Government and any employee, without the written permission of the BERC, shall not engage himself or continue in any profitable pursuit outside the BERC. It may be recalled that ‘Member’ means any Member of the BERC including its Chairman as is evident from the definition clause (Section 2).<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Section 17 of the Act No. 13 of 2003 is as follows:</strong><br/> <br/><em>“17. Funds of the Commission –</em><br/><em>(1) There shall be a fund to be called “Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission Fund” and money, as mentioned below, shall be deposited in the Fund, such as:-</em></div><ul><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>grant from the Government or statutory body; </em></li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>loans borrowed by the Commission;</em></li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>fees and charges deposited under this Act; and </em></li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>money received from any other source. </em></li></ul><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>(2) The amount of the Fund shall be maintained in the name of the Commission in any Scheduled Bank determined by the Commission, and procedure for withdrawal of money from the Bank is to be specified by regulation.</em><br/><em>(3) The pay and allowances etc. of Members and employees shall be paid and all other expenditures of the Commission shall be borne out of this Fund. </em><br/><em>(4) After meeting all expenses, any remaining unspent money of the Revenue budget shall be deposited to the Consolidated Fund.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>63.</strong>          Section 20(3) of the Act No. 13 of 2003 provides that apart from the audit  as mentioned in sub-section(2), the BERC, as a statutory public authority  within the meaning of the Comptroller and Auditor-General (Additional Functions) Act, 1974(XXIV of 1974), shall be under the jurisdiction of the Comptroller &amp; Auditor-General.<br/> <br/><strong>64.</strong>          The functions of the BERC, amongst others, as per Section 22 of the Act No. 13 of 2003, are to extend co-operation and advice to the Government, if necessary, regarding electricity generation, transmission,  marketing, supply, distribution and storage of energy; to resolve disputes   between  licensees, and  between licensees and consumers, and refer those to arbitration, if considered necessary; and to perform any incidental functions, if considered appropriate by the BERC for the fulfillment of the objectives of the Act for electricity generation and energy transmission, marketing, supply, storage, efficient use, quality of services, tariff fixation and safety improvement.<br/> <br/><strong>65.</strong>          Chapter V of the Act No. 13 of 2003 deals with the relationship between the Government and the BERC. In this connection, Section 24 of the Act appears to be very material. However, Section 24 is reproduced below:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“24. Powers of the Government for the Energy Sector –</em><br/><em>(1) The Government shall have the power of giving policy directives for the development and overall planning in energy sector. </em><br/><em>(2) The Government, if necessary, shall issue any policy directive in consultation with the Commission. </em><br/><em>(3) The Government shall make policies providing therein the scope for overall planning and co-ordination for the sake of development of energy sector giving priority to the need of energy for different socio-economic classes, and areas, and to achieve desired level of economic growth, and for conservation of energy as future sources of power.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>66.</strong>          Section 26 of the Act No. 13 of 2003 envisages that in case of difference of opinion or dispute arising out of any matter mentioned in the Act, the Government shall discuss the matter with the BERC, and if it appears necessary, the Government shall resolve the difference of opinion, or the dispute, as the case may be, with the assistance of experienced professionals. The consultative function of the Government and its ultimate resolution of the bone of contention, if any, between it and the BERC with the assistance of experienced professionals, as we see it, can not constitute any yardstick by which we can come to the conclusion that the Chairman of the BERC is not holding an office in the service of the Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>67.</strong>          Section 34(1) of the Act No. 13 of 2003 contemplates that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the price of power generation in wholesale, bulk and retail, and the supply of energy at the level of end-user, shall be determined in accordance  with the policy and methodology made by the BERC in consultation with the Government. Judging from this angle, the Government has a definite role in the matter and this role can not be whittled down at all.<br/> <br/><strong>68.</strong>          Section 61 of the Act No. 13 of 2003 mandates that the Chairman, Members, other officers and employees of the BERC shall be deemed to be public servants within the meaning of Section 21 of the Penal Code, 1860.<br/> <br/><strong>69.</strong>          From an overview of the scheme and various provisions of the Act No. 13 of 20003, we are led to hold that the BERC is an independent and impartial regulatory authority, albeit it has to function within the parameters of the policy directives of the Government. However, the finality of the decisions or orders of the BERC as contemplated by Section 55 of the Act No. 13 of 2003 can not in any way impel us to hold that the respondent no. 2 is not performing functions in respect of the Government of  Bangladesh. Besides, as conceded by Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam, the decisions or orders of the BERC are subject to judicial review under Article 102 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>70.</strong>          As already found, the Chairman of the BERC is deemed to be a public servant within the meaning of Section 21 of the Penal Code as per Section 61 of the Act No. 13 of 2003. Indisputably the Government is the appointing authority of the Chairman. In view of the provisions of Section 10 of the Act No.13 of 2003, it is clear that the status, pay and allowances and other terms of the Chairman and the Members of the BERC shall be determined by the prescribed rules. But since no rules have been framed under Section 58 of the Act as yet, those of the Chairman and the Members of the BERC shall be determined by the Government. In the absence of any rules framed under Section 58, the terms and conditions  of the service of the respondent no. 2 have been determined by the Government as evidenced by the impugned  Memo dated 11.10.2009 (Annexure-‘D’ to the Writ Petition).<br/> <br/><strong>71.</strong>          The authority, or for that matter, the President is empowered to remove the respondent no. 2 from his office in accordance with the procedure laid down in Section 11 of the Act No. 13 of 2003. It has already been mentioned that the BERC is under the jurisdiction of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of Bangladesh within the meaning of the Comptroller and Auditor-General (Additional Functions) Act, 1974 (Section 20(3) of the Act No. 13 of 2003). So in this respect, the Comptroller and Auditor-General controls the BERC, though on a limited scale. It is a stunning fact that the respondent no. 2, being  a former Comptroller and Auditor-General of Bangladesh,  joined the office of the Chairman of the BERC on the basis of the impugned Memo dated 11.10.2009 without any qualms.<br/> <br/><strong>72.</strong>          Undeniably, the pay and allowances of the Chairman and the Members and other employees of the BERC are paid and all other expenditures are met from the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission Fund. Sub-Section (4) of Section 17 of the Act No. 13 of 2003, as adverted to earlier, contemplates that after meeting all expenses, any remaining unspent money of the Revenue Budget shall be deposited to the Consolidated Fund. The Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission Fund, inter alia, comprises grants from the Government of Bangladesh.  As such, the grants from the Government form part of the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission Fund. What we are driving at boils down to this: For all practical purposes, the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission Fund has its origin from diverse sources including grants from the  Government. In such a posture of things, the pay, allowances and other financial benefits of the Chairman of the BERC are not solely dependent on the charges, money etc. received from other sources.<br/> <br/><strong>73.</strong>          Article 134 of the Constitution provides that except as otherwise provided by it, every person in the service of the Republic shall hold office during the pleasure of the President. So it seems that the ‘pleasure doctrine’ of the President is not absolute, but qualified. A person who holds any civil post in the service of the Republic is entitled to the protection afforded by Article 135 of the Constitution. Like judicial officers or other public servants, the respondent no. 2 is subject to the ‘pleasure doctrine’ of the President, even though he is entitled to the protection of Article 135 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>74.</strong>          The BERC being a statutory public authority is one of the species of the genus ‘the State’.  Parliament is another species of that genus. Parliament is a constitutional body, but its officers including the Secretary to Parliament and employees are in the service of the Republic. They are holding posts in respect of the Government of Bangladesh. Judicial Officers are also holding posts in respect of the Government of Bangladesh.<br/> <br/><strong>75.</strong>          The Judicial Administration Training Institute (JATI) is the creation of the Judicial Administration Training Institute Act, 1995. The JATI, like the BERC, is a statutory public authority. It is axiomatic that the officers and employees of the JATI are performing functions in respect of the Government of Bangladesh and in this view of the matter, they are in the service of the Republic. In Masder Hossain’s case (52 DLR (AD) 82), the term ‘Government’ appearing in the definition of the ‘service of the Republic’ in Article 152(1) of the Constitution has been used in a generic sense and not in the sense of the Executive Government alone.<br/> <br/><strong>76.</strong>          Members of Parliament, Speaker, Judges of the Supreme Court, Election Commissioners, Chairman and Members of the Public Service Commission, Comptroller and Auditor-General, Ministers, President of the Republic etc. are all constitutional functionaries. In the case of Shamsul Huq Chowdhury …Vs…Justice Md. Abdur Rouf and others; 49 DLR(HCD) 176, it has been enunciated that there is no reasonable ground to hold that a Judge of the Supreme Court is in the service of the Republic. Following this ‘ratio’, we can say that all other constitutional functionaries including the Comptroller and Auditor-General of Bangladesh are not in the service of the Republic. As such, we can not subscribe to the view taken in the decision in the case of Ruhul Quddus, Advocate and others…Vs… Justice M. A. Aziz and others (60 DLR (HCD)511)  that the persons specified  in Article 147(4) of the Constitution are also in the service of the Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>77.</strong>          The Constitution is the ‘suprema lex’ of the country. As per Article 116A of the Constitution, judicial officers are independent in the discharge of their judicial functions. In spite of their independence, they have been found to be in the service of the Republic. Similarly the functional independence of the Chairman of the BERC can not stand in the way of his being a person in the service of the Republic. <br/> <br/><strong>78.</strong>          The President can remove the respondent no. 2 from his office on certain specified grounds following a special procedure as laid down in Section 11 of the Act No. 13 of 2003.  The constitutional guarantee of Article 96 of the Constitution is absent in Section 11 of the said Act. Besides, the respondent no. 2 is not on a par with any constitutional incumbent.<br/> <br/><strong>79.</strong>          The Bangladesh Supreme Court (High Court Division) Employees (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1983 deal with the disciplinary proceedings of its officers and employees. The disciplinary proceedings taken against a major segment of public servants are under the relevant provisions of the Government Servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1985. Again, the officers and employees of Parliament have got separate Disciplinary Rules.  Given this context, we find that there is no uniform Disciplinary Rules applicable to all categories of public servants. There is no dispute about the proposition that all categories of public servants within the meaning of Section 21 of the Penal Code are in ‘the service of the Republic’. As adverted to earlier, the Chairman of the BERC is deemed to be a public servant within the meaning of Section 21 of that Code. This being the legal position, the respondent no. 2 has all the attributes of a person in the service of the Republic.<br/> <br/><strong>80.</strong>          Be that as it may, since the word ‘Government’ has been found to be  used in a generic sense in the definition of ‘the service of the Republic’  in Article 152(1) of the Constitution by the Appellate Division in Masder Hossain’s case, it is binding upon us in view of Article 111 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>81.</strong>          We are in full agreement with the submission of Dr. Shahdeen Malik that to deal with the energy resources of the Republic is essentially a function of the Government and the BERC being empowered by the Parliament to deal with some of the aspects and functions vis-à-vis the energy resources of Bangladesh is performing functions which are ‘in respect of the Government of Bangladesh’ as gas (a mineral) is vested in the Government as provided by Article 143 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>82.</strong>          We find substance in the contention of Dr. Shahdeen Malik that the functions which are now being performed by the BERC under the Act No. 13 of 2003 were previously performed directly by the Government; but the Parliament in its wisdom thought it expedient and desirable to entrust those functions to the BERC to ensure accountability and public/private involvement in regulating the energy sector and mere establishment of the BERC does not mean that the Government has completely divested itself of its sovereign and executive rights and power over mineral resources in that the BERC can not dilute the power and authority of the Republic under Article 143 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>83.</strong>          As referred to earlier, according to Article 129(4) of the Constitution, on ceasing to hold office, the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall not be eligible for further office in the service of the Republic. We have already found that the constitutional functionaries are not in the service of the Republic. From the context in which the word ‘further’ is used in Article 129(4) and in view of the spirit of the Constitution, it appears that the word ‘further’ necessarily means ‘any’. So our interpretation of Article 129(4) of the Constitution is that on ceasing to hold office, the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall not be eligible for any office in the service of the Republic. In the result, the question of application of the principle of ‘ejusdem generis’ as argued by Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam does not arise at all.<br/> <br/><strong>84.</strong>          From the scheme of the Act No. 13 of 2003 and in the light of the above discussions, we opine that the Chairman of the BERC (respondent no.2) is performing his functions in respect of the Government of Bangladesh and by that reason, he is necessarily in the service of the Republic. As he is in the service of the Republic, he can not hold his present office being an ex-Comptroller and Auditor-General of Bangladesh because of the absolute embargo imposed by Article 129(4) of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>85.</strong>          It is the submission of Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam that the Act No.13 of 2003 does not contemplate any public advertisement in daily newspapers inviting applications for appointment to the post of the Chairman of the BERC and formation of any Selection Committee to recommend the names of some persons to the President through the Administrative Ministry for appointment of any one of them thereto. On the other hand, the submission of Dr. Shahdeen Malik is that the requirements of public advertisement and formation of Selection Committee stem from the language of the law itself. On this point, he draws our attention to the language of Section 7(2)(a) of Act No. 13 of 2003 which is reproduced below:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“Persons employed in the Government service may apply for the post of Chairman or Member subject to fulfillment of the other conditions  in the Act, submitting applications through proper channel; however in case of final selection for appointment, the concerned official can only join in the selected post after severing  lien with the Government service.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>86.</strong>          Unless there is any public advertisement in daily newspapers, persons employed in the Government service can not make any application for the post of the Chairman or a Member of the BERC through proper channel. So it seems that the language of Section 7(2)(a) of the said Act pre-supposes public advertisements in national dailies for the post of the Chairman or a Member of the BERC and consequent formation of a Selection Committee for selection of suitable persons for appointment thereto. Admittedly public advertisements were made inviting applications for appointment to the post of the Chairman or a Member of the BERC earlier, though no Rules have been framed in that regard as yet. The past practice of public process of advertisement and selection is evidenced by Annexure-‘A’ and ‘B’ series to the Writ Petition. What is most striking is that a Member of the BERC was appointed recently following an open process of public advertisement in ‘The Daily Star’ on 19.08.2010 (Annexure-‘I’ to the Supplementary Affidavit dated 29.09.2010). As a matter of fact, the spirit of law (Act No. 13 of 2003) requires an open process of public advertisement and selection of the Chairman of the BERC. But curiously enough, in the case of the incumbent Chairman of the BERC, there has been a departure from that open process. Anyway, it is correct to say that no specific provisions of open public advertisements and formation of selection committees have been contemplated by the Act No. 13 of 2003, though the same are implied therein.  Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we feel constrained to express our opinion that the open process of public advertisement and selection of the respondent no. 2 by a Selection Committee for the post of the Chairman of the BERC was given a go-by by the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources with some ulterior motive.<br/> <br/><strong>87.</strong>          In the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the foregoing discussions, we have no hesitation in holding that the respondent no. 2 was appointed as the Chairman of the BERC by the impugned Memo dated 11.10.2009 in a non-transparent, opaque and hush-hush manner. So we find merit in the Rule. The Rule, therefore, succeeds.<br/> <br/><strong>88.</strong>          Accordingly, the Rule is made absolute without any order as to costs. It is hereby declared that the appointment of the respondent no. 2 and his holding of the public office of the Chairman of the BERC under the impugned Memo No. বিজ্বাখস(প্র-৩)/বাএরেক/নিয়োগ(চেয়ারম্যান)-১৪/২০০৯ dated 11.10.2009 (Annexure-‘D’)  issued by the Ministry of Power, Energy Mineral Resources are without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/> <br/>          Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam prays for a certificate under Article 103(2)(a) of the Constitution as the case involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution. The certificate as prayed for is granted.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

They got appointment in 1994 and joined in the respective posts. They have been performing their duties with utmost sincerity, and unquestionable integrity. The amended Bangladesh Biman Corporation Employees (Service) Regulations 1979 has been published in the Bangladesh Gazette on 5th February, 1984. The impugned provision has been incorporated as Regulation No. 11(3) which is as follows: “Notwithstanding anything contained in this regulations a Female Cabin Crew having two surviving children shall, upon her becoming pregnant for third child, cease to be an employee of the corporation". It has been stated that the said provision is discriminatory and inconsistent with the Bangladesh Biman Corporation Ordinance, 1977 as well as Constitution. Challenging the said provision the petitioners obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>    Respondent No. 1 contested the Rule by filing an affidavit-in-opposition contending, inter alia, that the petitioners are not persons aggrieved and they do not have the locus standi to seek relief to file the Writ Petition. No action has yet been taken against the petitioners by the respondents  that has infringed the fundamental rights of the petitioners  and/or give rise to any cause for grievance as claimed by the Writ Petition. The amended law as published in the gazette is not discriminatory and inconsistent with any provisions of the Constitution or the same has not been promulgated in violation of the human rights. It has further been stated that the whole country is going to establish the philosophy of two children for a family which is enough and one healthy child whether girl or boy is the best policy. The Rules and Regulations have been provided for the betterment and enhancement of the service of   Biman. The female employees have been enjoying the maternity benefit as provided by the Biman Corporation. The Biman is a service oriented commercial organization and at present a Company. It is a profit making establishment. The nature of job of a cabin crew is such that their physical attractiveness is one of the important factors for their service. Being a service oriented organization Biman has to ensure that it endows with the best possible service to its customers. In such view of the matter the instant provision has been provided in the Service Regulation which is not inconsistent with the Articles 27 and 28 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     Mr. T.H. Khan, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners, submits that the impugned legislation is inconsistent with  the provisions of Article 27 and 28 of the Constitution. He submits that the Ordinance authorised the Board of Directors of the Biman Corporation to make regulation and the Board of Directors made the impugned provision which  is inconsistent with the Ordinance itself. He submits that by the impugned Regulation of the respondents have made discrimination between male cabin crew and female cabin crew  which is barred under Article 28 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Attorney General appearing on behalf of the respondents submits that the Bangladesh Biman is  a  commercial service  oriented  institution and the impugned provision has been enacted considering the physical capability and attractiveness of the female cabin crew after giving birth of third child. He submits that the classification made between female cabin crew and male cabin crew is justified and permissible and cannot be said to be discriminatory within the meaning of Article 27 and 28 of the Constitution in view of the  nature of service render to Biman. He submits that the petitioners, knowing about the terms and conditions of their service as provided in the Regulation, took their job in Bangladesh Biman Corporation so they are bound by the Regulations. He submits that it is not the case of the petitioners that any of the three petitioners became pregnant for the third time so they are not persons aggrieved within the meaning of Article 102 of the Constitution. The instant Writ Petition of the petitioners is not maintainable.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>   We have heard the learned Advocates for the petitioners and  the respondents, perused the Writ Petition, affidavit-in-opposition and other materials on record.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     The petitioners have obtained the present Rule challenging the virus of Regulation No.11(3) of the Bangladesh Biman Corporation Employees (Service) Regulations, 1979 (hereinafter referred as Regulations). The original provision as provided in the Regulation No. 11 was as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“11. Retirement.- An employee other than cabin crew, shall retire from service of the Corporation on the completion of the fifty-seventh years of his age or the age of superannuation as may be changed  for the Government employee.”</em><br/><em>Provided that  the Corporation may extend the service of a medical officer (physician) beyond the date of his retirement for a period not exceeding three years and as such extension shall be in accordance with the provisions of Public Servant (Retirement) Act 1974 (XII of 1974).”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>8.</strong>      In exercise of power conferred by Section 30 of the Bangladesh Biman Corporation Ordinance 1977 the Board of Directors of the  Bangladesh Biman Corporation , with previous  sanction of the  Government, made the impugned amendment in the Bangladesh Biman Corporation Employees (Service) Regulation which runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"11. Retirement-(1) An employee, other than a cabin crew,   shall     retire from service of the corporation on the completion of the fifty seventh years of his age:</em><br/><em>Provided that the Corporation may extend the service of a medical officer (physician) beyond the date of his retirement for a  period not exceeding three years and such extension shall be subject  to such conditions, if any as may be determined by the Corporation. </em><br/><em> (2) The age of retirement of the following cabin crew shall be as  specified below, namely:- </em><br/><em>(i) Fight Steward (Male)                      .....  45 years </em><br/><em>(ii) Flight Stewardess                          ....... 35 " </em><br/><em>(iii) Purser and Chief Purser (Male)    ....  50 "</em><br/><em>(iv)  Purser and Chief Purser ( Female)  ....40 "</em><br/><em>(v) Junior Purser (Male)                          ....45 "</em><br/><em>(vi) Junior Purser (Female)          ..... 35"</em><br/><em>Provided that the retirement age of all cabin crew who are in the employment of the Corporation prior to 31st December, 1980, shall be governed by the terms and conditions under which they were employed. </em><br/><em>(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in these  regulations a female cabin crew having two surviving children shall, upon her becoming pregnant for third child, cease to be an employee of the Corporation." </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>9.</strong>        Earlier challenging the provision of  Regulation No.  11(2) of the said Regulations Writ Petition No.89 of 1993  was filed in the High Court Division   (Dalia Parveen Vs. Bangladesh Biman Corporation reported in 48 DLR page 132). In the said Writ Petition the High Court Division inter alia, observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“Therefore, I do not entertain any doubt that the reduction of age limit from 57 years to 35 years of the petitioner on the strength of amended Regulation 11 does not stand on any sanction of any law rather the same is violative of Article 28 of the Constitution. Article 28 reads-“28(1) The state shall not discriminate against any citizen on the ground of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Thus, reading all the aforesaid provisions of laws referred to earlier I do not find that the contention of Mr. Khondker Amir Hossain that on smartness of the stewardesses  to secure more effective service from them the age limit is so curtailed has any force. On reference to the amended Regulation No. 11 I do not find that the age limit has been curtailed on the ground of decreasing efficiency or smartness on the part of the stewardesses.  Therefore, I am of the opinion that Article 28 has all force in the case of the petitioner and the amended Regulation 11 of Regulations, 1979 has made a sharp discrimination between the persons rendering the similar service in violation of Article 28 to the deprivation of the right of  the petitioner to remain in service till expiry of age of 57 years.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>10.</strong>     It was further observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“Therefore, it seems that although Regulation No. 11 was amended on the strength of Section 30 it is inconsistent with Rule 3 of the Bangladesh Biman Corporation Employees (Pension and Gratuity) Rules, 1988 which has been framed by the Government on the strength of section 29 of the Ordinance.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Therefore, Regulation No. 11 as amended is inconsistent with Rules 3 of the aforesaid Rules, 1988 framed by the Government on the strength of Section 29 of the Ordinance, 1977.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>11.</strong>      From the above quoted decision  it appears to us that this court, in facts, held that the amended provision of Regulation No. 11 is inconsistent with the Rule 3 of the Bangladesh Biman Corporation Employees (Pension and Gratuity) Rules, 1988.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>   By the said amendment Regulation Nos. 11(2) and 11(3) were incorporated but the petitioner of that petition only challenged Regulation No. 11(2) of the Regulations. So no specific order was made in respect of Regulation No. 11(3).<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>   Challenging the judgment and order passed in Writ Petition No. 89 of 1993 the Bangladesh Biman Corporation preferred Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal in the Appellate Division which was ultimately dismissed. <br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>     In the case of Air India Vs. Nergesh Meerza reported in AIR 1981 (SC) 1829 this issue, for the first time, was  placed for  judicial review . In the said case along with pregnancy of a female cabin crew, the question regarding retirement age of the cabin crew  was placed for adjudication. It was observed by the Supreme Court of India:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“A perusal of the Regulations shows that the normal age of retirement of an AH (Air Hostesses)  is 35 years, or on marriage, if it takes place within four years of service , or on first pregnancy whichever occurs  earlier. Leaving the age of retirement for the time being, let us examine the constitutional  validity of the other two conditions, viz., termination  if marriage takes place within four years or on first pregnancy. So far as the question of marriage within four years is concerned, we do not think that the provisions  suffer from any constitutional infirmity. According to the regulations an AH starts her career between the age of 19 to 20 years. Most of the   AHs are not only SSC which is the minimum qualification but possess even  higher qualifications and there are very few who decide to marry immediately after entering the service. Thus, the Regulations permits in AH to marry at the age of 23 if she has joined the service at the age of 19 which is by all standards a very sound and  salutary provision. Apart from improving the health of the employees, it helps a good deal in the promotion and boosting up of our family planning programme. Secondly, if a woman marries near about the age of 20 to 23 years, she becomes fully mature and there is every chance of such a marriage proving a success, all things being equal. Thirdly, it has been rightly pointed out to us by the Corporation that if the bar of marriage within four years of service is removed then the Corporation will have to incur huge, expenditure in recruiting additional AHs either on a  temporary or on ad hoc basis to replace the working AHs if they conceive and any period short of four-years would be too little a time for the Corporation to phase out such an ambitious plan.  </em><br/><em>Coming now to the second limb of the provisions according to which the services of AHs would stand terminated on first pregnancy, we find ourselves in complete  agreement with the argument of Mr. Setalvad that this is a most unreasonable and arbitrary provision which shocks the conscience of the court. The Regulation does not prohibit  marriage after four years and if an AH after having fulfilled the first condition becomes pregnant, there is no reason why pregnancy should stand  in the way of her continuing in service. The Corporations represented to us that pregnancy leads to a number of complications and to medical disabilities which may stand in the efficient discharge of the duties  by the AHs. It was said that even in the early stage of pregnancy some ladies are prone to get sick due to air pressure, nausea in long flights and such other technical factors. This, however, appears to be purely an artificial argument because once a married woman is allowed to continue in service then under the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 and The Maharashtra Maternity Rules, 1965 (these apply to both the Corporations as their Head offices are at  Bombay) she is entitled to certain benefits  including maternity leave. In case , however, the Corporations feel that pregnancy from the very beginning may come in the way of the discharge of the duties by some of the AHs, they could be  given maternity leave for a period of 14 to 16 months and in the meanwhile there could be no difficulty in Management making arrangements on a temporary or ad hoc basis by employing additional AHs. We are also unable to understand the argument of the Corporation that a woman after bearing children becomes weak in physique or in her constitution. There is neither  any legal nor medical authority for this bald proposition. Having taken the AH in service and after having utilized her services for four years, to terminate her service by the  Management  if she becomes pregnant amounts to compelling the poor AH not to have any children and thus interfere with an divert the ordinary course of human nature. It seems to us that the termination of the services of an AH under such circumstances is not only a callous and  cruel act but an open insult to Indian womanhood-the most sacrosanct and cherished institution. We are constrained to observe that such a course of action is extremely detestable and abhorrent to the notions of a civilized society. Apart from being grossly unethical, it smacks of a deep rooted sense of utter selfishness at the cost of all human values. Such a provision, therefore,  is not only manifestly unreasonable and arbitrary but contains the quality of unfairness and exhibits naked despotism and is, therefore, clearly violaltive of Article 14 of the Constitution.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>15.</strong>     After so determination of the Supreme Court of India in Nergesh Meerza case this issue was again placed before the Supreme Court of India in the case of  Air India Cabin Crew Association Vs. Yishawinee Marchant  reported in AIR 2004 (SC) 87. In the said case it was further observed by the Supreme Court of India:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“For air hostesses in the Indian Air lines, Government of India Notification dated 12.4.1980 fixed minimum retirement age as 35 years. It was provided that air hostesses will retire on attaining the age of 35 years or on marriage if it takes place within four years of joining service or on first pregnancy whichever occurs earlier. In line with Indian Air lines. Air India also carried out similar  amendments in their regulations. The male cabin crew  members, known as Assistant Flight Pursers, Flight Pursers and Flight Supervisors were to continue on flight duties until the age of 58 years. Ms. Negesh Meerza together with her fellow Air hostesses filed a Writ Petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the retirement and other conditions of service applicable to Air hostesses on the ground that they were discriminatory under Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution. The petition was transferred to the Supreme Court  and by its decision in the case of Air India v. Nergesh Meerza  (1981 (4) SCC 335) the provision of retirement of Air hostesses on the pregnancy was struck down  as arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. The regulation , which provided for extension of service of the air hostesses beyond 35 years  and up to the age of 45 years  at the sole discretion of Managing Director, was also found to be arbitrary being without any guidelines. This court in Nergesh Meerza’s case, therefore, came to the conclusion that the service regulations insofar as they provided for termination of service  on first pregnancy and extension of service beyond 35 years, only at the discretion of Managing Director, were arbitrary hence unconstitutional under Article 14 of the Constitution.”       </em><br/> <br/><em>It would be necessary to take note that the decision of  Neregesh Meerza’s decision  (supra) rendered  by three Judges Bench  of this Court as according to the appellants  some of the legal premises are already covered and certain legal questions are already settled by the aforesaid judgment, which are binding on the High Court and also on this Bench of two Judges.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    The learned Attorney General submits that equality before law means that among the equals the law should be equal and should be equally administered and that the likes should be treated alike. In case of female cabin crew of Biman slight discrimination has been made considering the nature of service and physical attractiveness  and capability of performance  of service after giving birth of third child which is permissible. In  the case  of Pathomma Vs. State of Kerala reported in AIR 1978 S.C. page 771 India Supreme Court held that it is for the State to make  reasonable classification which must fulfil two conditions:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(1) The  classification must be found on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes person or things that are grouped together from other left out of the group; and<br/>(2)  The differentia  must have a reasonable nexus to the object sought  to be achieved  by the statute. In the case of Mackenzia Vs. Andreg D Casta reported in AIR 1987 S.C. 1281 Indian Supreme Court deprecated  the discrimination between the male stenographers and the confidential  lady  stenographers only on the ground of sex where there was a deference  between the work which the confidential lady stenographers  were doing and the work of their male counterpart.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>17.</strong>      It is well-established that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of a statute burden in upon the person who attacks  it to show that there has been a clear transgression of constitutional principles. This court  can go into the issue as to whether a particular legislation is within  legislative competence of the legislature on the provision of the constitution or not. It is duty of the legislature to legislate such law which are  not oppressive,  unjust and one sided  and discriminatory. The  discrimination between person similarly situated and possibility of such discrimination makes a legislation ultravires in view of Article 27 and 28 of the Constitution.  Here the impugned provision has made discrimination between the male and female  cabin crews and in between the female cabin crews as well. This discrimination has been made between female cabin crews  having two surviving children and female cabin crews having two  surviving children and thereafter upon her becoming pregnant for third child.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>     “In English Law ‘but for sex’ test has been developed to mean that no less favourable treatment  is to be given to women on gender based criteria which would favour the opposite sex and women will not be deliberately selected for less favourable treatment because of their sex It is on this ‘but for sex’ test.”<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>     In the case of Rabia Bashri Irene and another Vs. Bangladesh Biman Corporation represented by Managing Director and another reported in 52 DLR (HCD)  308, it has been observed  by the High Court Division that:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“Gender discrimination –The SRO published  in the Bangladesh Gazette on February 5th 1984 which provides that the retirement of Flight Steward (male) 45 years and Flight Stewardess  (female) 35 years are violative of Articles 28 of the Constitution.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>20.</strong>       Biman Bangladesh Airlines is a travel industry pleasing  appearance, manners and physical fitness are required for members of  the crew  of both sexes. For the services on board of an Aircraft are expected  to be smart, alert and agile. <br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>       But provision of stand termination due to pregnancy for third child is a practice derogatory to women. In case Nergish Meerza's case it was  further observed that what is said about the fair sex by the Judges fully applies to a pregnant woman because pregnancy also is not a disability but one of the natural consequences of marriage and is an immutable characteristic of married life. Any distinction, therefore, made on the ground of pregnancy cannot but be held to extremely arbitrary. In Sharran A.    Frontieroy Vs.  Elliot. L. Richardson, (1973) 36 L. Ed. 2nd 583 U.S. Supreme Court made following observation:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"Moreover, since sex, like race and national origin, is an immutable characteristic determined solely by the accident of birth, the imposition of special disabilities upon the members of a particular sex because of their sex would seem to violate the basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility. In Mary Aun Turher Vs. Department of Employment Security (1975) 46 L ed 2nd 181 the U.S. Supreme Court  observed- "It cannot be doubted that a substantial member of women are fully capable of working well into their last  trimester of pregnancy and of resuming employment shortly after  child birth. We conclude that the Utah unemployment compensation   statute's incorporation of a conclusive presumption of incapacity during so long a period before and after child birth is constitutionally invalid under the principles of the La  Fleur Case". In the case of City of  Los Angeles, Department of Water and Pover Vs. Marle Manhart, (1978) 55 L Ed.2nd 657  U.S. Supreme Court further observed:  "It is now well recognized that employment decisions cannot be predicated on mere "stereotyped" impression about the  characteristics of males or females. Myths and purely habitual  assumptions about a woman's  inability to perform certain kinds of work are no longer acceptable reason for refusing to employ qualified individuals, or for paying then less....... .The question, therefore, is whether the existence or non-existence of "discrimination"  is to be determined by comparison of class characteristics or individual characteristics.  A "stereotyped"  answer to that question may not be the same as the answer  that the language and purpose of the statute command". Considering authorities as quoted above in Nargesh Meerza's case it was further  held that by making pregnancy a bar to continuance in service of an Air Hostess the Corporation seems to have made an individualized approach to a woman's physical capacity to continue her employment even after pregnancies which undoubtedly is a most unreasonable approach. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>22.</strong>      In view of the discussion as made above, our considered opinion is that the pregnancy disability, exclusion amounted to down grade in the women whole in the labour force. By making pregnancy bar third time to be the continue in service of female cabin crew, the Biman Bangladesh Airlines seems to have made a clear  discrimination in betwen the female cabin crews having two surviving children and cabin crews having two children and her becoming pregnant for third time which is undoubtedly arbitrary unreasonable and utter selfishness at the cause of all human values.  Bhagwati J in the case of Maneka Gaudhi Vs. Union of India ( AIR 1978 S.C. 597)  said, "Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits --------. It must be  "right and just and fair" and not  arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive",  Indian Supreme Court in the case of Hai Chand Sardar Vs. Mizo District Council reported AIR 1967 (S.C.)  page 829 highlighted that where a  Regulation does not contain any principles  or standard for the exercise of the executive power, it was a bad regulation.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>      Our considered view is that in the case of Dalia Parveen the High Court Division consciously observed that the amended Regulations 11 is inconsistent with the parent law which clearly indicated that the provisions of Regulations No. 11(2) and 11(3) that is, amended provisions of Regulations 11 are inconsistent with the Bangladesh Biman Corporation Ordinance and Article 28 of the Constitution.  In the Appellate Division  in Leave Petition filed against the judgment of Dalia Parveen's Case referred to above it was argued on behalf of the Bangladesh Biman Corporation that the High Court Division wrongly  held that the amendment of Regulation 11 is violative of Article 28 of the Constitution in that there is a discrimination in the retirement age of Cabin Crews on the ground of sex. Their Lordships of the Appellate Division dismissed the submissions by disallowing the Leave Petition thereby affirmed the decision of the High Court Division. Where law is discriminatory it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative the Article 27 and 28 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>      Considering the submissions of the learned Advocates of both the parties and the connecting laws and interpretations above, we are of the view that the provision of Regulation No. 11(3) of Bangladesh Biman Corporation Employees (Service) Regulations, 1979 is discriminatory and inconsistent with the provisions of Article 28 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>         The learned Attorney General submits that the petitioners are not the persons aggrieved so they have no locus standi to institute the instant Writ Petition. It appears that the petitioners being an employees of Bangladesh Biman Corporation have challenged  their amended Service Regulation. So, it is difficult for us to except the submission of the learned Attorney General that they have got no locus standi to challenge their service Regulations. The expression aggrieved person as used in Article 102 of the Constitution has not been defined anywhere. From the judicial pronouncement it appears to us that the attitude of the courts on the question of locus-standi does not appear to be uniform. They vary from country to country, court to court and case to case.  In the case of S.P. Gupta Vs. Union of India reported in AIR 1982 SC 149 it has been observed by the Supreme Court of India that:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“A person who has a genuine grievance on account of an action which affects him prejudicially is ordinarily considered to be eligible to move the court.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>26.</strong>        In the case of Regina Vs. Liverpool Corporation (1972) 2 QB 299, Lord Denning M.R. held that –</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The expression ‘person aggrieved’ would include any person whole interests may be prejudicially affected by what taking place.</em><br/><em>It does not include a mere busy body who is interfering in things which do not concern him, but it includes any person who has a genuine grievance because something has been done or may be done which affects him.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>27.</strong>     The impugned Regulation may affect the petitioners any time. We are of the view that the petitioners have locus-standi to challenge the legality and propriety of the amended provisions of law, that is, the instant Writ Petition at the instance of the petitioners is maintainable.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>     Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, we find substance in this Rule.<br/><br/>            In the result, the Rule is made absolute. The impugned Regulation, that is, Regulation 11(3) of the Bangladesh Biman Corporation Employees (Service) Regulations, 1979 is declared to have been made without lawful authority and the same is inconsistent of the Article 28 of the Constitution. The said provision is hereby declared void  abinitio.<br/> <br/>            <strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
