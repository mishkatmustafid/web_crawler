Abu Zafor Siddique, J:</strong></u><br/><br/>          On an application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure a rule was issued calling upon the opposite party to show cause as to why the judgment and order dated 17.03.2008 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge 2<sup>nd</sup> Court and Special Tribunal No.6, Kushtia, convicting the accused petitioner under section 19A of the Arms Act, 1878 and sentencing him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10(ten) years in Special Tribunal Case No.104 of 2006, arising out of G.R. Case No.177 of 2006 corresponding to Doulatpur Police Station Case No.11, dated 11.08.2006 shall not be quashed.<br/><br/>The prosecution case at the trial, in short, is that one Md. Abdul Hai Sarker, Inspector of Police and Officer-in-charge of Daulatpur Police Station, Kushtia, lodge first information with Daulatpur Upazilla, Kushtia, alleging, inter alia, that on 10.08.2006 while the informant along with other officers and forces went out from Daulatpur Police Station, at that time he got secret information that accused Alamin @ Alam was staying in the house of his father-in-law namely Jamil Uddin in the village Tekala with arms. The informant party went to the house of Jamil Uddin with chowkider Sariful and dafader Nazrul Islam and the informant party caught red-handed the accused Alamin alis Alam with the arms from the dwelling hut of the said Jamil Uddin. Thereafter the informant prepared the seizure list in presence of witnesses and obtained the signature on the seizure list, hence the FIR.<br/><br/>The case was investigated by the investigating officer who visited the place of occurrence and prepared a sketch map of the place of occurrence along with a index. He examined the witnesses and recorded their statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. After investigation the investigating officer found prima-facie case against the sole accused and submitted a charge sheet being No.141 dated 17.08.2006 under section 19A and 19(f) of the Arms Act, 1878, and the case record was transmitted to the Additional Session Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> court and Special Tribunal-6, Kushtia (in-charge), for trial where it was registered as Special Tribunal Case No. 104 of 2006. Charge was framed against the sole accused and it was read over to him. The accused petitioner pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried in accordance with law.<br/><br/>During trial the prosecution examined as many as 12 witnesses out of 16 cited witnesses in the charge sheet, but the defence examined none. The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses is that the case was false and no arms were recovered from the possession of the petitioner. The petitioner has been entangled with this case out of influence of enemies of the petitioner.<br/><br/>Considering the facts, circumstances and deposition of prosecution witnesses and hearing the parties the trial court convicted and sentenced the accused in the manner as already stated above.<br/><br/>Since the convict could not prefer appeal in time he filed an application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure and obtained the instant rule.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Saiful Alam, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the convict-petitioner, has submitted that the accused petitioner is innocent and he has been implicated in the instant case falsely. He has next submitted that the instant case is absolutely a case of no legal evidence and the prosecution miserably failed to prove the guilt of the convict-petitioner, as such, he should be acquitted. He has further submitted that the convict-petitioner was not also properly examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and this being the mandatory provision of law the accused appellant has been seriously prejudiced and as such the convict-petitioner should be acquitted of the charge leveled against him and the impugned judgment and order of conviction is liable to be quashed. In support of his contention the learned Advocate of the petitioner has referred the case of Shahid Mia and another -Vs.- State and another, reported in 60 DLR (HCD),-371.<br/><br/>In reply, Mr. Md. Zahurul Haque, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the state, has supported the impugned judgment passed by the learned Judge of the Tribunal and has submitted the police personnel have categorically stated that the arms and ammunition were recovered from the absolute control and possession of the petitioner. He has further submitted the evidence of the police personnel are unimpeachable, so, there is no harm to convict a person relying upon the evidence of the police personnel, and as such there is no reason to quash the judgment and order of conviction.<br/><br/>We have heard the submissions of both sides, perused the application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence, First Information Report, charge-sheet, evidence of prosecution witnesses, examination of the convict petitioner under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and other materials and relevant documents available in the record.<br/><br/>From the records it appears that the prosecution examined as many as 12 witnesses amongst them P.W.-1. Md. Foysal Alam A.S.I. of Police stated in his deposition that on 11.08.2006 he along with other officers and staffs went to the house of Jamil Uddin the father-in-law of the petitioner and caught the petitioner red-handed and recovered arms and ammunitions in presence of the witnesses. Thereafter, a seizure list was prepared in the place of occurrence. In his cross-examination he denied all the suggestions given by the defence.<br/><br/>P.W.-2, Md. Nazrul Islam is a seizure list witness, he stated in his deposition that- the convict-petitioner Alamin was caught red-handed with a pistol and magzine. Police prepared a seizure list and obtained his signature on the seizure list. He proved his signature as Exbt.-1/2.<br/><br/>P.W.-3, Naharul Islam is the local witness, he stated in his deposition that police showed him 1(one) round of bullet. In cross-examination he stated that he knew nothing about the recovery of alleged arms.<br/><br/>P.W.-4, Md. Idriss Ali was tendered by the prosecution and the defence declined to cross-examination him.<br/><br/>P.W.-5, Shahadat Hossain is the local witness. He deposed that police showed him an arms. He knew nothing more than that.<br/><br/>P.W.-6, Zahurul Alam is a member of raiding party and cordoned of the place of occurrence. They caught red handed the accused with a pistol and 4 round bullets. In his cross-examination he denied all the suggestions given by the defence.<br/><br/>P.W.-7, Sariful Islam is a local chowkider stated in his deposition that police caught red-handed the accused with arms and ammunition and prepared seizure list and took his signature. He proved his signature on the seizure list as Exbt,-1/3. In his cross-examination he denied all the suggestions given by the defence.<br/><br/>P.W.-8, Md. Kamal is a member of raiding party. He was tendered by the prosecution and the defence declined to cross-examination him.<br/><br/>P.W.-9, Abdus Salam is a member of raiding party. He was supported the prosecution case. In his cross-examination he dined all the suggestions given by the defence.<br/><br/>P.W.-10, Delowar Hossain is another member of raiding party. He was tendered by the prosecution and the defence declined to cross-examination him.<br/><br/>P.W.11, Abdul Hai Sarder Inspector of Police and Officer-in-charge of the Daulatpur Police Station, he is informant of the case. He supported the FIR story. He identified the FIR and the arms in the court. He Exbt. seizure list as Exbt.-1, and his signature Exbt.-1(4), FIR Exbt. 2 and signature Exbt.2/1, 2/2. One pistol material Exbt-I, Magzine material Exbt. II and Bullate material Exbt.III. In his cross-examination he denied all the suggestions given by the defence.<br/><br/>P.W.-12, Police Inspector Abdul Karim the investigating officer of the Case. He visited the place of occurrence prepared sketch map with index, examined the witnesses and recoded the statement under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; and having prima face case he submitted charge sheet against the accused, under section 19A and (f) of the Arms Act 1878.<br/><br/>These are all evidences adduced by the prosecution.<br/><br/>In this case having gone through the examination of the petitioner under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on 04.01.2007 by the trial court.<br/><br/>In the statement of section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure it is stated-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“পরীক্ষা আমার সম্মুখে ও শ্রুতি গোচরে গৃহীত হইল এবং ইহাতে অভিযুক্ত ব্যক্তির উক্তি সম্পূর্ণ ও যথাযথ রুপে লিখিত হইয়াছে।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the above statement it appears that while examining the accused-petitioner under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the tribunal did not put the incriminating evidence against the accused person for enabling him to explain any circumstance, which has prejudiced him. Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is based on the principle involved in the maxim <strong><em>audi alteram partem-</em></strong> that is no one should be condemned unheard. It is the utmost duty of the court to give an opportunity to an accused to defend himself. The real object of section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is inviting the attention of the accused person to the points in the evidence which are against him for which he may be convicted, so, he is given a chance to offer his explanation as to those. But from the plain reading of examining the accused under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that this petitioner was not given proper opportunity to offer his explanation as to the guilt for which the accused petitioner has been prejudiced.<br/><br/>We have carefully considered the provision of law it is clear that the object of this section is to ensure that the accused have examined as required under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, this is mandatory provision of law. But the trial court absolutely failed to do it. It has already observed that while examining the convict-petitioner under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the trial court failed to put the incriminating evidence against the convict petitioner for the purpose of enabling them to explain any circumstance and thereby the petitioner has been prejudiced. Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the accused should be examined for the purpose of enabling him to explain any circumstance appearing in the evidence against him.<br/> <br/>At the same time on careful scrutiny of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and other materials on record it appears that the prosecution witnesses are all most police personnel and corroborated each other but the public witnesses have stated contradictory statement. So the learned Judge has not applied his judicial mind in passing the order of conviction and sentence, which is an abuse of the process of the law, which deserves our interference.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, we find merit in this rule.<br/> <br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 17.03.2008 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court and Special Tribunal No.6, Kushtia, in Special Tribunal Case No.104 of 2006, arising out of G.R.Case No.177 of 2006 corresponding to Doulatpur Police Station Case No.11, dated 11.08.2006 is here by quashed.<br/> <br/>Let the petitioner be set at liberty at once, if not wanted in connection with any other case.<br/> <br/>Send down the Lower Court Records and communicate the order at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

While in service in the College the petitioner was temporarily suspended by (he Governing Body of the College' on 01.07.1999 at the instance of some local vested quarter out of sheer conspiracy. Ultimately, he was dismissed from service on 08.11.1999 under rule 17(Ga) of the Non-Government Institution Administration and Management Rules. The petitioner was, therefore, constrained to institute Other Class Suit no.8O of 1999 before the court of Subordinate Judge, (now, the Joint District Judge), Dinajpur who subsequently passed an order of temporary injunction restraining Governing Body of the College from giving effeet to the order of dismissal and to allow him to serve till disposal of the suit. .Subsequently, the Governing Body of the College by adopting a resolution dated 17.07.2004 had withdrawn the order of suspension dated 01.07.1999 against the petitioner. Consequ-ently, he also withdrawn the said suit by way of mutual settlement. pursuant to the decision so adopted by the Governing Body of the College in its meeting, dated 17.07.2004 and also in consideration of the withdrawal of Other (class Suit No. 80 of 1999 by the petitioner on 27.07.2004, the College authority by its letter hearing Memo no. 72(1)/04 dated 31.07.2004 re-instated the petitioner in service asking him to join within 7 (seven) days from the date of receipt of  the  said order. The Petitioner accordingly joined in his respective post as Assistant Professor, (Physics) in the College on 01.O8.2004 which was duly accepted by the respondent no.7 on the same day.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>         It has been contended that  the  petitioner  as  an  Assistant Professor of the Department of Physics of the College was entitled to get half of the balance amount of the government portion of salary and accordingly an amount of Tk.l ,89,272.24 only was payable to him on his re-instatement in .service, It has been asserted that though the said amount was withdrawn by respondent no.7 through bill but instead of paying to him the said amount was kept in the College account bearing A/C No.544 at Rupali Bank, Birol Branch, and that the respondent no.7 did not yet pay his arrear dues despite repeated requests so made to that effect. The anomaly was duly detected during, the course of audit by respondent no.4. Pursuant thereto the respondent no.3 vide Memo no.

Ashfaqul Islam, J:</strong></u><br/> <br/>        At the instance of the petitioner Osarunnessa, this Rule Nisi was issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the Order no.17 dated 25.01.2011 passed by the learned Judge, Artha Rin Adalat No.1, Dhaka in Artha Execution Case No. 195 of 2007 issuing warrant of arrest (Annexure-B in violation of Section 34 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 and order 21 Rule 37 and section 56 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall not be passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>   The background leading to the Rule, in short, is that the husband of the petitioner approached the respondent Bank for House Building Loan and on 24.12.1990 Tk. 75,000/- sanctioned for staff house building loan and on 28.10.1993 Tk. 20,0000/- for motorcycle loan. The petitioner is the guarantor of the loan. Petitioner gradually paid loan for Tk. 22,674/- but due to various reasons failed to adjust dues of the Bank. Respondent No. 3 Manager Janata Bank, Local Office, Dulkusha, Dhaka on 29.4.2003 filed a suit before the learned Artha Rin Adalat No.1, Dhaka, for recovery of money inclusive interest amounting to Tk. 14,05,888/- and the said suit was registered as Artha Rin Suit No. 423 of 2004.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>   The suit was decreed exparte in the year 2004 followed by Artha Execution Case No.87 of 2005. In the Execution Case property was sold in auction on 07.03.2007. The Bank then filed second Execution Case No. 195 of   2007 (Annexure-A). In that Second Execution case on 25.01.2011 the Bank filed an application praying for issuing warrant of arrest of the petitioner for realizing all dues and the Court issued warrant of arrest as prayed on 25.01.2011 (Annexure-B and B1).<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>   The petitioner was arrested on 05.06.2008 vide order No. 8 dated 3.4.2008 and thereafter on 27.11.2008  the Court released the petitioner since she served out more than six months  civil imprisonment (Annexure-D). Thereafter by the impugned order No. 17 dated 25.01.2011 again warrant of arrest has been issued against the petitioner against which the petitioner moved this Division and obtained the present Rule and stay.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>   Mr. Md. Harunur Rashid, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of  the petitioner after placing the petition, impugned order  and other Annexures with the petition mainly submits that the impugned order  is exfacie illegal and not sustainable under law since the petitioner had already been arrested pursuance to Artha Rin Adalat’s order which she served out and hence as per section 34(12) of the Ain she cannot be put to civil imprisonment again.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>   The Rule is not opposed by the respon-dents. However, Mr. S.M. Moniruzzaman, the learned counsel candidly submits that the law is very much clear on this issue and the petitioner on that score cannot be put to civil imprisonment for the second time.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>   Heard the learned counsels for both sides and considered their submissions.  Section 34(12) states as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"> </div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">“এই আইনের অধীনে কোন ডিক্রী বা আদেশ বাস্তবায়নের উদ্দেশ্যে পরিচালিত জারী মামলায়, জারী মামলার সংখ্যা একাধিক হইলেও কোন একজন দায়িককে গ্রেফতার করিয়া পরিপূর্ণ মেয়াদের জন্য একবার দেওয়ানী কারাগারে আটক রাখা হইলে, তাহাকে পুনর্বার গ্রেফতার করা ও দেওয়ানী কারাগারে আটক করা যাইবে না।"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>8.</strong>   Admittedly the petitioner was arrested on 5.6.2008 vide Order No.8 dated 30.4.2008 and was released after serving more than six months on 27.11.2008 (Annexure-D). Therefore, as per section 34(12) the petitioner cannot be put to civil imprisonment for the second time and for that reason we hold that the order impugned against is exfacie illegal and without any lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>   With these observations the Rule is made absolute. The order No. 17 dated 25.11.2011 passed by the Artha Rin Adalat No.1 in Artha Execution Case No. 195 of 2007 issuing warrant of arrest (Annexure-B(i) is declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect and hereby set aside.<br/> <br/>      Communicate this order at once. <br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Enayetur Rahim, J:</strong></u><br/> <br/>          Plaintiff has preferred this appeal being aggrieved by the judgment and decree dated 06.11.2007 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No.19 of 2007 rejecting the plaint of the suit under the provision of order VII Rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure, read with section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 2001.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>     Plaintiff appellant instituted Title Suit No. 19 of 2007 in the 3<sup>rd</sup> Court of Joint District Judge, Dhaka impleading the present respondents as defendants for a declaration that the deeds of transfer described in the schedule-B to the plaint are void illegal, inoperative and not binding upon the plaintiff and for recovery of khas possession of the land described in the schedule to the plaint after evicting the defendants No. 2-83.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>     Plaintiff’s case, in short, is that the plaintiff Quaderabad Housing Estate Ltd. is a Private Limited Company duly registered at the office of Register Joint Stock Companies and the plaintiff company was framed to carry on business on real state, building, apartment and other business. The properties descried in schedule ‘A’ to the plaint were purchased by late Abdul Qader Chowdhury, Abdul Momin Chowdhury, Abdul Barek Chowdhury and Abdul Barek and sons limited on different dates and years from the rightful owners and possessors. After such purchase they mutated their respective names in the office of the Revenue Authority, paid rent and got rent receipts. Subsequently amicable agreement was made between them and according to the said amicable agreement Abdul Momin Chowdhury got the landed properties described in schedule-‘A’ to the plaint.  Abdul Momin Chowdhury also purchased some properties, which form part of the schedule-‘A’ property. He also amalgamated his own purchased property with that of the inherited properties and for better and more beneficial use of the properties he desired to form a Real Estate Business and Alhaj Abdul Momin Chowdhury was made the Managing Director of the Company. The power of issuing allotment of plot, receipt of consideration, execution, registrations of document absolutely vest with the Managing Director Mr. Abdul Momin Chowdhury. The Articles of Association of the company do not empower any other Director to transfer the properties of the Real Estate. Mr. G. K. Moinudddin Chowdhury, the defendant No.1 is the eldest son of Alhaj Abdul Momin Chowdhury. He was not promoter director or a share holder of the Real Estate Company. The defendant No.1 was adopted a Director of the Real Estate Company on 28.08.1996 on allotment of 1000 shares. As per internal management of all the companies, business of the family was amicably arranged. The defendant No.1 was given responsibility of Qaderabad Housing Estate to look after the affairs of the company to manage, maintain, and prevent encroacher/ trespassers. He was also assigned to procure buyers of the plots, negotiate sale and he would introduce the buyers with the Managing Director and duly inform the buyers terms and conditions. The buyers have to pay the price as per terms of the memorandum and Articles of Association to the Managing Director and the Managing Director used to receive consideration, execute and register due conveyance of sale. Many plots have sold in the aforesaid manner. The defendant No.1 was not and is not empowered to transfer or execute any document of transfer. The Managing Director is the only person to execute the deed of transfer. The defendant No.1 in violation of the terms and conditions of the Memorandum of Article of Association transferred the plots numbering 54 secretly to different persons. He in collusion with buyers executed the deeds of transfer without the knowledge of the Managing Director. He received the consideration money, executed and registered deeds of sale in favour of the defendants No.2–55(b) illegally using the name of the company. The transfer, execution of the documents of the transfer and registration are all illegal, voids inoperative and collusive. The company is not bound by the illegal and unauthorized acts of defendant No.1. The defendants No.2-55(b) have not acquired any right, title and interest by virtue of those illegally created documents. The plaintiff company does not recognize them as purchasers/ allottees of the plots. When this forgery was detected the Managing Director, other Directors of the company became bewildered. In order to save the reputation of the plaintiff company and also to resolve the misunderstanding the dispute was referred to the Arbitration of 2(two) gentlemen namely Mr. Abdul Gafur Mazumder and Mr. Wahidar Rahman by a written reference dated 06.02.2006. The Arbitrators were to give the award within a period of 04.05.2006. The Arbitrators committed gross misconduct and gave a biased award and legalized the illegal acts of the defendant No.1 and the plaintiff company became prejudice. Against the said award the Managing Director and other Directors of the company have filed Arbitration Miscellaneous Case No. 764 of 2006 before the District Judge, Dhaka for setting aside the award dated 04.05.2006. The defendant No.1 during the period of arbitration proceedings and from the date of award till date also transferred 54 plots to the defendants No. 2-55(b). The plaintiff company was not a party to the arbitration agreement, the share holders of the plaintiff company and other companies referred the dispute for arbitration. The defendant No.1 has not honoured the award. He has been selling the plots of the company beyond the alleged award. He has not taken any step to transfer his shares of the plaintiff company and other companies to his father Alhaj Abul Momin Chowdhury. He has been flouting the terms of the award. The defendant No.1 has sold the properties by executing and registering sale deeds. The registered sale deeds can be cancelled only by a decree of the competent civil court. The arbitration proceeding ended with the award. The Managing Director of the Company on various dates cautioned the members of the Public not to purchase property/ plots from defendant No.1 by publishing public notices in the daily news papers. He also wrote letters to the Sub-Registrar, Mohammadpur, Chairman RAJUK, Assistant Commissioner (Land), Chairman House Building Finance Corporation and requested not to deal with the forged and collusive transfer made by the defendant No.1 in collusion with other defendants. The schedule land measuring total area 214.373 (Katha) as transferred by the defendant No.1 to the other defendants by the deeds as described in schedule-‘B’ to the plaint are void, illegal inoperative and not binding on the plaintiff company and liable to be cancelled. A cloud has been cast upon the title of the plaintiff company by the creation of schedule-‘B’ sale deeds.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     The defendant-respondent No.1 after entering into the suit filed an application under Order VII Rule 11 (d) of the Code of Civil Procedure read with section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 for rejection of the plaint of the suit stating, inter alia, that on mere reading and going through the plaint it becomes clear that the plaintiff company categorically admitted in paragraph-9 of the plaint that the Managing Director and other Directors of the company to resolve misunderstanding amongst themself referred the disputes to the Arbitration of 2 Arbitrator namely Mr. Abdul Gafur Majumder and Mr. Wahidur Rahman by a written reference dated 06.02.2006 (Memorandum of understanding) and the said Arbitrators gave an award on 04.05.2006. It also admitted that on behalf of the present plaintiff company the Managing Director and other Directors of the company have already filed Arbitration Miscellaneous Case No.764 of 2006 in the Court of District Judge, Dhaka for setting aside the award and said Miscellaneous Case is still pending. It was further stated in the said application that from the averments made in the plaint the plaintiff admitted that the Managing Director and the others Directors of the plaintiff company were the parties to the Arbitration agreement dated 06.02.2006 as well as the award dated 04.05.2006 and the defendant No.1 was the other party of the same Arbitration agreement and award. The subject matter and or determining issues of the said Arbitration agreement and award as well as the subject matter and or determining issues of the present suit are same and that the present suit arising out of the same disputes, which have already been amicably settled and resolved by the family settlement acknowledged by both the parties through execution of a Memorandum of Understanding and or Arbitration agreement on 06.02.2006, followed by an award dated 04.05.2006 regarding the same schedule of deeds of transfer and plots and other related maters as it is most pertinently evident from the copy of the award filed by the plaintiff company through firisty. The instant suit is neither maintainable nor entertainable in its present from and nature and the jurisdiction of the same is barred under section 7 of the Arbitration Act (Salishi Ain) 2001 and hence the plaint of the present suit is liable to be rejected. It was also stated in the application that a fruitless litigation can not allowed to be continued for ends of justice and thus the plaint of the instant suit was liable to be rejected under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     The plaintiffs filed written objection against the said application denying the material statement made on it stating, inter alia, that the defendant No.1 obtained an illegal and biased award. He was barred from selling any of the property. But he did not comply with the terms of the award. He has also transferred 21 plots after filing of the suit. The plaintiff has clear cause of action for cancellation of documents and since the defendant No.1 committed fraud and for that the cause of action has been clearly stated in paragraph 12 of the plaint. The disputes referred to the Arbitrators by the majority directors against the defendant No.1 the plaintiff Housing Estate Ltd. was not a party in the arbitration agreement. Moreover, the alleged arbitration agreement concluded by an illegally obtained award dated 04.05.2006. The present suit has been filed on 05.10.2006. The proceeding was not pending at the time of institution of the suit. The Arbitration Miscellaneous Case No.764 of 2006 has been filed by Mr. Abdul Momin Chowdhury and other Directors for setting aside the award and this Miscellaneous Case is not an appeal and not continuation of the disputes and as such the suit is maintainable and the application under order VII rule 11(d) for rejection of the plaint of the suit is liable to be rejected.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>     The learned Joint District Judge after hearing the said application by the order dated 06.11.2007 allowed the application under order VII rule 11(d) read with section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 and rejected the plaint of the suit holding that in view of the provision of section 7 of Arbitration Act, 2001 the suit is barred.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     Against the said judgment and decree the plaintiff has preferred this appeal before this Court.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     Mr. Abdul Quayum, learned Advocate of the plaintiff appellant submits that the learned Joint District Judge erred in law in rejecting the plaint of the suit inasmuch as he failed to consider and appreciate the purport and scope of order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. He further submits that before filing written statement the rejection of the plaint on the ground of maintainability of the suit is not permissible in law. In this connection he refers the case of Ismat Zerin Khan –Vs-The World Bank and others, reported in 11 MLR (AD) Page-58. Mr. Quayum admitting the provision of section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 submits that the subject matter of disputes which referred to the arbitration can not be the subject matter or issues in the present suit and same is barred under the said law. But he extraneously argues that the subject matter of dispute or issue with regard to the properties and plots of schedule-‘B’ to the plaint, which were not referred to the arbitration, in respect of those properties and plots and deeds of transfer the present suit is very much maintainable and the learned Joint District Judge in rejecting the plaint of the suit as a whole failed to consider and appreciate this legal aspect of the present suit. The learned Advocate drew our attention to schedule-‘B’ to the plaint, where description of the sale deeds and plot members, which sought to be cancelled have been mentioned and submits that from the said schedule it is evident that 77 sale deeds in respect of 77 plots have been mentioned but the arbitration took place with regard to 56 plots only and as such the sale deeds and plots which were not the subject matter or issue in arbitration proceeding, the suit is vary much maintainable in respect of those sale deeds and plots. In support of his contention he referred the case of Syed Masud Ali and others –Vs- Md. Asmatullah &amp; others reported in 32 DLR (AD) page 39, where their lordships held that the plaintiffs suit to the extend of 2<sup>nd</sup> schedule land was dismissed as not maintainable but they may proceed with regard to the 1<sup>st</sup> schedule land if the plaintiff is so desired to proceed. He also refers the case of Balwant Singh–Vs- The State Bank of India and others, reported in AIR 1976, Punjab &amp; Haryana, (Full Bench) Page-316 and the case of Mst. Chandani –Vs- Rajasthan State and others, reported in AIR 1962, Rajasthan Page-36. In those cases it was held that plaint disclosed cause of action in respect of particular claim against some of the defendants, the plaint can not be rejected in its entirety.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     On the other hand Mr. Shah Md. Khasruzzaman, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the defendant respondent No.1 submits that the application under order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure is very much maintainable before filing the written statement and he submits that at any stage of the suit the application under the said order is entertainable and maintainable. It is at all not necessary to wait for filing of the written statement and in support of his said contention he refers the case of Jobeda Khatun –Vs- Momtaz Begum and others reported in 45 DLR (AD) Page-31 and the case of P.R. Sukeshwala and another –Vs- Dr. Devadatta V.S. Kerkar and another reported in AIR 1995, Bombay, Page 227. Mr. Zaman further submits that the learned Joint District Judge considering the provision of section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 rightly rejected the plaint of the suit holding that the suit is barred under the provision of section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 and it is now settled principle of law that where the parties to a dispute have pursued arbitration proceeding resulting in an award, none of them can after the award is made, get rid of it by ignoring the same. He referring the paragraph-9 of the plaint argues that the plaintiff admitted that to resolve misunderstanding they referred the dispute to the arbitration of 2(two) gentlemen by a written reference dated 06.02.2006 and award has been passed on the selfsame disputes and thus the suit or the same issue/ dispute is not maintainable and the Trial Court did not commit any error or illegality in rejecting the plaint. He also submits that the suit can not be proceeded for part claim/claims by split up the plaint as argued by the learned Advocate of the appellant. Mr. Khasruzzaman, to substantiate his argument referred the case of Fisheries Research Institute and others –Vs- Mr. Bhuyain Ltd and others reported in 4 BLC, Page-126, the case of Gutte -Vs- Punno reported in AIR 1963, Madhya Prodash Page-96 and the case of Bangladesh Power Development Board and others –Vs- Md. Asaduzzaman Sikder reported in 8 MLR (AD), Page-241. In those cases it has been held that the subject matter of the arbitration proceeding, where ultimately an award was given, on the same cause of action, the Civil Suit is barred under the Arbitration Act and the plaint was rejected under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  <br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>   Mr.A.Z.M. Mohiuddin, the learned Advocate appearing for the respondent Nos. 2, 8, 10, 13, 17, 43 and 50, though the said respondents did not file any application under order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure before the trial Court, adopting the legal submission of the learned Advocate of the respondent No.1 submits that Mr. Alhaj Abdul Momin Chowdhury, the Managing Director of the plaintiff company is the father of the defendant No.1 and the father and sons with an ill motive for illegal gain and to harass the purchaser defendants collusively instituted the present suit. He also refers the decisions cited by Mr. Zaman.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>   Heard the learned Advocate of the respective parties, perused the impugned judgment and decree, the relevant documents before us.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>   In view of the submission of the learned Advocate of the respective parties moot question before us is that whether the plaint of the present suit be rejected as a whole or the suit can be proceeded splitting up the plaint against some of the defendants, against whom the cause of action exist.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>   The facts of the case of Syed Masud Ali and other versus Md. Asmatullah and others reported in 32 DLR (AD) Page-39, as referred by the learned Advocate of the plaintiff appellant, was that a Title Suit was filed in the Court of Munsif challenging the enrolment of Waqf in view of Sections 50 and 102 of the Waqf Ordinance, 1962. In the said suit the plaintiff divided the suit properties under two schedules and had claimed ownership and possession over both of them. With regard to the first schedule plaintiff sought a declaration of his title but with regard to the 2<sup>nd</sup> schedule he prayed not only title to the land but for nullification of the enrolment made by the Administrator of Waqfs. The defendant entered appearance in the said suit and before filing written statement raised the question of competency of the suit and the trial Court and High Court Division in revision concurrently held against the defendant that is refused to reject the plaint. Appellate Division in appeal considered whether the said suit regarding 2<sup>nd</sup> schedule land was competent. Appellate Division allowed the said appeal in part and set aside the decision of the High Court Division and trial Court and held to the effect:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“The plaintiff’s suit to the extent of 2<sup>nd</sup> schedule land is dismissed as not maintainable but the suit may proceed with regard to the first schedule land of the plaint if the plaintiff so desire to proceed.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>14.</strong>   In the case of <em>Khandkar Abul Hussain –Vs- Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh</em> and others reported in 54 DLR page 467, a Division Bench of the High Court Division has held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“When two distinct causes founded on distinct and separate allegations are brought before the Court and if one cause is clearly barred under any provision of law the court is authorized under the law and can legitimately try other cause for granting relief which is not related to the barring provision”. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>15.</strong>   In the said case it has also been held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>”The Subordinate Judge could have split up the suit for trying the second cause which is for damages for defamatory statement and for implicating the plaintiff in a false case.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>16.</strong>   In the case of <em>Mst. Chandani -Vs- Rajasthan State and other</em>, reported in AIR 1962 Rajasthan, Page-86 it has been held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“The plaint shall be rejected where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law; that rule, however, would be attracted into its full application where the suit as a whole would be so barred, and different considerations may reasonably arise where such a suit happens to be barred against some of the defendants but may still be good, against the others.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>17.</strong>   In view of the above proposition of law we have no hesitation to hold that a suit can be proceeded splitting up the plaint against those defendants, against whom the cause of action exist.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>   In the instant case the plaintiff in the plaint admitted that with regard to 56 deeds of transfer and plots of schedule-‘B’ arbitration took place on the basis of a mutual agreement; an award has already been passed on those disputes/issues and challenging the said award Arbitration Miscellaneous Case No.764 of 2006 filed by the plaintiff before the learned District Judge, Dhaka is still pending. This admission of the plaintiff from a plain reading of the plaint appears to us that the suit with regard to 56 deeds of transfer and plots of schedule-‘B’ is barred by the provision of section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 2001. But 21 deeds out of 77 deeds of transfer of schedule-‘B’ to the plaint and the plots relating to said 21 sale deeds were not referred to the Arbitration tribunal as per the Arbitration agreement dated 06.02.2006 and the award dated 04.05.2006 has got no manner of relation/ connection with the said 21 deeds of transfer and as such the suit is very much maintainable with regard to those 21 deeds of transfer and plots. Thus the learned Joint District Judge erred in law in rejecting the plaint of the suit as a whole.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>   The submission of Mr. Quayum relying the decision reported in 11 MLR (AD) Page-58 that the application under order 7 rule 11 is not maintainable before filing the written statement is not applicable in the instant case. In the case of <em>Abdul Jalil and other -Vs- Islami Bank and Bangladesh</em> reported in 20 BLD (AD) Page-278, it has been held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“A plaint may be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code merely on a plain reading of the plaint but in exceptional circumstances the Court may invoke its inherent jurisdiction and can throw the plaint out in limini. The plea of implied bar should be decided on evidence unless the fact disclosed in the plaint clearly indicate that the suit is not maintainable. In exceptional cases recourse may be taken even under section 151 of the Code.”       </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>20.</strong>   From the said judgment it also appears to us that in the suit the defendant did not file any written statement and on behalf of the defendant the argument was made that written statement had not been filed by the defendant, despite that the Appellate Division has taken the above view. Further it appears from the case of Syed Masud Ali and other -Vs- Md. Asmatullah and others reported in 32 DLR(AD), Page-39, which was cited by Mr. Quayum, that in the said case before filing the written statement defendant raised the question of competency of the suit. As such the submission of Mr. Quayum that before filing the written statement the application under order 7 rules 11 (d) is not maintainable is not tenable in law.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>   Having discussed as above we find merit in the appeal. The appeal is allowed-in-part. The judgment and decree dated 06.11.2007 is hereby modified to the effect that the suit will proceed with regard to 21 sale deeds and plots out of 77 sale deeds and plots of schedule-‘B’ to the plaint, which were not referred to the Arbitration tribunal as per agreement dated 06.02.2006 and not the subject matter and or issue of the award dated 04.05.2006. The plaintiff is at liberty to amend the plaint for getting appropriate relief from civil Court. However, there is no order as to costs.  <br/> <br/>        Send down the lower Court records at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Subsequently by amending the agreement the arbitration clause was incorporated.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Thereafter a new committee of the second party was elected and in the Extra Ordinary General Meeting and annual general meeting was held and power of attorney was retified with certain amendment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Thereafter 1<sup>st</sup> party under took the foundation work. The further case of the 1<sup>st</sup> party is that they have invested 6.5 crores Taka and there was no investment of the 2<sup>nd</sup> party and has constructed building upto 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor and has paid Tk. 1 crore and 10 lacs as profit of allotment of shop and spaces to the second party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">As per the amended agreement the 2<sup>nd</sup> party was promise bound to got the 4<sup>th</sup> Floor to 6<sup>th</sup> Floor constructed by the 1<sup>st</sup> party but in violation of the contract they made advertisement for construction of space/floor from 4<sup>th</sup> Floor to 9<sup>th</sup> Floor and in such circumstances the 1<sup>st</sup> party issued a legal notice and also requested by writing letter to the 2<sup>nd</sup> party for issuance of work order for construction 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Floor as per the agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">That in the above circumstances the 1<sup>st</sup> party filed the application for appointment of arbitrator.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>4.  </strong>   During pendency of the said Arbitration Miscellaneous case the 1<sup>st</sup> party filed an application under order 39 rule 1 and 2 of the code of the civil procedure and section 7 (A), (E) of the Arbitration Act 2001 with a prayer for temporary injunction. The application was filed on 08.9.2010.<br/> <br/><strong>5. </strong>    That against the said application filled by the 1<sup>st</sup> party the 2<sup>nd</sup> party appeared before the Court and contested the said application for injunction by filing written objection and denied all the material allegation made in the said application.<br/> <br/><strong>6. </strong>    The learned District Judge after hearing both the parties was pleased to allow the application under order 39 rule 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure and 7 (A) (E) of the Arbitration Act and passed order of temporary injunction on 09.1.2011 on allowing the said application for temporary injunction restraining the rule petitioner i.e. the 2<sup>nd</sup> party of the arbitration case from making any construction   on the land in question  as mentioned in the schedule of the application.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     Against the aforesaid order dated 09.1.2011 the present petitioner as appellant filed F.M.A. No 63 of 2011 before this Court and after filing of the appeal the appellants as petitioner filed an application for stay and the High Court Division issued a Civil Rule on 21.3.2011 and also passed an ad-interim order of stay. Subsequently the respondent filed a Civil Miscellaneous  petition before the Appellate Division and the Appellant Division by the order dated 29.5.2011 directed a Division Bench of this Court to hear the matter by 12.6.2011 and allowed the order of status-quo granted by the learned Judge in Chamber to continue till the date i. e. 12.5.2011.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     When the appeal was taken up for hearing by a Davison Bench of this Court it came to discussion and light that in view of the provision of section 48 of the  Arbitration  Act  the appeal is not maintainable accordingly the appellant did not  pressed the appeal and by the order dated 22.6.2011 the appeal and the rule were dismissed for non prosecution. Thereafter the appellants of the said Miscellaneous appeal i.e. the 2<sup>nd</sup> party of the arbitration proceeding as petitioner filed a civil revisional application as per provision of section 115(1) of the Code of  Civil Procedure against the Judgment and order dated 9.1.2011 passed by the learned District Judge, Dhaka in Arbitration Miscellaneous case No. 477 of 2010 granting injunction restraining the rule petitioner i.e 2<sup>nd</sup> party making any construction on the land in question. At the time of the issuance of the rule the rule issuing Court was pleased to issue an ad-interim order in the like manner “pending hearing of the rule, the petitioner are permitted to complete the construction of 3<sup>rd</sup> floor at their own risk” .<br/> <br/><strong>9. </strong>    Against the aforesaid order dated 7.4.2011 permitting the 2<sup>nd</sup> party rule petitioner to complete the construction of the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor at their own risk the  opposite party i.e. the 1<sup>st</sup> party of the arbitration proceeding filed provisional civil petition for Leave to Appeal No. 568 of 2011 in the Appellate Division and the honorable Judge in Chamber  was pleased to disposed of the said  provisional civil petition for Leave to Appeal No. 568 of 2011 finding that “In view of the submission of the learned counsel Respondent No. 1 is directed not to construct beyond 3<sup>rd</sup> floor till disposal of the revisonal application” vide order date 25.7.2011.<br/> <br/><strong>10. </strong>  Meanwhile, the opposite party filled an application for vacating the order dated 19.7.2011 passed by this Court in the civil revision permitting the petitioner to complete the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor at their own risk at the time of issuance of the rule.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>   When this application for vacating the order of stay came up for hearing before this Court on 19.7.2011 this Court after hearing both the parties and on the  verbally undertaking given by Mr. Aminuddin the learned advocate for the petitioner that he has already instructed from his client not to proceed with construction of 3<sup>rd</sup> floor till disposal of the rule under that circumstance since both the parties  agreed on this point to get the civil revision heard and disposed of and the mater was fixed for hearing and on conclusion of  hearing the Court delivers this judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>   At the very beginning of hearing Mr. Mahabubey Alam<strong>,</strong> the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the rule petitioner has submitted that the learned District Judge while acting as presiding Judge in arbitration proceeding has no power to issue an order of injunction.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>   Mr. Mahabubay Alam referring to section 2(b) of the Arbitration Act, simultaneously he has submitted that section 7 (A) of the Arbitration Act contained  ouster of jurisdiction of Civil Code.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>   As such accordingly Mr. Mahabubey Alam the learned advocate for the petitioner submitted that the order of injunction passed by the learned District Judge, Dhaka in Arbitration Miscellaneous case No. 477 of 2010 is ifsofacto an illegal order which can not be sustainable in law, accordingly, he prays that the impugned order is liable to be set aside and  the rule be made  absolute.<br/> <br/><strong>15. </strong>  In support of his argument Mr. Mahabubay Alam has referred to a case of our Appellate Division being the case of <strong>A. K. M. Ruhul Amin Vs District Judge</strong> and <strong> Appellate Election Tribunal</strong>, <strong>Bhola and others Abul Kalam Azad Vs. Nur Hossain</strong> <strong>Howlader and others, Abdul Bari Vs. Shahjahan Chowdhury and others, Mohammad Hossain Ali Sarker Vs. Mohammad Mobarak Ali and others</strong> <strong>reported in 38 DLR(AD) 172.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>16. </strong>  The case referred to by Mr. Mahabubay Alam although related to matter in respect of Election Tribunal and Election Appellate Tribunal which is not exactly in agreement with the facts of the case before us. Even than the principle that has been laid down in the aforesaid case being almost similar in nature with the present case as because the District Judge was Election Appellate Tribunal Judge and here the District Judge has been given power as per provision of section 12 of the Arbitration Act wherein our Appellate Division found that the District Judge acting as an election appellate tribunal is not a person designate but a Court subordinate to the High Court Division’’. In this view of the matter although  Mr. A. F<strong>. </strong>Hassan Ariff the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite parties has very strenuously submitted that no appeal or revision lies against an order passed by the District Judge in a arbitration case as per provision of Arbitration Act so the District Judge here is not amenable to the High Court Division. Mr. Hassan Ariff further submits that arbitration act is a special law for adjudication of the dispute between the parties who agreed for holding of arbitration as such it shall prevail over general law. And Mr. Ariff further   submits that the Arbitration  Act of 2001 is substantive as well as a procedural law. Where right of appeal has been specifically provided within the frame work of arbitration act and no provision of revision has been created in the arbitration act so no Civil Revision will lie in the High Court Division. <br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>   He next  submits that since the statute has  given no right to the litigant to file civil revision in the High Court Division and the arbitration act does not provide such jurisdiction to the High Court Division to exercise such power under arbitration act. The present Civil revisional application under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure is not at all maintainable and the same is liable to be  dismissed and the rule be discharged accordingly.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>   In support of his submission Mr. A. F. Hassan Ariff has referred to a decision of our Appellate Division being the  case of Managing Director , Rupali Bank Limited and others Vs. Tafazal Hossain and others reported  in 44 DLR(AD) 260   wherein it has been found by our lordships in the Appellate Division “ <strong><em>Relation between general law and special law availability of remedy – If any legal remedy is ordinarily available under both general law and special law, the remedy prescribed by the special law must be sought in exclusion of the one available under the general law”.  </em></strong><br/> <br/><strong>19. </strong>  The  most pertinent question which has been agitated and  opposed by the petitioner and opposite parties is regarding maintainability of the civil revision in the High Court Division against the order of ad- interim  temporary injunction  passed by the learned  District Judge in arbitration Miscellaneous case; this point is main issue to be decided here.<br/> <br/><strong>20.  </strong> On perusal of the papers and documents filed by both the parties in as much as after hearing both the parties, the rule petition and the counter affidavit filed by the opposite party and since it is agreed point that the learned District Judge issued order of temporary injunction in pursuance of Provision of section  7(A) kha and  Ummo of the Arbitration Act of 2001 which has been amended in 2004. Thus I find that the learned District Judge has rightly and legally passed the order being enabling him by section 7 (A) of the Arbitration Act.  Regarding the maintainability of the civil revision the point that has been submitted by Mr. Hassan Ariff that no civil revision or appeal shall lie against an order passed by the District Judge, I am unable to accept the contention of Mr.  Ariff.  In my view since there is provision of appeal as per provision of section 48 of the Arbitration Act although in respect  of  very specific limited ground even than there is provision of appeal and although the arbitration act does not specifically provided for revision against an order passed by the District Judge in arbitration Miscellaneous case even then in view of the decision that has been referred to by Mr. Mahabubey Alam the learned advocate for the petitioner being  the case reported in 38 DLR (AD) 172 I hold the same view that as a District Judge while he is acting in pursuance of the statute enabling him by section 12 of the arbitration act as well as section 7(A) of the Arbitration Act. He is performing duty as a Judge of the civil jurisdiction and he is not a person designate but a Court subordinate to the High Court Division. Under that circumstance I find that this civil revisional application is maintainable.<br/> <br/><strong>21. </strong>  Now I am to find regarding the merit and veracity of the order of injunction passed by the learned District Judge. I have gone through the impugned order which I find to be a well discussed and well evaluated order referring to the facts and circumstance and merit  of the case referred to by both 1<sup>st</sup> party and opposed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> party and  the learned District Judge after perusal of all the papers and documents he has passed the impugned order rightly after evaluating the papers and documents submitted by the parties and on certain facts and circumstance which are admitted by both the parties Under that circumstances the learned District Judge being  empowered by section 7(A) of the Arbitration Act on very meticulous discussion of facts and circumstances and materials available from the papers and documents submitted by the both the parties was pleased to  pass an order of temporary injunction till disposal of the arbitration miscellaneous case. At the same time the learned District Judge directed both the parties to take appropriate step for quick disposal of the arbitration miscellaneous case.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>   So I do not find any cogent reason to interfere with such well evaluated and well discussed order of injunction passed by the learned District Judge. Thus I find no merit in the rule.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>   In the result, the rule is discharged without any order as to costs. The impugned order of temporary injunction passed by the learned District Judge on 09.1.2011 in Arbitration Miscellaneous case No  477 of 2010 is hereby maintained.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>   The learned District Judge is directed to hear and disposed of   the Arbitration Miscellaneous case No. 477 of 2010 within 6(six) months from date of receipt of the copy of this judgment.<br/> <br/>Send a copy of this judgment to the Court of the learned District Judge as expeditiously as possible.  <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Since the government failed to produce the relevant file and in the affidavit the State did not state any fact with regard to the same it is not possible for the Court to determine how and on which date and what manner the file was initiated by the Government, and whether the relevant file was at all placed before the President; even if, the file was placed before the President then what materials were posted for his consideration to give pardon and remit the sentence of the petitioner. Because of non production of the said file the Government have deprived this Court to answer properly all those questions. In view of the cited proposition of law, though those are not binding on us; but it has got persuasive value, the contention of the learned advocate of the petitioner that this Court has no power to examine or touch the order passed by the our President exercising the power under Article 49 of the Constitution cannot be accepted. The Court cannot fold its hand in despair and declare ‘judicial hands off’. So long as the question arises whether an authority under the Constitution has acted with the limit of its power or exceeded it or the power has been exercised without application of mind and mechanically or the order in question is a malafide one or the order has been passed on some extraneous consideration or how far the order is fair and reasonable it can certainly be examined and decided by this Court. Government have got no authority and jurisdiction to exercise the power under Article 49 of the Constitution but it can exercise power under Section 401(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure to suspend or remit sentences of a convict in suitable cases. Government in exercising power under Article 49 of the Constitution exceeded its jurisdiction. </strong><strong>... (12, 14, 25 and 26)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 49</strong><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 401 (1), 498 and 561A</strong><br/><strong>From the order dated 12.04.1993 it is evident that in the said order nothing has been mentioned with regard to the Criminal appeal. In view of the above one feature is very clear that though the petitioner was granted bail on 28.08.1991 in the said appeal till disposal of the same but after disposal of the Criminal Appeal on 03.09.1992 his bail ipso facto stood cancelled and the High Court Division without allowing him any time, directed to surrender to the trial Court. In view of the above, the petitioner ought to have surrender-red to the trial Court without making any further delay but he did not surrender and as such he became a fugitive and the order of pardon was made on 12.04.1993 when he was fugitive. The petitioner without surrendering to Court concerned had pursued for remitting his sentence before the President and the Government and ultimately managed to obtain the said order. After disposal of the criminal appeal either the petitioner or his wife should have informed the authority concerned about the judgment and the direction of the High Court Division as the matter of pardon was under process. It is also an admitted fact that when the petitioner moved the application under Sections 561A read with 498 section of the Code of Criminal Procedure he was fugitive from justice and as such this Court is unable to give any relief to a fugitive to quashing or setting aside the orders dated 30.06.1997 and 31.08.1997 respectively passed by the learned Assistant Sessions Judge, Cox’s Bazar. It is well settled that all public power including constitutional power shall never be exercisable arbitrarily or malafide and ordinarily, guideline for fair and equal execution are guarantors of the valid play of power and when the mode of power of exercising a valid power is improper or unreasonable, there is an abuse of power. On perusal of the judgments of the trial Court and the appellate Court hardly, there is any scope to say that the trial was held against the petitioner to victimize him with political ill motive.</strong><br/><br/><strong>When the petitioner moved the application before this Court in its revisional jurisdiction he was a fugitive. It is true that the petitioner in the cause title of the application mentioned section 498 with section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Mentioning the section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by itself did not change his status of fugitive. Section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not at all applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case; rather it was an attempt of the petitioner to mislead the Court. The petitioner is directed to surrender before the court below within 6(six) weeks from the date of receipt of the judgment and order of this Court.  … (30, 31, 39, 40, 47, 58, and 62)</strong><br/> <br/><em>Maru Ram vs. Union of India, AIR 1980 (SC), 2147, Kehar Singh -Vs- Union of India AIR 1989(SC), 653 , Swaran Singh–Vs- State of U.P. and others (1998) SCC,75 , Shatapal and another –Vs- The State of Hariana, AIR 2000(SC), -1702, Chand –Vs- Crown, PLD 1956 (FC), 43, Gul Hassan –Vs- The State, 21 DLR (SC), 109, Anti-Corruption Commission –Vs- Mahmud Hossain and others, reported in 61 DLR (AD) page-17, Anti-Corruption Commission </em><em>–Vs- ATM Nazimullah Chowdhury</em><em> and others, reported in 62 DLR (AD), page-25, Anti-Corruption Commission –Vs- Dr. HBM Iqbal Alamgir and others reported in 15 BLC(AD) page-45 ref. </em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Mr. Md.

Enayetur Rahim, J:</strong></u><br/><br/>At the instance of the petitioner on an application under Section 561A read with section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the instant Rule was issued on the following terms;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Let a Rule be issued calling upon the opposite party to show cause as to why the First Court of Assistant Sessions Judge, Cox’s Bazar shall not be directed to give effect to the order of remission of sentence of the petitioner in ST No.25 of 1987 as passed by the President being Memo No.143-P-45/92(Kara-2) dated 12.04.1993 as communi-cated to the petitioner by Memo No.3-16/92 dated 08.06.1993 of the opposite-party and why the warrant of arrest and warrant of commitment as issued on 30.06.1997 against the petitioner shall not be recalled by setting aside the orders dated 30.06.1997 and 31.08.1997 passed in ST No.25 of 1987 and/ or  to as such other or further order or orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure the petitioner stated that the petitioner along with others (in total 15 persons were put on trial before the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of Assistant Sessions Judge Cox’s Bazar, (that was performing the function of Additional Sessions Judge at the relevant time) in Sessions Trial No.25 of 1987 arising out of Tekhnaf Police Station Case No.8(7)/81.<br/><br/>On conclusion of the trial the petitioner along with two others were found guilty under Sections 304/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10(ten) years with a fine of Tk.10,000/-(ten thousand), in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for further period of 2(two) years.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the said judgment and order of conviction and sentence the petitioner along with two others preferred Criminal Appeal No.611 of 1989 before the High Court Division. While the said appeal was pending the petitioner was enlarged on bail by an order dated 28.08.1991. Eventually, a Division Bench of the High Court Division after hearing the appeal by its judgment and order dated 22<sup>nd</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> September,1992 dismissed the same and affirmed the conviction under Sections 304/34 of the Penal Code; but modified the sentence from 10(ten) years to 8(eight) years.<br/><br/>The President of Bangladesh by order being No.143-P-45/92(Kara-2) dated 12.04.1993 was pleased to remit the sentence of the petitioner along with two others as passed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of Assistant Sessions Judge, Cox’s Bazar in Sessions Trial No.25 of 1987 on 08.06.1989 in exercising the power under Article 49 of the Constitution and section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The said order was communicated, among others, to the Deputy Commissioner Cox’s Bazar who then communicated the same to the Solicitor, Ministry of law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs by his Memo No.3-16/92-435/1(3)/J:M: dated 08.06.1993; pursuant to the said order the other two convict who were in jail were released on receipt of the said order of the President. However, neither the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs nor the Deputy Commissioner, Cox’s Bazar ever communi-cated the said order of remission of sentence of the petitioner to the trial Court. Due to non-communication of the aforesaid order of remission of sentence of the petitioner by the President the learned Assistant Sessions Judge by its order dated 30.06.1997 had issued warrant of arrest and conviction warrant against the petitioner holding that he (petitioner) did not surrender after the disposal of the appeal to serve out the remaining sentence as held by the High Court Division. On coming to know about the said issuance of the warrant of arrest and warrant of commitment the petitioner on 18.08.1997 filed an application in the Court of Assistant Sessions Judge through his engaged Advocate for recalling the warrant of arrest and warrant of commitment in view of the order of remission of the sentence passed by the President submitting a copy of the same. The learned Assistant Sessions Judge, after hearing the said application and the respective parties by the order dated 31.08.1997 rejected the application holding that the Court rightly and lawfully issued the warrant of arrest as well as the conviction warrant as the petitioner did not surrender before the trial court complying the direction of the High Court Division and after issuance of the warrant of arrest the petitioner became fugitive from justice and after his surrender there might be a scope to give effect of the order of the Ministry of Home affairs as claimed by the petitioner.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the said orders and to give effect the order of remission of sentence the petitioner obtained the present Rule.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Tamizuddin, the learned Advocate appearing on  behalf of the petitioner with Mr. S.M. Zafar Sadeque and Mr. Mohammad Ali, the learned Advocates, submits that since the President remitted the sentence of the accused petitioner in exercise the power as conferred in Article 49 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh the learned Assistant Sessions Judge is liable under the law to give effect to the order of the President and in not doing so he committed serious illegality and exceeded its jurisdiction. Mr. Tamijuddin further submits that there is no legal justification for the petitioner to surrender before the Court in order to give effect the order of remission of sentence as observed by the learned Assistant Sessions Judge as he is not required to do so in view of the President’s order and as such the impugned orders are liable to be quashed and this Court in exercising power under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure may interfere with the impugned orders and to give effect to the order of the President dated 12.04.1993 remitting the sentence of the petitioner.<br/><br/>Mr. M. H. Sarder the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing with Mr. Gazi Md. Mamunur Rashid and Mr. Md. Asaduzz-aman, the learned Assistant Attorneys General, submits that the memo dated 12.04.1993 by which the sentence of the petitioner has been remitted was issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs and it was the decision of the President as well as the Government.<br/><br/>It is to be noted here that when the matter was taken up for hearing, on perusal of the Photostat copy of the order dated 12.04.1993, annexed with the application, some doubt was created in our mind about the same and to remove our said doubt we directed the Deputy Attorney General and the Assistant Attorney General present in the Court to produce the relevant file with regard to the remission given to the petitioner by the President, in exercising Power under Article 49 of the Constitution as well as under Section 401(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Eventually, the learned Deputy Attorney General frankly expressed their inability in presenting the relevant file as the concerned Ministry failed to supply the file to the office of the Attorney General. In such facts and circumstances we directed the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs to produce the file and at one stage we had compelled to issue Suo-Motu Rule for contempt against the Secretary, Ministry of Home affairs. In that event, the learned Deputy Attorney General by filing an affidavit informed the Court that the relevant file had been misplaced. The concerned officers of the Ministry have been trying to trace out the said file. However, a photostat copy of the order of remission to the petitioner attested by the Assistant Inspector General of Prison and  authenticated by the Deputy Secretary Ministry of Home Affairs has been annexed with the affidavit.<br/><br/>The order of remission of the sentence of the petitioner dated 12.04.1993, annexure-A, to the application under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure runs as follows;    <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><u>আদেশ</u><br/>   যেহেতু সাজাপ্রাপ্ত আসামী যথাক্রমে (১) সরোয়ার কামাল (২) মীর কাশেম ও (৩) দরবেশ আলী সর্ব সাং- নাইক্যংখালী, টেকনাফ থানা মামলা নং ৮(৭)৮১ ধারা ৩০৪/৩৪/১০৯/৩২৩/৩২৪ বিপিসি স্পেশাল ট্রাইবুনাল মামলা নং ২৫/৮৭ ধারা ৩০৪/৩৪ বিপিসিতে বিজ্ঞ বিচারাদালত সরোয়ার কামাল, মীর কাশেম ও দরবেশ আলীকে দোষী সাব্যস্ত করিয়া ৮-৬-৮৯ইং তারিখে প্রত্যেককে ১০ (দশ) বছর করিয়া কারাদন্ড এবং ১০,০০০/-(দশ হাজার) টাকা জরিমানা অনাদায়ে দুই বছরের কারাদন্ডে দন্ডিত করেন;<br/>২। যেহেতু সরকার উল্লেখিত আসামী যথাক্ররমে সারোয়ার কামাল, মীর কাশেম ও দরবেশ আলীর সাজা মওকুফের সিদ্ধান্ত গ্রহন করিয়াছে;<br/>৩। এখন যেহেতু বাংলাদেশ সংবিধানের ৪৯ নং অনুচ্ছেদ এবং ফৌজদারী কার্যবিধির ৪০১(১) ধারা ক্ষমতাবলে সরকার উল্লেখিত মামলার আসামী সারোয়ার কামাল, মীর কাশেম ও দরবেশ আলীর সাজা মওকুফ করিয়াছেন।<br/>৪। এই আদেশ অনতিবিলম্বে কর্য্যকারী হইবে।</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;">রাষ্ট্রপতির আদেশক্রমে<br/>(দিলরুবা)<br/>সিনিয়র সহকারী সচিব</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">নং ১৪৩/১(৬)/পি-৪৫/৯২ (কারা-২)   তারিখঃ <br/>অনুলিপি অবগতি ও প্রয়োজনীয় ব্যবস্থা গ্রহণের জন্য প্রেরন করা হইলঃ-</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">সচিব, রাষ্ট্রপতির সচিবালয়, বংগভবন, ঢাকা</li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">সচিব, প্রধান মন্ত্রীর কার্য্যলয়, পুরাতন সংসদ ভবন, তেজগাঁও, ঢাকা</li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">মহা-পুলিশ পরিদর্শক, পুলিশ সদর দপ্তর, ঢাকা</li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">মহা- কারা পরিদর্শক, কারা অধিদপ্তর, ঢাকা</li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">জেলা প্রশাসক, কক্মবাজার এই প্রসংগে তাঁহার স্মারক নং ৩-১৬/৯৯-৯০৯৫/জেএম তারিখ ১৫-১২-৯১ইং এর বরাতে</li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">উপ-মহাকারা পরিদর্শক, চট্রগ্রাম বিভাগ, কেন্দ্রীয়া কারাগার, কুমিল্লা</li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;">(দিলরুবা)<br/>সিনিয়র সহকারী সচিব</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears from the above order that the case number has been mentioned as Special Tribunal Case No.25 of 1987. But fact remains that the petitioner was convicted in Special Trial Case No.25 of 1987. In the above order of remission of sentence the case number has not been mentioned correctly, which clearly shows non application of mind of the authority concerned. Further in the said memo it has been written as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/>২। যেহেতু <u>সরকার</u> উল্লেখিত আসামী যথাক্রমে সারোয়ার কামাল, মীর কাশেম ও দরবেশ আলীর সাজা মওকুফের সিদ্ধান্ত গ্রহন করিয়াছেন;<br/>৩। এখন <u>যেহেতু বাংলাদেশ সংবিধানের ৪৯ নং অনুচ্ছেদ</u> এবং ফৌজদারী কার্যবিধির ৪০১(১) ধারা ক্ষমতাবলে <u>সরকার</u> উল্লেখিত মামলার আসামী ১। সরোয়ার কামাল, ২। মীর কাশেম ও দরবেশ আলীর সাজা মওকুফ করিয়াছেন;<br/>(the under line has given by us)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The above language of the order also has raised a pertinent question in our mind how the Government had exercised the power under Article 49 of the Constitution, the power which must be exercised by the President as per the Rules of Business. Since the Government failed to produce the relevant file and in the affidavit the State (opposite party) did not state any fact with regard to the same it is not possible for us to determine how and on which date and what manner the file was initiated by the Government, and whether the relevant file was at all placed before the President; even if, the file was placed before the President then what materials were posted for his consideration to give pardon and remit the sentence of the petitioner. Because of non production of the said file the Government have deprived us to answer properly all those questions. This dark part of the process of remission of sentence is unlikely to see the light. But we are of the view that Government has got no authority and jurisdiction to exercise the power under Article 49 of the Constitution. Government can exercise power under Section 401(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure to suspend or remit sentences of a convict. In the present Case the Government in exercising power under Article 49 of the Constitution, as it evident from the order dated 12.04.1993, exceeded its jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Similar question has been settled in the case of Maru Ram Vs. Union of India, reported in AIR 1980 (SC), page 2147. In the said Case it has been held;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“It is apparent that superficially viewed, the two powers, one constitu-teonal and the other statutory, are co-extensive. But two things may be similar but not the same. That is precisely the difference. We cannot agree that the power which is the creature of the Code can be equated with a high prerogative vested by the Constitution in the highest function-aries of the Union and the State. The source is different, the sub-stance is different, the strength is different, although the stream may be flowing along the same bed.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Mr. Tamizuddin, the learned Advocate for the petitioner has tried to convince us that the Court may only inquire whether fraud has been committed in procuring the pardon or remission of sentence but in other case the Court has got no power to interfere or examine or touch the order passed by the President under Article 49 of the Constitution.<br/><br/>So far our knowledge goes neither the Appellate Division nor the High Court Division of our Supreme Court has decided the issue whether the court particularly the High Court Division in its appropriate jurisdiction has any power or authority to examine the exercise of power under Article 49 of the constitution by the President. But the Supreme Court of India in several cases has decided the power and jurisdiction of the Court in the above issue.<br/><br/>It is pertinent to mention here that Article 72 and Article 161 of the Constitution of India are similar to Article 49 of our Constitution. Article 72 and 161 of the Constitution of India have conferred power upon the President of India and the Governor of the States respectively to give pardon or remit sentence of a convict.<br/><br/>In the Case of Maru Ram –Vs- Union of Indian, reported in AIR(SC)1980, page-2147, it has also been held that;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Considerations for exercise of power under Articles 72/ 161 may be myriad and their occasions protean and are left to the appropriate Government, but no consideration nor occasion can be wholly irrelevant, irrational, discriminatory or malafide. Only in these rare cases will Court examine the exercise.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Kehar Singh -Vs- Union of India reported in AIR 1989(SC), page-653, it has been held that;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Upon the consideration to which we had adverted, it appears to us clear that the question as to the area of President’s power under Art. 72 falls squarely within the judicial domain and can be examined by the Court.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Swaran Singh–Vs- State of U.P. and others, reported in (1998) SCC, page-75, it has been held that;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In view of the said aforesaid settled legal proposition, we can not accept the rigid contention of the learned counsel of the third respondent that this Court has no power to touch the order passed by the Governor under Article 161 of the Constitution. If such power was exercised arbitrary, malafide or in absolute disregard of the finer canons of the constitutionalism, the by product order can not get the approval of law and in such cases, the judicial hand must be stretched to it.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the above case Shri Doodh Nath, an MLA of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, was convicted of the offence of murder and sentenced to imprisonment for life. But within a period of less than two years, he succeeded to come out from prison as the Governor of Uttar Pradesh granted remission of the remaining long period of his life sentence. That order of the Governor was challenged before the High Court of Allahabad by the son of the deceased, Swaran Singh. A Division Bench of High Court dismissed the petition on the premise that a decision of the Governor under Article 161 of the Constitution of India is not justiciable. Against the said order of the High Court, Swaran Shing moved before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of India ultimately quashed the order of remission of sentence of convict Shri Doodh Nath, an MLA of Uttar Pradesh, on the ground that Governor was not posted with material facts and thereby, he was apparently deprived of the opportunity to exercise the powers in a fair and just manner. And the Supreme Court of India held that; “the order now impugned fringes on arbitrariness.”<br/>          And the Court also quashed the said order of remission of sentence. <br/><br/>In the case of Shatapal and another –Vs- The State of Hariana, reported in AIR 2000(SC), page-1702, similar view has been reiterated. In the said case also the order granting pardon was set aside on the ground that Governor had not applied his mind to the material on record and has mechanically passed the order just to allow the prisoner to overcome the conviction and sentence passed by the Court.<br/><br/>In the above case the order of the Governor of State of Haryana granting pardon remitting the unexpired portion of the sentence on prisoner Shri Siriyans Kumar Jain, who belonged to ‘Bharotio Janata party’, in exercise of power conferred by Article 161 of the Constitution of India was challenged by one of family members of deceased Krishan Kumar who was murdered during a local Government election held in the year 1987. The trial court convicted Siriyans Kumar Jain and four others under Section 302 read with 149/120B of Indian Penal Code and sentenced each of them for imprisonment for life. On appeal the High court of Panjab and Haryana maintained the conviction of 2(two) persons but acquitted Siriyans Kumar Jain and two others from the charges brought against them. Against the said order of acquittal the State of Haryana preferred appeal before the Supreme Court of India. Ultimately, the Supreme Court of India set aside the order of the acquittal of accused Siriyans Kumar Jain and another and they were directed by the Supreme Court to surrender to custody in order to serve out the remaining part of their sentence. Convict Siriyans Kumar Jain instead of surrendering to serve the sentence, as directed by the Court, filed an application before the Governor invoking the provision of Article 161 of the Constitution of India. The concerned authority after taking opinion of the Legal Remembrance placed the file before the Chief Minister, who agreed with the opinion of the legal Remembrance that this is fit Case where discretion given under Article 161 of the Constitution be exercised and relief prayed for be granted. The Governor finally granted pardon on the basis of the advice of the Chief Minister.<br/><br/>In deciding the merit of the above appeal the Supreme Court of India categorically held that;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“There cannot be any dispute with the proposition of law that the power of granting pardon under Article 161 is very wide and do not contain any limitation as to the time on which and the occasion on which and the circumstances in which the said powers could be exercised. But the said power being a constitutional power conferred upon the Governor by the Constitution is amenable to judicial review on certain limited grounds. The Court, therefore, would be justified in interfering with an order passed by the Governor in exercise of power under Article 161 of the Constitution if the Governor is found to have exercised the power himself without being advised by the Government or if the Governor tran-sgresses the jurisdiction in exercising the same or it is established that the Governor has passed the order without application of mind or the order in question is a malafide one or the Governor has passed the order on some extraneous consideration.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the above mentioned Case the Supreme Court of India observed that certain vital facts concerning the prisoner were not placed before the Governor particularly the fact that the Supreme Court of India by its Judgment and order dated 10.12.1998 set aside the order of acquittal directing Seriyans Kumar Jain to surrender to custody in order to serve out the remaining part of his sentence and he did not comply with the said Court’s order and on 25.10.1999 when the order was passed he was not confined in jail and he only surrendered before the Court of Sessions, Hissar on 02.02.1999 and also was released on the very same day in view of the Governor order dated 25.01.1999. In the said Case the ultimate conclusion of the Court is as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In the aforesaid premises, we have no hesitation to come to the conclu-sion that the order in question has been vitiated and the Governor has not been advised properly with all the materials and, therefore, we have no other option than to quash the said order dated 05.01.1999.”  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In view of the above proposition of law of this Sub continent, though those are not binding on us; but it has got persuasive value, we are unable to accept the submission of the learned advocate of the petitioner that this Court has no power to examine or touch the order passed by the our President exercising the power under Article 49 of the Constitution.<br/><br/>Thus, we are of the view that the Court can not fold its hand in despair and declare ‘judicial hands off’. So long as the question arises whether an authority under the Constitution has acted with the limit of its power or exceeded it or the power has been exercised without application of mind and mechanically or the order in question is a malafide one or the order has been passed on some extraneous consideration or how far the order is fair and reasonable it can certainly be examined and decided by the Court. The Court can not be debarred to examine the decision making process and the correctness of the decision itself.  <br/>Bearing in mind the above proposition of law, let us now decide the fate of the present Rule.<br/><br/>At the outset, it is necessary to mention that we are conscious about the jurisdiction of this Bench that this Bench has no power to deal with the constitutional matter. But to decide the issue involved in the Rule particularly, the terms of the Rule, where the petitioner has sought direction to give effect the order of pardon remitting his sentence, we can not fold our hands off and shut our eyes from examining the order dated 12.04.1993 of the Ministry of Home Affair’s to remit the sentence of the petitioner.<br/><br/>Since the Government failed to produce the relevant file we called for the record of Criminal Appeal No.611 of 1989 from our record room. It appears from the said record that the judgment and order of the High Court Division dated 22<sup>nd</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> September, 1992 along with the lower Court was sent to the Court below on 19.12.1992. At the time of disposal of the appeal the appellant was directed to surrender before the trial Court to serve out his remaining sentence.<br/><br/>Mr. Tamizuddin, the learned Advocate of the petitioner submits that while the petitioner was inside the jail before granting bail by the High Court Division, the wife of the petitioner filed an application to the President for pardon and remission of the sentence of the petitioner and he was on bail when the order of remission of sentence was passed. In absence of the original file it is very difficult to determine when the application of the petitioner’s wife was filed before the competent authority and was placed to the concerned Ministry and before the President; what materials were placed or posted before the President or the Government in support of the prayer of pardon of the petitioner; whether any information as to the dismissal of the Criminal Appeal No.611 of 1989 and maintaining the conviction by the High Court Division with the copy of the judgment and order were at all placed before the President or the Government. But from the record before us it manifests that though at the time of disposal of the appeal the High Court Division directed the petitioner to surrender to the trial Court, the petitioner without complying the said order of the High Court Division had pursued for his pardon. We have already noticed that on 19.12.1992 the judgment and order along with lower Court record was sent to the court below and the order of pardon was passed on 12.04.1993. It is clear that in between the said period the petitioner was an absconder and fugitive from law and justice.  In the application for pardon addressed to the President, as evident from supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioner, a date has been mentioned as 13.06.1991 with regard to the preparation of the application; but there is no proof of it that on that particular date the application for pardon was filed by the wife of the petitioner to the competent authority in order to place it before the President. On perusal of the said application it appears to us that in the said application not a single word has been mentioned or stated about the pendency of Criminal Appeal No.611 of 1989 before the High Court Division. Even in the application dated 18.08.1997 filed before the Assistant Sessions Judge Cox’s Bazar by which the petitioner prayed for recalling the warrant of arrest also did not mention about the judgment and order of the High Court Division passed in Criminal Appeal No.611 of 1989 and as well as the direction given to him to surrender to serve out the remaining Sentence. From the order dated 12.04.1993 it is also evident that in the said order nothing has been mentioned with regard to the Criminal appeal. In view of the above one feature is very clear that though the petitioner was granted bail on 28.08.1991 in the said appeal till disposal of the same but after disposal of the Criminal Appeal on 03.09.1992 his bail ipso facto stood cancelled and the High Court Division without allowing him any time, directed to surrender to the trial Court. In view of the above, the petitioner ought to have surrendered to the trial Court without making any further delay but he did not surrender and as such he became a fugitive and the order of pardon was made on 12.04.1993 when he was fugitive. The petitioner without surrendering to Court concerned had pursued for remitting his sentence before the President and the Government and ultimately managed to obtain the said order.<br/><br/>Even if, we accept the statement of the petitioner as true that while he was inside the jail his wife made the application before the authority concerned; in that situation after disposal of the criminal appeal either the petitioner or his wife should have informed the authority concerned about the judgment and the direction of the High Court Division as the matter of pardon was under process.<br/><br/>In view of the above facts and circumstances it is a pertinent question when a person is fugitive from law and justice in that situation whether the President or the Government can give pardon or remit the sentence of a fugitive in exercising extraordinary power under Article 49 of the Constitution or under Section 401(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as the case may be.<br/><br/>To decide the said issue it is relevant to discuss the proposition of law enunciated by our Appellate Division with regard to fugitive.<br/><br/>It is the consistent view of our Appellate Division that a man who seeks justice from the Court of law must come before the Court to agitate his grievance and must surrender first to the process of justice, otherwise he remains to be fugitive from justice and could not seek aid or assistance of the process of justice in order to claim right of audience against the process of the Court issued against him. In the cases of Chand –Vs- Crown, reported in PLD 1956 (FC), page-43, Gul Hassan –Vs- The State, reported in 21 DLR (SC), page-109, Anti-Corruption Commission –Vs- Mahmud Hossain and others, reported in 61 DLR (AD) page-17, Anti-Corruption Commission –Vs- ATM Nazimullah Chowdhury and others, reported in 62 DLR (AD), page-25, Anti-Corruption Commission –Vs- Dr. HBM Iqbal Alamgir and others reported in 15 BLC(AD) page-45, our Appellate Division has enunciated the above proposition of law. <br/><br/>In the case of Anti-Corruption Commission –Vs- Dr. HBM Iqbal Alamgir and others, reported in 15 BLC (AD), page-44 it has been held that;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“It is well settled that when a person seeks remedy from a Court of law either in writ jurisdiction or criminal appellate, revisional or miscellaneous jurisdiction under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure he ought to submit to the due process of justice. Let it be made clear to him, if it is not already known that Court would not act in aid of an accused person who is a fugitive from law and justice”. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the above case it has also been held that;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Besides, the learned Advocates who move applications for the fugitives shall have to face the consequence of committing contempt of Court.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The learned Assistant Sessions Judge by its order dated 30.06.1997 issued warrant of arrest as well as the conviction warrant against the petitioner when the Assistant Public Prosecution brought notice of the Court that in compliance of the order of the High Court Division passed in Criminal Appeal No. 611 of 1989 the petitioner did not surrender before the Court concerned to serve out his remaining sentence.<br/><br/>On coming to know about the said order the petitioner though his Advocate on 27.08.1997 filed an application to recall the above order dated 30.06.1997 and the Court refused to interfere with the said order of arrest and conviction warrant on the ground that the petitioner being a fugitive can not get justice from the Court unless he surrenders first. The above finding of the learned Assistant Sessions Judge is very consonant with the settled proposition of law that a fugitive from justice is not entitled to obtain a judicial order defying the process of the Court. Even the petitioner without surrendering to the process of Court moved the application under Section 561A read with Section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before this Court and obtained the Rule and bail. We could not understand how the application of a fugitive was entertained; even before swearing the affidavit no permission was taken from the learned Judges of the concerned Bench. In such situation we can make only comment that the petitioner no doubt a fortunate person, who not only managed to obtain the order of pardon, remitting his sentence, but also succeeded to obtain Rule and bail without surrender, defying the process of Court.<br/><br/>Having considered the above settled proposition of law with regard to a fugitive, we are of the view that in passing the order dated 27.08.1997 refusing to recall the order dated 18.08.1997 the learned Assistant Sessions Judge did not commit any error or illegality. It is also an admitted fact that when the petitioner moved the application under Sections 561A read with 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he was fugitive from justice and as such we are unable to give any relief to a fugitive to quashing or setting aside the orders dated 30.06.1997 and 31.08.1997 respectively passed by the learned Assistant sessions Judge, Cox’s Bazar.<br/><br/>It is well settled that the Court can not direct the President how he is to exercise the power under Article 49 of the Constitution.  Similarly, the Court also can not direct the Government how they exercise the power under Section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. But the action of the President or the Government, as the case may be, must be based on some rational, reasonable, fair and relevant principle which is non discriminatory and it must not be guided by any extraneous or irrelevant considerations. It is well settled that all public power including constitutional power shall never be exercisable arbitrarily or malafide and ordinarily, guideline for fair and equal execution are guarantors of the valid play of power and when the mode of power of exercising a valid power is improper or unreasonable, there is an abuse of power.<br/><br/>On perusal of the application filed by the wife of the petitioner as it has quoted in the supplementary affidavit it appears that she prayed pardon mainly on the ground that her husband (the petitioner) and his two political well wishers namely Mir Khashim Ali and Darbesh Ali were victimized for political reasons and their political opponent implicated them in the false Case.<br/><br/>The last paragraph of the said application is as under;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“এমতাবস্থায় রাজনৈতিক অন্যায় ষড়যন্ত্রর অহেতুক শিকার অধীনের স্বামী সারওয়ার কামাল ও তৎদুই রাজনৈতিক ও শুভানুধ্যয় ও শুভাকাংখী জনাব মীর কাশেম ও দরবেশ আলী মেম্বারের বিরুদ্ধে আনিত মিথ্যা অভিযোগের দায় হইতে উক্ত ব্যক্তিগণকে আদালত কর্তৃক প্রদত্ত দন্ড মার্জনা পূর্বক শহীদ জিয়ার আকাংখীত আদর্শ ও উদ্দেশ্যে দেশনেত্রী বেগম খালেদা জিয়ার নেতৃত্বে বাস্তবায়নসহ দুই মরন পথযাত্রী সম্ভ্রান্ত পরিবারকে রক্ষা করার পক্ষে প্রয়োজনীয় ব্যবস্থা গ্রহনের নিমিত্ত অধীনি আপনার সহূদয় করুনা প্রার্থী।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>On perusal of the record of Criminal Appeal No.611 of 1989 it appears to us that the occurrence took place with regard to a land dispute.<br/><br/>It was the prosecution Case that on the date and time of occurrence while Badiur Rahman, the informant, along with his brother Lokman Hakim, Tajur Muluk (the deceased) along with other relations were cultivating their lands in plot No.735,736 and 776 measuring 2.83 acres accused Sarwar Kamal along with 20(twenty) others armed with various deadly weapons like ‘longa’, ‘dao’, ‘lathi’, ‘iron rod’ and ‘khanta’ etc. attacked them with a view of dispossessing them from the said land; eventually, at the order of the convict Sarwar Kamal Convict Mir Kashem Ali hit, with a dao, on the head of the victim Tajur Muluk and there after convict Darbesh Ali also gave some more blows on him and victim Tajur Muluk became senseless with bleeding injuries. The victim Tajur Muluk was taken to the Dulhajare Hospital for treatment where he ultimately succumed to his injuries after 3(three) days.<br/><br/>On careful examination of the judgment of the High Court Division as well as the trial Court it appears that the defence never put any suggestion to the prosecution witnesses that the present petitioner had been implicated in the case for political victimization by his opponent political group.<br/><br/>We have already observed that we have been deprived to know what materials were placed before the President or the Government for its/their consideration to give pardon to the petitioner; but, from the application of the wife of the petitioner it is evident that the petitioner was convicted for political victimization and no relevant documents were annexed or submitted with the said application.<br/><br/>We do not find any nexus between the statements made in the application for pardon and the prosecution story, material evidence on record and the judgment of the trial Court. On perusal of the judgments of the trial Court and the appellate Court hardly, there is any scope to say that the trial was held against the petitioner to victimize him with political ill motive.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate of the petitioner as well as Deputy Attorney General failed to satisfy us by showing any important piece of document what materials were placed or posted to the President or the Government for its consideration, other than an application for pardon of the wife of the petitioner.<br/><br/>In this connection we are of the view that when a convict seeks pardon from the President or the Government he must supply the following materials with the application for pardon; namely-</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">the First Information Report and Police Report;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">the evidence;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">judgment of the trial Court and appellate Court, if any;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">information whether during trial or appeal the convict was on bail or in custody or on absconsion;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">how long the convict is in custody after conviction and what actual  period of sentence he has served;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">whether the convict  is an accused or convicted in any other Case or Cases.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the above materials the authority concerned has to collect a report from Jail authority about the conduct and behavior, when the convict was in jail.<br/><br/>It is the proposition that a decision must be arrived at after taking into account all relevant considerations, eschewing all irrelevant considerations can not for a moment be doubted.<br/><br/>It the instant Case if, the President and the Government gave pardon to the petitioner only considering the statement made in the application for pardon, filed by his wife, without taking into consideration of other relevant materials, certainly the exercise of power under Article 49 of the Constitution or section 401(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure has vitiated the order of pardon as the said order is a mechanical order and the product of favoritism, extraneous and malafide factors.<br/><br/>The petitioner also failed to show us that after disposal of the Criminal Appeal he had intimated about the judgment of the appellate Court to the President or the Government as well as the order of the High Court Division directing him to surrender before the trial Court to serve out his remaining sentence.<br/><br/>If, the said facts and materials were placed before the President and Government the decision of the President or the Government would have been otherwise. Because, it is presumed that the President and the concerned authorities of the Government are well conversant with the law that if a fugitive from law is given pardon knowing his status then the exercise of power under Article 49 of the Constitution or section 401(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure certainly be arbitrary, malafide, unreasonable, irrational and improper and such exercise of power is against the principle of the rule of law and an abuse of the power. If the President or the Government given such indulgence to a fugitive, ignoring and avoiding the direction of the Court and allow the fugitive to approach him/them straight and give him pardon exercising extraordinary power, a day will come when the Criminal administration of justice certainly be collapsed. In view of the principle of rule of law the Court can not approve such exercise of power, in favour of a fugitive, which is absolutely malafide, arbitrary and unreasonable. Fairness, reasonableness and bonafide are the essence of the rule of law.<br/><br/>Further, the decisions of the Appellate Division are institutional decision and the decision is binding as a law. When the Appellate Division categorically and consistently held that a fugitive is not entitled to seek any kind of redress as against his grievance, if any, then the pardon given to a fugitive is absolutely disregard to the said law and the Supreme Court. It is desirable that all concerned including the President and the Government should respect the law declared by the Supreme Court and the Government functionaries are obliged to act in aid of the Supreme Court in view of the provisions of Article 112 of the constitution.   <br/><br/>Having considered the facts and circumstances of the present Case and the proposition of law we are of the view that the order dated 12.04.1993 remitting the sentence of the petition in exercising power under Article 49 of the constitution and section 401(1) of the Code f Criminal Procedure has vitiated on the following reasons:</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">the petitioner was a fugitive from law when the order of pardon was made;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">the petitioner in procuring the order of pardon concealed the material facts; particularly, the pendency of the Criminal Appeal No.611 of 1989 before this High Court Division and the  judgment of the High Court Division passed in the said appeal maintaining the order of convic-tion and directing him to surrender to the Court below to serve out the remaining sentence.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">the petitioner without surrender-ing to the process of the Court, as per direction of the High Court Division succeeded to procure the order of pardon;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">the alleged order is a mechanical one and product of party favo-uritism, extraneous and malafide factors and also not fair, reason-able and rational; which is against the sprit of the rule of law; </li><li style="text-align: justify;">the conduct of the petitioner does not show that he with clean hands moved before the President and the Government;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">it is not clear from the order that whether the President at all exercised the power conferred upon him under Article 49 of the Constitution, as in the said order it has been mentioned that the Government has taken the decision to remit the sentence of the petitioner and for this ambiguity and anomaly it reflects non application of mind of the concerned authorities of the Government.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Thus, we are not inclined to direct the First Court of Assistant Sessions Judge, Cox’s Bazar to give effect the order of Pardon dated 12.04.1993 remitting the sentence of the petitioner as per the terms of the first portion of the Rule.<br/><br/>On the other hand the trial court rightly issued the warrant of arrest as well as the conviction warrant on 30.06.1997 when the Judgment and order of the High Court Division passed in Criminal Appeal No. 611 of 1989 was brought to the notice of it and subsequently on 31.08.1997 rightly refused to interfere with his earlier order on the ground that the petitioner was a fugitive. In passing the order on 30.06.1997, the learned Assistant Sessions Judge before issuing the warrant of arrest held that; “অতএব, তাহার অনুকুলে প্রদত্ত জামিন বাতিল করা হইলz” This finding of the learned Assistant Sessions Judge is irrelevant and uncalled for. Because, after the disposal of the appeal in the High Court Division, the bail given to him ipso facto stood cancelled. When there was no bail, question of cancellation of bail does not arise at all. Apart from the above observation, the orders dated 30.06.1997 and 31.08.1997 respectively are based on sound principle of law and thus, we are not inclined to interfere or to quash the said orders. The learned Assistant Sessions Judge passed the said orders within its jurisdiction. Moreso, when the petitioner moved the application before this Court in its revisional jurisdiction he was a fugitive. It is true that the petitioner in the cause title of the application mentioned section 498 with section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Mentioning the section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by itself did not change his status of fugitive. Section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not at all applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case; rather it was an attempt of the petitioner to mislead the Court. Moreso, the petitioner was not advised properly. <br/><br/>Further, in exercising power under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure we have no scope to direct the authority concerned to give effect of the alleged order of pardon, since it is an executive order, not an order passed in a pending proceeding. <br/><br/>In view of the above, we are inclined to discharge the Rule. <br/><br/>Accordingly, the Rule is discharged.<br/><br/>The petitioner is directed to surrender before the court below within 6(six) weeks from the date of receipt of the judgment and order of this Court.<br/><br/>However, the petitioner is at liberty to file fresh application for pardon, complying the observations made in this judgment, if so advised, and the President or the Government may reconsider the prayer of pardon of the petitioner in the light of the relevant materials in accordance with constitution and law. This judgment will not be a bar for such reconsideration.  <br/><br/>It appears from the order sheet annexed by the petitioner in the supplementary affidavit, annexure-C, that the trial Court sent the record to the High Court on 03.07.1989 by its order No.35. After disposal of the appeal the record was sent to the trial Court on 19.12.1992 but it appears from the said order sheet that the order of the High Court was not brought to the notice of the concerned judge and the record was sent to the record room behind the back of the learned judge.<br/><br/>It is absolutely misconduct on the part of the concerned officials who did not bring notice of the judgment of the High Court Division to the concerned trial Judge.<br/><br/>In view of the above, we direct the learned Assistant Sessions Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Cox’s Bazar to make an inquiry why after disposal of the appeal when the lower Court record was sent to the said Court with a copy of the judgment and order of the Criminal Appeal same was not placed before the presiding Judge and he is also directed to take departmental action against the concerned person/persons who is/are liable for such misconduct.<br/><br/>Considering the facts and circumstances of the instant case our conscience pricks to say few words to express our anxiety.<br/><br/>Sub-section (1) of section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has empowered the Government to suspend or remit sentence, either whole or party of the punishment to which a convict has been sentenced; on the other hand sub-section (3) of the said section has empowered the Government to cancel the suspension or remission of sentence and to take the concerned person into custody, if at large, to undergo the unexpired portion of sentence; sub-section (2) of the section makes a provision that the Government may require the Presiding Judge of the Court before or by which the conviction was had or confirmed to state is opinion as to whether the application should be granted or refused.<br/><br/>Having regard to the fact that to exercise the above power by the Government there is no Rule or standard guideline. Thus, we are of the view that for fair, proper and boanafide exercise of the above power Government may frame Rule and guideline or even amend the Code, as has been done in one of our neighbouring countries. Possibly, this is the high time for the Government to think over the matter to avoid controversy, criticism and misuse of power.<br/><br/>Let a copy of this judgment and order be sent to the trial court as well as the Secretary to the President, Secretary Ministry of Home Affairs and Secretary Ministry of Law Justice and Parliamentary Affairs for their appraisal and future guidance.<br/><br/><strong>      Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

Panchananda died leaving behind two sons, namely, Ram Narayan Mal and Ramlochan Mal before Chakala Rosanabad survey operation and during Rosanabad survey operation the said sons used to live together in a joint family and khatian No.112 in respect of 1<sup>st</sup> schedule land recorded the name of Ram Narayan Mal and khatian No.14 in respect of 2<sup>nd</sup> schedule land and suit schedule Nos.3 and 4 have been recorded in the name of Ram Lochan Mal. The suit schedule lands were not recorded in the khatian as per their share. Ram Narayan Mal died leaving one son, Aboy Charan and one daughter, Swarasati Debi Urshashi. Urshashi died leaving 3 sons, Guru Charan, Hari Charan and defendant No.30 as heirs. Abhoy Charan Mal got 8 annas share in the suit land in ejmali. Karunamaye, daughter of, Abhoy Charan, after marriage, used to live with her father. Abhoy Charan died leaving one daughter, Karunamoye and 2 grand sons, Rajani Kanta Mal and Kuluk Kanta Mal who became owner in the left out property of their grand father, Abhoy Charan and their names have been recorded in R.S. Khatian. The names of Rajani Kanta Mal and Kuluk Chandra Mal have not been recorded in revisional khatian but name of Kuluk Chandra has been wrongly recorded in revisional khatian. Rajani Kanta died leaving son plaintiff No.1 and Kuluk Chandra Mal died leaving son, plaintiff No.2. So, plaintiffs became owner and possessors in the left out property of Rajanai Kanta and Kuluk Chandra Mal and enjoyed in ejmali. The further case of the plaintiffs is that, during Chakala Roshanabad survey operation, Ram Lochan wrongly recroded 8 annas share i.e. 3<sup>rd</sup> schedule land of his two brothers in the name of his son, Orehan on taking advantage of oldness of Ram Narayan, the heirs of Karunamaye along with Bashi Ram and others, who are cousin brother of Kuranamay Mal owning 8 annas share but in ka schedule land, Karunamoye was owner of ½ annas share. Kuluk Chandra Mal purchased 11 decimals of land from plot No.65 of 2<sup>nd</sup> schedule by deed dated 4.9.1981 and plaintiff No.2 purchased 8 decimals of land from plot No.65 of 2<sup>nd</sup> schedule from  defendant No.2 by sale deed dated 1.9.1981. Plaintiff No.2 purchased 10 decimals of land from plot No.69/70 of 2<sup>nd</sup> schedule from Rafiqul Islam by sale deed dated 23.6.1992. Paranchandra Mal died leaving Bashee Ramchandra Mal, Goura Chandra Mal as residuary with another son, Ramlochan Mal and brother Ramnarayan and Rajchandra Mal. Gourachandra Mal died leaving  one son. Bashee Rammal died leaving Rameshawr Mal, Jugeshawr Mal and Ramcharan Mal as residuary. Raseshwar died leaving Khetra Mohan Mal and defendant No.7, Usha. Jugeshwar Mal died leaving defendant Nos.1-3 as 3 sons. Ramcharan died leaving no son. Khetra Mohan Mal died leaving two sons, defendant Nos.4 and 5 and wife, defendant No.6 and they became owner of the property left by Rameshawr Mal. Plaintiffs have been owning and possessing the suit land. The defendants possessing more share than their actual share for which plaintiffs demanded partition but defendants refused, lastly on 5.8.1993, hence the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>   Defendant Nos.1, 2 and 3 contested the suit by filing written statement. It is the case of the defendants that Panchananda was in possession of and owner of the land of 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> schedule of plaint and he has no title in 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> schedule of the plaint. Panchannanda died leaving 2 sons, namely, Ram Narayan and Ram Lochan as his heirs who became owner and in possession of the land of 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> schedule of the plaint. Ram Narayan and Ram Lochan used to live together in a joint family and Ram Narayan Mal being 'korta' of the family, and Chakla Roshanabad Khatian No.112 and 114 were prepared in the name of Ram Narayan in respect of 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> schedule land but both of them possessed equally. Abhoy Charan and Swarasati were not sons of Ram Narayan who had no son. Ram Narayan died leaving behind brother, Ram Lochan as heir and Ram Lochan got land of 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> schedule by inheritance from his father and brother. 3<sup>rd</sup> schedule land of khatian No.C.R.155 was prepared in the name of Ramsum Dardas, Bashee Rammal, Charan, Gongaram and Kashiram, Nandaramal and son of Ram Lochan as owner and possessor of 4<sup>th</sup> schedule of R.S. khatian No.2 which was prepared and published in the name of Pancharanda and his residuary had no title in the land of 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> schedule. Haracharan Mal died unmarried during the life time of his father. Thereafter, Ram Lochan became owner and possessor in 8 annas share of 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> schedule land and said Ram Lochan died leaving behind 3 sons, Bashuram Mal, Ramchandra Mal and Gouchandra Mal who inherited the property of their father, they purchased 8 annas land from 4<sup>th</sup> schedule from Nandarampal in the name of Bashirampal and possessed. Even they purchased part of the pond and bank of the pond in plot No.10-11 to 3<sup>rd</sup> schedule and became owner and possessor therein. In this way, Bashiram, Razchandra and Gouree Chandra became owner and possessor in the land of 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> schedule by purchase and inheritance and they sold aforesaid land of schedule 1<sup>st  </sup> to 4<sup>th </sup>to Rameshawar and Jaggeshwar. Thereafter, Rameshawar and Jaggeshwar purchased 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> schedule land by deed dated 23<sup>rd</sup> Bhadra, 1332 B.S. and S.A. khatian prepared in their names. Ramcharan died leaving behind wife, Kanjabasheedas and she became owner and was in possession of the property left by Ramchandra Mal. Krishna Chandra Barman created false deed in respect of 56 decimals of land of plot No.72 and 11 from Kanjabasheedas. Kanjabasheedas did not execute such deed and she had no need/necessity to sell aforesaid 56 decimals of land to pay her husband’s debt and own debt of Tk.3,000.00. She sold 72 decimal of land to Krishna Mohan for paying her husband’s and own loan. Plaintiff Nos.1-2 purchased 5 decimals of land from Krishnamohan’s purcha-sed land by sale deed dated 16.9.1980. Plaintiff No.2 purchased 8 decimals of land from defendant No.2 by deed dated 1.9.1981. Before the plaintiff, Gurucharan, Haricharan Rajmohan, Ummasee Swarasatee and Avoy Charan had no ownership and possession because Ram Narayan had no residuary named Karonamayee. Kuluk and Rajanee had fish business and were movable men, allowed Basheeram lived in Bashiram’s land and died leaving behind plaintiff Nos.1 and 2 in the dwelling hut. Plaintiff Nos.1 and 2 had no title in the suit land. They created a false gift deed No.90 dated 12.1.1924 and forged the name in S.A. khatian to grab the property.<br/> <br/><strong>5.   </strong>Trial Court framed 3 issues, whether the suit is maintainable in its present form, whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get decree as prayed for and whether plaintiffs entitled to get other reliefs.<br/> <br/><strong>6.   </strong>Plaintiff examined 3 P.Ws. and defendants examined 3 D.Ws. and produced some documents. Learned Subordinate Judge decreed the suit. Defendant Nos.1 – 3 preferred Title Appeal No.105 of 1998 which was heard, on transfer by the learned Additional District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Comilla who allowed the appeal, reversed the findings of the trial Court and this rule is from that judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>7.   </strong>Mr. Tobarak Hossain, learned Advocate, appearing for the plaintiff-petitioners, submits that, the judgment and decree passed by the Court of appeal below is not proper judgment of reversal.   The learned judge of the appellate court did not advert to the findings arrived at by the learned Subordinate Judge on consideration of the materials on record. Learned Advocate further submits that, trial Court on consideration of the evidence on record found plaintiffs' title and possession in 3.97 ½ acres of land but this finding of the learned Subordinate judge was neither address to nor adverted by the learned Additional District Judge while allowing the appeal. Learned Advocate further submits that learned Subordinate Judge after consideration of the materials on record in respect of 2<sup>nd</sup> schedule land made findings to the effect that:        </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">      ২য় তপছিলের ভূমি হইতে ২৭ শতক হুকুম দখল করিয়াছে, ঐ ২৭ শতক এর মধ্যে ১৩  শতক বাদীগনের অংশ হইতে বাদ যাইবে .............. ৪র্থ তপছিলের ভূমি ১১ শতক হুকুুম দখল করা হইয়াছে তাহা হইতে বাদীগনের অংশ ৫   শতক বাদ যাইবে.........."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In reversing the judgment of the learned subordinate judge learned Additional District judge did not make any discussion of the evidence on record. Learned Advocate further submits that judgment of the appellate Court having passed without considering the materials on record, as such, the appeal should be remanded back to the Court of appeal below so that the learned Judge of the Appellate Court could pass the judgment on reference to the evidence on record.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>   Mr. H. R. Nandi along with Mrs. Lily Rani Saha, learned Advocates, appearing for the opposite parties, on the other hand submits that, judgment passed by the Court of appeal below as Final Court of fact should not be disturbed as the judgment passed by the learned judge of Court of appeal below was passed legally on reference to the evidence on record. Learned Advocate further submits that if the appeal be remanded to the Court of appeal below, then, the learned Advocate submits, that a direction should be given to the learned Additional District Judge to consider the case of the parties by taking additional evidence as per section 107 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>   I am of the view that the judgment of the Appellate Court is not a proper judgment of reversal. Let me find the relevant portion of the judgment. At the out set it may be mentioned that the judgment of the appellate court is not in proper language. Let me quote the relevant portion of the judgment;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">      উল্লেখিত অবস্থায় দেখব যায় আপীল পর্যায়ে শুনানীকালে রেসপনডেন্ট বাদীপক্ষ মোট ১.৩৪ একর ভূমি হুকুম দখলের কারণে আরজির তপছিল থেকে কর্তন করে উক্ত ভূমি বিবাদীগনের অংশ থেকে বাদ যাবে বলে তাদের ২৮/২/০৫ ইং তারিখের প্রদত্ত দরখাস্তে উল্লেখ করেছে। কিন্তু এই ১.৩৪ একর ভূমি কোন কোন বিবাদীর অংশ থেকে বাদ যাবে কিংবা ছাহাম প্রার্থী ১১/১২/১৩(ক)-১৩(খ) পর্যন্ত বিবাদীদের অংশ থেকে বাদ যাবে কি না কিংবা তাদের অংশ অক্ষুন্ন থাকবে কিনা এসব বিষয়ে দাখিলকৃত দরখাস্তে বাদী রেসপন্ডেন্ট পক্ষ সুনিদিষ্ট ভাবে কিছুই উল্লেখ করেনি।<br/>      অপরদিকে বিবাদী আপীল্যান্ট পক্ষ ২২/১১/০৫ ইং তারিকে দরখাস্ত দিয়ে আরজির তপছিল ভুক্ত সর্বমোট ৩.১৭ একর ভুমি হুকুম দখল হয়েছে বলে পরিস্কার ভাবে উল্লেখ করেছে। বাদীপক্ষ মোট ১.৩৪ একর ভূমি হুকুম দখলের কথা স্বীকার করলেও বিবাদী আপীল্যান্ট  পক্ষের  দাবী মতে মোট ৩.১৭ একর হুকুম দখলের বিষয়টি সম্পর্কে সুস্পষ্ট কোন বক্তব্য দেননি। ফলে দেখা যঅয়  এই মামলার বন্টন যোগ্য মোট ৮.২৩ একর ভূমির মধ্যে বাদীপক্ষ বলেছে ১.৩৪ একর ভূমি হুকুম দখল হয়েছে আবার বিবাদীপকষ বলেছে হুকুম দখলকৃত ভূমির পরিমান ৩.১৭ একর। বিজ্ঞ নিম্ন আদালত হুকুম দখলকৃত ভূমি সম্পর্কে উভয় পক্ষের উল্লেখিত বাদীর উপর দৃশ্যত কোন আলোচনা করেননি। কারণ বিচারের সময বাদীপক্ষ যেমন মোট ১.৩৪ একর ভূমি হুকুম দখলকৃত বলে আদালতে তথ্য প্রদান করেননি ঠিক তেমনি বিবাদী আপীল্যান্ট পক্ষ তাদের দাবী মতে ৩.১৭ একর হুকুম দখল হওয়ার বিষয়টি বিজ্ঞ নিম্ন আদালতে উথথাপন করেননি।<br/>      এ রুপ পরিস্থিতিতে স্পষ্টতঃ দেখা যায় আরজীর তপছিলের ভূমি থেকে ৩.১৭ একর না কি ১.৩৪ একর ভূমি হুকুম দখল হয়েছে তা নিরুপন না করে তপছিল বর্ণিত ভূমি বন্টনের যে প্রাথমিক ডিক্রী বিজ্ঞ নিম্ন আদালত প্রদান করেছেন তা মোঠেই যথাযথও সঠিক হয়নি। যদি বাদী রেসপন্ডেন্ট পক্ষ মুল মামলায় আরজীর তপছিল ভূক্ত ভূমি থেকে গোমতী নদীর বাধের জন্য হুকুম দখলকৃত ভূমির সঠিক পরিমান বাদ দিয়ে তাদের দাবীকৃত প্রাপ্য অংশ দাবী করতেন এবং তা যদি সাক্ষ্য প্রমানের মাধ্যমে প্রতিষ্ঠিত  করতে পারতেন তা হলে এই মুল বাটোয়ারা মামলাটির বিচার কার্যক্রম সঠিক হয়েছে বলে গন্য করা যেত। কিন্তু তারা তা না কারয় স্বাভাবিক ভাব্রেজীর পিছিলে বর্ণিত বন্টনযোগ্য ভূমির মধ্যে গরমিল দেখা দিয়েছে।<br/>     বাদীগনের পুর্ববতীমার নারায়ন মালের নামীয় ১ম তপছিলে বর্ণিত সম্পৃক্তির ১১২নং খতিয়ান এবং ২য় তপছিলের বর্ণিত সম্পত্তির ১৪নং খতিয়ানের সত্যায়িত নকলপ্রদ-ঘ(১) (ডি)(১) আদালতে দাখিল করলেও রাম লোচনেরনোমীয় ৩য় ও ৪র্থ তপছিলের বর্ণিত সম্পত্তির যথাত্র্রমে ২০৩ ও ১৩নং খতিয়ানের কোন সত্যায়িত নকল তারা আদালতে দাখিল করে নাই। ফলে দেখা যায় বাদীগনের পূর্ববর্তী রাম নারায়ন এবং রাম লোচন আরজীর ১ম-৪র্থ তপছিলের ভূমিতে তুল্যাংশে মালিক থাকার দাবীটি বাদীগন প্রমান করতে সমর্থন হয়ননি। আর, এস, খতিয়ানের একটি অতি পুরাতনও গ্রহনযোগ্য খতিয়ান এর এমিট্রকে সাক্ষ্য প্রমান দিয়ে অশুদ্ধ ও ভুল হিসেবে প্রমানিত না হওয়া পর্যন্ত এই ধরনের খতিয়ানকে আইনতঃ অশুদ্ধ ও ভ্রমাত্মক দাবী করার কোন সুযোগ নেই।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>10. </strong>Here I refer to provision of Order XLI Rule 31 of the Code of Civil Procedure which is as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"The judgment of the appellate Court shall be in writing and shall state-<br/>(a)        the points for determination;<br/>(b)        the decision thereon;<br/>(c )       the reasons for the decision; and,<br/>(d)        where the decree appealed from is reversed or varied, the relief to which the appellant is entitled;<br/>        and shall, at the time that it is pronounced, be signed and dated by the judge or by the judges concurring therein."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>11.</strong> On reference to the entire judgment of the Court of appeal below mentioned herein before, I am of the view that the findings of the learned judge are not proper findings of a judgment of reversal.

Ashfaqul Islam, J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>          This Reference application under section 160(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984 (hereinafter referred to as Ordinance, 1984) has been filed by the applicant against an order  of the Taxes Appeal Tribunal, Division Bench-5 Dhaka, passed in Income Tax Appeal No.4408  of 2008-2009 (Assessment year 2007- 2008) dated 30.07.2009  arising out of the order dated 20.04.2009 of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes, (Appeal) Taxes Appeal Zone-3, Dhaka in First Appeal No.159/Coy’s Circle-15/Taxes Zone-05/2008-2009.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>         Facts leading to the filing of this Reference Application, in short, are that the applicant is engaged in share trading business as a limited company and a regular tax payee. Under section 53BBB of the Ordinance as a regular tax payee  he paid tax at the rate of 0.015%  at source on the value of shares, debentures, mutual funds, bonds or securities transacted by the company at the time of payment for such transaction. The applicant submitted his return showing his income in two heads (i) income from share trading business and (ii) income from bank interest. The Applicant has no case against the Respondent’s decision on the second head i.e. bank interest income. The applicant has paid tax of Tk. 3,15,396/= at the rate of 0.015% on turnover of Tk. 210,26,39,696/= and has shown Tk. 11,355.09.52/- as an income, less tax deducted at source, as per section 82C(4) of the Income Tax Ordinance. The applicant showed his expenditure from that tax deducted income at source and computed GP at Tk. 26,34,703/-.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>         It has been further stated that this Division in Desh Petroleum Service Co. Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Taxes, Zones-5 12 MLR 48  has  decided that “As per section 82©(4), the tax amount deducted or collected on account of supply of goods of execution of contract falling under section 52 shall be deemed to have fully discharged from tax liability. The further levy of taxes by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes is illegal” and this judgment has become a binding precedent. The Deputy Commissioner of Taxes (hereinafter called DCT) misunderstood the law and served a notice under 83(1) and 79 of the Ordinance for personal hearing and following notices the applicant through his Authorized Representative made submission  that the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes deducted the bank interest income from the shown GP at Tk.26,34,703/- and considering the rest Tk.19,91,452/-as net income, made a bad calculation and imposed tax of Tk.7,88,490/- at the rate of 40%. The Deputy Commissioner of Taxes most arbitrarily imposed double tax on the applicant, which was a flagrant violation of the decision referred to above.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>         The applicant being aggrieved by the assessment order by the D.C.T. preferred appeal before the Commissioner of Taxes (Appeal) on the same ground but the Commissioner of Taxes (Appeal) failed to grasp the error in proper understanding of law and upheld the decision of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes. Thereafter the applicant moved before the Tax Appellate Tribunal again on the same ground. The Tribunal even upheld the decision of the Commissioner of Taxes (Appeal) against which this Reference Application has been preferred in which following questions have been framed :-<br/><em>“A. Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified under section 53BBB, 82C(2)(1e) and 82C(4) of the Income Tax Ordinance in rejecting the appeal.”  </em><br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>         By filing supplementary affidavit the petitioner also formulated two questions of law to be added with the paragraph 13A. Those are as under –</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“B. Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in imposing double tax on the Applicant ? </em><br/><em>Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in not considering the Applicant’s  payment of tax at source under section 53BBB on their deemed income as per section 82C (1e), as Applicant’s final discharge of tax liability under section 82C(4).”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>6.</strong>         Mr. Rafiq-ul Huq, the learned Senior Advocate appearing with Ms. Nazmus Saliheen, the learned counsel on behalf of the applicant in his submission mainly highlighted and emphasized question of law as envisage in supplementary affidavit   in particular the question of law (C).  The bone of his contention is that as per section 82(C )(4) of the Ordinance the tax amount deducted or collected at source in terms of 52BBB of the <strong>Ordinance shall be deemed to have been finally  discharged  from tax liability</strong>. The further levy of taxes by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes is illegal. He placed reliance on the decision of 12 MLR 48 as referred to above. <br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>         Mr. Abdur Rahim Bhuiyan, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing with Mrs. Mahfuza Begum, the learned Assistant Attorney General, on the other hand, by filing affidavit-in-opposition, on behalf of the respondent opposes the reference application and submits that the Appellate Tribunal was justified in law in rejecting the appeal as the D.C.T. made assessment computing income of Tk. 7,88,490/- under section 82C on the basis of tax deducted at source under section 53BBB at Tk. 3,15,396/- @ 0.015% against commission received at Tk. 1,13,55,091/- against purchase and sales of shares of Tk. 210,26,39,696/-. The assessee declared return of his income showing net profit of Tk. 26,34,703/- inclusive of interest income (FDR) Tk. 6,43,251/-. So the D.C.T. computed income under section 82 Cat Tk. 7,88,490/-, interest income (FDR) Tk. 6,43,251/- and the rest amount of declared returned income was computed as Deemed Income of the assessee at Tk. 12,02,962/- in accepting the total income declared by the assessee company.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>         He referred to section 82C(5) and submits that the case of the applicant falls under the said provision and hence the principle enunciated in 12 MLR is not applicable in the instant case. <br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>         We have heard the learned Senior Advocate for the applicant and the learned Deputy Attorney General at length and considered their submissions. We have also carefully gone through the Reference application and the different Annexures thereto. For proper answer of the questions formulated in this Reference it would be profitable to go through the relevant provisions of the Ordinance on this behalf. Section 52 BBB states:-  </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The Chief Executive Officer of a stock exchange shall collect tax at the rate of [ zero point zero five percent (0.05%)] on the value of shares, debentures, mutual funds, bonds or securities  transacted by a member of a stock exchange at the time of payment for such transaction.]”</em><br/>      Next section 82( C )(2) (le) states:- <br/><em>“The amount received on account of transaction by a member of a stock exchange for which tax is collectible under section 53BBB.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>10.</strong>       This provision was inserted in the Ordinance by Finance Act, 2006.<br/><br/>Then comes Section 82 (C)(4)  which reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Income referred to under sub-section (1) in respect of which tax has been deducted or collected on account of ……………………… transaction by a member of any stock exchange under section 53BBB, …………………………. <u>shall be deemed to be the final discharge of tax liability under this Ordinance</u> ” (Underlined by us)</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>11.</strong>       <u>On a plain reading of all these provisions together the irresistible and only inference that can be drawn is that the tax that has been levied at source under section 53 BBB is the final discharge of tax  liability within the meaning of section 82 (C ) (4).</u> Regard may be taken to the pertinent portion of the decision referred to above. In that decision his Lordships clearly observed in paragraph 8 as under :-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The admitted position is that the applicant submitted its return for the assessment year 1999-2000 showing net income of Tk.2,31,3457/- from its business of carrying contract and it also appears that the tax deducted from its income of Tk.2,03,49,305.41 at  source at the prescribed rate on the basis of circular No.2 (Tax) 1999-2000 dated 23.9.1999 read with Rule -16 of the Income Tax Rules 1984, as of date, amounts to Tk.6,10,480100, and the same has been accepted by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>12. </strong>It would be relevant to mention in this context <u>that the forgoing provisions are almost all new enactments and there are no provisions as such to this effect in the Income Tax ordinance 1922. Therefore, it is our considerate view that this is a special privilege that has been given by the legislature to a certain group of persons dealing with some particular business and in all fairness the legislature never wanted that they should be taxed twice.</u> In the above decision we also find reflection of the view taken by us and for that reason the submission of the learned Deputy Attorney General that this case comes <u>within the purview of section 82( C ) (5) has no legs to stands since Sec 82(C)(5) concerns about excess amount of expenditure categorized under Section 19 of the Ordinance.</u>  (Underlings are mine)<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>       Section 82 ( C ) (5) runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Where an assessee, while explaining the nature and source of any sum, investment, money, valuable article, <u>excess amount of expenditure referred to in section 19</u>, takes into account any source of income which is subject to tax in accordance with the provisions of the section, he shall not be entitled to take credit of any sum as is in excess of any amount which, if taxed at a rate or rates, other than the rate applicable to income chargeable to tax under this section, would have resulted in tax liability equal to the tax payable in respect of income under this section.” (Underlined by us)</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>14.</strong>       The inevitable result that follows that this Reference Application should be allowed in favour of the applicant.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>       Thus, we are of the view that questions of law as framed by the applicant in the Reference Application are answered in the negative and in favour of the applicant. Accordingly, the Reference Application is allowed without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/>      The Registrar of the Supreme Court is directed to take necessary steps under section 162 of the Ordinance. <br/> <br/><strong>        Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
