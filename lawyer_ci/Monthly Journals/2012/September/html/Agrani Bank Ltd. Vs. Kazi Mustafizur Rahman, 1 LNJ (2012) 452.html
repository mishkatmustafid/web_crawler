Kamruzzaman, the learned Advo-cate appearing for the petitioner Agrani Bank at the very outset upon referring a number of decisions reported in 49 DLR(AD)-135, 16 MLR-97, 12 MLR-73, 9 MLR-17, 18 BLD (AD)-268, 56 DLR-695 and 8 MLR(AD)-01 submits that the proposition of law is by now well settled that no separate suit lies against the judgment and decree or order passed by the Artha Rin Adalat.<br/> <br/><strong>7. </strong>        Drawing my attention to the provision of section 6 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 1990, Mr. Md. Kamruzzaman submits that the impugned order does not reflect the true position of law and as such the same is liable to be set-aside.<br/> <br/><strong>8. </strong>        No one has entered appearance to oppose the Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>         I have considered the submission of the learned Advocate and perused the Revisional application along with other materials on record. It is found that the plaintiff-opposite party filed Title Suit No.30 of 1995 impleading the petitioner-Agrani Bank for declaration that the exparte decree passed in Money Suit No. 3 of 1993 is collusive, illegal, without jurisdic-tion and not binding upon the plaintiff.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>       Now, the only question calls for consideration in this Rule whether any separate suit lies against the judgment and decree passed by the Artha Rin Adalat. In order to resolve this point certain provisions of law are required to be referred to for having a better view of the dispute in question.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>       In this connection, I feel it proper to quote Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure at the outset which reads as follows :- <br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>       The Plaint shall be rejected in the following cases:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(a)    where it does not disclose a cause of action.<br/>(b)    where the relief claimed is undervalued , and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court fails to do so:<br/>(c)    where the relief claimed is properly valued but the plaint is written upon insufficient stamp and the plaintiff on being required by the Court  to supply the requisite stamp-paper within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so :<br/>(d)    where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law.<br/>(Provided that the time fixed by the Court for the correction of the valuation or supplying of the requisite stamp paper shall not exceed twenty one days ).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>13.</strong>       From a plain reading of the aforesaid provision of law, I find that Clause (d) of Rule 11 of Order 7 is relevant for our purpose. Since, the defendant claims that the said suit is barred under the specific provision of law as contemplated under section 6 of Artha Rin Adalat Ain,1990. Therefore, I also feel it necessary to quote the aforesaid provisions of law. Section 6 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 1990 reads as follows :-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“৬। অর্থ ঋণ আদালতের সিদ্ধামত্ম চুড়ামত্ম। (১) ধারা ৭ এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, অর্থ ঋণ আদালতের কার্য্যধারা, আদেশ, রায় ও ডিক্রী সম্পর্কে কোন আদালত বা অন্য কোন কর্তৃপক্ষের নিকট প্রশ্ন উত্থাপন করা যাইবে না।‘<br/>(২) উপ-ধারা (১) এ যাহা কিছুই থাকুক না কেন, কোন অর্থ ঋণ আদালত কর্তৃক বিবাদীর বিরুদ্ধে প্রদত্ত কোন একতরফা ডিক্রী রদ করার জন্য বিবাদী Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1903) এর Order IX Gi rule 13 এর বিধান মোতাবেক আদালতে দরখাসত্ম করিতে চাহিলে তাহাকে তাহার বিরুদ্ধে ডিক্রীকৃত অর্থের অমত্মতঃ অর্ধেক অর্থ বা উহার সমপরিমান অর্থের ব্যাংক জামানত দরখাসেত্মর সহিত আদালতে জমা করিতে হইবে, এবং উক্তরুপ জমা করা না হইলে তাহার দরখাসত্ম গ্রহন যোগ্য হইবে না।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>14.</strong>       From a plain reading of the above quoted provisions of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 1990, it appears that under the Ain of 1990, if any party is aggrieved by the ex-parte decree of the Artha Rin Adalat two remedies are available to judgment debtor or aggrieved party. One, a petition under Order IX, rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the other, an appeal before the High Court Division. In both the cases deposit of half of the decreetal amount is a positive requirement and mandate.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>       In this connection I must quote a passage from a case of Nur Islam (Md) Vs Agroni Bank reported in 49 DLR (AD) 135 for having a better view in the dispute in question which reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>Mr. AKM Nurun Nabi Khan, learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner, contends that <u>when the petitioner-defendant challenged the exparte decree on the ground of fraud his application under section 151 CPC is quite maintainable. We do not find any substance in this contention, for the Artha Rin Adalat Act specifically provides for only two remedies against an exparte decree</u>. It is either by an application or by an appeal; but in both the cases deposit of 50% of decretal amount is necessary. To avoid this deposit, it appears, the petitioner has sought a short-cut by invoking section 151 CPC which is not applicable in such a situation. The application under section 151 is found to have been rightly dismissed.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(The under linings are mine)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>16.</strong>       In the case  being M. Tariqullah Sikder Vs. Sonali Bank reported in 56 DLR(2007)695 also provides similar feature to the effect that provision of Section 6 of the Artha Rin Adalat  Ain 1990 bars instituting of separate suit to set aside exparte decree passed by Artha Rin Adalat. Only available  scope for setting aside ex-parte  decree passed by Artha Rin Adalat in Artha Rin case is to file miscellaneous case under Order IX  rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure  by deposit of 50% of decreetal amount or in the alternative in the appeal as contemplated under the said Ain.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>       As, I have already noticed that in this case the plaintiff-opposite party without taking the remedies available to him challenged the rightness of the judgment and decree in a suit before a Court of ordinary civil jurisdiction. The suit, thus is clearly barred by law justifying rejection of plaint.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>       For the reasons stated above, I am inclined to hold that the learned Assistant Judge seriously erred in law in passing the impugned order without properly applying his judicial mind into the facts and circumstances of the case and law bearing on the subject and the same has resulted in an error in the impugned decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>       In the result, the Rule is made absolute. The impugned order dated 28.9.95 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Barisal in Title Suit No. 30 of 1995 refusing to reject plaint stands set-aside. Plaint of Title Suit No. 30 of 1995 of the said Court stands rejected.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>       The order of stay granted earlier by this Court so far it relates to Execution Case No. 19 of 1994 arising out of Money Suit No. 03 of 1993 pending in the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of learned Subordinate Judge, and Artha Rin Adalat, Barisal stands vacated.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">The Artha Rin Adalat concerned is directed to proceed with the Money Execution Case No. 19 of 1994 arising out of Money Suit No. 03 of 1993 expeditiously.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
