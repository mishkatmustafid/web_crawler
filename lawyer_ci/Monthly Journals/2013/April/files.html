The plaint case, in short, was that the Banachhaya Mohila Kallayan Samity was a Women Welfare Organization. The plaintiff was the first General Secretary and co­ordinator of the said samity since its incorporation in 1989. The said samity was registered under the Department of Women Affairs of the Government of Bangladesh and got government as well as foreign grants. The said samity was an autonomous body and had its own constitution. As per its constitution, there was a procedure for formation of General, Executive and Advisory Committees. But there was no provision for formation of any ad-hoc committee under that constitution. The General Secretary was authorized to convene any meeting. But on 14.06.1992 the District Women's Affairs officer most illegally convened an emergency meeting of the Executive Committee and formed an ad-hoc committee of five members with defendant No.l as president and defendant No.2 as general secretary. The formation of the said committee without election was illegal. The said illegal committee by holding a farce election on 28.11.1992 formed an Executive Committee, wherein the defendant No. 1 was shown as elected President, defendant No.2 as Vice President, defendant No.3 was shown as General Secretary and defendant Nos.6 and 7 were shown as members of the Executive Committee. That the said newly formed committee was absolutely illegal and the plaintiff was not bound by any decision taken by that illegal committee. That the plaintiff raised an objection against the activities of that illegal Executive Committee and as a result, at the initiative of the donors' association, an enquiry was held and the plaintiff was recommended to be kept as a non-voting member of the executive committee. That the defendant No.3 treating herself as General Secretary took steps for shifting the office of the samity to her own residence without the permission of the donors association which was also illegal. That the defendant No.l as the president of that illegal committee issued a letter on 03.03.1992 suspending the plaintiff and thereafter issued a show cause notice on AD # 9 (Forma No. 2.03.1993 for her dismissal on some false allegations, That the said notice was illegal as the defendant No.l had no authority to issue such show cause notice upon the plaintiff. That' the previous committee wherein the plaintiff was General Secretary was still in existence as per law and the defendant did not have any right to amend the constitution of the association. That the formation, activities and the orders passed by that illegal committee were all illegal and as such the plaintiff filed the suit for declaration that she was still the General Secretary of the committee and also for mandatory injunction for her reinstatement to her previous office.<br/><br/>The defendant No. l and 3 contested the suit by filing written statement denying all the allegations made in the plaint. The material case of these contesting defendants was that Banachhaya Mohila Kallayan Samity was registered under Voluntary Social Welfare Agencies (Registration and Control Ordinance) 1961 (Ordinance No.XLVI of 1961) in the year 1989. That as per section 9 of that Ordinance No.XLVI of' 1961, the executive committee of any organization could be suspended and an ad-hoc committee could be formed and as per section 9(3) of the said ordinance the said ad-hoc committee would have power to run the organization. That since four members of the previous committee of Banachhaya Mohila Kallayan Samity resigned and the plaintiff was removed from the post of General Secretary for the mismanagement created by her in the samity an ad-hoc committee was formed and this ad-hoc committee held election on 28.11.1992 and the new executive committee was formed on 30.11.1992 with six members. Thereafter on 28.02.1992 this executive committee held its first meeting wherein the plaintiff was present. That plaintiff's son Kamrul Islam as the project co-ordinator of W.D.P. project obtained salary as well as house rent from the fund of the samity which was illegal. That the newly formed committee obtained a number of allegations against the plaintiff and accordingly a meeting was held on 28.02.1993 and a decision was taken to take action against the plaintiff and accordingly a show cause notice was issued against her and since her reply was not satisfactory the plaintiff was suspended from the office of the sarnity on 03.03.1999. Thereafter a show cause notice was served upon the plaintiff on 07.03.1993 and an enquiiy was held into allegations against the plaintiff and considering the report of the enquiry committee together with the unsatisfactory reply of the plaintiff, she was finally dismissed on 01.06.1993. That the suit was filed on false allegations and as such was liable to be dismissed with cost.<br/><br/>The trial court decreed the suit by the judgment and order dated 30.06.1996. The appellate court affirmed that judgment and decree of the trial court.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved the contesting defenda-nts preferred the above mentioned Civil Revision No.2944 of 2006 before the High Court Division and obtained rule. A Single Bench of the High Court Division, after hearing both the parties, discharged that rule holding that though under section 9 of Voluntary Socia Welfare Agencies (Registration and Control Ordinance), 1961 registration   authority has got power to suspend the governing body and to form an ad-hoc committee of any such org organization but in the present case there was no circumstances as mentioned in this section 9 of this Ordinance of 1961   prevails; for suspending the governing body of the samitv and for forming an ad-hoc committee and as such the suspension of the governing body of the samity and the formation of the .ad-hoc committee was illegal and consequently all the activities of this newly formed illegal committee of the samity including removal of the plaintiff from the samitv were illegal.<br/><br/>Mrs. Sigma Hilda, the learned advocate M for the petitioner has made submissions to. the effect that since the previous commit of the samity failed to run the affair of the samity and there occurred serious mismanagement in the functions of the samity, the registration authority rightly suspended that committed and formed the ad-hoc committee in accordance with the provision of Vohmtorv Social Wei fan-Agencies (Registration and Control) Ordinance, 1961; that the registration authority was very much empowered to suspend the executive committee of the samity and to form ad-hoc committee under that provision of law and that for the greater interest of the organization and the beneficiaries, registration authority rightly suspended the executive committee and rightly formed  per provision of law .the learned council has contended that the High Court Division as well as the courts below have committed serious error of law and without considering the legal aspects and without assessing the evidence on record properly: the learned advocate has argued to the effects also that if the impugned judgments of the courts below are allowed to stand this Banachhaha Mohila Kallayan Samity will be prejudiced seriously and the very existence of samity will be at stake. <br/><br/>Mr. Qumrul Haque Siddique, the learned advocate for the respondents has made submissions supporting the impugned judgment.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned advocates of both the sides and gone through the impugned judgment of the High Court Division as well as those of the courts below.<br/><br/>It appears that all the three courts, on proper consideration of the facts, circumstances and evidence on record and also examining the relevant law held the concurrent view that none of the circumstances and conditions stated in section   9   of Voluntary   Social   Welfare Agencies    (Registration    and Control) Ordinance, 1961 was prevailing and in that circumstances the registration authority had no power to dissolve the existing governing body of the samity and to form an ad-hoc committee and as such the formation of ad-hoc committee and the subsequent election of the governing body held by that ad-hoc committee   and   also    the    said   elected governing body of the samity were all illegal and, therefore, all the activities of that ad-hoc committee and the elected committee were illegal.<br/><br/>Considering the facts and circumstances and evidence on record we find no error in these concurrent findings of all the three courts below.<br/><br/>So, we find no merit in this leave petition and hence it is dismissed.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

This kind of change by imposing additional charge on the spectrum of 2008 may be done only after complying with the provisions of notice as mandated by sub-section (2) of Section 39. Thus, without going into the dispute as to whether the Guideline in question has been issued either under Sections  38, 39, 34 (N) or 55(3), it is held that under any circumstances when the terms and conditions of an existing license are to be amended, substituted, changed or cancelled, the same can only be done after issuing 15 days notice upon the licencee seeking written statement from it and after considering such written statement of the licnecee regarding the proposed amendments. It appears that the earlier amendment of 2006 to the terms and conditions of the licence regarding charges was done through a lengthy discussions and negotiations between the parties, and finally, the amendment order was issued under Section 39 (before amendment) as an agreed amendment order. However, in the instant case, when the said additional charge through MCF was incorporated in the Guideline seeking to amend  the terms and conditions of the licence in so far as it relates to the assignment of spectrum of 2008, there was no existence of such notice, negotiation or agreement between the parties. The MCF, as incorporated in the Guideline dated 11.09.2011, cannot lawfully be applied on the spectrum of 2008 as it would change the terms and conditions of the licence. In addition, when by specific provisions under Clause-9 of the Guideline the Government and the BTRC exempted the application of the enhanced rate of spectrum fee in respect of the spectrum of 2008, they acted arbitrarily when BTRC sought to apply the MCF through the impugned memo in respect of the same spectrum, which, in our view, suffers from unreasonableness. Thus, the impugned memo, in so far as it relates to the application of MCF in respect of the spectrum of 7.4 in 1800 MH<sub>Z</sub> assigned in 2008, is without lawful authority and is of no legal effect. Consequently, the Grameen Phone is not required to pay the same.</strong><strong>...(27 to 29). </strong><br/><br/><strong>Value Added Tax Act (of 1991)</strong><br/><strong>Section 6(3)(N),(4),(4LL)</strong><br/><strong>Value Added Tax Rules, 1991</strong><br/><strong>Rule 18(L) to (P)</strong><br/><strong>There is no illegality in the impugned memo in so far as the issue of Vat is concerned. Thus, by using the words “without any deduction”, or previously “excluding Vat and tax”, in the Guideline or in the impugned memo, there is no departure from the above mentioned provisions of law. Rather, under the new dispensation for payment of Vat at source, BTRC must write the words “without any deduction” or “excluding Vat and Tax” etc. to make it compliant with the provisions of sub-sections (3)(N), (4), (4LL) and other relevant provisions of Section 6 of the VAT Act, 1991 and Rules 18 (L) to (P) of the VAT  Rules, 1991....(39).</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>After examining the arbitration clause under clause-9 of the Licence Agreement vide Revalidation order dated 24.10.2004, it appears that the arbitrators are also able to resolve the disputes regarding the interpretation of the Agreement.

Pursuant to the said agreement and some subsequent addenda to the same, Grameen Phone was given licences for Radio Stations &amp; Equipment and Radio System Operation on 28.11.1996 for 15 years with yearly licence fee of taka one crore. Thus, 10.11.2011 was the due date for renewal of the said licences. Subsequently, upon enactment of Bangladesh Telecommunic-ation Act, 2001 (“the Telecom Act”), the said licences were revalidated by the newly consti-tuted Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulat-ory Commission (BTRC), a statutory body, in view of the provisions under Sections 89 and 90 of the Telecom Act. Accordingly, BTRC issued Revalidation Order on 24.10.2004 declaring that the said licences along with its subsequent amendments  would continue and remain valid until 10.11.2011 as part of the said licences within the meaning  of Section 90 (3)(Ka) of the Telecom Act. Through such revalidation and amendments, licence fees and other charges were increased time to time. During above period, the Government and the BTRC assigned the following spectrums  in favour of the Grameen Phone:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">5 MHz spectrum in 900 band in 1996.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">2.4 MHz in 900 band initially for Dhaka in 2000 and subsequently in 2002 for the whole country.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">7.2 MHz in 1800 band in 2005. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In 2008, BTRC assigned further spectrum in favour of the Grameen Phone  totalling 7.4 MHz in 1800 band. Thereafter, when the renewal time of the licences approached, BTRC assigned more spectrums, namely 7.4 MHz in 900 band and 7.2 MHz in 1800 band both in 2011. The assignment of Spectrum in 2008 was for 18 years, and BTRC vide its Assignment Letter dated 30.10.2008 assured that if the licence was to be renewed within the said 18 years’ period, Grameen Phone would not have to pay any additional charge for the same. As the renewal time approached, BTRC issued Guideline on 11.09.2011 determining procedures and fees for renewal of licences by the mobile cellular operators like the Grameen Phone. By this Guideline, it introduced, amongst others, the Market Competition Factor (MCF), a new charge applicable to all mobile cellular operators including the Grameen Phone depending on the quantum of their market-share, and, accordingly, fixed 1.48 as MCF for the Grameen Phone. However, as the BTRC by the impugned memo dated 17.10.2011 demanded, amongst others, the said MCF on the 7.4 MHz spectrum assigned to the Grameen Phone in 2008, the dispute arose between the parties as the Grameen Phone refused to pay the same. By the impugned Memo, BTRC further demanded the renewal and new spectrum fees without any deduction, meaning without deduction of VAT, which, according  to the Grameen Phone , is against the provisions of Value Added Tax Act, 1991 and the Rules made thereunder. Being aggrieved by the above demands in the impugned memo, the Grameen Phone, as petitioner, moved this Court and obtained the aforesaid Rule.<br/> <br/>The Rule Nisi is mainly contested by the BTRC by filing affidavit-in-opposition and su-pplementary affidavit-in-opposition. Grameen Phone also submitted several supplementary affidavits. Notice of the Rule Nisi was served on the National Board of Revenue (NBR), the added respondent No. 8, yet no one turns up either to represent it or to contest the Rule.<br/><br/><strong><u>Contentious Scenario:</u></strong><br/><br/>The main contention of the Grameen Phone is that although the BTRC may introduce MCF by the Guideline, yet the same can not be applied to its spectrum of 7.4 MHz assigned in 2008 in view of the clear terms &amp; conditions of the said assignment that at the time of renewal of the licence no additional charge would be applicable for the same. According to them the application of 1.48 MCF in respect of the said assignment of 2008 not only breaches the contract between the parties but is also contrary to the provisions of law applicable thereto. Their further contention in respect of the words—“without any deduction”—as used in the impugned memo is that by those words the BTRC illegally claimed  the amount mentioned in the impugned memo without any deduction of VAT therefrom, which is contrary to the provisions of VAT Act, 1991 and Rules made thereunder. According to them, the VAT amount at the rate of 15% is to be deducted from the amount mentioned in the impugned memo (except for the MCF for 2008 assignment) as this is the mandate of Rule 18(P) of the VAT Rules, 1991.<br/> <br/>BTRC, on the other hand, contends that the Guidelines having been issued in exercise of the statutory powers conferred on it and the Government under the provisions of the Telecom Act, it has legal force and as such it will prevail even if it is in conflict with any terms of the contract between the parties. In respect of VAT, BTRC’s contention is that the issue and arguments raised by the Grameen Phone in respect of the deduction of VAT at source goes against the basic concept of VAT as introduced by the VAT Act, 1991. According to them, it is the mandate of the law that the Value Added Tax is always added to the total consideration amount and it is never deducted form the same like advance income tax or other taxes.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Submissions and Arguments:</u></strong><br/><br/>Mr. Rafiqul Haq, Mr. Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh and Mr. Md. Mehedi Hasan Chowdhury, learned advocates, appear for the petitioner Grameen Phone. On the other hand, Mr. Azmal Hossain Q.C, Mr. Khandaker Reza-E-Raquib and Mr. Imranul Kabir, learned advocates, appear for the BTRC. None appears for the NBR.<br/> <br/>Mr. Rafiqul Haq, learned senior counsel appearing for the Grameen Phone mainly argues on the vatability of the service or facility provided by the BTRC through licence. On MCF issue, however, Mr. Haq supports the submissions of Mr. Taposh and Mr. Mehedi. Mr. Haque submits that the license in question is not a service within the meaning of the Value Added Tax Act, 1991 (“VAT Act”), rather it is  permission and as such not vatable at all.  Referring to Section 2(Q) of the VAT Act and 2<sup>nd</sup> Schedule to the same, Mr. Haq submits that the licence as provided by the BTRC comes under Article-7 (O) of the said Schedule and as such it is excluded from the scope of vatability by the clear terms of Section 2(R) of the VAT Act, and accordingly, the licence or any other facility as provided by the BTRC in favour of the Grameen Phone is not vatable. Referring to Section 21(4) of the Telecom Act, 2001, Mr. Haq points out that since the amounts receivable by the BTRC are to be deposited  in the Consolidated Fund of the State, the licence fee, renewal of licence fee or spectrum fee etc. should be regarded as being excluded from the scope of Vat. Alternatively, he argues that, even if it is found that the licnece provided by the BTRC  is vatable, then, supporting the arguments of Mr. Taposh and Mr. Mehedi, he submits that  the Vat payable should be deducted from the amount claimed by the BTRC by the impugned memo and paid directly to the NBR in view of Rule-18(Uma) of the Value Added Tax Rules-1991(“VAT Rules”).<br/> <br/>Both Mr. Taposh and Mr. Mehedi strenuously argue on the MCF issue. They submit that while assigning the spectrum in 2008, the BTRC, in clear terms, stipulated that their would be no additional charges for the said assignment at the time of renewal of the licence. Therefore, they argue, the application of MCF in respect of the spectrum granted in 2008 is without lawful authority. According to them Grameen Phone has no objection to pay Tk. 150 Crore spectrum fee for new assignments as mentioned in the Table of the impugned memo under Columns-A and B. Grameen Phone also does not have objection to pay MCF in respect of the said new assignments of spectrum. But it should not be compelled to pay the MCF in respect of the previous assignment of 7.4 spectrum in 1800 MHz band as assigned to it in 2008. Referring to Clause-1 of the Assignment Letter dated 30.10.2008, they point out that this Clause clearly stipulates that during the 18 years period of the said assignment if the license is required to be renewed there will be no additional charges for  the said assignment.  Referring to clause-2  of the said Assignment Letter, learned advocates submit that only if the Grameen Phone wants to utilize the frequency for 3G, LTE or equivalent technology services, the terms and conditions as regards the payment of charges may be changed. Drawing our attention to Clause-9 of the Guideline, learned advocates submit that the Guideline is contradictory to itself in that while the Guideline accepted the non-application of enhanced assignment fee in respect of the spectrum assigned in 2008 and kept it Tk. 80 crores as before, by saying “other provisions of this guideline shall be applicable for respective licensees”, the Guideline sought to apply MCF in respect of the said assignment of 2008, which, according to them, is not only contrary to Clause-1 of the Assignment Letter but also is in violation of the mandatory provisions of Sections 38 and 39 of the Telecom Act  as it changes the terms and conditions of the licence. Learned advocates point out that the Grameen Phone is only liable to pay, after deduction of Vat, on the basis of the following calculations, namely [(A x B) + (C X D)] X G + (E X F) in Table of the impugned memo, and they are not lawfully required to pay (E X F) X G,  which is more than Tk. 236 crore.<br/> <br/>As regards Vat, Mr. Taposh and Mr. Mehedi submit that with the introduction of the system of deduction of Vat  at source by the Finance Act, 2010 followed by the amendments in the VAT Act and VAT Rules, it has now become the responsibility of the service or facility recipient like the Grameen Phone to pay the Vat at source, and that Vat, according to them, will have to be paid after deducting the Vat amount from the amount receivable by the BTRC. Referring to Sections 3(3)(Ga), 5, 6 and Rules 18 (L-P), learned advocates argue that according to those provisions ‘deduction at source’ (Ev­p LaÑe) means deduction from the total receivable but not deduction from the receivable after adding Vat to it as contended by the BTRC.<br/> <br/>Mr. Azmal Hossain Q.C., on the other hand, frankly concedes that the BTRC cannot claim MCF for the period from 2008 to 2011 as it will be amounting to giving retrospective effect to the Guideline which is not permitted by law. However, according to him, BTRC can claim MCF for the remaining 15 years period in respect of the assignment of 2008 as the same was given for 18 years. Mr. Hossain argues that the Guideline have been issued in exercise of the statutory powers conferred on the BTRC and the Government under Sections 38 and 39 read with Section 55(3) of the Telecom Act,  and as such, to change the terms and conditions of the assignment of spectrum relating to its fees and charges, no notice is required to be served on the licencees under section 39 of the said Act. Referring to Clause-1 of the Assignment Letter dated 30.08.2008, leaned advocate points out that the additional charges mentioned therein relate to the spectrum fee of Tk. 80 crore and it does not have any nexus with the MCF. He argues that since the spectrum fee of Tk. 80 crore for the said 2008 spectrum has not been increased, BTRC has not even violated any terms of the said Assignment Letter.<br/> <br/>As regards Vat, Mr. Hossain, submits that the Vat scheme under the VAT Act made different persons liable for collection and deposit of vat at different stages of transactions.  Therefore, liability to pay Vat and responsibility to collect and deposit the same may be required to be done by different reasons.  Referring to the definition of  ‘Ll­k¡NÉ ®ph¡’ (taxable service)  and ‘Ll’  (tax) as defined by Sections 2 (Chhaa)) and 2 (Gha Gha Gha) respectively, he submits that there is no scope to hold otherwise than that the service (­ph¡) or facility |(p¤¢hd¡) as provided by the BTRC though licences in exchange for licence fees and other charges is not included in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Schedule to the VAT Act. Therefore, the service or p¤¢hd¡ as provided by the BTRC through license or permit are vatable.  Drawing our attention to the provisions of Section 3(5) and definition of ‘fZ’ (consideration) as given by Section 2 (Z Z),  Mr. Hossain submits that the basic scheme of the VAT Act  is that the Vat is calculated at the rate of 15% on the total value receivable. Therefore, according to him, Vat is always added to the total value receivable, and, under no circumstances, it can be deducted or subtracted from the total value as suggested by the learned advocates for the petitioner. Therefore, he argues, to comply with the basic scheme of the VAT Act and VAT Rules made thereunder, BTRC lawfully motioned the words ‘without any deduction’ in the impugned memo, which means the demanded money has to be paid as it is, and, while calculating Vat to pay the same at source, the petitioner will have to add to it 15% of the total demanded amount as Vat, withhold  the same and deposit it in the exchequer directly, otherwise it will go against the basic concept of Vat.<br/> <br/>In addition to the above submissions, Mr. Hossain raises the issue of maintainability of the writ petition itself on the ground that since there is an Arbitration Clause in the revalidated licence agreement of 2004 and even in the original agreement of 1996, the writ petition is not maintainable as the petitioner has come before this court without availing of the alternative remedy as agreed by the parties and provided by the law, namely the Arbitration Act, 2001.  He submits that even the Arbitration Tribunal or Arbitrators may give interpretation of law if they are required to do so in disposing of the disputes between the parties. Mr. Hossain further argues that the contract between the BTRC and Grameen Phone is an ordinary commercial contract, and as such, in view of the law as decided by our Apex Court in Sharping Fishery case reported in 39 DLR (AD)-85, writ should be held to be not maintainable.     <br/> <br/>Heard the submissions of the learned advocates, perused the writ petition, supplementary affidavits and affidavit-in-opposition submitted by the respective parties. Since the disputes between the parties revolve around two main issues, namely Market Competition Factor (MCF) and VAT, they are addressed below separately. In addition, the maintainability of the writ petition will also be dealt with in due course.<br/><br/><strong><u>Dispute relating to MCF :</u></strong><br/><br/>The admitted position is that pursuant to the agreement of 1996 and several subsequent amendments thereto, the Government and the BTRC have so far assigned different spectrums in favour of the Grameen Phone at several stages, namely:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">In 1996- 5 MHz spectrum in 900 band;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In 2000- 2.4 MHz in 900 band initially for Dhaka City and in 2002- permission for using the same in the entire country;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In 2005-7.2 MHz in 1800 band;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In 2008-7.4 MHz in 1800 band; and two new assignments in 2011, namely</li><li style="text-align: justify;">7.4 MHz in 900 band;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">7.2 MHz in 1800 band;</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">According to the said agreement, the Grameen Phone is required to get the licences renewed after 15 years, namely at the end of 2011, when last two assignments of spectrums were given.<br/> <br/>After granting of licenses in 1996, several amendments to the said licences were made, the major being the ones done in 2004 upon enactment of the Bangladesh Tele Communication Act, 2001. As the licences were originally issued by the Government under the provisions of the Telegraph Act, 1885, with the establishment of the BTRC, a statutory body, under the Telecom Act, BTRC issued a Revalidation Order on 24.10.2004 (Annexure-D to the writ petition). By the said Revalidation Order, the licences previously issued were revalidated as being licences issued under the Telecom Act  in view of its Section 90 (3) (L). The Revalidation Order further confirmed that the licences issued in 1996 would remain valid till 10.11.2011 and all subsequent  amendments would be deemed to be part of those licences. Accordingly, new Licence Agreement was executed between the parties, which became part of the original licence. Some new fees and charges were introduced and additional spectrums were allotted. By Clause-14 of the new Licence Agreement, optimal use of frequency was ensured, whereas Clause-9 incorporated Arbitration clause. In 2006, another major amendment to the licence took place vide memo dated 16.04.2006 (Annexure-E), and terms and conditions of the license were amended by the BTRC under Section 39 of the Telecom Act. By such amendments, annual licence fee was increased to Tk. five crore with effect from 01.07.2005, 5.5% revenue sharing was introduced on all collected rents and call charges etc. to be payable on quarterly basis. In 2006, namely on 27.04.2006, further Revalidation Order was issued revalidating the radio system operating licence vide annexures-F and F1 to the writ petition.<br/> <br/>In 2008, BTRC granted the disputed spectrum of 7.4 band in 1800 MHz vide Assignment Letter dated 30.10.02008 (Annexure-G). Prior to this assignment, there were correspondences between the parties, and terms and conditions of the said assignment were determined through such correspondences and negotiations. One of such correspondences is a letter written by one Anamika Vakto, Senior Assistant Director of Spectrum Management of the BTRC, who by letter dated 30.09.2008 confirmed the terms and conditions of the said assignment. The parties having agreed to such terms and conditions, BTRC issued Assignm-ent Letter dated 30.10.2008. The reference to the said letter of Anamika Vakto has been made by the petitioner in paragraph 12 of the writ petition, but the BTRC did not deny the same, rather in paragraph-7 of the Affidavit-in-Opposition merely mentioned that they ware matters of record. Therefore, although the said letter dated 30.09.2008 is not annexed to the writ petition, we may safely hold that the background negotiations leading to the issuance of the said Assignment Letter dated 30.10.2008 is an admitted fact and the said assignment in 2008 was not granted unilaterally. Rather, it was granted on the basis of prior negotiations between the parties. <br/> <br/>Since several terms of the said Assignment Letter dated 30.10.2008 are disputed and interpreted by the parties according to their own convenience, a decision on the same is needed. The relevant terms and conditions mentioned in the said Assignment Letter are quoted below:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><em><u>“Terms and Conditions:</u></em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>The assignment will be for 18 years from the date of assignment subject to the renewal of the license. <u>Within 18 years if the licence is renewed there will not be any additional charge for this particular assignment</u> for current technology (GSM, GPRS and EDGE).</em></li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>The licencees will be allowed to provide services with this spectrum according to the conditions of the cellular mobile license. However, <u>to utilize the frequency for 3G, LTE or equivalent technology based services the licensee</u> will be required to take permission from the Commission. <u>In such cases conditions and terms may be varied as deemed necessary by the Commission</u>.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>…………………………………………………………….</em></li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>…………………………………………………………….</em></li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>The Commission reserves the right to make any change in the charges or levies from time to time and the Licencee shall abide by the decision of the Commission.”</em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>(Underlines supplied)      </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Thus, it appears that the assignment of spectrum in 2008 was given for 18 years. Clause-1 of the Assignment Letter stipulates that if the licence is required to be renewed during this 18 years’ period, no additional charge will be applicable for this particular assignment “for current technology (GSM, GPRS and EDGE)”. It is no bodies case that Grameen Phone is not using the current technology. Clause-2 of the said Terms and Conditions further stipulates that if the Grameen Phone wants to utilize the frequency of 3G, LTE or equivalent technology, then the terms and conditions of this assignment may be varied. However, Clause-5 has conferred a general power on the BTRC. According to this Clause, BTRC reserves the right to make any change in the charges or levies from time to time and that the Grameen Phone shall abide by such decision of the BTRC. It appears from the above reading that there is an apparent tension between Clause-1 and Clause-5, which needs decision of this court in so far as the MCF-dispute is concerned.<br/> <br/>The Assignment Letter dated 30.10.2008 starts with the words “BTRC has been pleased to assign you the following frequency <u>for providing service under your Cellular Mobile Operator Licence</u> with the following terms and conditions”. Therefore, it is clear that the assignment of the spectrum in 2008 was given under the original licence of 1996 and as such there is no doubt that any change in the terms and conditions of this assignment will affect the terms and conditions of the licence itself. In other words, any change in the terms and conditions of the said assignment tantamounts to the change in the terms and conditions of the licence itself.<br/> <br/>By Clause-1 of the said Assignment Letter, the parties agreed that the assignment was given for 18 years and that if the original licence was required to be renewed during this 18 years’ period (parties already knew that the renewal of license would be required in 2011), there would be no additional charge for this particular assignment. Clause-2 further clarifies that the terms and conditions of the said assignment may be varied only when the Grameen Phone wants to utilize frequency for 3G, LTE or equivalent technology services. Therefore, we are of the view that the terms and conditions relating to the enhancement of charges applicable to this particular assignment have been fixed by the parties in clear terms. The problem arose when BTRC issued Guideline on 11.09.2011 (Annexure-H) under the title “Cellular Mobile Phone Operator Regulatory and Licencing Guideline, 2011”, (“the Guideline”), after the same having been approved by the Government on 07.09.2011. By the said Guideline, new fees have been introduced as license renewal fee, new assignment fee etc. By Clause-8.01 (ii), new spectrum assignment fee of Tk. 150 crore per MHz has been fixed. By the same Clause, new fee or charges named ‘Market Competition   Factors (MCF)’ based on market share of the operators has been introduced and Grameen Phone’s MCF has been fixed as 1.48.  Clause-9, however, made a distinction in respect of the applicability of the new charges and fees in respect of the said assignment of 2008. Clause-9.01 is quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“9.01 The spectrum assignment fees shall be applicable for all of the access frequencies assigned to the licensees <u>except for the 7.4 MHz</u>, 2 MH<sub>Z</sub> and 2.6 MHz <u>spectrum assigned in the year 2008 in favour of Grameen Phone</u>, AXIATA and Orascom respectively with a value of Tk. 80 (eighty) crore per MHz uplink and downlink for 18(eighteen) Years from the date of assignment subject to the renewal of the license. <u>However, other provisions of these guidelines shall be applicable for the respective licensee(s)</u>.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>(Underlines supplied)</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears from the above Clause that while increasing the spectrum assignment fee to Tk. 150 crore, the spectrum fee of 2008 assignment was not increased. However, by mentioning “other provisions of this guidelines shall be applicable for the respective licencee (s)”, this Clause has sought to make MCF of 1.48 applicable to the said assignment of 2008. As we have stated hereinabove that the terms and conditions of the said Assignment Letter dated 30.10.2008 have become parts of the licence, we are of the view that any change to the said terms and conditions will amount to a change in the terms and conditions of the original licence itself. Let us now examine to what extent and how the said terms and conditions of licence may be changed under the provisions of the applicable law.<br/> <br/>The Telecom Act has undergone major changes through the amendments in 2010 vide Act No. 41 of 2010. Some powers of the BTRC have been transferred to the Government in addition to the other existing powers of the Government. Before the above amendments, the power to issue Guideline regarding different charges was vested in the BTRC under section 31(2) (R). But after amendments, only the Government can issue such Guideline under section 34 (Ga). In addition, under the amended provisions of Section 38, the Government may determine procedure and fees for renewal of licence in absence of Rules and Regulations in this regard. This section has confined the power of the Government  only in respect of the determination of procedure for renewal and renewal fees. However, while approving the Guideline in question vide Memo dated 07.09.2011 (Annexure-W to the Supplementary Affidavit dated 29.11.2011 filed by the petitioner), the Government gave coverage of the same under Section 38 by giving a direction upon the BTRC to implement the said Guideline.<br/> <br/>Be that as it may, so far as the amendments to the terms and conditions of the licence are concerned, the amended provisions of Section 39 of the Telecom Act contains specific procedure. For ready reference, Sections 38 and 39, as amended, are quoted below:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<strong>৩৮। লাইসেন্স নবায়ন-</strong> এই অধ্যায়ের অধীন ইস্যুকৃত লাইসেন্স বিধি বা প্রবিধান দ্বারা নির্ধারিত পদ্ধতিতে ও ফিস প্রদান সাপেক্ষে নবায়নযোগ্য হইবে, এবং বিধি বা প্রবিধানের অবর্তমানে সরকার সাধারন বা বিশেষ  আদেশ দ্বারা ঐ সকল বিষয় নির্ধারণ করিতে পারিবে।<br/><strong>৩৯। লাইসেন্সের শর্তাবলী সংশোধন-</strong> (১) কমিশন, সরকারের পূর্বানুমোদনক্রমে, এই আইনের উদ্দেশ্য   পূরণকল্পে, তদধীন ইস্যুকৃত লাইসেন্সের <u>যে কোন শর্ত এই আইন বা বিধি অনুসারে</u> সংশোধন, সংযোজন, প্রতিসহাপন, বা বাতিল করিতে পারিবে।<br/>(২) সরকার, লাইসেন্সের কোন শর্ত সংশোধনের প্রয়োজন মনে করিলে, কমিশনকে উক্ত সংশোধন করিবার জন্য নির্দেশ প্রদান করিতে পারিবে এবং কমিশন সরকারের নির্দেশ মোতাবেক, <u>উক্তরুপ সংশোধনের কারণ উল্লেখপূর্বক লাইসেন্সেধারীকে উক্তরুপ সংশোধনের বিষয়ে অনধিক ১৫ (পনের) দিনের মধ্যে লিখিতভাবে বক্তব্য উপসহাপনের সুযোগ প্রদানক্রমে একটি নোটিশ প্রদান করিবে;</u> প্রস্তাবিত সংশোধনী সম্পর্কে লাইসেন্সধারীর কোন লিখিত বক্তব্য থাকিলে উহা কমিশনের মাধ্যমে সরকারের নিকট পেশ করিতে হইবে এবং সরকার উহা বিবেচনাএ্রমে অনধিক ৩০ (এিশ) দিনের মধ্যে সিদ্ধান্ত প্রদান করিবে।<br/>(৩) লাইসেন্সধারীর  কোন আবেদনের পরিপ্রেক্ষিতে যুও্রসংগত মনে করিলে সরকার কমিশনকে লাইসেন্সের কোন শর্ত সংশোধন করিবার নির্দেশ প্রদান করিতে পারিবে এবং কমিশন তদনুযায়ী প্রয়োজনীয় ব্যবসহা গ্রহন করিবে।"<br/>(Underlines supplied)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears from the above provisions that under Section 38, the Government may determine procedure and fees for renewal of licnence in the absence of any Rules or Regulations in this regard. On the other hand, under Section 39(1), the BTRC may amend or cancel the terms and conditions of Lincence in accordance with the provisions of the Telecom Act or Rules made thereunder. Admittedly no Rules or Regulations in this regard have been framed/issued by the concerned authority. Sub-section (2) of Section 39, however, provides that if the Government is of the view that any conditions of the licence has to be amended, it may direct the BTRC to do such amendment, whereupon the BTRC shall issue 15 (fifteen) days notice upon the licencee seeking its written statement regarding the proposed amendments. Thereafter, BTRC will forward the said written statement, if any, to the Government, whereupon the Government will give its decision within 30 days. Again, under Section 39(3), the conditions of license may also be amended at the instance of the licensee on the basis of its application to the Government followed by a direction of the Government to the BTRC. Therefore, the combined reading of sub-sections (1), (2) &amp; (3) of Section-39 reveal that, in the absence of any Rules or Regulations in this regard, any conditions of licence may be amended, changed or cancelled only in accordance with the procedure of sub-section (2) of Section-39. This means, the Government may do amendments to the conditions of licence through the BTRC and such amendments may be brought about only after seeking written statement from the Licencee and after consideration of such written statement, if any.<br/> <br/>In the instant matter, the Guideline dated 11.09.2011 incorporated an additional charge as Market Competition Factor (MCF) under Clause-8.01 (ii), and the same has been applied to the spectrum of 2008 by the impugned memo thereby changing the terms and conditions of licence.  We are of the view that this kind of change by imposing additional charge on the spectrum of 2008 may be done only after complying with the provisions of notice as mandated by sub-section (2) of Section 39. Thus, without going into the dispute as to whether the Guideline in question has been issued either under Sections  38, 39, 34 (N) or 55(3), we hold that under any circumstances when the terms and conditions of an existing license are to be amended, substituted, changed or cancelled, the same can only be done after issuing 15 days notice upon the licencee seeking written statement from it and after considering such written statement of the licnecee regarding the proposed amendments. It is evident from record that the BTRC followed the same procedure in the past while increasing different charges in 2006 by amendment dated 16.04.2006 (Annexure-E), which starts with the following words:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“Whereas, in view of the submission representation made by the cellular mobile operators that payment of Royalty and licence fees on handsets was not a workable proposition/arrangement and <u>the consequent discussion of the BTRC with the cellular mobile operators over a period of time it was agreed that</u> the fees and charges as are fixed in this amendment will have to be paid by each of the cellular mobile operators ...............”   </em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>(Underlines supplied)</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears from the above quoted statement that the earlier amendment of 2006 to the terms and conditions of the licence regarding charges was done through a lengthy discussions and negotiations between the parties, and finally, the amendment order was issued under Section 39 (before amendment) as an agreed amendm-ent order. However, in the instant case, when the said additional charge through MCF was incorporated in the Guideline seeking to amend  the terms and conditions of the licence in so far as it relates to the assignment of spectrum of 2008, there was no existence of such notice, negotiation or agreement between the parties. When the  learned advocate for the BTRC was confronted with this point, they also confirmed that no such specific negotiation took place in respect of the application of MCF on the spectrum of 2008 and no notice as such was issued seeking written statement from the Grameen Phone. This being the particular facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the MCF, as incorporated in the Guideline dated 11.09.2011, cannot lawfully be applied on the spectrum of 2008 as it would change the terms and conditions of the licence.<br/> <br/>In addition, when by specific provisions under Clause-9 of the Guideline the Government and the BTRC exempted the application of the enhanced rate of spectrum fee in respect of the spectrum of 2008, they acted arbitrarily when BTRC sought to apply the MCF through the impugned memo in respect of the same spectrum, which, in our view, suffers from unreasonableness. Thus, we find substance in the submissions of Mr. Taposh and Mr. Mehedi. This being so, we hold that the impugned memo, in so far as it relates to the application of MCF in respect of the spectrum of 7.4 in 1800 MH<sub>Z</sub> assigned in 2008, is without lawful authority and is of no legal effect. Consequently, the Grameen Phone is not required to pay the same.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Dispute relating to VAT deduction:</u></strong><br/><br/>Since the issue of vatablity of services or facility provided by the BTRC through licence, spectrum etc. is not covered by the terms of the issued by this court, the National Board of Revenue (NBR), the main stakeholder on this issue, was not asked to give reply on the same. Considering this aspect,  we are of the view that the issue of vatability as raised by Mr. Haq may be examined in a proper case upon a proper Rule Nisi in this regard. Since the Grameen Phone challenged the impugned memo only for the reason that the BTRC demanded the amount ‘without any deduction’, meaning without deduction of Vat therefrom, we will confine ourselves to the terms of the Rule.<br/> <br/>The dispute involving Vat goes to the very root of the scheme of VAT. According to the Grameen Phone, on the total receivable claim of Tk. 100, they will deduct Tk. 15 as VAT and give BTRC Tk. 85, and after such deduction, will pay the said Tk. 15 directly to the Government exchequer as VAT at source in view of Rule 18 (Uma) of the VAT Rules, 1991.<br/> <br/>Value added tax has not been defined in the VAT Act, 1991 or Rules made thereunder. Section 3 of the VAT Act provides, amongst other,  that 15% Vat will be payable on all services in Bangladesh on the basis of the value mentioned in Section 5. Section 5 (4) provides that in case of proving service, the value added tax will be charged on the total receivables ("phÑ­j¡V fË¡¢çl Efl"). If we read these two provisions together along with the definition of the term ‘fZ’ (consideration) as defined by Section 2 (Z Z) (which defines ‘fZ’ as the total money or value received or receivable as against the services provided), we may conclude that VAT is always assessed or calculated on the basis of the total value receivable or received. This means, if a person sells something for Tk. 100, the Vat amount in view of Section 3 will be 15%, and that 15% Vat, in view of Section 5, has to be calculated on Tk. 100 and be added to the said Tk. 100 making the purchaser to pay in total Tk. 115 to the seller. The seller then deposit the Vat of Tk. 15 in the exchequer. Upon reading of the relevant provisions, namely Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the VAT Act, 1991, there cannot be any other concept of value added tax.<br/> <br/>There are several methods of calculation of value added tax. As for examples, Section 5(2) provides for ‘direct subtraction method’ and Section 5(4) provides for ‘indirect subtraction method’. In practice, to avoid the complicacies involving the calculation and to avoid evasion of payment of Vat, the ‘indirect subtraction method’ is the most used one. Under this method, at every stage of transaction 15% vat is added and paid by the purchaser of goods or recipient of services. When the purchaser again sells the said goods or service either as whole-seller or retailer to another purchaser or consumer, the first purchaser gets credit for the said 15% vat already paid from the vat to be paid by the 2<sup>nd</sup> purchaser and 2<sup>nd</sup> purchaser gets credit for the Vat he paid from the 3<sup>rd</sup> purchaser in the chain. Ultimately, the vat is paid by the consumer or final recipient of the service. This is why the value added tax is called ‘consumer tax’, as it is the consumer who ultimately pays the Vat. The people or person in the middle like the whole-seller or retailer, although pay Vat, but get the same credited or adjusted from the final vat paid by the consumer. Thus, the ultimate burden is on the consumer.<br/> <br/>Generally, the vat is collected and deposited by the seller or service provider or facility provider upon collecting the same from the purchaser or service recipient or facility recipient. This is the general mandate under sub-section (3) (N) of Section 3 of the VAT Act. But the general system has undergone major change through the Finance Act, 2010 by which  payment of vat at source has been introduced through the amended provisions of  sub-section (4), (4 L L),  (4 L  L  L), (4 M),  (4 M) and  (4 P) etc of Section 6.  To facilitate this new system, the concerned VAT Rules have also been amended by incorporation of Rules 18 (L) to (P). Rule 18 (P), in clear terms, made provisions for deduction and payment of Vat at source by the companies like Grameen Phone at the time of renewal of its licence or payment of revenue sharing and other charges. In the normal course, it is the service or facility provider who pays Vat upon collecting the same from the service or facility recipient. Under the new dispensation, the Vat has to be paid by the recipient of  service or facility like Grameen Phone at source after deduction. The dispute arose because of the words ‘Ev­p LaÑe’ (deduction at source) as used in the VAT Act and Rules made thereunder. In Bengali, the word ‘LaÑe’ (deduction) generally connotes that some small thing is to be deducted or cut off from a bigger thing. Thus, there may be an understating that the Vat has to be deducted from the consideration (fZ) or total receivable.<br/> <br/>We have examined the relevant provisions of VAT Act, in particular the basic provisions on which the entire scheme of Vat stands, namely, Sections  3, 5 and the definition of the word  ‘fZ’ (consideration).  We are of the view that by the amendment though Finance Act, 2010, only a method or system of paying Vat has been changed. Generally, it is the service or facility provider who is supposed to deposit Vat after collecting the same from the service or facility recipient. Now, still it is the service or facility recipient who pays the Vat, but pays the same directly to the exchequer after withholding the same at source. Thus, the basic concept or scheme of Vat has not been changed. Rule 18(Uma) and the clarifications of NBR (Annexures M and M1 to the writ petition) have reinforced  this position. But upon reading the clarifications of NBR, we have frustratingly noticed that the NBR has just quoted the provisions of Rule 18 (P) and did not even try to resolve dispute between the parties on Vat issue. By referring to Section 6 and Rule 18 (P), NBR just said that the recipient of the facility would have to pay the Vat at source directly to the Government exchequer after deduction. This was not the dispute between the parties. The dispute was as to wherefrom such deduction of Vat would be made. During hearing also, we do not find any assistance from the NBR. This dispute could in fact be resolved even before coming to this court through a proper clarification from the NBR. Nevertheless, since the matter is before us, we have no hesitation to confirm the basic principle of VAT as enunciated by Sections 3 and 5 of the Vat Act, 1991, which is that the Vat is always added to the total consideration value. It is never deducted like advanced income tax or income tax from the income. Therefore, at whatever stage you deduct and pay Vat, you have to deduct it after addition of Vat and not before addition. Thus, it is in fact ‘withholding’ of Vat at source and paying the same directly to the exchequer. On this issue, we find substance in the submissions of Mr. Hossain. <br/> <br/>When Grameen phone or any recipient of service or facility is required to deduct Vat at source, it is supposed to withhold it after calculating the same on the total ‘FZ’ (consideration), the value of the service, and pay it directly to the exchequer. Under the scheme, the Licencee like the Grameen Phone will get credit for the said amount from the Vat to be paid ultimately by the millions of subscribers of this country. Grameen phone is required to add the Vat to the total receivable or consideration (in the instant case the demanded money except the MCF for 2008 spectrum) and deduct or withhold it at source and pay the same directly to the exchequer. When Grameen Phone will provide cellular service to the million subscribers, it will collect Vat on the service value or receivables from each subscriber and get credit for the Vat already paid by it at source while paying for renewal or new spectrum fees or other fees or charges.<br/> <br/>The following example will make the opaque glass clearer:-<br/><u>Example</u>:<br/>Let us presume that the fees for renewal of licence, licence fee, spectrum fee or charges as fixed by BTRC is Tk. 100 and Grameen Phone provides its service to the subscribers for Tk. 400 in the following way:<br/> </div><table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="height:167px; width:625px"><tbody><tr><td style="height: 76px; width: 83px; text-align: center;">Renewal fee, Spectrum fees and other charges<br/>			 <br/>			(Tk.)</td><td style="height: 76px; width: 81px; text-align: center;">Grameen is required to pay: (100 + 15% Vat)<br/>			 <br/>			(Tk.)</td><td style="height: 76px; width: 83px; text-align: center;">Salaries of Grameen’s employees, equipments and other expenses<br/>			(Tk.)</td><td style="height: 76px; width: 58px; text-align: center;">Profit<br/>			 <br/>			 <br/>			 <br/>			(Tk.)</td><td style="height: 76px; width: 108px; text-align: center;">Total receivable or consideration (fZ)<br/>			 <br/>			 <br/>			(Tk.)</td><td style="height: 76px; width: 97px; text-align: center;">Subscribers will pay (400 + 15% Vat) = (400 + 60)<br/>			 <br/>			 <br/>			(Tk.)</td></tr><tr><td style="height: 4px; width: 83px; text-align: center;"><strong>100</strong></td><td style="height: 4px; width: 81px; text-align: center;"><strong>115</strong></td><td style="height: 4px; width: 83px; text-align: center;"><strong>180</strong></td><td style="height: 4px; width: 58px; text-align: center;"><strong>105</strong></td><td style="height: 4px; width: 108px; text-align: center;"><strong>400</strong></td><td style="height: 4px; width: 97px; text-align: center;"><strong>460</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Now, Grameen Phone is supposed to deposit Vat twice (we are not showing Vats payable for equipments etc.):  1stly – it will withhold Tk. 15 at the time of paying the licence renewal fee etc. and deposit the same directly in the exchequer in view of Rule 18(Uma) of the VAT Rules, 1991, and 2ndly – it is supposed to pay Tk. 60 as Vat upon receipt of Tk. 460 from the subscribers. However, at the final transaction Grameen Phone will get credit for its already paid up Vat of Tk. 15 from the Vat of Tk. 60 as received from the subscribers and will in fact deposit (60 – 15) = Tk. 45 in the exchequer, making the total Vat of (45+15) = Tk. 60 ultimately paid by the subscribers. The above calculation may be followed if Vat at source is required to be calculated separately on other fees or charges.<br/><em>[N.B.: The above calculation is a lump-sum one. The real calculation might be much more complicated to be done by the expert Accountants.]</em><br/> <br/>In the circumstances and for the above reasons, we do not find any illegality in the impugned memo in so far as the issue of Vat is concerned. Thus, by using the words “without any deduction”, or previously “excluding Vat and tax”, in the Guideline or in the impugned memo, we do not see any departure from the above mentioned provisions of law. Rather, under the new dispensation for payment of Vat at source, BTRC must write the words “without any deduction” or “excluding Vat and Tax” etc. to make it compliant with the provisions of sub-sections (3)(N), (4), (4 L L) and other relevant provisions of Section 6 of the VAT Act, 1991 and Rules 18 (L) to (P) of the VAT  Rules, 1991.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Maintainability of the writ petition:</u></strong><br/><br/>We have examined the arbitration Clause under Clause-9 of the Licence Agreement vide Reva-lidation Order dated 24.10.2004 (Annexure-D). It appears that the arbitrators are also able to resolve the disputes regarding the interpretation of the Agreement. Be that as it may, this court has already held that writ is maintainable when the interpretation of law is required to resolve the dispute. In the instant matter, since the interpretation of law, namely interpretation of Sections 38 and 39 of the Telecom Act, Sections 3,5,6 of the VAT Act and Rule 18 (Uma) of the VAT Rules is involved, we are of the view that this writ petition is maintainable.<br/> <br/>Besides, the agreement between the parties having already merged into the licences issued by the BTRC, the agreement in question has become a sovereign contract and as such writ is maintainable. In this regard, the law settled by our Apex Court in Bangladesh Telecom Ltd. Vs. BTTB, 48 DLR (AD)-20 (para-16) may be quoted: (Para-16)</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“Had there been no licence in favour of BTL the agreement, standing alone, would have been purely commercial contract, the cancellation of which could not have attracted the writ jurisdiction of the High Court Division but as the agreement merged into the licence (granted under a statutory provision) its terms and conditions no longer remained the terms and conditions of a commercial contract. It became the terms and conditions of the licence itself.”  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, in line with the above ratio, we hold that the instant Writ Petition is maintainable.   <br/> <br/><strong><u>CONCLUSIONS OF THE COURT:</u></strong><br/><br/>Regard being had to the above reasons, discussions and legal position, we hold as follows:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The writ petition is maintainable;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Rule is made absolute in part;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The impugned memo dated 17.10.2011 (Annexure-I), in so far as the application of MCF to the assignment of spectrum in 2008 is concerned, is without lawful authority. Accordingly, the petitioner Grameen Phone is not required to pay the MCF for the 7.4 spectrum in 1800 MHz assigned in its favour in 2008;</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> There is no illegality in the impugned memo in so far as the issue of Vat is concerned. The Grameen phone is required to add the Vat to the demanded money (except the MCF in respect of the spectrum of 2008) and withhold it at source and then pay the same directly to the Government exchequer. However, Grameen Phone will get credit for the said paid Vat from the Vat to be paid ultimately by its subscribers in accordance with law; </li><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of above, the Grameen Phone should immediately pay, if not paid already, the fees, charges and VAT to the concerned authorities in accordance with law.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Pred-ecessor of plaintiff No. 1-4 took settlement of 5 acres of land and khatian No. 110 opened in his name, similarly predecessor of plaintiff No. 5 took settlement of 5 acres of land and khatian No. 117 was opened in his name. Plaintiffs by settlement and inheritance became owner of suit land and possessing the same. On 15.10.2001 defendant No. 6 obstructed petiti-oners in cutting standing paddy where from plaintiffs came to know about the orders of Miscellaneous Case No. 29 of 2000-2001 dated 28.8.2001 cancelling the khatians opened in favour of plaintiffs, hence the suit.<br/><br/>Defendant No. 7-34 added in the suit by filing application, contested the suit and it is their case that Bolkha got settlement of 5 acres of land in case No. 124/51 -52, transferred the lands by two registered patta deeds dated 10.11.1952 and 11.11.1952 and who took patta subsequently transferred the suit land to these defendants vide registered deeds dated 7.4.1956, 29.2.1956 and 19.2.1956, 12.4.1957. At the time of revenue survey, Chandra Prashed mouza was splited in to Chandra Prashed , Bangia Chandra Prashad Char, Chandra Prashad Kumbo Poti and Domchor mouza. Dag No. 1472/1 was splited in present dag 224, 292 and 443 and khatian No. 184 and additional khatian No. 109 were opened. The seller paid rent to the Government and by two registered patta deed No. 5145 and 5892 dated 10.11.52 and 11.11. 52 transferred the case land to A. Kader, Yeakub Ali Bouli, Montaz uddin Bouli, Mohor Ali Forazi, Karim Box Forazi, Izzat ali Howlader, Subol Chandra Bagmar, Mohon Basi, chitta Ranjon Bagar and later on, A. Kader by registered patta dated 4.7.56 transferred his portion of land. Thereafter, said Miscellaneous Case was disposed of on compromise. In Settlement Case No.124/L/51-52 plaintiff No. 4 of the instant suit with the conivance of employees of revenue office created false, fabricated khatain in respect of present dag No. 1472/1. Tahshilder on 27.5.2001 submitted report before the relevant authority and also started Miscellaneous Case being No. 27(Vo)/2000-01. It appears from the report that with the surveyor and Kanoongo, khatian No. 109, 121, 110, 117 were opened in favour of the plaintiffs and the said khatians in favour of plaintiff was later on cancelled, hence, plaintiff’s suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>The case of the Government defendant Nos. 1-6 is that plaintiff case is totally false and that plaintiffs case of purchase and by inheritance got 5 acres of land are false, fabricated and forged and plaintiffs have no right, title over the suit land.<br/><br/>Learned Assistant Judge framed 5 issues. Plaintiff examined 3 witnesses and exhibited documents marked as exhibit 1-2(Ka). Defendant No.7 examined 2 witnesses and exhibited papers marked as exhibit-Ka –Ka(Ta) and (cha). Government defendant Nos. 1-6 examined one witness as D.W.3.<br/><br/>Learned Assistant Judge decided issue No. 2 as suit is not bad for defect of parties. Learned Assistant Judge also decided issue No. 3 as the suit is not barred by limitation, Learned Assistant Judge on consideration of exhibit decided issue Nos. 4 and 5 as per claim of the plaintiff. Learned Judge as to whether there is existence of Settlement case No. 9/L/51-52,  for which plaintiffs called for the record from office of Additional Deputy Commissioner (Rev.), learned Assistant Judge on consideration of the same found that along with the case record of the aforesaid case record of Misc. Case No. 39/02-03, signature of Assistant Commissioner of (Land) dated 8.6.95 was found; learned Judge thereafter observed as:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“ উল্লেখিত খাজনা আদায় সংক্রামত্ম তথ্য সহকারী কমিশনার (ভূমি) প্রদান করেন নাই বিবাদী ইহা অস্বীকার করেন নাই বিবাদী ইহা অস্বীকার করেন নাই কিংবা উ্কত প্রদ: ৬ সম্পর্কে বিবাদী (সরকার) পক্ষ কোন জেরা করেন নাই। সুতরাং দাখিলী কাগজপত্র পর্যালোচনায় দেখা যায় যে, ৯/এল/৫১-৫২ নং বন্দোবস্ত মোকদ্দমার অসিত্মত্ব বাদীপক্ষ প্রমান করিতে সক্ষ হইয়াছেন। অন্যদিকে বিবাদী সরকার পক্ষ বর্ননায় ইহা ৮ ও ১২ নং রেজিষ্ট্রিতে উল্লেখ নেই দাবী করিলেও ইহা সম্পর্কে অত্র বিবাদীপক্ষের সাক্ষী উড-৩ জেরা ও জবানবন্দিতে কোন বক্তব্য উত্থাপন করেন নাই। এমনকি ১-৬ নং বিবাদীর অফিসে রক্ষিত উক্ত রেজিষ্ট্রার ও আদালতে বিবাদীপক্ষ দাখিল করেন নাই। কেননা বিবাদী পক্ষের উক্ত বক্তব্য প্রমানের ভার বিবাদীর উপরই আইনত ন্যাসত্ম ছিল। অন্যদিকে বাদীপক্ষ বিরোধীয় আদেমের সত্যায়িত ফটোকপি দাখিল করেন যাহা প্রদ: ৮ হিসেবে চিহ্নিত হয়। সরকার বিবাদীপ্ক্ষ উক্ত দাখিলীয় কাগজ সম্পর্কে কোন জেরা করেন না্ই। উ্ক্ত আদেশ মতে পর্যালোচনায় বিগত ১০.০৭.২০০১ ইং তারিখের আদেশের উল্লেখ আছে যে, জারীকারক প্রতিবেদনে উল্লেক করিয়াছেন যে, নোটিশে উল্লেখিত ব্যক্তির সন্ধান পাওয়া যায় নাই। ফলে নোটিশ যথাযথ ভাবে জারি করিতে না পারিয়া উহা ফেরত প্রদান করিয়াছেন। ১-৬ নং বিবাদীপক্ষের স্বাক্ষী উক্ত আদেমের কথা জেরায় ও স্বীকার  করেন। সুতরাং দেকা যায় যে, নোটিশ যথাযথভাবে জারী হয় নাই। কিন্তু বিধি সম্মত ভাবে নোটিশ জারীর আইনত বাধ্যকতা রহিয়াছে। কিন্তু মিস কেস নং-  ২৯ (ভো)/২০০০-২০০১ নং মোকদ্দমায় নোটিশ যতাযথ ভাবে জারী না হওয়ায় উ্ক্ত আইনগত বাধ্যবাধকতা পালন করা হয় নাই। বিরোধীয় আদেশ পর্যালোচনায় দেখা যায় যে, মূলতঃ সার্ভেয়ার ও কানুনগোর রিপোর্টের ভিত্তিতে খতিয়ানসমূহ বাতিল করা হয।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Learned Judge, thereafter, considered the case of the Government and on consideration of only witness for the Government, D.W.3, observed as:- আদেশ পর্যালোচনায় দেকা যায় যে, মূলতঃ সার্ভেয়ার ও কানুনগোর রিপোর্টের ভিত্তিতে খতিয়ানসমূহ বাতিল করা হয়।  <br/><br/>Learned Judge also found that defendant No. 1-6 did not produce register in court. Learned Judge thereafter considered paper of the Government and also order passed on 10.7.2001, and held that notice was not served upon the plaintiff which D.W.3 in his deposition and cross-examination admitted. Learned Judge also found that as per law, notice must required to be served upon the person concerned. Learned Judge on consider-ation of the case record of Case 29/(Vo)/2000-01 found that since notice was not served as per law cancellation of the khatian of the plaintiff was done illegally. Learned Judge also considered the report of the surveyor in respect of Case No. 9/L/51-52 and found that surveyor did not particularly utter a single word as to where the said case record is lying.<br/><br/>Thereafter, the learned Judge considered the case of defendant No.7- 34 added in the suit by filing application under Order I Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure and held that:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“মোকাদ্দমাটি সহকারী কমিশনার (ভূমি) ভোলা সদয় এর বিরোধীয় আদেশ বে-আইনী, একতিয়ার বহির্ভূত, বাদীর প্রতি কার্যকর নহে মর্মে কোন না সূচক বিবাদীর প্রতিকারে দায়ের করা হইয়াছে। বিরোধীয় ভূমির স্বত্ব নির্ধারন মোকদ্দমার বিচার্য্য বিষয় নহে|”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Thereafter, upon such findings learned Judge decreed the suit declaring that</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“এতদ্বারা আরজির ক’ তপসিলে বর্ণিত বিরোধীয় ভূমি সংক্রামেত্ম খ’ তপসিল বর্ণিত বিরোধীয় আদেশ বে-আইনী গণ্যে উহা রদ ও রহিদ ক্রমে বাদীপক্ষের প্রতি বাধ্যকর নহে ঘোষিত হইল| ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Against this decree Government did not prefer any appeal but added defendant No. 7-34 filed Title Appeal No. 19 of 2008, which, on transfer, was heard by the learned Additional District Judge, who by impugned judgment and decree set aside the judgment of trial court and sent the suit back on remand.<br/><br/>In remanding the suit, learned Judge found that both plaintiffs and defendant No.7-34 claim suit land as settlement from Government; suit was filed by the plaintiffs for declaring the notice issued by the Assistant Commissioner (Land) as illegal, and not binding upon the plaintiffs. Learned Additional District Judge thereafter observed that ‘learned Assistant Judge did not consider the case as to who possess the suit land.’ Learned Additional District Judge further found that Government admitted settlement in favour of defendants. Learned Jude also observed that the papers submitted by defendant No. 7 -34 are sufficient to prove their possession and further observed that ‘learned Assistant Judge held that papers submitted by defendants are not sufficient to hold who are possessing the suit land is not a good observation.’ Learned Judge also considered that ‘trial court did not properly assessed the deposition of witnesses and’ learned Assistant Judge on reference to the deposition of plaintiff’s witnesses wrongly found that the settlement in favour of plaintiff has been proved. Learned Judge also observed that ‘learned Assistant Judge was not legal to hold Assistant Commissioner (Land)’s order was not binding upon the plaintiffs.’ Thereafter learned Additional District Judge observed as:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">বিচারকালে সংশ্লিষ্ট রেজিষ্ট্রার এবং কেস নথি তলব পূর্বক প্রয়োজন বোধে সার্ভেয়ার দ্বারা সম্পত্তি পরিমাপ করা যুক্তি সংগত ছিল যাহা করা হয় নাই। তাহা ছাড়া সহকারী কমিশনার ভূমি তথা রাজস্ব বিভাগ ভোলা নালিশী সম্পত্তির প্রকৃত তত্বাবধায় এবঙ সরকার পক্ষ হইতেই আপীলকারী বিবাদীপক্ষের দাবী স্পষ্ট স্বীকার করা হইয়াছে। কিন্তু সরকারী দপ্তর হইতে সংশ্লিষ্ট রেজিষ্ট্রার সমুহ তলব পুর্বক যথাযথ ভাবে পর্যালোচনা করা  হয় নাই। যাহাত্যাবশ্যক ছিল। তাহা ছাড়া বিবাদী আপীলকারী পক্ষ বন্দোবসত্ম ও খরিদ মুলে নালিশী সম্পত্তি দাবী করেন এবঙ উ্কত সম্পত্তি ৩টি মৌজায় বিভক্ত হইয়াছে বলিয়া দাবী করিলেও বিাবদী সরকারী প্ক্ষকে উ্কত বিষয়ে মৌজা ম্রাপ সহ অপরাপর সংশ্লিষ্ট কাগজাদি তলব করতঃ বিচারে আনা উচিৎ ছিল। যাহা করা হয় নাই।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, learned Advocate, appearing for the petitioner submits that, learned Assistant Judge having found from the surveyor’s report that provisions of rule have not been complied with and cancellation of khatains of the plaintiffs was passed by the Assistant Commissioner (Land) is not supported by law and this lawful finding was not set aside by the learned Additional District Judge while remanding the suit as such the same is liable to be set aside. Learned Advocate further submits that it is the case of plaintiffs and proved by exhibits containing Government papers, that after getting the land in settlement Case 9/L/51-52, plaintiffs are possessing the suit land by paying rents to the Government, exhibit C series, as such, learned Additional District Judge committed gross illegality in absence of any paper filed by the Government that defendant No. 7-34 was settled with the suit land without considering that defendant’s case that original mouza Chandra Prashad has been splited into three mouzas and it is duty cust  upon the defendants to prove this fact, in sending back the suit on remand learned Additional District Judge give premium to the defendant to fill up the lacuna which is not permissible under law. Learned Advocate further submits that court of appeal below did not consider the case of the plaintiff in proper perspective and instant of sending the suit back on remand for further bout between the parties, learned Additional District Judge ought to have disposed of the suit finally. Learned Advocate further submits that from the findings of Learned Additional District Judge it appears that Learned Additional District Judge give opportunity to defendant No.7-34 and also Government i.e. defendant No. 1-6 to produced the paper which they did not find for long time and further directed the trial court to call for the records which is duty of the defendants to prove the case make out in their written statements.<br/><br/>Learned Advocate in support of his submissions relied on the cases reported in 53 DLR (AD)110, 24BLD(AD)125, 54 DLR (AD) 721. These decisions, relating to when remand order can be passed by the Appellate Court.<br/><br/>Learned Advocate for the defendant No. 7-34 opposite parties submits that C. S. khatian in the instant case was cancelled legally as whether notice was served or not, on relying on section 27 of General Clauses Act, submits that if the notice issued at the proper address it is deemed to be served and further submits that from the objection it revealed that plaintiffs are not in possession as such the suit is not maintainable.<br/><br/>Learned Advocate relied on the case of Hazee Abdul Hossain and other -Vs.-Md. Amjad Hossain and other, 15 MLR-485, on the question of maintainability of the suit under section 42 of Special Relief Act and submits  that the suit is not maintainable as plaintiff failed prove his case; the case of Indian Bank-Vs-Datla Venkata Chinna Krishnam Raju, AIR-1991(SC) 908, the case of U.P. Junior Doctors Action Committee –Vs.-Dr. B. Sheetal Nandwani and others, AIR 1991 (SC) 909 where it is held that if any one got admission on bhogus result, the beneficiary would not justify attraction of the application of rules of natural justice being provided an opportunity to be heard. Learned Advocate next relied on the case of Ishaque (Md.) Vs- Ekramul Haque Chowdhury and others, 54 DLR (AD)-26, where it is held that in a case of forfeiture for denial of title, written notice of lessor’s intention to determine the lease is not compulsory as the cause of action is the denial of the landlord’s title resulting in determination of the tenancy. Learned Advocate next relied on the case of Erfan Ali -Vs. Joynal Abedin Miah, 1983 BLD (AD)-342 where it is held that rent receipt and their evidentiary value, though not documents of title, they are important items of evidence of possession and may be used as collateral evidence of title since possession generally follows title. Learned Advocate next relied on the case of Md. Nurul Islam Vs. Md. Ali Hossain Miah being dead his heirs Md. Amir Hossasin and others, 5 BLT -297 where it is held that notice sent by post at the address of the suit premises having been returned unserved with the remark of the postal authority ‘left’ was presumed to be good service. Then learned Advocate next relied on the case of Mohammad Idris Khan –Vs- Hazi Erfanuddin 9 DLR 16 where it is held that fraud vitiates all proceeding that said contravention of law no ground for allowing an order obtained by fraud to stand.<br/><br/>Now let me proceed with my own way to decide this case.<br/><br/>Only question calls for determination as to whether before cancellation of khatian notice was served upon the plaintiffs or not.<br/><br/>Plaintiffs knocked door of justice with claim that they have got settlement in Settlement Case NO. 9/L/51-52, khatians were opened in their favour but by Misc. Case No. 29/2001-2002 the said khatians were cancelled without giving them any notice. Government denied that facts that there is no such case in the registered of 1951-52. It is the finding of learned Assistant Judge that D.W.3 examined by the Government, did not utter a single word as to service of notice, D.W. 3 only stated that in Settlement Case plaintiff acquired the land and D.W. 3 did not say a single word that settlement in favour of plaintiffs are false or not. It appears that D.W. 3 is not a proper witness adduced by the Government or defendant No. 7-34 in their favour. If it is found notice was issued, it is sufficient compliance of Rule 24 and 32 of the State Acquisition Rules 1951 and is sufficient for dismissal of the suit but if it is found otherwise, then suit must be decreed as the Rules are mandatory in nature. Relevant portion of rule 24 and 32 of the State Acquisition Rules 1951, these rule are in chapter IV under heading preparation or revision of record of rights, are as follows:-<br/><br/>Rule 24 under caption Preliminary record, writing:- for preparation of draft record it shall consist of statements of rights which is khatians; separate khatians are prepared for each person interested or each group of person faintly interest in the land according to particulars but no entry shall be made as to the revenue, rent or cess, the class to which the tenant belongs or the special conditions and incidents of the tenancy and a field index or khasra or draft arrange shall be prepared according to the serial numbers of the fields in the village which shall not form part of the draft record. Dispute regarding ownership of the land or ownership of any interest or land, shall be decided by a Revenue Officer or a kannongo in a summary manner and on the basis of actual possession.<br/><br/>Rule 25 relate to Legal Explanation, Rule 26 relates to attestation and allotment of land under Section 20(3), Rule 27 relates to choice and allotment of land under Section 20(3) when a record of rights is revised by omitting the stage of attestation , Rule 29 relates to determination of normal annual yield of land under Section 24(4), rule 29(A) relates to preparation of preliminary rent role, Rule 30 relate to preparation of settlement rent role and Rule 31 relates to publication of the draft record of rights under Section 19(1) are not required to be considered for disposal of this rule.  But Rule 32 is required.<br/><br/>Rule 32 relates for disposal of objections under Section 29(1) of the Act wherein it is stipulated that after draft khatian converted to final on its publication, objector can raised objection by filing objection in prescribed form and copy or copies of such objection are required to be supplied for service of notices upon the person or persons in whose name khatians have been prepared, which is mandatory and relevant portion of the Rule is that the Revenue Officer shall issue notices informing the objector and all other persons. Rule thereafter make it mandatory, obligatory, not directory on the part of Revenue Officer to do some act necessary for publication of the khatian. Law is “The Revenue Officer <u>shall</u> issue notices informing the objector and all other persons so interested of the date and place fixed for the hearing of the objection, and with each notice to a person, other than the objector, he <u>shall</u> forward a copy of the objection. Objections regarding the ownership of land or the ownership of any interest in land <u>shall</u> be decided by the Revenue Officer in a summary manner on the basis of actual possession. The record <u>shall</u> contain a brief summary of the evidence taken and an abstract of the reasons for the decision. When a Revenue Officer directs that a change <u>shall</u> be made in the rent recorded as payable by any tenant, he <u>shall</u> direct that a corresponding change <u>shall</u> be made in the cess, if any, recorded as payable by such tenant. Objections <u>shall</u> not be disposed of in the absence of any of the parties materially interested or their representatives, unless the Revenue Officer be satisfied, for reasons to be recorded in writing, that the <u>notice was duly served</u> on the person concerned.”(Underlines are of mine).<br/><br/>In these rules word ‘shall’ has been frequently used giving the intents of the legislature as mandatory non compliance of which make the act done under the statute absolutely void. Notice shall be sent means it mandatory sense. Shall in common parlance always construed as compulsory unless accompanied with qualified word giving a different meaning.  Whenever a statute declares that a thing shall be done, the natural and proper meaning is that a preemptory mandate is enjoined. In different laws ‘shall’ as used has a district meaning and used differently with the intents of the legislature but unless there be a qualified word for using it directory ‘shall’ always used as mandatory and obligatorily means it must be done. In the case of Pratab Singh Kairon –vs- Gurniy Singh, AIR 1958 Pun 409 it is settled that where the word shall is used in a statue the Presumption is that its use is imperative and not merely directory, particularly when it is address to a court or a public servant and when a right or benefit depends on its imperative use.<br/><br/>In the instant case Government did not say issuance of any notice. It is the case of defendant No. 7-34, settler from the Government that as per section 27 of General Clauses Act if notice issued giving proper address of the receiver it deemed to be served. From the record of the Government I do not find any such notice was issued upon the plaintiffs. Learned Assistant Judge held that before cancellation of khatinas no notice was served upon the plaintiffs. Appellate court did not reverse the findings of the trial court on this score. As such, cancellation of the khatians was done by the Revenue Officer illegally.<br/><br/>Defendant No. 7-34 who are setler of the Government filed appeal. In law they have no locus standi to challenge the decision of the trial court as Government did not prefer any appeal. The case is that Government cancelled the khatian of the plaintiffs, not defendant No. 7-34 and since Government accept the verdict of the trial Court, defendant No. 7-34, who are setler of the Government can not challenge the decree of the learned Assistant Judge.<br/><br/>Rule has merit.<br/><br/>In the result, the rule is made absolute without any order as to cost.<br/><br/>The judgment and decree passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Bhola, allowing Title Appeal No. 19 of 2008 is set aside and those of the learned Subordinate Judge, Sadar, Bhola passed in Title Suit No. 192 of 2001 is restored.<br/><br/>Send down the lower court record.<br/><br/>Communicate this order at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The pre-emptor is a co-sharer of the   case holding and the pre-emptee opposite party Nos.1 and 2 are stranger to the case land. No notice of transfer was served on him, the pre-emptor needs more land and hence, the case. <br/><br/>The vendor opposite parties resisted the pre-emption application by filing written statement denying most of the allegations of the pre-emption application contending, inter-alia, that they acquired the case land by way of a registered exchange deed and as such the pre-emption case is not maintainable.<br/><br/>At the trial both the parties led evidence to prove their respective cases and the learned Assistant Judge by his judgment and order dated 01.7.2001 dismissed the pre-emption case on contest.<br/><br/>The pre-emptor-petitioner, thereafter, preferred Misc. Appeal No. 34 of 2001 in the Court of District Judge, Gazipur against the said judgment and order passed by the learned Assistant Judge. Eventually, the said case was transmitted to the Court of Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup>  Court, Gazipur for disposal, who by order dated 11.01.2004 dismissed the appeal for default.<br/><br/>The unsuccessful, pre-emptor petitioner, thereupon filed Miscellaneous Case No.  6 of 2004 under 0rder 41, Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure on 9.02.2004 for re-admission of the appeal. In the said Misc. Case 2 (two) witnesses were   examined.<br/><br/>The learned Joint District Judge, 2nd Court, Gazipur, however, by Order No.32 dated 28.5.2005 rejected the misc. case stating that a partition suit is pending in respect of the case land and the pre-emptor-petitioner having realized that there  is no chance to  get any  relief in the pre-emption case deliberately  did not take any step in  Misc. (pre-emption) Appeal on the date fixed  for hearing of the appeal .<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order dated 28.5.2005 the present appellant preferred this first miscellaneous appeal.<br/><br/>Mr. Golam Arshed, the learned Advocate appearing for the appellant submits that the Court of appeal below without applying its judicial mind into the facts and circumstance of the case and law bearing on the subject most illegally rejected the Misc. Case under Order 41, Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure. He next submits that the Court of appeal below ought to have considered that the appellant permanently resides in Dhaka,  who  on the day fixed for hearing of the appeal due to heavy traffic jam  could not reach in the Court premises at   district Gazipur from Dhaka in time for taking step of her case and thus fell into an error of law resulting in an error in the impugned decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/><br/>Mr. Arshed, finally submits that both the witnesses namely, PW-1 and PW-2 in their respective testimony categorically testified that due to heavy traffic jam the appellant could not reach from Dhaka to Gazipur in time for taking step of her case but  the Court of appeal below most illegally in discarding the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 mechanically disallowed the Misc. Case under Order 41 Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdus Samad Azad, the learned Advocate appearing for the respondent No.1, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment and order which was according to him just, correct and proper. Mr. Azad in the course of his argument upon placing supplementary affidavit dated 8.11.2012 and other materials on record submits that the instant first miscellaneous appeal is not maintainable inasmuch as the same arises from an order disallowing the Misc. case for restoration of a proceeding under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 being Misc. (Pre-emption)   Appeal No. 34 of 2001. The learned Advocate in support of his argument has relied on a decision reported in   32 DL(AD) 231.<br/><br/>I have hared the learned Advocates for both the sides and perused the impugned judgment and other materials on record. To appreciate the submission of the learned Advocates of both the sides from a correct angle, it would be convenient for me to decide first of all the question of maintainability of the instant Miscellaneous Appeal.<br/><br/>It appears that unsuccessful pre-emptor petitioner  filed Misc. Appeal No. 34 of 2001 against the judgment and order dated 1.7.2001  and the learned  Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup>  Court, Gazipur by order dated 11.01.2004 dismissed the appeal for default and thereupon, pre-emptor petitioner, filed Misc. case No.  6 of 2004 under 0rder 41, Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure for re-admission of the appeal on 9.02.2004 and the learned Joint District Judge, 2nd Court (in-charge), Gazipur by his judgment and order dated 28.5.2005 disallowed Misc. Case and  the instant appeal is directed against that  judgment and order dated 28.5.2005. <br/><br/>Mr. Golam Arshed, the learned Advocate upon referring to the provisions of Order 43, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure submits that it is apparent from the record that the present appellant preferred Misc. Case for re-admission of Misc. appeal under Order 41, Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure and as per provision of Order 43 Rule 1(t) of the Code of Civil Procedure this first miscellaneous appeal is well maintainable.<br/><br/>Now, certain provisions of law are required to be referred to for having a better view of the dispute in question.  Order XLIII, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Appeals from Orders</strong> 1. An appeal shall lie from the following orders under the provisions of section 104, namely:-<br/>..................<br/>..................<br/>..................<br/>(t) an order of refusal under rule 19 of Order XLI to re-admit, or under rule 21 of Order XLI to re-hear, an appeal;<br/>..................<br/>..................</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the above, it manifests that there is express provision in Order 43, Rule 1 (t) of the Code of Civil Procedure for appeal against order passed under Order 41, Rule 19 of the Code refusing to re-admit the appeal.<br/><br/>I have already noticed that in this case the appellant preferred Misc. case under Order 41, Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure for re-admission of Misc. Appeal  in the Court of Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court (in-charge), Gazipur,  who  by the impugned judgment and order  dated 28.5.2005 disallowed Misc. Case and the instant appeal is directed against the said judgment and order dated 28.5.2005 passed by the Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court (in-charge), Gazipur in Miscellaneous Case No.6 of 2004 refusing to re-admit the appeal. On perusal of Order 43, Rule 1 (t) read with section 104 of the Code of Civil Procedure, I am of the clear view that the instant first miscellaneous appeal is well maintainable. <br/><br/>It is argued that there is nothing on record to suggest that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from appearing  before the Court of appeal below on 11.01.2004 when the matter was called on for hearing  and as such, the learned Joint District Judge committed no wrong in rejecting the Misc. Case filed under Order 41, Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>On the contrary, Mr. Golam Arshed, the learned Advocate submits that the appellant in his Misc. Case under Order 41, Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure for readmission of appeal categorically stated that she permanently resides in Dhaka and due to traffic jam she could not reach in Court at  Gazipur from Dhaka in time to take step in her case on 11.01.2004 and as such it can be said that the appellant being a lady was prevented by sufficient cause from  appearing  before the Court on 11.01.2004 when the appeal was called on for hearing though there is nothing in law which prevents a party. Mr. Golam Arshed, to strengthen his submission relies on the decisions reported in 21 DLR 353, 7 DLR 173.<br/><br/>On a careful perusal of the record, it appears that the appellant, Nahida Sultana herself was  examined as PW-1, who in her deposition stated that on the way to Gazipur her Taxi became out of order and also serious traffic jam she could not reach in Gazipur Court premises in time from Dhaka on 11.01.2004 and PW-2 in his deposition corro-borated the evidence of PW-1 in all material particulars.<br/><br/>On going through the application under Order 41, Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure and evidence of PW-1 and PW-2, it appears that on 11.01.2004 due to traffic jam as well as the Taxi of the appellant was fallen out of order on the way to Gazipur from Dhaka could not reach in the Court of  Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court (in-charge), Gazipur from Dhaka,  the appellant in time for taking step in her case. Therefore, I am unable to see eye to eye to such submission of the learned Advocate for the respondent that the appellant having failed to make out a case that she was prevented by sufficient cause from appearing  appear before the Court when the appeal was called on for hearing.<br/><br/>Another plank of attack made by Mr. M. A. Hannan, the learned Advocate for the respondent No.1 that the present appellant has no subsisting interest in the case land as she transferred the case land by executing a Ewaz Deed on 29.01.2009 and the learned Joint District Judge rightly arrived at a finding that the pre-emptor-appellant  having realized the merit of the Misc. (pre-emption) Appeal deliberately did turn to  appear before the Court for hearing of the appeal.<br/>      <br/>In reply, Mr. Golam Arshed, the learned Advocate submits that this argument in deciding an application under Order 41, Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure for re-admission of appeal which was  dismissed for default is plainly misconceived.<br/><br/>It appears that  the present appellant after being unsuccessful in an application under Order 41, Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Pro-cedure for re-admission of appeal preferred the instant first miscellaneous appeal for setting-aside the judgment and order dated 28.5.2005 passed by the Joint District Judge, 2nd Court (in-charge), Gazipur in Miscellaneous Case No.6 of 2004 disallowing the    Misc. case under 0rder 41, Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It also appears that the impugned judgment has dealt with some unnecessary facts in deciding an application under 0rder 41, Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure for re-admission of Appeal.<br/><br/>The conduct of the appellant may be reprehensible  but the matter cannot be decided on the ground of mere apprehension for non appearance. Whether the appellant was preve-nted by sufficient cause from appearing before the Court when the appeal was called on for hearing will determine the outcome of the proceeding under Order 41, rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  Order 41, Rule 19  of the Code of Civil Procedure gives ample power to the appellate Court to  re-admit the appeal if the Court is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing before the Court  when that appeal was called on for hearing. The only point for consideration before a Court in deciding an application under Order 41, Rule 19  of the Code of Civil Procedure, is whether the applicant was prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing when the impugned  order was passed ex-parte. I, therefore, find there is a good deal of substance in the contentions raised by Mr. Golam Arshed, and the view taken by the Court below can not be legally sustained.<br/><br/>In view of my discussions made in the foregoing paragraphs, it is by now clear that the learned Joint District Judge  acted  illegally   in  rejecting the Misc. Case under 0rder 41, Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure by the impugned judgment and order, the same calls for interference.<br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and order dated 28.5.2005 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 2nd Court, Gazipur in Miscellaneous Case No.6 of 2004 is set-aside and  accordingly, the appeal being Misc. Appeal No.34 of 2001 is re-admitted.<br/><br/>Since, the case has been dragging over a period of 12(twelve) years, the Court of appeal below is directed to hear and dispose of the appeal as early as possible preferably within 6 (six) months from the date of receipt of this judgment.<br/><br/>Let a copy of the judgment along with reconstructed case record be sent down at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

S. khatian. After that, Niamat Ali died leaving behind a son, namely. Miah Kha and two daughters namely, Rakoat Bibi and Ojir Bibi. Miah Kha sold 70 decimals of land of plot No.77 to plaintiff No. 1 by a registered deed of sale dated 14.10.1958. Miah Kha further sold 13!/2 decimals of land to plaintiff No.l from the said plot No.77 by a registered deed of sale dated 08.12.1956 and in this way, plaintiff No. 1 acquired title to l.l8.50 acres of land in total. Ojir Bibi, the other daughter of Niamat Ali Kha, died leaving behind a son, namely, Kasim Uddin. By amicable partition, Kasim Uddin got 93  decimals of land who transferred 88 decimals of land to his wife Malika Banu by a registered deed dated 27.12.1947. After that, Kasim Uddin and Malika Banu, the husband and the wife respectively, jointly transferred 70 decimals of land of plot No.77 to Belat Ali Mathbor by registered deed dated 22.01.1949 and Belat Ali transferred the same to Malika Banu, wife of Kasim Uddin and their son Mafizuddin by a registered deed dated 03.05.1954. While in possession Malika Banu transferred 88 decimal of land to plaintiff No.l by a registered deed dated 07.10.1958. Thus, the plaintiffs acquired 16 annas title i.e. 2.12 acres of land in C. S. plot No.77. While the plaintiffs were in possession of the suit land, one Abdul Aziz Khan in the name of an industry trespassed into 96 decimals of land by creating some false documents. Consequ-ently, the plaintiffs filed Title Suit No.28 of 1967 for recovery of khas possession. Ultimately, the said suit was decreed and the plaintiff got delivery of possession on 08.07.1967 through executing Court. Since then the plaintiffs had possessed the entire suit land in C. S. plot No.77, S. A. and R.S. khatians have also been prepared in their names subsequently. The defendants, the sons of Miah Kha, having no title and interest trespassed into a portion of the suit plot as described in the schedule-B to the plaint. Hence Title Suit No.464 of 1985 has been filed for declaration of title and recovery of khash possession.<br/><br/>What is important to note there is that the defendants did not contest the suit. After a long lapse of time, the learned Subordinate Judge by the judgment and order dated 25.10.1995 decreed the suit ex parte. Against that ex parte decree, one Abed Khan as the petitioner filed Miscellaneous Case No.40 of 1996. On23.07.2001, the Court fixed the date of final hearing of miscellaneous case but the petitioner did not turn up and none was found upon repeated calls. After that, the learned Subordinate Judge by judgment and order dated 23.07.2001   dismissed Miscellaneous Case No.40 of 1996.<br/><br/>Against the order of dismissal dated 23.07.2001, the appellant herein prefer-red Miscellaneous Appeal No.212 of 2001 before the learned District Judge, Dhaka. On transfer, the appeal was heard by the learned Additional District Judge, Third Court, Dhaka, who by impugned judgment and    order dated 24.05.2004 dismissed the same.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order 24.05.2004,   the appellant herein filed Civil Revision No. 3994 of 2007 before the High Court Division and obtained Rule. The High Court Division by the judgment an order dated   14.10.2009 discharged the Rule without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with judgment and order dated 14.10.2009 passed by the High Court Division, the appellant moved this Division by filing Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.2511 of 2009 in which this Division granted leave on 29.07.2010 resulting in the initiation of Civil Appeal No.280 of 2010.<br/><br/>Mr. A. F. M. Hassan Ariff, learned Senior Advocate (with Mr. A. F. M. Meshbahuddin learned Senior Advocate), appearing on behalf of the appellant, submits that the decree passed in Title Suit No.464 of 1985 of the Second Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka, is a nullity as L. A. Case No.02 of 1987-88 had been initiated during pendency of the suit for acquisition of the suit land and other land and that the High Court Division without looking into this legal aspect of the case discharged the Rule and as such, the impugned judgment should be set aside. He further submits that as soon as the plaintiffs came to know about initiation of L. A. Case No.2 of 1987-88 they should not have proceeded with the suit and that the decree obtained by them even after initiation of acquisition proceeding is a nullity and as such, the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division should be set aside.<br/><br/>Dr.   Rafiqur Rahman,   learned   Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of respond-ent No. l (a)-l (e), supports the    impugn-ed judgment stating that the appellant did not have any locus standi to file the revisional application as it has not filed any case under Order IX rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the ex parte decree passed in Title Suit No.464 of 1985. He lastly submits that the High Court Division has addressed all the issues raised by the appellant before this Division and as such, the impugned judgment should not be interfered with.<br/><br/><br/>We have considered the impugned judgm-ent, the submissions of the learn-ed Senior Advocates and the documents incorporated in the paper book.<br/><br/>To begin with, it is necessary to go through the submissions of the learned Advocate for the appellant, on which, leave was granted by this Division as under: They never received any summons of the title suit but the High Court Division observed in the judgment contrary to the materials of the case that summons was served upon the RAJUK inasmuch as from order sheets of the title suit shows that RAJUK was made pro-forma defendant No.4 by amendment vide order No.78 dated 17.08.1988 and before such amendment the suit land stood acquired on 16.06.1988 and as such, the amendment and making the RAJUK as pr-forma defendant thereof is a nullity.<br/><br/>As per section 44 of the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982, any suit challenging the acquisition of lands barred by law and since the suit land was acquired on 16.06.1988 the suit stood barred by law at seriously occasioned a failure of justice and the same is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>The centering round a notice dated 30.04.2007 issued by RAJUK for vacating the land from unauthorized occupation, the respondents filed Writ Petition No.4609 of 2007 which was discharged on 03.02.2009 with clear finding that C.S. Plot No.77 measuring 2.12 acres of land stood totally acquired by L.A. Case No.02 of 1987-88 and the respondents received compensation money for .70 acres of land from the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka and the rest of the compensation of the portion of 1.42 acres of land was received by Abid Khan and challenging this judgment, the respondents filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1016 of 2009 and upon hearing the parties, this Division dismissed the same on 24.11.2009 and in such circumstances, the High Court Division held that the suit land is not the acquired land in L.A. Case No.02 of 1987-88 but is situated outside the L.A. Case and this has occasioned failure of justice and hence, the same is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the plaintiffs filed Title Suit No.228 of 1979 in the First Court of the then Subordinate  Judge,  Dhaka, renumbered as Title Suit No.464 of 1985 in the Second Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession in respect of the land appended in the schedule to the plaint. There is no gainsaying the fact that initially the appellant-RAJUK and the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka were not made parties lo the suit. On 17.07.1988, the plaintiffs filed an application in the suit for adding the appellant-RAJUK and the Deputy Commissi-oner, Dhaka as defendant Nos.4 and 5 and the application was allowed on the same date.<br/>The relevant portion of the application for addition of party is quoted below :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">দেঃ কার্য্য বিধি আইনের আদেশ ১নং রুল-১০ ও ১৫১ ধারা মোতাবেক দরখাস্ত।<br/>দরখাস্ত পক্ষে বাদীগণ।<br/><strong>মাননীয় আদালত সমীপে সবিনয় নিবেদন এই যেঃ-</strong><br/>১। বাদী উপরোক্তা মোকদ্দমা স্বত্ব ঘোষণা ও খাস দখলের জন্য বিবাদীগণের বিরুদ্দে দায়ের করিয়াছে বিবদীগণও উক্ত মোকদ্দমায় জবাব দিযাছে এবং আগামী তারিখে শুনানীর জন্য দিন ধার্য্য আছে।<br/>২। নালিশী সম্পত্তি জিলা ঢাকার মিরপুর থানার অধীন বাইলজুরী মৌজায় অবস্থিত এবং বর্তমানে বৃহত্তর ঢাকা শহর উন্নয়ন কল্পে রাজউক নালিশী সম্পত্তি সহ অন্যান্য সম্পত্তি একায়ার করিবার জন্য সরজমিনে সার্ভে করিতেছে এবং জিলা ঢাকার ডিপুটি কমিশনার এল, এ, এবং এল, আর এর অফিসেও একটি এল, এ, কেইস রম্নজু হইয়াছে যাহার নম্বর-এল, এ, কেইস নং-২/৮৭-৮৮। কাজেই উপরোক্ত মোকদ্দমায় রাজউক ও ডিপুটি কমিশনার ও এল, এ, কে পক্ষভূক্ত করা একান্থ দরকার ন্যায় বিচারের স্বার্থে। কারণ বর্তমানে রাজউক ও ডিপুটি কমিশনার এল, এ, উপরোক্ত মোকদ্দমায় হবপবংংধৎু ঢ়ধৎঃু কাজেই ঢ়ৎড়ঢ়বৎ ধফলঁফরপধঃরড়হ এর জন্য তাহিদিগকে উক্ত মোকদ্দমার বিবাদী শ্রেণীভুক্ত করা একান্ত দরকার নচেৎ বাদীগণ উক্ত মোকদ্দমায় সঠিক ডিক্রি ও ন্যায় বিচার পাইবে না। (বসঢ়যধংরং ংঁঢ়ঢ়ষরবফ)<br/>অতএব, হুজুর দয়া করিয়া ন্যায় বিচারের স্বার্থে আরজি ধসবহফসবহঃ করিয়া উপরোক্তা মোকদ্দমায় রাজউক ও ডিপুটি কমিশনার এল, এ, কে পক্ষভুক্ত করিবার আদেশদানে সুবচার করিতে আজ্ঞা হয়।<br/>যে প্রকার আরজি সংশোধন হইবেঃ-<br/>৪। রাজউক (ডি, আই, টি), ডি, আই, টি, বিল্ডিং, মতিঝিল বাণিজ্যিক এলাকা, ঢাকা।<br/>৫। ডিপুটি কমিশনার, এল, এ, কালেকটরিয়েট বিল্ডিং, থানা-কোতযালী, ঢাকা।</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: right;">-----বিবাদীগণ।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Having considered the application for addition of party, we find that though RAJUK and the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka, was made parties to the suit, no relief was sought against them. In the application for addition of party, the plaintiffs stated in no uncertain terms that RAJUK initiated L.A. Case No.02 of 1987-88 for acquiring the suit land along with other lands and that with this end in view, RAJUK had been conducting survey.<br/><br/>Admittedly, gains a   notice   dated 30.04.2007 issued by RAJUK for vacating the land   from   unauthorized   occupation,   the respondents filed Writ Petition No.4609 of 2007 in which Rule Nisi was issued. On 03.02.2009, Rule was discharged with a clear finding that C.S. Plot No.77 measuring 2.12 acres of land stood totally acquired by L.A. Case No.02 of 1987-88 and that the respondents received compensation money for .70 acre of land from the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka and that the rest of the compensation of the portion measuring 1.42 acres of land was received by Abid Khan. Challenging this judgment, the respondents filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1016 of 2009 and upon hearing the parties; this Division dismissed the same on 24.11.2009. Even then the High Court Division held that the suit land was not the acquired land in L.A. Case No.02 of 1987-88 but is situated outside that L.A. Case. Such a glaring erroneous finding contrary to admitted fact cannot sustain in law.<br/><br/>As soon as L. A. Case has been initiated for acquiring the suit land along with other lands, Title Suit No.464 of 1985 should not have proceeded with ads there is a clear bar in respect of such suit under section 44 of Acquisition and Requisition of Immoveable Property  Ordinance, 1982   (in   short,   the Ordinance). Section 44 of the Ordinance is quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"44.Save as otherwise expressly provided </em><em>in this Ordinance, no Court shall entertain any suit or application against any order </em><em>passed or any action taken under this </em><em>Ordinance, and no injunction shall be granted by any Court in respect of any action taken or </em><em>to be taken in pursuance. Of any power </em><em>conferred by or under this Ordinance. "</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the section quoted above, it appears that no Court shall entertain any suit or application against any order passed or action taken under the Ordinance in respect of any action taken or to be taken or under this Ordinance.<br/>In view of the clear bar in section 44 of the Ordinance, the decree passed in Title Suit No.464 of 1985 is a nullity.<br/><br/>The High Court Division came to a finding that after the ex prate, decree RAJUK did not take any step for setting it aside before the Court as per provision of law and that RAJUK failed to prefer an application under Order IX Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure against the ex parte decree and therefore, RAJUK had no locus standi to file the instant civil revision by passing the appellate forum.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the suit land along with other lands was acquired in L.A. Case No.02 of 1987-88 and RAJUK is the requiring body thereof. Since RAJUK has got direct interest in the suit land it was quite competent to bring it to the notice of the Court that a decree which is a nullity was passed against it. In such a case of special nature, delay and procedural defect shall not stand in the way of getting the desired relief. Therefore, the revisional application filed by RAJUK before the High Court Division was quite competent to right the wrong.<br/><br/>The findings arrived at and the decisions made by the High Court Division are not based on proper appreciation of laws and facts and as such can not sustain in law.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed as the decree obtained in Title Suit No.464 of 1985 was a nullity and consequently, the impugned judgment is set aside without any order as to costs.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Subsequently, the schedule was amended on 12.04.1972. The writ-petitioners who are the voters, procured a voter list on 10.04.2012 which was published on 09.04.2012 and came to know that their names have been recorded in the voter list twice. On verification, it was discovered that in most of the cases, the name of each member has been recorded in more than one place in the voter list. On search, the writ-petitioners had been able to find out 500 cases whose names had been recorded in the voter list in more than one place. It has further been stated that Article 10 of the Order of 1972 provides that the Bar Council shall admit persons as Advocates on its roll; to hold examinations for purposes of admission and to remove Advocates from such roll and also to prepare and maintain the roll of Advocates. Article 20 provides that the Bar Council shall prepare and maintain a roll of Advocates. Article 23 provides for entries in the roll in order of seniority and Article 25 provides that the roll shall be made in order of seniority. The roll of Advocates prepared and maintained in accordance with the provisions of P. O. No.46 of 1972 shall be the sole basis for holding the election of the Bar Council but on scrutiny, the list of voters published by the Bar Council on 09.04.2012 shows ex facie that the same was merely consolidation of the members list obtained from various Bar Associations recognized by the Bar Council. Consequently, many Advocates have been shown as voters twice or thrice. The voter list prepared by the Bar Council on the basis of the lists of members of different Bar Associations is illegal. It has further been stated that election is a formal decision making process which cannot be allowed to be frustrated by an election of the national Bar Council on the basis of inflated and illegal voter list.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with Memo No.BBC/Prosha/2012/680(81) dated 14.03.2012 and   the Memo No. BBC/Administration/2012 dated 12.04.2012 issued by the Chairman of  Bangladesh Bar Council, the writ-petitioners   moved   the   High   Court Division by filing Writ Petition No.4546 of 2012 and obtained<em> Rule Nisi.</em><br/> <br/>Writ-respondent No. l, 2 and 4 entered appearances by filing affidavit-in-opposition controvert the material statements made in the writ petition. Their case, in short, is that some names of the voters appeared in the list in more than one polling station and the reason is that the lists sent by the different Bar Associations had been printed by the Bar Council as the voter list. This process has been continuing for a long time. No one raised any objection. At a special meeting held on 29.04.2012, the Bar Council took resolution to omit the names of the voters whose names appeared in the voter list twice. The Bar Council has already made correction of the names of the voters. Some steps for holding the election have already been taken. In such circumstances, the process of election should not be stopped as the learned Advocates are waiting to cast their votes.<br/><br/>The writ-petitioners, by a supplementary affidavit dated 09.05.2012, further stated that they have been able to collect 52 more names in the voters' list whose names have been recorded as voters in more than one place. In the affidavit-in-reply, the writ-petitioners also stated that the statement made in paragraph-4 of the affidavit-in-opposition that "the Bar Council will take all the precaution to see that double voting is checked and accordingly, instruction has been given to the respective presiding officers to that effect" exposes that instruction has replaced the law that requires a consolidated Roll of Advocates under Articles 5, 20, 232 and 25 read with articles 2(d) (e) and (h) of the Order of 1972. The law requires the Bar Council shall publish such list of voters in accordance with Articles 5, 20, 23 and 25 of the Order of 1972 at least 30 days before the polling. The voter list has not been prepared in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>The learned Judges of the High Court Division upon hearing the parties disposed of the Rule by the judgment and order dated 25.05.2012.<br/> <br/>Feeling aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, writ-respondents have  filed this Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1434 of 2012 before this Division.<br/> <br/>Civil Miscellaneous Petition for Leave to Appeal No.623 of 2012 arises out of Writ Petition No.7003 of 2012. In that writ-petition, the petitioner impugned the election schedule dated    20.01.2000 published by writ-respondent No. l fixing the date of election of Bangladesh Bar Council on 17.06.2012 on averments that the schedule is violative of Article 7 of Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Order, 1972 (in short, the Order) and that the election schedule is also violative of Article 9 of the Order of 1972. The impugned election schedule also violates Rule 11 of the Bar Council Rules, 1972.<br/> <br/>The writ-petitioners obtained Rule Nisi and an interim order of stay on the date of issuance of the Rule.<br/> <br/>Civil Miscellaneous Petition for Leave to Appeal No.624 of 2012 arises out of Writ Petition No.7017 of 2012. The aforesaid writ- petition was filed challenging the failure of Bangladesh Bar Council in not concluding the Bar Council election on or before 31st Day of May, 1912 and that the impugned election schedule is violative of Article 8 of the Order of 1972.<br/> <br/>At the time of issuance of the Rule, the petitioner obtained an interim order dated 05.06.2012 staying operation of the election schedule.<br/> <br/>Civil Miscellaneous Petition for Leave to Appeal No.622 of 2012 arises out of Writ Petition No.7045 of 2012. In the aforesaid writ petition, the petitioner challenged the election schedule and the election process on various grounds.<br/> <br/>On 05.06.2012, the High Court Division issued a Rule Nisi and passed an interim order of stay in that writ petition against which this civil miscellaneous petition for leave to appeal has been filed.<br/> <br/>Mr. Abdul Baset Majumder, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the leave-petitioner in Civil Miscellaneous Petitions for leave to Appeal Nos.622-624 of 2012, submits that the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.4546 of 2012 has considered all the points which are involved in the writ petitions from which   the   present   civil miscellaneous cases for leave to appeal arise. He further submits that unless the interim orders of stay passed in the writ petitions are vacated the Bar Council Election cannot be held as per the schedule declared by the Bar Council. He then submits that the Bangladesh Bar Council declared the date of election within time-frame given in Article 8 of the Order of 1972 and that because of the interim orders of stay passed by the High Court Division the schedule had to be changed and that the writ petitions filed subsequent to the disposal of Writ Petition No.4546 of 2012 are new devices to delay the election.<br/> <br/>Mr. A. J. Mohammad AH, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of respondent No. 1 in civil miscellaneous petition for leave to appeal Nos.623-624 of 2012, on the other hand, submits that according to Sub-rule (1) of Rule 11 of the Bangladesh legal Practitioner and Bar Council Rules, 1972 (in short, the rules),the Bar Council is required to publish a voter shall cast his vote at least 30 days before the polling and that admittedly, there are serious faults in the voter list and as such, the election process should start afresh after correct the voter list.<br/> <br/>We have considered the submission of the learned  Advocates, pressured the judgment delivery in Writ Petition No.4546 of 2012 and the records of other write petitions in which the High Court Division issued Ruled and passed interim orders stopping the election schedule of the Bangladesh Bar Council..<br/> <br/>At the very outset, it is important to outset that the Bar Council election should be held a.: expeditiously as possible and therefore, we have decided to dispose of all the civil miscellaneous petitions for leave to appeal and the civil petition for leave to appeal by this common judgment and the writ petitions now awaiting disposal before the High Court Division shall   be  deemed   to   have   been disposed of.<br/> <br/>In order to address the submissions the Article 8 of the Order of 1972 is mandatory and that there is no scope for holding election of the Bangladesh Bar Council beyond the time frame, Article 8 of the Order of 1972 is quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"Elections to the Bar Council shall always, be held so as to conclude on or before the  thirty first day of May<sub>;</sub> in the year in which in term of Bar Council expires."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Chairman of the Bangladesh Bar Council   by   a   circular   dated    14, 03.2012; declared the schedule of election to elect 14  Members    of   Bangladesh   Bar      Council according to Article 8 of the Order of 1972 and the schedule was subsequently amended on 12,04.2012. The amended schedule is saw follows</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Date of submission of nomination paper—from 17.04.2012.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Date of scrutiny ------- 26.04.2012,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Date of withdrawal of nomination paper — -29.04.2012.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Date of holding election ......... 28.05.2012.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Date of filing objection — with one month from the date of publication of the result.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Date   of receiving   objection   by   the Tribunal ......... -05.07.20I2.”<span id="cke_bm_172E" style="display:none"> </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The above schedule reveals that steps were taken to hold the election within 3 1 st day of May according to the mandate of Article 8 of the Order of 1972. Allegations were made that there were serious mistakes in the voter list and that the names of. Many voters have been recorded in the voter list twice and thrice. Therefore, challenging the voter list, the writ petitioner of Writ Petition No.4546 of 2012 obtain a Rule and interim order of stay from the High Court Division and subsequently, the election could riot ho held according to the<br/> <br/>Challenging the interim order of stay, the Bangladesh Bar Council filed a civil miscellaneous petition   for leave to appeal before this Division and the learned Judge-in Chamber stayed the operation of the impugned interim order of stay passed by the High Court Division and directed to connect the voter list within a stipulated date. The Full Court of this Division, How ever, maintained the interim order to stay passed by the High Court and directed a particular Bench of the High Court Division to dispose of Writ Petition No.4546 2012 within a stipulated time. Therefore, it uppers that; he, election could not be held within 31st day of May for fie reasons which were beyond the control of the Bangladesh Bar Council.<br/> <br/>Having gone through Article 8 of the Order to 1972, it appears that no consequence Has been attached to it in the event of failure of the Bar Council to concluded the election within 31<sup>st</sup> day of May of the Bar Council to conclude the ejection within 31st day of May.<br/> <br/>The word "shall" gives an impression that the time-frame given in Article 8 of the Order of 1972 is intended to be mandatory. The article requires to be considered in the light of the intention of the legislature by carefully construing the scope of the statute and the consequences that flow from the construction there of.<br/> <br/>Where a statute requires something to be done or to be done in a particular manner and the consequences of failure to do so are also provided, no difficulty arises and the provision is construed as mandatory. But where the statute requires something to be done or to I have done in a particular manner without specifying the   consequences   of   noncompliance, a question arises as to whether the requirement is to be construed as merely directory, or as imperative or mandatory.<br/> <br/>Henry Cambell Black in his handbook on Constitution and Interpretation of Laws 334 1896 opined:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"A provision is said to be mandatory when disobedience to it or want of exact compliance with it will make the ad done under the statute absolutely void.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Craies on Statute Law, 6th Ed. opined:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"The terms "mandatory" and "directory" refer to the method by which the legislature sets about attaining its object. When a statute is passed for the purpose of enabling something to be done and prescribes the formalities which are to attend its performa-nce, those prescribed formalities which are essential to the validity of the thing when done are called imperative (or mandatory); but those which are not essential, and may be disregarded without invalidating the thing to be dine, are called director-.!. "</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of HV Kamath vs Ishaque (1955)1 SCR 1104 (1126) it was held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"The practical bearing of the distinction between a provision which is mandatory and one which is directory is that while the former must be strictly observed, in the case of the latter it is sufficient that it is substantially complied with."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Thomas M Cooley in his book "A Treatise on Constitutional Limitations" 1868 (Third print) P 74 2004 wrote as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"In respect to statutes it has long been settled that particular provisions may be regarded as directory merely; by which is meant that they are to be considered as giving directions which ought to be followed, but not as so limiting the power in respect to which the directions are given that it cannot be effectually exercised without observing them. There are cases where, whether a statute was to be regarded as merely directory or not, was made to depend upon the employment or failing to employ negative words which imported that the act should be done in a particular manner or time, and not otherwise. The use of such words is often very conclusive of intent to impose a limitation; but their absence is by no means equally conclusive that the statute was not destined to be mandatory. Lord Mansfield would have the question whether mandatory or not depends upon whether that which was directed to the done was or was not of the essence of the thing required. The Supreme Court of New York, in an opinion afterwards approved by the Court of Appeals, laid down the rule as one settled by authority, that "statutes directing the mode of proceeding by public officers are directory, and are not regarded as essential to the validity of the proceedings themselves, unless it be so declared in the statute.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>But many regulations are made by statutes designed for the information of assessors and</em><em> officers, and intended to promote method, system and uniformity in the modes of proceeding, compliance or non-compliance with which does in no respect affect the rights of tax paying citizens. These may be considered directory. Officers may be liable to legal animadversion, perhaps to punishment, for not observing them; but yet their observance is not a condition precedent to the validity of the tax."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of AHM Mustafa Kamal vs. Bangladesh (2009) 61 DLR (AD) 10, this Division held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"Since no consequence has been provided for the provisions both in section 6A of the Criminal Law Amendment Act and Rule 19Ka of the EP Rules, 2007, they are directory in nature and the Court shall not become Functus officio even after the expiry of stipulated period."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Md Delwar Hossain vs. State reported in 2006 BLD (AD) 109 this Division considered whether section 20 of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 1995 providing for conclusion of the trial within 120 days is directory or mandatory. This Division held that sub-section 2 of section does not provide for a consequence for failure of the trial Court to conclude the trial within 120 days. The provision is not mandatory rather directory.<br/> <br/>From the cases referred to above, it appears that unless consequence is provided, a provision though appears to be mandatory is directory.<br/> <br/>Bangladesh Bar Council did not have any latches in not holding the election within 31<sup>st</sup> day of May in the year in which the terms of the Bar Council expired and because of intervention of the Court the election could not be held. Though the language of Article 8 of the Order of 1972 appears to be mandatory no consequence has been attached thereto. Therefore, Article 8 of the Order of 1972 is directory and not mandatory.<br/> <br/>Article 20 of the Order of 1972 provides that that the Bar Council shall prepare and<br/>maintain a roll of Advocates. The provision of this Article is quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"20. The Bar Council shall prepare and maintain a roll of advocates in which shall be entered the names of-</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>a. all persons who were, as advocates, entitled to practice in the High Court or in any court subordinate to the High Court ultimately before the commencement of this order;</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>b. all persons who are admitted as advocates under the provisions of this Order. "</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Rule 11 of the Rules provides for preparation of voter list and casting of votes. Rule 11 is quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"11. (1) The Bar Council shall publish a list of voters showing at which polling station a particular voter shall cast his vote at least thirty days before the polling.</em><br/><em>Provided that the Bar Council shall have power to add to the list till the polling</em><br/><em>Provided further that no person shall be entitled to vote if he ceases to be an Advocate before the poll</em><br/><em>(2) All voters shall cast their votes at the polling stations indicated in the list except persons appointed as polling agents who shall be entitled to cast their votes at the polling station for which they have been appointed. A candidate can cast his vote at any polling station."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Having considered the provisions of Article 20 of the Order of 1972 and Rule 11 of AD# 10 (Forma No. 3) the Rules, in general, and Sub-rule (1) of rule 11, in particular, we are of the view that the Bar Council is required to publish a correct voter list at least 30 days before the polling. A voter list containing innumerable mistakes can not be regarded as a voter list as contemplated under Sub-rule (1) of Rule 11 although the first proviso to it states that the Bar Council shall have the power to add to the list till the polling. This proviso does not allow the Bangladesh Bar Council to delete the names of 500 to 600 voters from the voter list before the polling. In addition, the candidates must know before participation in the election about the exact number of voters in the roll. Though it is not expected that a learned Advocate whose name is recorded as voter in more than one Bar Association will not cast his vote in more than one Bar Association, there may be a few unscrupulous ones who may cast their votes in more than one Bar Association. The preparation of correct voter list is an important part of the election process and a voter list containing duplication and triplication of the names of some of the voters must be corrected before declaration of election schedule.<br/> <br/>Having given our anxious consideration try the facts and circumstances of the cases, we feel that the Bar Council should be run by elected representatives and as such, tile election of the Bar Council should be held as expeditiously as possible. We also feel that keeping the litigations pending in the High Court Division; it is not possible to initiate the election process afresh.<br/> <br/>This Division previously exercised the power of doing complete justice under article 104 of the Constitution in several cases including the cases of M/s. Gannysons Ltd. and other vs. Sonali  Bank and others, (l985)37 DLR  (AD)42 and AFM  Naziruddin vs. Mrs. Hameeda Banu, (1993) 45 DLR (AD) 38. The subject-matter of the instant case not only presents an occasion to but also demands, exercise of the power of this Division.<br/> <br/>Therefore, we have decided to dispose of all the civil miscellaneous petitions for leave to appeal and the civil petition for leave to appeal. In order to ensure free and fair election, a fresh schedule should be published by the Bar Council after correcting the voter list so that there can not be duplications and triplications of some voters in different Bar Associations. Therefore, all the cases are disposed of on the following terms:<br/><br/>Civil Miscellaneous Petition Nos.622-624 of 2012, Writ Petition Nos.7045, 7003 and 7017 of 2012 out of which the above civil miscellaneous petitions arose and civil petition for leave to appeal No. 1434 of 2017 are disposed of.<br/><br/>The declaration of election schedule by the Bangladesh Bar Council for holding election of Bar Council for the term from 2012 to 2015 is cancelled. The election of Bangladesh Bar Council shall be held within 30 days from date according to the following schedule;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Date of filing of nomination paper by 25.06.2012.<br/>Date of scrutiny: 28.06.2012.<br/>Date of withdrawal: 05.07.2012.<br/>Date of election: 18.07.2012.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Bangladesh Bar Council is directed to publish the above schedule by 19.06.2012.<br/> <br/>The tenure of the incumbent Bangladesh Bar Council is extended till 30th July, 2012 or till publication of the election result in the official Gazette, whichever is earlier.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

Shamsul Huda, J:</strong></span><br/><br/>This Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal is directed on behalf of the petitioner against the judgment and order dated 3.12.2009 passed by the High Court Division in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 27508 of 2009, summarily rejecting the application under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure and affirming the order dated 18.11.2009 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Faridpur in Criminal Revision No. 85 of 2009, summarily rejecting the revisional application preferred against the order dated 29.10.2009 passed by the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Faridpur in Complaint Case No. C-128 of 2007 rejecting an application under Section 241A of the Code of Criminal Procedure and framing charge under Section 40A of the Electricity Act, 1910.<br/><br/>The facts relevant for disposal of the Petition for Leave to Appeal, in short, are that one Md. Anowarul Haque, Assistant Engineer, Power Development Board, Faridpur Area, Faridpur filed a petition of complaint in the Court of Magistrate, Power Development Board, Faridpur Area, Faridpur alleging inter alia that the brother of the accused took electricity connection for his fishery project who died recently. The accused petitioner is the Managing Director of the said fishery project and there are dues of Tk. 3, 01,445/- to the aforesaid fishery project as arrear electricity bill. After hearing the parties and considering the application under Section 241A of the Code of Criminal Procedure filed by the accused petitioner herein, the learned Magistrate rejected the same. Thereafter, he preferred Criminal Revision under Section 439A of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the learned Sessions Judge, Faridpur who by his judgment and order dated 18.11.2009 summarily rejected the revisional application.<br/><br/>The petitioner herein thereafter preferred Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 27508 of 2009 under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the High Court Division challenging the propriety of the aforesaid order of the learned Sessions Judge, Faridpur.<br/><br/>A Division Bench of the High Court Division after hearing the learned Advocate for the petitioner summarily rejected the aforesaid  application   by   its   order  dated 3.12.2009 holding inter alia that the electricity connection was taken for the fishery firm, named and styled as "Silver Carp Ltd." Of which   the   accused   petitioner   was   the Managing Director. Although during life time of Syed Joglul Ali  Pasha electricity was consumed for the aforesaid Fishery Firm and there was dues of Tk. 3,01,4457- only as electricity charge for which electricity line was  disconnected  on  27.2.2005,   but  the accused petitioner herein without paying the said amount reinstated the electricity line un authqrisedly.<br/><br/>Mr. S.N. Goswami, learned Advocate for the   petitioner   submits   that   the   learned  Magistrate     took     cognizance     without considering the fact that the fishery firm belonged to his brother Syed Joglul Ali Pasha, who consumed the electricity and he died leaving   sons   and   daughters,    who   has responsibility  to  pay  the   dues   and   thus committed illegality in taking cognizance against the petitioner herein. On the other hand the learned Sessions Judge most illegally passed the judgment and order rejecting the revisional application summarily, which is a non speaking order and at the same time the High Court Division also committed illegality in rejecting the application under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure on misconception of law and facts.<br/><br/>Heard the learned Advocate for the petitioner, perused the leave petition, petition of complaint and application under Section 241A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, filed before the learned Magistrate, Power Development Board, Faridpur Area, Faridpur. Facts stated in the aforesaid application under Section 241A of the Code of Criminal Procedure are nothing but defence pleas which cannot be considered at the time of framing of charge. In view of above facts the learned Sessions Judge, Faridpur committed no illegality in rejecting the revisional application under Section 439A of the Code of Criminal Procedure summarily. The High Court Division passed the impugned judgment and order considering the relevant facts and law and summarily rejected the application under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure the same is not maintainable.<br/><br/>Whether the petitioner being Managing Director of the Fishery project, namely "Silver Carp Ltd." is responsible to pay the dues as stated above is a contentious question of facts which can not be resolved in proceeding under Section 561 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, except trial.<br/><br/>We do not find any illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgment and no interference is called for.<br/><br/>In the result, the Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal is summarily dismissed.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
