TAFAZZUL ISLAM, J:</strong></span><br/><br/>This appeal by leave is directed against the judgment and order passed on 23.6.1997 in Civil Revision No.908 of 1991 by a Single Bench of the High Court Division discharging the Rule obtained against the judgment and decree dated 20.10.1990 of the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Kurigram passed in Other Appeal No.78 of 1987 setting aside those of dated 30.7.1987 by the learned Assistant Judge, Fulbari, in Other Suit No. 37 of 1986 decreeing the suit.<br/><br/>The appellants, as plaintiffs, filed the above Other Suit No.37 of 1986 for declaration of their title in the suit land on the averments that the suit land originally belonged Moharaja Jogodipendra Narayan Bhup Bahadur and Abdul Hafez Ahmed Talukder, their uncle, in the year 1351 B.S, took settlement of the same at a rental of Taka 14.50 and since then Abdul Hafiz Ahmed Talukder possessed the suit land on his own right and after his death the plaintiffs, as his heirs, had been possessing the suit land; due to the prolonged illness of the plaintiff no. 1, who was the tadbirker on behalf of the all plaintiffs, the defendants in collusion with the staffs of the Settlement Office, in the R.S. Record, fraudulently recorded 3.22 acres in the name of the defendants 1-5 arid 3.23 acres in the name of defendants 6-8 which clouded the title of the plaintiffs in the suit land and hence the suit.<br/><br/>The defendants 3-7 filed written statement, contending that the suit land belonged to Abdul Hafez Ahmed Talukder who died leaving his own brother Abdul Gafur Talukder, the father of the plaintiffs, and from Abdul Gafur Talukder the defendant Nos.1-5 took settlement of 3.22 acres and defendant 6-8 took settlement of 3.23 acres of land out of the suit land and then the defendant No.l executed kabuliyat on behalf of the defendant Nos.1-5 and the defendant No. 6 executed kabuliyat on behalf of defendant Nos. 6-8 both in favour of Abdul Gafur Talukdar and both the kabuliyats were executed and registered on 5.4.54 and since then they have been possessing the suit land and the plaintiffs out of greed filed the suit.<br/><br/>The learned Assistant Judge, Fulbari, after hearing, decreed the suit. On appeal the learned Subordinate Judge (Now Joint District Judge) Kurigram allowed the appeal. Thereafter the petitioners moved the High Court Division and obtained Rule in Civil Revision No. 908 of 1991 and after hearing the High Court Division discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>The learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the High Court Division fell in error in not considering that the defendants could not produce any witness or documents to prove that Abdul Gafur Talukder, did accept the kabuliyats, Ext. Uma, on which the defendants relied and further the plaintiffs also proved their possession in the suit land and on consideration of the materials on record the trial court duly found that the entry in the R.S record is wrong and there is also no evidence to prove that Abdul Gafur Talukdar ever accepted the kabuliyats executed by the defendants but the appellate Court, without reversing the material findings of the trial court erroneously allowed the appeal holding that the defendants acquired title and possession in the land in suit on the basis of kabuliyat Ext. Uma and dakhiles <em>Exts. </em>Ga(2) and Ga(5). The learned counsel further submits that the High Court Division also failed to consider that inspite of clear assertion of the plaintiffs that Ext. Urna and Exts.Ga(2) arid Ga(5) are fabricated and false those exhibits were not sent to experts for comparison of the hand writings of Abdul Gafur Talukder specially when Jashimuddin and Hori, the defendant Nos.l and 6 respectively in their deposition stated that they were present at the house of Abdul Gafur Talukder on 22 Choitra, 1360 B.S at 10.11 AM while he granted those dakhilas but the contents of the certified copies of the kabuliyats show that they at the same date and time were present at Calsonirhat Sub-Registry Office for registration of the kabuliyat and the distance between the two places is about 10 to 12 miles.<br/><br/>As it appears the High Court Division found that the appellate Court allowed the appeal holding that (a) even if for arguments sake it is conceded that the defendants could not give satisfactory explanation to the points raised by the plaintiffs but that would not improve the case of the plaintiffs because it is the cardinal principle of law that the plaintiff is to prove his own case and he must not rely on the weakness or defects of the defendants case (b) the plaintiffs failed to adduce any reliable documentary or oral evidence in support of their contention that the kabuliyat dated 5.4.1954 executed by the defendants in favour of Abdul Gafur are not genuine documents or that the same was not acted upon, (c) the R.S. Khatian was prepared in the names of the defendants (d) the defendants paid rent to Abdul Gafur and subsequently to the Government Acquired Estate which show that the defendants have been possessing the suit land (e) if the evidence, both documentary and oral, adduced by the parties are weighed it will be seen that the evidence adduced by the defendants stands on a better footing, (f) the trial Court only discussed the evidence of P.Ws. without discussing the evidence of the D.Ws. and did not consider the registered kabuliyats in their properperspective. The High Court Division further found that though the appellate Court did not elaborately discuss the evidence adduced by the parties in support of their respective cases but gave specific finding that the plaintiffs could not prove their title and possession and on the other hand the defendants have been able to prove their title and possession in the land in suit and that the registered kabuliyats of the year 1954, the dakhilas granted by Abdul Gafur Talukder, the preparation of R.S. Khatian in the name of the defendants and the payment of rents by the defendants to the Government Acquired Estate by Dakhilas, Ext. Ka series, go to show that the defendants are in possession of the suit land and they also adduced oral evidence in support of their possession. The High Court Division also found that there being no misreading and non-consideration of material evidence on record and misconstruction of the document and the conclusion arrived at by the appellate Court being based on the evidence on record, the appellate Court did not commit any error of law which calls for interference.<br/><br/>We are of the view that the High Court Division on proper consideration of the evidence and materials on record arrived at a correct decision. The learned counsel could not point at any illegality or infirmity in the decision of the High Court Division so as to call for interference.<br/><br/>The appeal is dismissed with cost at all stages.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Shahidul Huq, J:</strong></span><br/> <br/>The order   dated 19.05.2010 passed by learned Joint District Judge,  1<sup>st</sup>  Court, Gazipur in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 66 of 2008  arising out of the order dated 18.9.2008 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, 4<sup>th</sup> Court, Gazipur in Miscellaneous Case No. 17 of 1999 allowing the appeal has been called in question by invoking the revisional jurisdiction on laying an application under section 115 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure in which a single Judge of this Court on perusal of the impugned judgment issued rule calling upon the opposite party to show cause as to why the judgment and order dated 19.5.2010  complained of in the petition moved in court today-should not be set aside should not be set aside or any other order/ or orders as to this court deem fit and proper.<br/> <br/>The short facts for disposal of the rule is that the opposite party No.1-appellant as petitioner has filed an application under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act being Miscellaneous Case No. 17 of 1999 for pre-emption alleging inter-alia that he is the co-sharer by purchase to the case property (Jote) wherein the pre-emptee opposite party No.  1 is a stranger thereto that opposite party No. 2 has transferred the case land to opposite party No. 1 by a registered sale deed dated 23.9.1995 at a consideration of Taka 70,000/- only but no notice of sale has been served upon him a requirement under section 89 of the SAT Act. It has further alleged that the opposite party No. 1 had been in possession prior to the disputed sale and as such he know nothing about the disputed sale and when has learnt about the transfer only on 1.4.1997. He thereafter has filed the Miscellaneous Case for pre-emption.<br/> <br/>Pre-emptee opposite party No. 1 has contested the case by filing written objection denying all the material allegations of the petition for pre-emption and contended inter alia that the petitioner is not a co-sharer to the case land and as such he has no locus standi to pray for pre-emption of the case land and that the application is barred by limitation defect of parties and the pre-emptee opposite party No. 1 has spent Taka 86,00,000/= towards improvement of the land and set up a Diary farm and digged a huge pond and as such the case is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>During trial the petitioner-opposite party has examined 3 witnesses while the contesting opposite party No. 1 examined 4 witnesses in support of their respective case.<br/> <br/>After hearing both the parties the learned trial Court allowed the preemption by judgment dated 29.01.2001.<br/> <br/>Against the aforesaid judgment and order allowing pre-emption Miscellaneous Appeal No. 4 of 2001 has been filed which has been heard by the Subordinate Judge who by his judgment and order dated 25.4.2004 has been pleased to send back the case on remand with direction to assess the improvement cost only and the learned trial Court on receipt of the case and upon hearing the parties by his order dated 18.09.2008 has been pleased to reject  the prayer for pre-emption on the point of maintainability as the application seeking pre-emption has been filed before amendment to section 96 in 1996.<br/> <br/>Against the said judgment and order dated 18.9.2008 the opposite party has filed Miscellaneous Appeal no. 66 of 2008 before the District judge, Gazipur on the ground that when the Appellate Court remand the case for inquiry or taking evidence or special direction the trial Court have to act within the limits set down by the remand order and cannot reopen the finding of the appellate Court. It has to comply with the order of remand exactly on remand it is not open to the trial Court to do anything but to carry out the terms of the remand order even if it considers that not to be in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>The learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Curt Gazipur upon reading the case of the contesting parties on considering the oral and documentary evidence on record allowed the Miscellaneous Appeal No. 66 of 2008 by his judgment and Order dated 19.05.2010.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 19.05.2010 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Gazipur in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 66 of 2008 arising out of order dated 18.09.2008 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, 4<sup>th</sup> Court, Gazipur in Miscellaneous Case No. 17 the petitioner moved this application  under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/>At the trial the pre-emptor examined 3 witnesses on the other hand contesting opposite party Nol. 1 examined 4 witnesses in support of their respective cases.<br/> <br/>Mr. Yusuf Hossain Humayun the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner submits that the appellate Court without appreciating the spirit of the judgment and order passed by the trial Court and has arrived at an erroneous finding. The learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner further submits that the learned appellate Court has set aside the judgment and order of the trial Court as it has traveled beyond the direction of the Appellate Court while sending on remand but in so doing it has not considered the fact that if a case is found to be suffering from basic requirement such as limitation, defect of parties and maintainability there can not be legal bar to take into consideration of such issues. The learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner also submits that the learned appellate Court while found that the application for pre-emption suffers from gross defect of parties and maintainability on the face of papers produced and that there is specific and undisputed documentary and oral evidence that the petitioner-opposite party has had knowledge about the transfer the case land and development of the same by the opposite party-petitioner and that he presented the application after amendment to section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act 1950  and as such the application is not legally maintainable and is hopelessly barred by limitation it ought to have upheld the judgment and order of the trial Court. The learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner lastly submits that the learned Appellate Court while setting aside the judgment and order of the trial Court has failed to consider the admitted fact that the petitioner has a Diary Farm over the land and excavated a huge tank in the case land.<br/> <br/>While on the other hand Mr. Probir Neogi the learned Advocate appearing for the Opposite party No. 1 submits that the pre-emptor is a co-sharer by purchase to the case jote and the pre-emptee opposite party No. 1 is a stranger. The opposite party No. 2 transferred the case land to the opposite party No. 1 by a registered kabala deed dated 23.09.1995 at a consideration of Tk. 70.000/- but no notice of the disputed sale was served upon him as required under section 89 of the SAT Act and the opposite party No. 1 had been in possession prior to the disputed sale. The learned Advocate appearing for the opposite party further submits that the applicant is not co-sharer to the case jote and as such he has no locus-standi to file the pre-emption case and the case is barred by limitation and as such the application for pre-emption is liable to be rejected. The learned Advocate for the opposite party lastly submits that the opposite party No. 1 spent Tk. 86,00,000/- for improvement of the land by making a Diary Farm digging  pond and as such the rule is liable to be discharged<br/> <br/>Heard the learned Advocates of both sides perused the revisional application, judgment of the Courts below examined the witnesses of P.Ws. and D.Ws. and other connected papers. It appears that the learned Court of appeal below has justified the finding of the learned Assistant Judge. The Appellate Court however in the operative portion of his judgment rightly observed that "নিন্ম আদালত মনে করেন যে স্বামী দীঘি খননের আংশিক কার্য সম্পন্ন হইয়াছে যা প্রকল্পের কাজ পুরণ করিয়াছেন। উহা প্রদানের জন্য এডভোকেট কমিশনের মাধ্যমে পরিদর্শন বা পরিমাপ করান নাই বা কত টাকা খরচ করিয়েছেন এমন কোন উন্নয়ন খরচ ব্যয়ের অংশের টাকা উল্লেখ করেন নাই কিন্তু আপীলকারী ১নং তরফজ্বব£ লিখিত আপত্তি দৃষ্টে দেখা যায় যে তাহারা প্রকল্পের ৮৬ লক্ষ টাকা ব্যয় বরাদ্দ করিয়াছেন এবং ব্যাপক বিনিয়োগ করিয়াছেন। ফলে প্রকৃত পক্ষেই আপীলকারী ১নং তরফছানী সালিশী সম গন্ডিতে তাহার প্রজেক্ট ব্যয় বায়নের কি কি স্থাপনা নির্মান করিয়াছে তাহাতে কি কি পরিমান ব্যয় হইয়াছে তাহা বিশদ ভাবে সাক্ষ্য প্রমান দ্বারা ও ষস্বখবস ঈজ্জঢ়লভখহব  দ্বারা নির্ণয়ের দাবী রাখে। ফলে উক্ত বিষয়টি নির্ধারণের আলোকে অর্থাৎ শুধুমাত্র আপীলকারী ১নং তরফদাবীর বিনিয়োগ প্রমানের লক্ষ্যে মূল মোকদ্দমাটি রিমান্ডে প্রেরন করা যাইতে পারে বলিয়া প্রতিয়মান হয়."<br/> <br/>Considering this findings the learned lower Court ought to have considered the law relating to remand order under order 41 rule 23 of the Code of Civil Procedure minutely in depth. Where the procedure laid down to be followed after a case is remanded depend upon the direction given in the remand order. When the appellate court remand the case for further evidence regarding improvement the trial court to have act within the limits set down by the remand order and can not open the finding of the appellate court. In this connection it is very much pertinent to explain the word remand which has been well explained in Order 41 Rule 23 which runs as follows: “ Where the Court from whose decree an appeal is preferred has disposed of the suit upon a preliminary point and the decree is reversed in appeal, the Appellate Court may, if it thinks fit, by order remand the case, and may further direct what issue or issues shall be tried in the case so remand, and shall send a copy of its judgment and order to the Court from whose decree the appeals preferred, with directions to re-admit the suit under its original number in the register of civil suits, and proceed to determine the suit; and the evidence (if any) record during the original trial shall, subject to all just exceptions, be evidence during the trial after remand”.<br/> <br/>In the above facts and circumstances and the observation as made in the body of the judgment of the lower appellate court under Order 41 Rule 23 of the Code of Civil Procedure we are of the view that the impugned judgment of the final Court of facts does not suffer from any illegality infirmity and perversity and no error has committed  by the final court of fact and as such we are not inclined to interfere  the judgment and order of the lower appellate Court and hence we find that lower appellate Court did not commit any wrong in affirming  the judgment and order of the trial Court.<br/> <br/>Rules 4 and 5 of Section 89 of the State Acquisition and  Tenancy Act runs as follows :<br/><br/><strong>        “(4) </strong>If  the transfer of a portion or share of such  a holding be one to which the provisions of section 96 apply, there shall be filed notices  giving particulars of the transfer in the prescribed form together with process  fees prescribed for the service thereof on all the co-sharer tenants of the said holding who are not parties to the transfer and for affixing a copy thereof in the office of the Registering Officer or the Court house or the Office of the Revenue Authority, as the case may be.<br/>        <strong>(5)</strong> The Court, Revenue Authority or Registering, as the case may be, shall transmit the notice referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1) to the Revenue-officer and shall serve the notice on the co-sharer tenants  referred to in sub-section (4) by registered post and shall cause a copy of the notice to be affixed in the Court house or in the Office of the Revenue Authority or of the Registering Officer, as the case may be”.<br/> <br/>The  aforesaid provision of law  as laid down  in Sub-section 4 and 5 of Section 89 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act are fully applicable  in the facts and circumstances of the present case. So in view of the aforesaid provision of law we have no hesitation  to accept the submission as advanced  by the learned Advocate appearing for the opposite party accordingly the petitioner has failed to show any error, illegality , infirmity and perversity in the impugned judgment and order of the lower Appellate Court and consequently  the impugned judgment and order of the lower Appellate Court does not deserve any interference by us under the revisional jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court as laid down under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/>In that view of the matter the impugned judgment and order of the learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Gazipur does not suffer from any illegality infirmity and perversity and as such the same does not call for any interference under the revisional jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court. Accordingly the revisional application filed under section 115(1) is devoid of any substance accordingly the  Rule  fails.      <br/> <br/>In the result the rule is discharged without any order as to costs. The impugned Judgment and order dated 19.05.2010 passed by the learned Joint District  Judge, 1<sup>st</sup>  Court, Gazipur in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 66 of 2008 is hereby affirmed and the judgment and order dated 18.09.2008  passed  by the learned Assistant Judge 4<sup>th</sup> Court Gazipur in Miscellaneous Case No. 17 of 1999  is hereby set aside.<br/> <br/>The order of stay as granted at the time of issuance of the rule is hereby recalled and vacated.<br/>      <br/>Send down the lower Court’s records along with a copy of this judgment to the concern court immediately for information and necessary action.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Shahidul Huq, J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This appeal at the instance of plaintiff is directed against the judgment and decree dated 29.05.2008 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Sylhet in Title Suit No. 32 of 2006.<br/> <br/>The short facts for disposal of plaintiff’s case is that, the schedule of the plaint was originally belonged to Padma Lochon Deb who died leaving behind two sons namely Pabitra Chandan Deb. and Ram Charan Deb. Thereafter Ram Charan died leaving behind his only son Raj Kumar Deb and Raj Kumar died unmarried leaving behind his full paternal uncle Pabitra Charan Deb. The record of right was prepared in the name of Pabitra Charan Deb and Raj Kumar Deb. Raj Kumar Deb also left his sister’s son Jahnabi Charan Deb. Thereafter, Jahnabi Charan Deb died leaving behind 3 sons namely Umesh Chandra Deb. Omorendra Kumar Deb and Abani Kumar  Deb. Umesh Chandra died leaving behind his wife  Anzoli Rani Deb and 2 sons Ajoy Kumar Deb and Bidhan Kumar Deb. The said Amorendra Kumar Deb died leaving behind his wife Nilima Rani Deb and 4 sons Moloy Kumar Deb. Prithesh Kumar Deb.Rijush Kumar Deb and Bikash Kumar Deb. Thereafter Pijush Kumar Deb died unmarried leaving his mother Nilima Rani Deb and 3 brothers  Moloy  Kumar, Deb Pritish Kumar Deb  and Bikash Kumar Deb. In  this way the plaintiffs got the suits land. Thereafter separate Khatian No. 1119 was opened in their names and rent was also realised. The finally published Khataindid not contain the names of the predecessors of the present defendants as licensee and this fact is admitted by the defendants on filing the application dated 27.08.02 to the Assistant Commissioner (Land, Sylhet for consideration of the order of mutation in favour of the plaintiffs. The defendants as well as their predecessors never denied the title of the plaintiffs. The possession of the defendants legally construed to be the possession of the plaintiffs or their predecessors. The defendants have no locustandi to challenge the order passed in the mutation case in favour of the plaintiff. The objection filed in the mutation case  No.408/01-02 before the Assistant Commissioner (land) Sadar, Shlhet dated  13.08.01 under misconception of law  and the subsequent order dated 27.08.02 obtained by the defendants in the mutation case tentamounts to hostile attitude of the licensee defendants against the plaintiffs. The defendants have no title in the land except a licensee.  Pabitra Chandra Deb Raj Kumar Deb, never proposed to sale the disputed property to Gojendra Kumar Deb. He did not realiseTk. 100.00 from Pabitra Charan Deb and Raj Kumar Deb on 01.07.1952 A.D. Accordingly in the written statement of Title Suit No. 32 of 2006 Gojendra Kumar Deb never paid of Tk. 60.00 to Pabitra Charan Deb on 02.08.52 or paid Tk. 40.00 to Raj Kumar Deb on 05.09.52 A.D. Raj Kumar Deb and Pabitra Kumar Deb did not  execute any receipts on 01.07.52. The said receipt is forged. In the written statement the defendants of T.S. 32 of 2006 categorically denied the case of the plaintiff-side. In the circumstances they prayed for a  decree in T.S. No. 177  of 2006 and prayed dismissal of T.S. No. 32 of 2006.<br/> <br/>On the other hand, the case of the defendant are that the suit that the disputed property described in the schedule of the plaint of the above suit was originally owned by Pabitra Charan Deb and Raj Kumar Deb. They proposed to sale the property when the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff Gojendra Kumar Deb accepted the proposal and accordingly  price of the land was settled of Tk. 200.00. Both the parties agreed to realise money by instalments. Then Tk. 100.00 was realised on 1.7.52 and after receiving money by Raj Kumar Deb a receipt was given to the purchaser where both the owners put their signatures. Then Tk. 60.00 was paid on 02.08.1952 and the rest of Tk. 40.00 was realised on  05.09.1952 and they also gave receipt to the purchaser. Thereafter  the possession of the land was handed over to the predecessor-in-interest a receipt of acknowle-dging the money from the plaintiffs. There was an agreement between the parties of executing and registering  kabala deed in favour of the plaintiff-side. Finally the defendant  Nos. 1-2 did not execute and register the same. The plaintiff of T.S. No. 32/06 have been possessing the land for more than 50 years by realising Government Taxes. They have got mutated their names in respect of disputed  land. The defendants of  T.S. No. 32/06 have collusively mutated their names  in respect of  suit land. In the circumstances,  they prayed for dismissal of T.S. 177/06 and also prayed a decree in T.S. No. 32/06.<br/> <br/>After perusing the pleadings of both the sides, following issues are framed for the ends of justice.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether T.S. No. 177/06 and T.S. No. 32/06 are maintainable in their present form ?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether plaintiffs of both the suits have title and possession over the disputed land?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether Tk.200.00 was settled as price of the land dscribed in the plaint of T.S. No. 32/06?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether both the plaintiffs are entitled to get relief as prayed for.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The plaintiffs examined 4 witnesses and submitted some documents which have been marked as Exts. No. 1-9. On the other hand the defendants side examined 5 witnesses before the Court and submitted documents of their side are marked as Exts. Kha – Tha.  <br/> <br/>Mr. Abdul Baset Majumder  the learned Advocate appearing for the appellant  submits that the judgment and decree passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Sylhet is not justified by facts and circumstances of the case as  such liable to be set aside and the judgment and decree of the trial court is against the materials and evidence on record which caused failure of justice and the issues framed ought to have been decided in favour of the appellants and thus judgment and decree is liable to be set –aside.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate appearing for the appellant further submits that the plaintiffs failed to prove their title over the suit land on the basis of purchase, conversely the defendants have  been able to  prove their title over the suit land and as such the trial Court was obligated to dismiss the suit and decree the suit filed by the defendant appellant but the trial   court failed to consider those vital aspects of the case and erroneously decreed the suit filed by the plaintiffs which caused failure of justice and the plaintiffs relicense  under the defendant in respect of the suit land, their possession cannot be adverse against the defendant but the trial court without appreciating that vital fact erroneously decreed the suit which caused failure of justice.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate appearing for the appellant also submits that the plaintiffs failed to produce any purchased deed in support of their purported purchase and also payment of money for alleged purchase in spite of that the trial court decreed the suit which caused serious miscarriage of justice.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate appearing for the appellant then submits that mere existence of structure and residing therein does not prove that the plaintiffs have title and possession on the basis of title over the suit land but the trial Court without considering those fact erroneou-sly decreed the suit which caused failure of justice and the trial Court without considering the attending facts and circumstance of the case relied only the possession of the plaintiffs over the suit land. In fact the possession of the plaintiffs are on the basis of license granted by the plaintiff and as such the trial Court ought to have dismiss the suit filed by the plaintiffs and decreed the suit filed by the defendant.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate appearing for the appellant further submits that the ingredient of adverse possession as claimed by the plaintiffs re conspicuously absent in the present suit but the trial Court without considering those facts decreed the suit which caused serious miscarriage of justice. The learned Advocate appearing for the appellant lastly submits that as a licensee the plaintiffs on the basis of their possession availed the opportunity of having connection of electricity and gas line which does not signify that they have title over the suit land but the trial court relying upon those factors erroneously decreed the suit which caused failure of justice and the trial Court failed to apply his judicial mind while disposing the issues which caused serious miscarriage of justice. So in any view of the matter the impugned judgment and decree passed by the trial Court is liable to be set aside.  The learned Advocate appearing for the appellant in course of his submission cited the case of <strong><em>Salma Khatun and others -Vs- Zilla parishad</em></strong>, Chittagong represented by its Secretary and another reported in 51 D.L.R page 257.<br/> <br/>On the other hand Mr. Abdul Quayum with Mr. Md. Ali Reza the learned Advocate appearing for the respondent submit that suit property was originally owned by Pabitra Charan Deb and Raj Kumar Deb. They proposed to sale the property when the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff Gojendra Kumar Deb accepted the proposal and accordingly price of the land was settled at Tk. 200.00. Both the parties agreed to realise money by instalments. Then Tk. 100.00 was realised on 1.7.52 and after receiving money by Raj Kumar Deb a receipt was given to the purchaser where both the owners put their signatures. Then Tk. 60.00 was paid on 02.08.1952 and the rest of Tk. 40.00 was realised on 05.09.1952 and they also gave receipt to the purchaser. Thereafter the possession of the land was handed over to the predecessor-in-interest a receipt of acknowledging the money from the plaintiffs. There was an agreement between the parties of executing and registering kabala deed in favour of the plaintiff-side. Finally the defendant Nos. 1-2 did not execute and register the same. The plaintiff of T.S. No. 32/06 have been possessing the land for more than 50 years by realising Government Taxes. They have got mutated their names in respect of disputed land. The defendants of T.S. No. 32/06 have collusively mutated their names in respect of suit land. In the circumstances, they prayed for dismissal of T.S. 177/06 and also prayed a decree in T.S. No. 32/06. The learned Advocate appearing for the respondent in course of his submission cited the case of <em><strong>Mrs. Hamida Banu Vs A.F.M. Naziruddin</strong></em> reported in 11 B.L.D page 211 and in the case of Sree Santipada Datta being dead his heris Aranangsha Datta and other Vs. Satish Chandra Das and others reported in 12 B.L.T.page 27.<br/> <br/>Heard the learned Advocates appearing for both sides, perused the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Sylhet and also perused the depositions of P.Ws and DWs, exhibits and other connected papers and also consider the submissions and the citations as referred by the learned Advocates of both the sides in support of their contention.<br/> <br/>It appears that P.W. 1 Pritish Ranjan Deb in the examination-in-Chief narrated the case of the plaintiff side. He specifically stated that গজেন্দ্র কুমার দে কে কেহ অনুমতি দেয় নাই। সে কিভাবে ঐ বাড়ীতে ঢোকে তাহা পবিত্র বা রাজ কুমার দেব জানে না। গজেন্দ্র কুমার দে মূল মালিকদের গৃহে আসিয়া ঢুকিয়া যায়। তাহারা কবে ঢুকিয়াছে তাহা বলিতে পারব না। ঐব ভঁৎঃযবৎ ংঃধঃবফঃযধঃ ২১৭ দাগের ভূমিতে বর্তমানে আববাস আলী দখলে আছে। বর্ণিত আববাস আলী অবৈধ কাগজ সৃষ্টি করিয়া দখলে ঢুকে তবে কবে ঢুকে তাহা বলিতে পারিব না। আববাস আলীর বিরুদ্ধে রাজ কুমার ও পবিত্র চরন দেব কোন কিছু করেন নাই। ২১৭ দাগের ভূমিতে অনুমতি দখল ছিলেন জাহ্নবী চরন দেব। আববাস আলীর বিরুদ্ধে জাহ্ননবী চরন দেব ও কিছু করেন নাই। জাহ্নবীচরন দেবের মাতা ব্রক্ষময়ী যে পবিত্র চরন দেবের ভগ্নি তৎ সম্পর্কে কোন লিখিত কাগজাত নাই।  He also stated that 2002 ইংরেজীতে আমরা নামজারীর জন্য আবেদন করি। আমার পিতা বা দাদার সময় নাম জারীর জন্য প্রার্থনা করা হয় নাই বা চেষ্টা করা হয় নাই। আমি প্রেমদা বালা দেব বলে কাউকে চিনি না। নবীন চন্দ্র দেব বলে কাউকে চিনি না।<br/> <br/>In the above facts and circumstances P. W. 1 in cross examination admitted that there are electricity and gas lines in the disputed house. But according to him he could not say who has made those connections. In this further cross-examination he admitted that they did not realise the rents of the land before 2001. P.W. 2 Sheikh Ramian in his examination-in-Chief admitted that defendants have been possessing the western portion of the land. In the cross-examination he fails to mention the plot no. the Khatian numbers of the disputed land. In another place of cross examination the P.W. 2 said (১-৫ নং বিবাদীর পিতা হরিপদ দেব এবং তাহার পিতা গজেন্দ্র ঐ বাড়ীতে থাকতেন) According to cross examination of P.W. 2 the pucca house was constructed by  Horipada. The garage of the house is being possessed by the defendant the P.W. 2 added. P.W. 3 Md. Amir Ullah in his cross-examination admitted that pond has been possessed by defendants and they have been cutting bomboos. Matab Uddin deposed as P.W. 4 and in the cross examination he said বিবাদীরা নাঃ জমিতে ঘর বাড়ী নিমার্ণন করেছে।<br/> <br/>On the other hand D.W.1 Shomir Lal Dey in his examination-in-chief categorically narrated the case of the defendant side. He faced cross examination but it appears that no damage has made by the plaintiff-side. In his further deposition he stated that his grand father Gojendra Kumar Deb paid the  consideration money of the disputed house and obtained receipt from Pabitra Charan Deb and Others. D.w.2 Ranu Dutta, a man of 78 years old, in his examination said that Gojendra Kumar Deb obtained the suit house by way of purchase from Pabitra and Raj Kumar. Accordingly to him Raj Kumar was his classmate. He disclosed that the price of the house was settled of Tk. 200.00 and it was paid in three instalments. The 1<sup>st</sup> instalment was paid on 01.07.1952 and 2<sup>nd</sup> instalment on 02.08.1952 and the last instalment made on 05.09.1952. He proved  the Ext. X the receipt of payment of consideration money. In the cross examination he categorically stated that he was present on 01.07.1952 at the time of paying the instalment. Accordingly to his further cross-examination he was also present at the time of paying last instalment of the price of the disputed house. Monindra Kumar Deb, a man  of 60 years old deposed as D.W. 3. In the examination-in-chief he supported the case of the defendant-side. In the cross-examination he said “আমার শৈশব কাল থেকেই নাঃ জমি বিবাদীদের দখল করতে দেখি। হরিপদ ও তার পিতাকে ও নাঃ জমি দখল করতে দেখি। বর্তমানে নাঃ জমি তার ছেলেরা দখল করে।”<br/> <br/>Mr. Faruque Ahmed Chowdhury, an Advocate of the Sylhet District Bar Association deposed as D.W. in the Suit. In his cross examination he clearly deposed that the defendant side has been possessing the disputed land from his childhood. He never saw to possess the land by the plaintiff-side. He was cross examined by plaintiff side and he denied the suggestions put to him by the plaintiff-side. Virtually the plaintiff-side by cross-examining this witness has failed to damage the testimony of the evidence made by this witness. Finally D.W.5 a Mohrar of Sylhet District Registrar Office proved some of the certified copies of deeds in favour of the defendant side.<br/> <br/>From the above discussions it appears to us that as regards possession of disputed land, the PWs have proved the possession of the defendant side. P.W.2. P.W.3 and  P. W.4 very clearly proved that actually the disputed house is being possessed by the defendant-side. We have already seen from the deposition of P.W.1 and P.W.4 that there are electricity and gas lines in the disputed house. Accordingly to the deposition of P.W.1 he could not say who made those connections in the house. It is evident from Ext O-R(2) that there are  electricity, gas and telephone  connections available in the disputed house. It proves those connections are made in the suit house by the defendant side. We have also observed from the depositions of DWs that they have proved their possession in the disputed land. So we can say that the defendants have possession over the suit land. The plaintiff side at the time of argument raised that the defendants have the permissive possession in the suit land   and they also raised that on the basis of a Farog (Exbt. Da)no title has been accrued in favour of the defendant side. In this context we have perused Ext Da and the evidence of D. W. 2 Ranu Dutta alongwith other exhibited documents of the defendant side and of the view that the defendants have been ables to prove of paying the consideration money to the original owners of the disputed house and subsequently obtained Ext. Da  Though Ext. Da is not duly registered in spite of that consideration the law pronounced by the Hon’ble Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh reported in (XII) B.L.T (AD) 27.<br/> <br/>In this context we like to quote section 52 of the Easements Act which runs as follows: “LICENSE” DEFFINED.- Where one person grants to another or to a definite number of other persons, a right to do, or continue to do in or upon the immovable property of the grantor, something which would in the absence of such right, be unlawful, and such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the property, the right is called a license” and referred in the case of Mrs. Hameeda Banu –Vs- A.F.M. Naziruddin reported in  11 BLD page 211 where their lordship held that “As a general rule, a license is revocable section 60 of the Easement Act embodies two exceptions to the general rule namely (1) a license cannot be revocable by the grantor with a transfer of property. and (2) when the license has executed a work of a permanent character and incurred expenses in the execution”. In the aforesaid facts and circumstances we can hold that the disputed house was properly transferred by Raj Kumar Deb and Pabirta Kumar Day in 1952 and since then the defendant side has been possessing the same. The receipt Ext. Da) though not fulfilled the conditions as laid down in section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, yet after considering the evidences on record it is evident to us that uninterrupted adverse and hostile possession of the defendant side for a period over 12 years from the date of 1.7.52 the defendant side has acquired title in the disputed house by adverse possession. Therefore, this Court opined that the predecessor in interest of the defendant side paid Tk. 200/00 as conside-ration money of the disputed house to Raj Kumar Deb and Pabitra Charan Deb. The defendants have title and possession over the suit house but the plaintiffs side have failed to prove their title as well as the genealogy.  It further appears that the plaintiff filed the suit for declaration of title in the suit land with an order of eviction of defendant licensees from the suit 2<sup>nd</sup> schedule land within 1<sup>st</sup> schedule and residential structures therein. We have perused the exhibited documents of the plaintiffs side of this suit along with the oral evidences of P.Ws. It appears to us that plaintiffs side have failed to establish their title in the suit land. The P.Ws. by their depositions categorically proved that the disputed house have been built by the defendants side. According to the P.Ws. the defendants have been possessing the house, the garage and pond. They have connected electricity and gas lines in the house. So considering the facts and circumstances of this suit we are of the view that this suit is not maintainable in its present form and the plaintiffs of this suit are not entitled to get relief as prayed for. On the other hand, plaintiffs of T. S. No. 32/06 have filed the suit for declaration of title by way of purchase and adverse possession. We have already seen that the plaintiffs side of this suit has able to prove their title and possession over the suit land after examining necessary witnesses. They have also produced some of the documents which were marked as Exts. L-a in support of their title and possession in the suit land. This court perused all the exhibited documents and found that the plaintiffs of this suit are entitled to get the relief as prayed for.  <br/> <br/>In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case we are of the view that the impugned judgment and decree dated 29.05.2008 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Sylhet in T.S. No. 177 of 2006 does not call for any interference under the Appellate jurisdiction of this Court and it is accordingly affirmed.<br/> <br/>In the result, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/>Send down the lower Courts records along with a copy of this judgment to the concerned Court forthwith. <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The amount of fine to be given to the victim.<br/><br/>The prosecution case in short, is that on 29.04.2003 the victim Shilpi Chakrabarty aged about 18 years, daughter of Shamol Chakrabarty, of Village-Arua, Police Station-Shibalaya, District-Manikgonj lodged an allegation as to that on 27.04.2003 at about 10.00 p.m. the informant after having supper along with her family members went to bed with her father and mother in the eastern viti of their residence, after about 12.30 a.m. (28.04.2003) she woke up with the sound of cutting of the door of their thatched house, then they raised hue and cry, at that time the accused persons namely- 1) Aku Gazi, son of late Akali Gazi, 2) Lutfor Prmanik, son of Nabin Pramanik, 3) Mannan Sheikh, son of Balai Sheikh and 4) Khadu, son of Wazuddin, all of village-Arua, Police Station- Shibalaya, District-Manikgonj, entered into the house and confined her father and mother, at that time she was laid down on the floor by Aku Gazi and forcefully raped, after that accused No. 2, 3 and  4 forcibly raped her and in consequence of that gang rape she became faint.

During investigation he visited the place of occurrence, prepared sketch map along with index and recorded statements of the witness under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

And the same was renumbered as Druto Bichar Tribunal Case No.16 of 2003 and the learned Judge of the Tribunal No.3, Dhaka, took cognizance against the appellants and others. Accordingly, charge was framed against the accused-persons under section 9(1) and 30 of the Ain-2000 and the same was read over to the accused-persons who pleaded not guilty of the offence and claimed to be tried in accordance with law.<br/><br/>During trial the prosecution examined as many as 18 witnesses out of 21 cited witnesses in the charge sheet and the defence examined 1(one) as defence witness.<br/><br/>From the trend of cross-examination of the P.Ws. the defence case is that the convict-appellants are innocent and they have been falsely implicated with this case out of local enmity and no rape had been committed by the accused-persons.<br/><br/>After conclusion of the hearing of both parties and on consideration of the evidence and the materials on record and in view of the facts and circumstances of the case the learned Judge of the Tribunal came to the finding that the prosecution proved the charge beyond all reasonable doubt and accordingly, the court below convicted the 4 accused-persons and acquitted other accused-persons from the charge levelled against them.<br/><br/>Being highly aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence the convicts being appellants preferred the instant appeal for setting aside the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed against them.<br/><br/>Mr. Kh. Gulzar Hossain, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants submits that the learned Judge of the Druto Bichar Tribunal No.3, Dhaka has misread the evidence and misinterpreted the law has passed the judgment and order of conviction which is not tenable in the eye of law. He further submits that the convict-appellants are innocent and they have been falsely implicated with the case out of local enmity. He next submits that not a single independent witness has supported the prosecution case. P.W.1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 are highly interested witnesses i.e, P.W.1 is the victim of the case, P.W.2 and 3 are mother and father of the victim, P.W.5 and  6 are full brothers of the victim. P.W.4, 7 and 8 are neighboring witnesses and they did not corroborate with each others, P.W. 9 and 14 are elected Member and Chairman of the local Union Parishad and they are the party men of the victims father. P.W.10, 11 and 15 have been tendered by the prosecution and rest of the P.Ws are official witnesses and they did not corroborate with each others. He submits that there is a delay of 34 hours in lodging the FIR which has not been explained and that the case is doubtful. He next submits that the defence examined 1(one) witness as D.W.1, Mr. Salauddin, the Secretary General of Manabadhikar Unnayan Shongsta and he did not support the prosecution case. He lastly submits that not a single independent witness was examined in this case and this is a case of no evidence, thus, the prosecution has failed to prove the allegations against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt. He therefore, prayed that the impugned judgment and order are not sustainable in the eye of law and the same are liable to be set-aside. In support of his submission Mr. Golzar Hossain, learned Advocate for the appellants referred decisions of several cases which will be discussed in the later part of the judgment.<br/><br/>Mr. S. M. A. Sabur along with Mrs. Masuda Rehana Begum, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the informant and victim Shilpi Chakrabarti, placed the prosecution case and evidence before us.

P.W.17 is the Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class, Manikgonj, who recorded the statement of the victim, and  proved  his  signature  on  that  statement  under section 22 of the Ain, 2000, and the same have been marked as exhibits and others official witnesses have corroborated each other. The learned Advocate opposes the appeal contending that the offence alleged has been proved by the victim herself and also by the corroborative evidence of other witnesses who were examined by the prosecution. He submits that the P.W.12 doctor has found the <u>sign of forceful sexual acts</u> which is the evidence of committing rape on the victim and as such the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt, as such, there is nothing to be interfered by this court in the instant appeal. Accordingly, he prayed for dismissal of the appeal.<br/><br/>In support of his submission Mr. S.M.A. Sabur, the learned Advocate for the informant-victim, referred several reported decisions which will be discussed in the later part of the judgment.<br/><br/>On the other hand Mr. Md.

It is further contended that doctor have found the sign of forceful sexual acts. He next submits that the prosecution by producing sufficient evidence has been able to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubt, as such, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>We have considered the arguments as advanced by the learned Advocates of the both sides and perused the Memoremdum of appeal, impugned judgment and order of the trial court, evidence on record and the L.C.Record.

Shafiqul Alam, Inspector of  Police, who is the investigating officer of the case in his examination in chief stated that he recorded the FIR as a recording officer and investigated the same by  himself and he visited the place of occurrence, prepared the sketch map of the place of occurrence along with index, recorded the statements of the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and arranged for medical examination of the victim and also arranged for recording statements of victim and others local witnesses under section 22 of the Ain-2000. He also stated that at the time of investigation he arrested Aku Gazi and Khadu and having found prima-facie case submitted charge sheet against the convict-appellants and others accused-persons under section 9(3) and 30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain 2000. He proved all the documents. In cross-examination he denied all the suggestions given by the defence.<br/><br/>These are all the evidence adduced by the prosecution.<br/><br/>On the other hand defence produced one witness as D.W-1, namely Allhaj Salauddin Ahamed, Secretary General, Human Right Development Organization for helpless. He saw the report of the alleged offence which was published in many National Dailies.  Thereafter he investigated the case privately and prepared an investigation report and the same was sent to the Hon’ble Prime Minister, Government Peoples Republic of Bangladesh, 2) Hon’ble Minister, Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, 3) Hon’ble Minister, Home Affairs, 4) Inspector General of Polcie (I.G.P.), 5) D.I.G Dhaka Range, 6) D.C. Manikgonj, 7) S.P. Manikgonj and 8) Judge, Cognizance court Manikgonj and others. He deposed, “আমার সংস্থা অসহায়দের পক্ষে মানবাধিকার উন্নয়ন সংস্থা এর পক্ষে এই মামলার ঘটনা সম্পর্কে জানার জন্য মানিকগঞ্জ জেলার ডেপুটি কমিশনার, পুলিশ সুপার এবং ও.সি. শিবালয় থানা সাহেবের নিকট চিঠি দিয়া ঘটনাস্থাল তদন্তের জন্য কার্যক্রম করার জন্য অবগত করাই” He next deposed, “গত ইং ১৮.০৫.০৩ তারিখে আমি আমার সংস্থার জি.এম.আবু তাহের চৌধুরী, তদন্ত কর্মকর্তা মহিলা বিশারদ বেগম রোকেয়া এবং আমাদের সহকর্মী মি. মোঃ ইউনুসকে নিয়া ঘটনাস্থলে যাই।” He next deposed, “আমরা বিকাল ৪.০০ টায় আলোচনা করিয়া চেয়ারম্যানকে না জানাইয়া এই মামলার ভিকটিম শিল্পী চক্রবর্ত্তী পিতা শ্যামল চক্রবর্ত্তীর বাড়ীতে যাইু আমরা এই মামলার ঘটনা স্থলে শিল্পী চক্রবর্ত্তীর বাড়ীতে যাইয়া শিল্পী চক্রবর্ত্তী তাহার পিতাকে উপস্থিত পাই নাই। আমরা শিল্পী চক্রবর্ত্তীর মাতাকে ঘটনা সম্পর্কে জিজ্ঞাসা করি। ঐ এলাকার নিকটবর্তী মসজিদের ইমাম, এলাকার স্কুলের একজন শিক্ষক সহ ঐ বাড়ীর নিকটবর্তী বাড়ীর লোকজন সহ ২০/২৫ জনকে ঘটনা সম্পর্কে জিজ্ঞাসাবাদ করি।” He next deposed, “ঐ বাড়ীর আসে পাশের লোকজন ঐ বিষয়ে আমাদের জানায় ভোর হলে ভিকটিমের বাড়ীর কিছু লোক শিল্পীদের বাড়ীতে আসে এবং জানতে পারে যে, শিল্পী চক্রবর্ত্তীর মা উচ্চ রক্তচাপ জনিত কারনে অসুস্থ্য হইয়াছেন। শিল্পী চক্রবর্ত্তী তাহার অসুস্থ্য মায়ের মাথায় পানি ঢালিতেছে।” He further stated, “কিছু লোক আমাদের জানায় যে, ঘটনার রাত্রে শিল্পীদের বাড়ীতে ডাকাত আসিয়াছিল। শিল্পীর বাবা ডাকাত চিনিতে পারিয়াছে এই ধরনের কথা শিল্পীর বাবা/মা এবং ভায়েরা তাহাদেরকে বলিয়াছে।” He next deposed, ‘‘<u>শিল্পীকে জিজ্ঞাসাবাদ করি, শিল্পী আমাদের জানাইয়াছে যে, ঘটনার রাত্রে আকু গাজী সহ আরো কয়েক জন লোক তাহাকে ধর্ষন করিয়াছে। উহার পরে সে সংজ্ঞাহীন হইয়া পড়ে সংজ্ঞাহীন হইবার পর আরো ৫/৬ জন তাহাকে ধর্ষন করিয়াছে বলিয়া তাহার পিতার নিকট জানিতে পারিয়াছি</u><u>ÕÕ|</u> (Underlined by us). In cross-examination he denied all the suggestion given by the prosecution. On re-call, he proved his report as Exhibit-A and his signature as Exhibit-A/1.<br/><br/>At the time of trial after conclusion of the prosecution witnesses the Tribunal examined the accused-appellants under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on 01.09.2004. It appears that while examining the appellants under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the Tribunal properly disclosed the available evidence against the appellants who were present in the dock, in reply the accused persons claimed themselves as not guilty of the offence and demanded to be tried in accordence with law. Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is based on the principle involved in the ‘<em><u>maxim audi alteram partem’ that is no one should be condemned unheard</u>.</em> It is the utmost duty of the court of law to give an opportunity to an accused to defend himself. The real object of section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is inviting the attention of the accused-person to the points raised in the evidence which are against him for which he may be convicted, so, it is clear from the record that the accused-persons have been given a good chance to offer their explanation as to those. But the accused-appellants not availed the chance of <em><u>maxim audi alteram partemt</u></em> in this case. The accused-persons in their statement under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that was made on 01.09.2004, relevant portions are stated as follows; আপনি আসামী আকু গাজী; প্রসিকিউশন পক্ষের উলে­খিত ঢ়াক্ষীগণের জবানবন্দি ও জেরা আদালতে উপস্থিত থাকিয়া নিজ কর্নে শ্রবন করেন।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">এ ক্ষেত্রে আপনার বক্তব্য কি?   উত্তর- নির্দোষ।<br/>প্রশ্ন- সাফাই সাক্ষী দিবেন কি?  উত্তর- না।<br/>প্রশ্ন- আর কিছু বলবেন কি?    উত্তর- না। </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The other accused-persons were also examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and they have also replied in the similar way.<br/><br/>It appears from the record that Mr. Alhaj Salauddin Ahmed was examined as a defence witness. He had also submitted an investigation report before the tribunal by his own accord after 7 days from the examination of section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><br/>We have scrutinized the depositions of the prosecutions and defence witnesses along with the materials on record with attending facts and circumstances of this case in our own way to assertain whether the trial court committed any illegality in passing of the impugned judgment.<br/><br/>It appears that P.W.1, Shilpi Chakrabarti is the victim and informant of the case, who in her examination in chief deposed that on 27.04.2003 at about 10 p.m. after having supper went to bed along with her father and mother in the eastern viti of their residence, and about 12.30 (28.04.2003) she woke up with the sound of cutting of the door of their thatched house, then they made hue and cry, at that time accused-persons namely-Aku Gazi, Lutfor, Mannan and Khadu entered into the house and wrongfully confined her father and mother. Accused Aku Gazi forcibly laid down her on the floor and put out her wearings and forcefully raped her, after that accuseds Lutfor, Mannan and Khadu raped her one after another. She could recognised them in the follwing manner “ঐ সময় আমার বাবা তাহার হাতে থাকা টর্চ মারে এবং ঘরে হারিকেনের আলো ছিল। আমি উক্ত টর্চের আলোতে এবং হারিকেনের আলোতে আসামীদের চিনিতে পারি,” and she identified accuseds Aku Gazi, Salam and Khadu on the dock. She also deposed, “এই ঘটনা জানাইয়া ইং ২৯/০৪/২০০৩ তারিখে শিবালয় থানায় আমি মামলা দায়ের করি।” She further deposed that on 07.05.03 Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> class, recorded her statement under section 22 of the Ain, 2000 and she was also examined by the medical board at Manikgonj Sadar Hospital wherein doctor found sign of forceful sexual acts upon her. She proved all the documents before the Tribunal. During cross-examination the defence could not shaken her.<br/><br/>P.Ws.2 and 3 are the mother and father of the victim Shilpi Charkrabarti and they are also victim and eye witnesses of the occurrence and they have categorically stated that the above mentioned accused persons confined them and thereafter accused Aku Gazi, Lutfor, Mannan and Khadu took away her daughter and forcibly raped their daughter one after another. P.Ws.2 and 3 also supported the prosecution case so far as it relats to date, time and manner of occurrence. They have corroborated with each other and they have also identified the accused-persons namely-Aku Gazi, Khadu and Salam on the dock.<br/><br/>P.W.4, Monwara Begum is a neighbor and an independent witness who has supported the prosecution case and corroborated with P.Ws.1, 2 and 3 in the following manner, “২৮.০৪.০৩ ইং তারিখে দিবাগত রাত্রে/ভোরে চিৎকার ও কান্নাকাটি শুনিয়া শিল্পীদের বাড়ীতে যাইয়া শিল্পীকে খুবভপ্লধ দেখি, শিল্পীর কপালে, মাথায় ও ঠোটে আঘাতের ভছয়ক্ষ্ম দেখতে পাই। ঐ সময় আরও লোকজন শিল্পীদের বাড়ীতে আসে। শিল্পীর মা জানাইয়াছে যে, আকু গাজী, মান্নান, লুৎফর, খাদু শিল্পীকে ধর্ষন করিয়াছে|” She has also stated that, she made a statement under section 22 of the Ain, 2000 before the Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> class, Manikgonj and the same was duly exhibited before the Tribunal during trial.<br/><br/>We have found that P.W.4, Monowara Begum as a natural and important witness. She also disclosed the circumstantial atmosphere of the victim’s house and just after the occurrence she came to the place of occuerrance and heard the facts from the victim. The defence also could not shaken her during cross-examination.<br/><br/>P.W.5, Bimal Chakrabarti and P.W.6, Kamol Chakrabarti are full brothers of the victim. At the time of occurrence P.Ws.5 and 6 were confined in their rooms and after occurrence they heard the actual facts from the victim and their parents. They made statements before the Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class, under section 22 of the Ain, 2000 and identified the accused-persons on the dock and they corroborated with each other.<br/><br/>P.W.7, Peara Begum is a very important witness of this case, who is the neighbors and an independent witness. Just after the occurrence she rushed to the place of occurrence. She deposed, “ পূর্ব ভিটার ঘরে শিল্পীকে অসুস্থ্য অবস্থায় দেখতে পাই। তাহার পরনের কাপড় চোপড় ঠিক করিয়া দেই। শিল্পীর মা, বাবা, আমাকে জানাইয়াছে যে, আসামী আকু গাজী, লুৎফর, মান্নান ও খাদু শিল্পীকে ধর্ষন করিয়াছে। আমি শিল্পীর মাথায় পানি ঢালিয়াছি। আমি পুলিশ ও ম্যাজিস্ট্রেটের নিকট জবানবন্দি দিয়াছিু” She  has supported the prosecution story into to.<br/><br/>P.W.8, Liakat Hossain is a local businessman who is a hearsay witness. He has categorically stated, “পথিমধ্যে লোকের কানাঘুষা শুনতে পাই, আমি উহাতে জানতে পারি যে, চক্রবর্তীর মেয়ে শিল্পী ধর্ষিতা হইয়াছে। এই কথা শুনিয়া আমি শিল্পীদের বাড়ী যাই এবং শিল্পীকে অসুস্থ অবস্থায় দেখতে পাই। তাহার মা পাশে থাকিয়া কান্না কাটি করিতেছে। আমি শিল্পীর বাবাকে জিজ্ঞাসা করিলে সে জানায় যে, আকু গাজী, লুৎফর, মান্নান, খাদু শিল্পীকে ধর্ষন করিয়াছে এবং তাহাকে মারধর করিয়াছে|” P.W.9 Md. Abdul Zabbar is an elected member of the local Union Parisad and he is also an hearsay witness who supported the prosecution case. P.W.14, Saifur Rahman Khan alias Sultan is the elected chairman of the local Arua Union Parisad has also supported the prosection case. P.W.10, Abdur Rashid Mollah, P.W.15, Rangalal, P.W.16, Nitay are the local witnesses and they have been tenderd by the prosecution P.W.13, Gopal Sarakar is a seizure list witness and he proved seizure list and seized articles in the court and also exhibited the same. P.W.11, Hasina Begum is tendered by the prosecution, in cross-examination, she did not support the prosecution case. P.W.17, Md. Mahabubur Rahaman, is the Magistrate, 1st Class, Manikgonj, who recorded statement under section 22 of the Ain, 2000. P.W.12, Dr. Md. Halim Mollah is the Medical Officer of the concerned Medical Board. He has proved the Medical certificate given by them and has also proved their “opinion that the victim Shilpi Chakrabarti is about 19 years of age and bearing sign of forceful sexual acts.” P.W.18 is the investigating officer, at the time of investigation he had properly investigated the case having found prima-facie case he submitted charge-sheet against the appellants and others.<br/><br/>Though the defence has examined 1(one) witness in its favour but the said witness in the last part of his examination in chief has categorically stated, “<u>শিল্পীকে জিজ্ঞাসা করি, শিল্পী আমাদের জানাইয়াছে যে, ঘটনার রাতে আকু গাজী সহ আরও কয়েক জন লোক তাহাকে ধর্ষন করিয়াছে</u><u>|</u>" So, it is clear from the above discussion that the victim Shilpi Chakrabarti was raped by a gang of people on the date of occurrance. The eye witnesses namely the father and mother of victim, the victim herself have categorically narrated the facts crroboratively. The other witnesses have also supported them. Though the defence has produced a witness but this witness at one stage has supported the prosecution, we do not find any anamoly in this case.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the appellants has tried to raise a question as to that the witnesses are the close relatives and neighbours of the victim, so, they are the interested witness of this case. On question of interested witnesses we have considered the case of Yogeshwar Gope -Vs.- State, reported in 58 DLR (AD) 73, wherein the apex court held that;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>''Only because of relationship of witnesses evidence connot be thrown away unless the evidence is found to be untrue or tainted by motive.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We have also taken notice of the views expressed in the case of Tungo Veskata Krishnaiah -Vs.- State of Andra Prodesh (1985)29 ML.Jr (Cr) 130, at page 140-141 (AP) which run as follow:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Where a witness is a natural witness to the occurrence and her evidence is consistent and it inspires confidence to accept her evidence to be truthful, her evidence alone is sufficient to base conviction. ''</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Similarly, in the case of Taneshwar Sahi -Vs.- The state of Uttar Prodesh, 1976 Cr. L&amp;J 6 at page 9 (All) it has been held that,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"there is no hard and fast rule that the evidence of the partisan witness can not be acted upon, without corrobora-tion. If his presence at the scence of occurrence can not be doubted and his evidence is consistence with the surro-unding circumstances and the probab-ilities of the case strikes the court as true it can be good foundation for conviction, more so if some assurance for it is available from the medical evidence.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We are respectfully relying upon the views noted above.<br/><br/>We have not found upon scrutiny of the evidence and the materials on record, anything to show any motive or intention in the prosecution witnesses No.2, 3, 5 and 6 or in the deposition of the prosecution witnesses No.7 and 8 that they have falsely implicated the appellants in this case or other witness to taint the evidence. All the P.Ws. are natural witnesss as to the facts stated by them and they have deposed the entire occurrence and their evidence are consistant and inspires confidence in our mind to be accepted as truthful. Their evidence had also been corroborated with each other.<br/><br/>As such we do not find any substance in the submission of the learned Advocate for the appellants.<br/><br/>Mr. S.M.A. Sabur the learned Advocate of the informant in course of his submission has also referred some decision which runs as follows;<br/><br/>In the case of Abdul Sobhan Biswas Vs. State, reported in 54 DLR(2002), 556, wherein it has held;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"<em>In the absence of evidence to the contrary the only reference that can be drawn is that the victim a helpless village woman is telling the truth about her <u>shameful ordeal</u> in the hands of the accused as she has nothing to gain by making false statements about subjecting herself to the ignominy of being raped"</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Delay in lodging FIR, benefit of doubt and techincalities and corroboration of witnesses he also referred in the following decesions.  <br/><br/>In the case of Shibu Pada Achariee Vs. The State reported in 8MLR(HC)(2003)275 wherein The High Court Division on the question of delay in lodging FIR held;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"True it is that delay in lodging First Information Report may give rise to suspicion which put the court on guard to look for possible motive and   explanation  of   delay  and  consider   its effect on righteousness or otherwise of prosecution case but it is equally true that mere delay in laying First Information Report with Police Station, not necessarily as a matter of law, is catasrophic to prosecution case. The effect of delay inputting forward First Infiormation Report in the light of plausibility of explanation forthcoming for such delay, accordin-gly, must fall for consideration in the fact and circumstances of a given case. Apprehension of victim of sex crime Ratna Rani Achariya of being excommunicated by  society, assurance offered to victim Ratna Rani Achariya by accussed-appellant and his father and mother to accept her as wife of accused-appellant in an arbitration held for the purpose and, also, by the decision reached between victim Ratna Rani side and accused-appellant side in a meeting held  under  the  auspices  of  Bangladesh Mahila Parishad and subsequent refusal to give effect to said assurance and other factors contri-buted the delay in laying First Information Report. Delay in putting forward First Information Report was quite natural and authenticity and integrity of prosecution case cannot be at all subjected to suspicion."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><u>The same Bench in the question of corroboration, held,-</u></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"<em>Corroborative evidence is not an imperative component in every case of rape. The rule is not that corrobor-ation is essential before there can be a conviction. <u>The testimony of victim of sexual assault is vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessities looking for corroboration of her statement the court should find no difficulty in acting on the testimony of a victim of sex crime alone in convicting a rapist when the testimony inspires confidence in the mind of judges as being reliable."</u></em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><u>And the question of the number of witnesses, the court held,-</u></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"Law does not require particular number of witnesses to prove a case and conviction may be well founded even on the testimony of solitary witness provided his integrity and trustworthiness is not shaken by any adverse circumstances appearing on the record against him and the court at the same time is convinced that his testimony has ring of truth. The well known maxim which is a Golden Rule that "evidence has to be weighed and not counted" has been given statutory placement in section 134 of The Evidence Act which provides that no particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>And in the point of framing charge and related technicalities of the proceeding the court held,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"<em>When the offence of rape was tried by the Special Tribunal under section 4(c)of the Cruelty to Women (Deterrent Punishment) Ordinance 1983 and the convict appellant was sentenced to suffer R.I. for seven years upon proof of the charge beyond all reasonable doubt and subsequently when it was found that the offence was triable by Sessions Judge who is also the same person presiding over the special tribunal as well as the Sessions court, the trial so held cannot be vitiated by reason of such technical-lities. In the facts and circumstances the charge, conviction and sentence may be altered from section 4(c) of the Cruelty to Women (Deterrent Punishment) Ordinance, 1983 into one under section 376 of the Penal Code, 1860.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The similar questions have been decided in many cases in the sub-continent i.e, in the case of State of Rajasthan -Vs.- Om Prakash, reported in AIR-2002, SUPREME COURT, 2235. In the case of Al-Amin and 5 others Vs. State, reported in 51 DLR(1999)-154, In the case of Md. Shamim Hossain (Shamim) and others (several criminal Appeal) Vs. The State, reported in 19 BLD(HCD)(1999)-307. And in the case of Rehana Begum and another Vs. State, reported in 63 DLR 2011 (HCD)-548.<br/><br/>In respect of the principle of benefit of doubt accepted in England as a matter of public policy is available to an accused on the same ground or to the same extent in our country. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the shadow of a doubt. This doubt is not an imaginary doubt. Benefit of doubt to the accused would be available provided there is supportive evidence on record. For creating doubt or granting benefit of doubt, the evidence is to be such which may lead to such doubt. The law would fail to protect the community, the society, if fanciful possibilites is admitted, thus, deflecting the course of justice.” <br/><br/>The facts of the above case are quite different from each other and not applicable in the case in hand. But the essence of the views taken in the aforesaid case are important and helpful for arrivine in the correct decision to the present case.<br/><br/>Mr. Kh. Gulzar Hossain, the learned Advocate for the appellants referred the case of Abdul Aziz (Md) and another -Vs.- State. reported in 2 BLC (1997)-630 wherein the Court held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>''<em>As the prosecutrix did not sustain any injury on her face, cheeks or breasts at the time of commission of the alleged rape and the Medical Board also did not detect any trace of sexual violence on the two victims the offence under section 376 of the Penal Code is not proved beyond all reasonable doubt for which the appellants are entitled to get benefit of doubt</em>''</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Though Mr. Gulzar has referred the case of Abdul Wahed alias Chandu Mia -Vs.- State reported in 4 BLC (1999)(HC)-320, wherein it has been held;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>''<em>Ordinarily in criminal cases the evidence of prosecutrix is believed but in the present case the contradictions are so major that the evidence of the prosecutrix cannot be believed, moreso, when P.W-2 is an eye witness did not prove rape and P.W-3 is another eye-witness slept in the same chowki with the prosecutrix was only tendered. Further, the prosecution withheld the charge sheeted witnesses giving without any explanation and introduced PWs 5,6 and 7 who are not charge sheeted witnesses. Even the prosecutrix was no medically examined and her wearing apparels were not chemically examined which is a vital omission on the part of the prosecution and it failed to prove its case beyond doubt and hence the conviction and sentence cannot be sustained.''</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>But in the case on hand we have shown categorically that the witnesses have been able to prove the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. The medical report also has supported the prosection story and the defence could not Shaken any witness in any manner, then, there is no application of the aforesaid cited case in the instant case.<br/><br/>On the point of improbability of committing sexual inter course he also referred the case of Bazlu Talukder and others -VS.- State, reported in 1 BLC (1996) (HCD)-261 wherein the court held;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>Improbability of committing sextual intercourse together-As the P.Ws. contradicted each other as to who accompanied the appellant Bazlu in kidnapping the girl aged 15 years who was raped by only one convict who is none other than Bazlu but the other convicts are full brother and bhaista of him and it is highly improbable that all those persons together would commit sexual intercourse on the girl when they are not professional or hardened criminals and hence other convicts are entitled to get benefit of  doubt.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Mohammad Siddiqur Rahaman and others Vs. The State, reported in 7 BLD (AD) 93 (1987) relates to delay in filing FIR, Hon'ble Appex Court held;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“On the point of "Assessment of evidence- Delay in filing the case raises serious doubt about the place, time and manner of the incident much more so about the recognition of the miscreants-Identification of the skeletons by a reference to the two bunches of te keys along with the skeletion is itself doubtful in view of the sate introduction of the story <u>through the mouths of the witnesses for the first</u> time in court- Again exclusion of fimale members of the family of the complainant raises doubt about the time, place and manner of the incident as well as recognition of the miscreants-satisfactory-The whole case has remained shrouded in mistry-It is for the prosecution to clear of all the mystries and suspicions failing which their case shall fail.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>On the point of FIR he also referred the case of Nayan Vs. The State, reported in 37DLR(1985)(Dhaka Bench)237, wherein the court held -</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"First information report not a substantive piece of evidence-But where there is clear conflict between the version given in the F.I.R. and the story made out in the course of trial-It then becomes imperative to note the conflict between them. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>He also reffered the decesions reported 9 MLR 28, 18 DLR(W.P)91, 31 DLR 16 and 5 BLD-255 which were decided on similar questions respectively. The facts of the cases referred by the learned Advocate of the appellants are quite different and distinguishble from those of the present one. However, we take notice of the principle of the cases.<br/><br/>Now let us see the relevant law under which the appellants have been connicted. Section 9 and 30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain-2000 is quoted below-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>ধারা ৯-(১) যদি কোন পুরুষ কোন নারী বা শিশুকে ধর্ষণ করেন, তাহা হইলে তিনি যাবজ্জীবন সশ্রম কারাদন্ডে দন্ডনীয় হইবেন এবং ইহার অতিরিক্ত অর্থদন্ডেও দন্ডনীয় হইবেন<br/>(২)..........................................................<br/>ধারা ৩০। অপরা­ধ প্র­রাচনা বা সহায়তার শাস্তি যদি কোন ব্যক্তি এই আই­নের অধীন কোন অপরাধ সংঘট­ন প্র­রাচনা যোগান এবং সেই প্র­রাচনার ফ­ল উক্ত অপরাধ সংঘটিত হয় বা অপরাধটি সংঘট­নের চেষ্টা করা হয় বা কোন ব্যক্তি যদি অন্য কোন ব্যক্তি­কে এই আই­নের অধীন কোন অপরাধ সংঘট­­ন সহায়তা ক­­রন, তাহা হই­­ল ঐ অপরাধ সংঘট­­নর জন্য বা অপরাধটি সংঘট­নের চেষ্টার জন্য নির্ধারিত দ­ন্ড প্র­রাচনাকারী বা সহায়তাকারী ব্যক্তি দন্ডনীয় হই­বেন।<em>”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We have considered this case with the evidence along with the relevant laws and also carerfully considered all decisions refered by the both sides.<br/><br/>On the question of medical examination and facts and circumstances we have considered the observation of this court in the case of Badal and another -Vs.- The State, reported in 19 BLD-527, which runs as follows;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"<em>From the oral evidence and from the facts and circumstances it is quiet clear that the imformant was raped on the night of occurrence by accused appellants. <u>Though on medical examination of the victim no sign of rape was found and though no mark of violence was noticed on the body of the victim, in view of the entire evidence on record it appears that the victim was raped by the appellants. So the learned Judge committed no illegality in convicting the appellants under section 6(3) of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishes Bidhan) Ain, 1995.</u></em></div> <div style="text-align: justify;">But in the instant case the Medical Board has categorically observed that the victim was bearing sign of forceful sexual acts, moreover, the victim herself and witnesses have corroborated the facts, with each other.In the instant case, the time, place and manner of occurrence as alleged by the prosecution have been conclusively proved by the evidence and the materials on record as well as the attending facts and circumstances of the case. The chain of evidence and materials on record are appears to be complete and unbroken.<br/><br/>Apart from that in rape case conviction and sentence can be based on solitary evidence of the prosecutrix if the same inspires confidence, which is very much available in the case in hand.<br/><br/>Consedering the fact and circumstances we are of the  view that the trial court has rightly found the accused appellants guilty of rape as charged as per section 9(1) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain-2000 and sentenced them to imprisonment for life and fine of Tk.20,000/- each.<br/><br/>Therefore, we do not find any illegality in the impugned judgment and order. The impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence being fair and legal does not call for any interference by this Court.<br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is dismissed. The order of conviction and sentence dated 16.09.2004 passed by the learned Judge, Druto Bichar Tribunal No.3, Dhaka, in Druto Bichar Tribunal Case No.16 of 2004, is hereby a<br/>ffirmed.<br/><br/>The order of stay is stand vacated.<br/><br/>Send down the lower court records along with copy of the judgment at-once.<br/><strong>        <br/>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Ruhul Quddus, J: </u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This appeal under section 30 of the Special Powers Act, 1974 is directed against judgment and order dated 9.8.2004 passed by Metropolitan Special Tribunal No.6, Dhaka in Metropolitan Special Tribunal Case No.7972 of 1999 convicting the appellant under section 19 A and 19 (f) of the Arms Act, 1878 and sentencing him under section 19A to suffer rigorous imprisonment for twenty years with a fine of Taka 5000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months more and further sentencing him under section 19 (f) to suffer rigorous imprisonment for seven years. The two sentences were made to run concurrently. <br/> <br/>Prosecution case, in short, is that the informant Md. Asaduzzaman Farazi, a Sub-Inspector of police, along with his forces, was on rescue duty on 6.4.1999, when he had received secret information that the appellant and his accomplices were repairing an illegal revolver sitting in the ground floor of City Law College. They had rushed to the place of occurrence and caught him red handed, while his accomplices fled away. The police, recovered a revolver with two round of bullets and some other articles on his own showing. On interrogation, the appellant admitted that he used to sell and repair illegal arms. Accordingly, the informant prepared a seizure list in presence of the witnesses, produced him to Kotwali police station along with the seized articles and lodged the <em>ejahar, </em>which gave rise to Kotwali Police Station Case No.10 dated 6.4.1999.<br/> <br/>The police, after investigation submitted charge sheet on 21.5.1999 against the sole appellant under sections 19 (a) (f)/ 19 A of the Arms Act. The case, after being ready for trial, was sent to the Metropolitan Special Tribunal No.1, Dhaka, wherein it was numbered as Metropolitan Special Tribunal Case No.7972 of 1999. The learned Judge of Tribunal No.1 after taking cognizance of the offences against the appellant, transferred it to the Metropolitan Special Tribunal No.11, Dhaka, for trial. The learned Judge of Tribunal No.11 framed charge against him under the said sections of the Arms Act by his order dated 4.10.1999 and proceeded with trial. Thereafter the case was transferred once again to the Metropolitan Special Tribunal No.6, Dhaka, wherein the trial was finally concluded.<br/> <br/>The prosecution, in order to prove its case, examined seven witnesses. Out of them P.Ws.1-2 are seizure list witnesses and are employees of the college. P.W.3 is a local witness. P.W.4 is the informant himself and P.Ws.5-6 are police personnel and members of the raiding party, while P.W.7 is the investigating officer.<br/> <br/>After closing the prosecution, the appel-lant was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, when he reitera-ted his innocence and declined to adduce evidence in defense. After conclusion of trial, the learned Judge of the Tribunal found him guilty of charges under sections 19A and 19 (f) of the Arms Act and accordingly pronounced the impugned judgment and order on 9.8.2004 convicting and sentencing him, as aforesaid. The appellant filed the instant appeal against the said judgment and order dated 9.8.2004 and subsequently obtained bail on 18.11.2009 from this Court. <br/> <br/>No one appears before us to press this appeal. In view of long pendency of the appeal, we take it up for disposal. The learned Assistant Attorney General, however, appears for the State and submits that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, and as such the learned Judge of the Tribunal rightly passed the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence, which does not call for any interference.      <br/> <br/>We have gone through the evidence and other materials on records. It appears that P.W.1 Ohid, an employee of the college and a seizure list witness, stated in his examination-in-chief that in the evening of 6.4.1999, he was on duty with his sir (indicating the Principal of City Law College in his office at first floor), when a police man asked him to come down to the room of occurrence in the ground floor. Accordingly he came downstairs and saw a revolver, one round of bullet, one bullet-shell and some other articles kept on a tool. In cross-examination, he stated that he did neither see the appellant, nor the recovery of arms. P.W.2 Abu Bakar, another employee of the college and seizure list witness corroborated the evidence of P.W.1 and stated in similar language that at the time of occurrence, he came down at the instance of a police man, entered into the room of occurrence and saw the arms in question. The police told him that they had recovered the said arms. The defense declined to cross-examine him. P.W.3 Sayed Hasan, a local witness and apparently independent, stated that on the date and time of occurrence he was passing through the front side of the college, when a police man told him that a person had been held inside the college. However, he did not know that person. At this stage, the prosecution declared him hostile. He denied the suggestion that he was not telling the truth. In cross-examination by the defense, he reiterated that he did not know the appellant and did not see any recovery.<br/> <br/>P.W.4, the informant Md. Asaduzzaman Farazi (a Sub-Inspector of Police) stated that on 6.4.1999 at about 19.30 hours he entered into the western room at the ground floor of the college, recovered the revolver, two rounds of bullets and other articles from the possession of the appellant and arrested him on the spot. P.W.5 Md. Imam Uddin, a constable and member of the raiding party, stated that at the time of occurrence all other members of the team went inside keeping him posted at the main gate of the college. After 15/20 minutes the police personnel brought the appellant arrested with the revolver and other seized articles. P.W.6 Md. Tazul Huda, another constable and a member of the raiding party stated that sensing the presence of police, some of the miscreants fled away, while they secured in arresting the appellant and recovered the revolver and other articles, which were found in front of him, and he was engaged in repairing the revolver. P.W.7, the Investigating Officer stated amongst other that during investigation he visited the place of occurrence, examined the witnesses and prepared the sketch-map and index. In cross-examination he admitted that he did not get the revolver examined by any ballistic expert, and did not record statements of any of the students. He also admitted that the accused did not have any past criminal records.<br/> <br/>A close reading of the <em>ejahar</em> along with the seizure list as to the factum of recovery of arms and the evidence of P.W.4 clearly suggests that the revolver and other articles were not recovered from the control and possession of the appellant inasmuch as  according to the <em>ejahar </em>and seizure list, the recovery was made on showing of the appellant, but the deposition of the informant (P.W.4) by contrast, indicates that the revolver and other articles were seized from the exclusive possession of the appellant, without mentioning the nature of such exclusiveness of such possession. P.W.4 also did not mention the manner of recovery. This departure in his testimony from the version of <em>ejahar, </em>casts a shadow of doubt over the place and manner of recovery of the arms and amunitions. It further appears from the deposition of P.W. 6 that the revolver in question was found in front of the appellant. This is a third statement which constitutes a third case as none of the prosecution witnesses supports him on this point. P.W.7, the Investigating Officer and also a member of the raiding party is mysteriously silent over the place and manner of recovery. Thus, the depositions of the prosecution witnesses do not speak a uniform story of recovery of arms and ammunitions. The depositions are contradictory and do not corroborate each other.<br/> <br/>The learned Judge of the Special Tribunal did not bring the specific incriminating evidence into the notice of the appellant as required by section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Such omission on the part of the trial Court is fatal inasmuch as by now it is well settled that proper compliance with the provision of section 342 is mandatory and failing on the part of the Judge to bring the incriminating evidence to the notice of an accused, vitiates trial.<br/> <br/>It appears from the impugned judgment that the learned Judge arrived at his findings upon misappreciation of evidence and held that the prosecution case has been proved by the evidence of P.Ws.1-2 inasmuch as P.Ws.1-2 did not support the prosecution case. His reliance on the evidence of P.Ws.1 and 2 is borne out by the following lines of his judgment: </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ উক্ত সাক্ষী PW ১-২ এর সাক্ষ্য পর্যালোচনায় দেখা যা যে, ঘটনাসহলে পুলিশ যাওয়া, আসামীকে ধৃত করা ও আলামত ঊদ্বার করা প্রসংগে সমর্থন পাওয়া যায়। যদিও তাহাদের সাক্ষ্য জব্দ তালিকায় বর্ণিত আলামতের বিবরনের চাইতে কিছুটা কম বর্ণনা আসিয়াছে তথাপি জব্দ তালিকায় উল্লেখিত আলামতের সহিত অনেকটা মিল পরিলক্ষিত হয়। উপরোক্তর অবসহাদৃষ্টে দেখা যাইতেছে যে, অাসামী জাবেদ ওরফে কসাই জাবেদকে ঘটনাস্থলে উল্লখিত আলামত সহ  ধৃত করা হয় তাহা সার্বিক সাক্ষ্য বিচারে সুস্পষ্ট ভাবে প্রতিয়মান হয়।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is needless to say that a person cannot be punished, unless he is found guilty beyond all reasonable doubt.  In our considered view, the facts, circumstances and evidence on records in the present case do not press home the charge framed against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt, and therefore, he is entitled to benefit of doubt.<br/> <br/>For all the reasons stated above we find merit in the appeal. The impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence, therefore, call for interference.<br/> <br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and order dated 9.8.2004 passed by the Judge, Metropolitan Special Tribunal No.6, Dhaka in Metropolitan Special Tribunal Case No. 7972 of 1999 is hereby set aside.

In the instant case, the Memo of Appeal was presented on 24.05.2006 before the High Court Division that is, within four months from communicating the grounds of decision by the Registrar of Trade Marks and as such it is well within time. If a person is aggrieved by a decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks, can prefer an appeal in spite of being not a party in the original proceeding. Admittedly, the application for withdrawal of the original application for registration of trade mark was allowed with consent of the opponents. When the application was withdrawn, the opposition case connected thereto became infructuous. Therefore, the question of accepting an infructuous opposition case affecting the interest of the appellant does not arise and hence, the impugned order insofar as it relates to acceptance of the opposition case is illegal. . . .(7, 8, 10, 11 and 12)</strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Mr. Mohd.

Ruhul Quddus, J: </strong></u></span><br/> <br/>This Trade Mark Appeal under section 76 of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 is directed against order dated 12.7.2005 passed by the Registrar of Trade Marks, Dhaka that was communicated by letter dated 22.5.2006 accepting Opposition Case No. 2131 of 2003. <br/> <br/>Facts relevant for disposal of this appeal are that the appellant’s agent in Bangladesh, Haji Abdul Maleque filed Application No. 65372 in class-6 for registration of trade mark, which was advertised in Trade Mark Journal No.219 at page 275 in August, 2002. In opposition thereto one Mr. Arihant Jain and others as proprietors of M/S Kangaroo Industries (herein appellant No.2) filed Opposition Case No.2131 of 2003 on the facts and grounds as stated and taken therein. In course of proceedings in the said opposition case, the applicant Haji Abdul Maleque filed an application for withdrawal of his original application for registration of trade mark on the reason that it was made in wrong name. The opponents gave their consent on such withdrawal. The Registrar of Trade Marks, Dhaka by his order dated 12.7.2005 filed the application, but at the same time accepted the opposition case and communicated the decision to the applicant. <br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the said order, so far it relates to acceptance of the opposition case, the appellant Kanin (India) (P) Ltd. as principal of the applicant Haji Abdul Maleque claming itself as the owner of the trade mark, has preferred the present Trade Mark Appeal before the High Court Division. <br/> <br/>Mr. Mohd. Moazzam Hussain, the learned Advocate appearing for the appellant supports the appeal submitting that when the applicant had already withdrawn his original application for registration of trade mark with the consent of the opponents, the connected opposition case became infructuous, and the Registrar of Trade Marks ought to have filed both the application and opposition case, but he committed illegality in accepting Opposition Case No. 2131 of 2003 which was already infructuous. The learned Advocate further submits that the impugned order accepting the opposition case would prejudice the appellant’s right and interest over the trade mark in future litigation, if any.<br/> <br/>On the other hand, Mr. Muhammad Ohiullah, the learned Advocate appearing for respondent No.2 (M/S Kangaroo Industries) submits that since the appellant M/S Kanin (India)(P) Ltd. was not the party in the proceedings before the Registrar of Trade Marks, it cannot maintain the present appeal, and that the appeal is hopelessly barred by limitation and has been preferred before the High Court Division without filing any application for condonation of delay and as such it should be dismissed as being barred by limitation as well. <br/> <br/>In turn of his reply Mr. Mohd. Moazzam Hussain, the learned Advocate for the appellant submits that since the impugned order would affect the appellant’s right and interest over the trade mark, it can maintain the present appeal. On the issue of limitation Mr. Hussain submits that in order to prefer an Appeal before the High Court Division, an aggrieved party requires the grounds of decision in writing. The intending appellant should apply for getting the grounds of decision on form T.M-15 to the Registrar of Trade Marks within one month from communicating the impugned decision. In the present case a review petition was pending, for which the applicant could not apply to the Registrar on form T.M-15 within one month as prescribed in the Rules. However, he filed a delayed application for grounds of decision on form T.M-15 to the Registrar with an application for condonation of delay. The Registrar allowed the said application for condonation of delay and communicated him the grounds of decision by a letter as contained in Memo No. T.M/Oppo/Mamla/471/06(2) dated 22.5.2006.<br/> <br/>We have examined the Revised Trade Marks Rules, 1963. Rule 84 of the said Rules provides four months time to prefer an appeal against any decision of the Registrar from the date of such decision excluding the time occupied for communication of the grounds. Rule 25 provides one month time to file an application on form T.M-15 for communication of the grounds in writing. It runs as follows: </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“25. Decision of Registrar.- (1) The decision of the Registrar at a hearing under rule 24, or without a hearing if the applicant has duly communicated his observations in writing, and has stated that he does not desire to be heard, shall be communicated to the applicant in writing, and if the applicant intends to appeal from such decision he may within one month from the date of such communications apply on form TM-15 to the Registrar requiring him to state in writing the grounds of, and the materials used by him in arriving at his decision. </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>(2)  In case where the Registrar makes any requirements to which the applicant does not object, the applicant shall comply therewith before the Registrar issues a statement in writing under sub-rule (1).  </em><br/><em>(3) The date when such statement is sent shall be deemed to be the date of the Registrar’s decision for the purpose of the Appeal.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From a plain reading of the above quoted rule it appears that in order to get the grounds of decision communicated, the intending appellant has to file an application on form T.M-15 within one month from communication of the decision.  On receipt of the grounds, the appellant would present the memo of appeal before the High Court Division within the time as prescribed in rule 84. <br/> <br/>In the present case an application for review of the impugned order was pending before the Registrar, for which the applicant could not file any application on form T.M-15 within one month. He, however, filed a belated application on form T.M-15 with an applicat-ion for condonation of delay. The Registrar allowed the said application condoning the delay and ultimately communicated the grounds of decision by a letter as contained in Memo No.T.M/Oppo/Mamla/471/06(2) dated 22.5.2006 to the learned Advocate for the applicant (see pages 25-26 of the paper book).<br/> <br/>It further appears from the office note that the memo of appeal was presented on 24.5.2006 before the High Court Division i.e within four months from communicating the grounds of decision by the Registrar of Trade Marks and as such it is well within time. <br/> <br/>On <em>locus standi</em> of the appellant, we hold that if a person whether juristic or natural, is aggrieved by a decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks, can prefer an appeal in spite of being not a party in the original proceeding. A person aggrieved is never prohibited to present an appeal against a decision of the Registrar, Trade Marks by any provision neither in the Civil Procedure Code nor in the Trade Marks Act or the Rules made thereunder.<br/> <br/>If we consider the impugned decision on merit, it is very difficult to defend the same as it is. Admittedly the application for withdrawal of the original application for registration of trade mark was allowed with consent of the opponents. When the application was withdrawn, the opposition case connected thereto became infructuous. Therefore the question of accepting an infructuous opposition case affecting the interest of the appellant does not arise and in that view of the matter, we hold the impugned order, so far it relates to acceptance of the opposition case, is illegal.<br/> <br/>As a result the appeal is allowed and the impugned order dated 12.7.2005 passed by the Registrar of Trade Marks, Dhaka in Opposition Case No.2131 of 2003, so far it relates to acceptance of the said opposition case is set aside. But if the appellant files any fresh application for registration of the trade mark, respondent No.2 will be entitled to file opposition case in opposition thereto. <br/> <br/>        Let a copy of the judgment be communicated and the record be sent back to the Registrar of Trade Marks, Dhaka immediately.   <br/> <br/><strong>         Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The provisions of section 10 of the Contract Act also come  in aid  of  the  plaintiff.

Abdul Wahhab Miah, J:</strong></span><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal has been filed by defendant Nos.4 and 5 against the judgment and decree dated the 8th day of June, 2010 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in First Appeal No. 328 of 2007 dismissing the same.<br/> <br/>Respondent No.l as plaintiff filed Title Suit No.37 of 2006 in the Court of Joint District Judge, 3rd Court, Dhaka for specific performance of contract impleading the present petitioners as defendant Nos. 4 and 5 and respondent Nos. 2, 3, 5-10 as defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 6-11. Brigadier General M. Aitqu-ur Rahman (since dead), father of the present petitioners was impleaded as defendant No. 3.<br/> <br/>In the plaint, it was stated, inter alia, that the plaintiff entered into an agreement with defendant No. 2 to purchase a flat being No.2/A, Tulip DOHS, Street No.6/B (Banani) within Cantonment Police Station. The sale price of the above flat was fixed at TK. 30,00,000.00. A tripartite agreement was exec-uted accordingly. The plaintiff paid a sum of taka 8,00,000.00 (eight lac) to defendant No.2 in 6(six) installments from 01.05.2000 to 02.06.2001. The plaintiff found the flat small in size in comparison with her need. So, defendant No.2 proposed to sell flat No.4/B of the project, 'Primrose' at plot No. 11 of Street No.4 of DOHS, Banani at taka 30,00,000.00 (thirty lac). And then again a tripartite agreement was executed with defendant No. 1-company through defendant No.2 on 30.06.2001 and the money paid earlier was adjusted towards the value of the new apartment. The plaintiff made further payment of taka 8,00,000.00 (eight lac) in 8(eight) installments from 02.11.2001 to 30.12.2002 i.e. upto 30.12.2002, she paid in total taka 16,00,000.00 (sixteen lac). After the plaintiff had seen flat No.4/B, 'Primrose1, she also found it not suitable for her. Then defendant No.2 again proposed to sell flat No.4-B of the project 'Heritage' at plot No. 18, Road No.3, Banani, DOHS (hereinafter referred to as the suit land) at a consideration of taka 35,00,000.00. The plaintiff made further payment of taka 8,00,000.00 in 8(eight) installments from 09.03.2003 to 30.05.2004 towards the value of the said flat. The plaintiff paid taka 24,00,000.00 in total. Thereafter, on 19.08.2004, the plaintiff paid a sum of taka 1,00,000.00 (one lac) to defendant No.2 and entered into a tripartite agreement with the defendant-company for purchasing flat No.4/B (hereinafter referred to as the suit flat) of its project 'Heritage', DOHS, Banani to be constructed on the suit land. After the agreement had been handed over to the plaintiff, she found that the same was not signed by the owner of the suit land, Brigadier General Atiqur Rahman (deceased defendant No.3). When the matter had been enquired from defendant No.2, he told that Mr. Atiqur Rahman was abroad and he would be able to get the agreement signed by him after his return from abroad and she need not be worried over the matter and accordingly, on good faith, the plaintiff kept herself waiting. After some days when the plaintiff gave tagid to defendant No.2 to have the signature of Mr. Atiqur Rahman on the tripartite agreement, he told that since the owner of the suit land had agreement with them as developer, she would not face any difficulty even if there was delay in signing the agreement. However, the plaintiff continued to give tagid to defendant Nos. 1 and 2 for the signature of defendant No.3 on the tripartite agreement and every time defendant No.2 repeated that the owner of the suit land was outside the country and the moment he comes to Bangladesh, he will get the agreement signed by him on taking the balance money and would also register the kabala. In this way, the plaintiff had been kept waiting. In the meantime, more than 80% of the work of the project was completed. At that stage of the work, when again the plaintiff put pressure upon defendant No.2 for the signature of defendant No.3 on the tripartite agreement, he started talking inconsistently (আবোল তাবোল কথাবার্তা বলিতে থাকেন). She enquired into the matter and came to know that some problems cropped up between defendant No.3 and defendant Nos.l, 2, 6, 7 and 8 for which the work of the project was stopped and defendant No.2 also stopped taking money. On 01.11.2005, the plaintiff informed defendant Nos. 10 and 11, he Director of the Military Land and Cantonment Directorate and the Administrator, Military Estate, Central Circle, Dhaka Cantonment respectively about the fact of non-signing of the tripartite agreement by defendant No.3. Later on, the plaintiff came to know that defendant No.3 in order to deprive the plaintiff of the suit flat created some fraudulent documents in respect of the same in favour of his son and daughter, i.e. defendant Nos.4 and 5. In the meantime, the plaintiff could see that though the work of the project resumed, defendant Nos. l, 2, 6, 7 and 8 were not there and it was defendant No.9 who was completing the unfinished work of the project. The plaintiff further came to know that defendant No.3 drove defendant Nos. l, 2, 6, 7 and 8 from the project by force and did riot allow them to continue with the project and gave the charge to complete the unfinished work of the project to defendant No.9. That being the state of affairs, the plaintiff became frustrated and started looking frantically for defendant Nos. l, 2, 6, 7 and 8, but could not trace out their whereabouts. And then, on 05.02.2006, the plaintiff served a legal notice upon defendant No.2 and thus tried to inform him all facts in detail and also requested him to take necessary steps by 19.02.2006. Although the said period expired, defendant No.2 did not respond and hence the plaintiff filed the suit. In the meantime, defendant No.3 died and his heirs, defendant Nos.4 and 5 were substituted in his place.<br/> <br/>The suit was contested by defendant Nos.l and 2, 4 and 5 and 10 and 11 by filing 3(three) separate sets of written statement.<br/> <br/>The case of defendant Nos.l and <em>2 </em>was that defendant No.3 was the owner of the suit land. Defendant No.l is the company and defendant No.2 is its Chairman. On 18.10.2001, defendant No.3 executed an agreement with defendant No. 1 to construct a multistoried building on the suit land. As per terms of the agreement, defendant No.3 and defendant No.l would be the 50/50 owners of the flats to be constructed on the suit land and also of the garage in the same ratio.  At first, decision was taken to construct a 5(five) storied building. Subsequently, by an agreement dated 18.08.2002, the parties agreed to construct 7(seven) storied building instead of 5(five) storied, other terms of the agree-ment remained same. As per terms of the said agreement (18.08.2002), the defendants got the plan passed and after obtaining necessary permission started construction of the building by giving the 7th storey foundation and when construction of the 5th floor was about to be started, on the demand and pressure of defendant No.3, the defendants had to execute a supplementary deed of agreement on 16.08.2004. And as per terms of the said supplementary agreement out of 10 flats, defendant No.3 got flat Nos. l-A and 1-B in the 1st floor, flat Nos.5-A and 5-B in the 5th floor and flat No.2-B in the 2nd floor. The defendants got flat No.2-A in the second floor, flat Nos,3-A and 3-B in the 3rd floor and flat Nos.4-A and 4-B in the 4th floor. The defendants after completing 80% works of the project upto the 5th floor-were taking preparation for undertaking constru-ction of the 6th and the 7th floors. As per terms of the agreement, the defendants in order to sell flat Nos.2-A, 3-A, 3-B, 4-A and 4-B which fell in their share entered   into agreement with the buyers, namely: Md. Mo-zammel Hossain, defendant No.9-Md, Saiful Islam Bhuiyan, Ishtiaque Ahmed. Abdullahil Rakib and the plaintiff respectively and received part payment from them as advance. The defendants entered into the agreement with the plaintiff for selling the suit flat at taka 35,00,000.00 and out of the consideration money received taka 25,00,000.00 on various dates. The defendants also received taka 35,00,000.00 from defendant No.9 out of the total price of taka 43,50,000.00 and taka 32,00,000.00 out of the total price of taka 39,50,000.00 from Abdullahil Baqui. In the meantime, defendant No.3 started creating various problems with the defendants on some illogical issues and at his instigation Abdullahil Rakib and defendant No.9 took attempt to take over possession of the flats illegally in respect of which agreements were entered into with them without paying the balance money to defendant No.l. Later on, when the defendants in order to finish the construction work of the flats demanded balance money from them, they became furious and started opposing them. And in the evening of 28.02.2005, said Abdullahil Baqui and defendant No.9 came to the house of defendant No.2 and forcibly boarded him into a car in a filmy style on the false assurance that they would pay the balance money and after driving the car for some time compelled defendant No.2 to sign on some blank stamps and cartridge papers and then dropped him from the car. On 01.03.2005, defendant No.2 lodged a General Diary with Ramna Police Station complaining the above incident which was registered as G. D. Entry No.70. Thereafter, defendant No.2 also filed a petition of complaint before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka being Compl-aint Case No.584 of 2005. The petition of complaint was sent to the Police Station for investigation, but the police submitted final report against which the defendants filed naraji petition which had been also rejected; they filed a criminal revision before the Metrop-olitan Sessions Judge, Dhaka being Criminal Revision No.251 of 2006 which is still pending. In the meantime, at the instigation of defendant No.3, defendant No.9 and Mr. Abdullahil Rakib started threatening the defendants to take over possession of the flats under sale of contract to them by force without paying the balance contracted money; in the circumstances, the defendants finding no other way filed Title Suit No. 151 of 2005 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Second Court, Dhaka for permanent injunction against said Abdullahil Rakib, defendant No.9 and defen-dant No.3 impleading them as defendant Nos.l, 2 and 3 respectively; the suit is still pending and is contested by said Abullahil Rakib and defendant No.9. The defendants further asserted that the suit Hat was not sold to any one else except the plaintiff. The agreement between the defendants and defendant No.3 is still in existence. Abdullahil Rakib and defendant No.9 at the instigation of defendant No.3 are illegally obstructing the defendants from finishing the remaining works of the building and are not co-operating with them to hand over the suit flat to the plaintiff for which the defendants are not in a position to hand over the possession of the same. The defendants will have no objection if the plaintiff gets title and possession of the suit flat through Court.<br/> <br/>Defendant Nos.4 and 5 in their written statement contended, inter alia, that defendant No.3 was the owner of the suit land measuring ".66 kathas. On 18.10.2001, defendant N.).l entered into an agreement with defendant No.3 for construction of an apartment building on the suit land: the agreement was signed by defendant No.2 on behalf of defendant No.l-company as its Chairman. According to the terms of the agreement, defendant No. 1-company was supposed to construct 10(ten) flats, each measuring an area of 2050 square feet having 10(ten) garages, one against each of the flats, after obtaining plan from Cantonment Board and hand over the possession thereof to the land owner and the flat owners within 24 (twenty four) months. Under the terms of the said agreement defendant No.l out of his 5(five) flats being Nos.2/A, 3/A, 3/B, 4/A and 4/B, sold 4(four) flats except the suit flat (flat No.4/B) and received taka l,36,03,000.00(one crore thirty six lac and three thousand) from the buyers. But, the suit flat remained unsold. Though defen-dant Nos.l and 2 received the said amount from the buyers, they failed to complete the construction work or failed to under-take the construction work satisfactorily or failed to do the construction work properly as per terms of the agreement and had abandoned the construction site; the inten-ding flat buyers of the defendant-company found out the Chairman of the company, defendant No.2 and when asked him about the completion of the construction of the project, he expressed his inability to comp-lete the construction work. In the circum-stances, defendant No.2 and the other buyers of the flats of the building assessed the costs to be incurred for completing the project at taka 80,00,000.00 which inclu-ded the remaining balance amount of the contracted amount of the buyers of the flats and the estimated value of the suit flat. The total amount, due from the four buyers of the flats, was taka 24,47,000.00 (twenty four lac and forty seven thousand) and the estimated sale value of the suit flat was assessed at taka 40,00,000.00 (forty lac) i.e. in total taka 64,47,000.00(sixty four lac and forty seven thousand), could be collected from the project. Defendant No.2 further told that the project could be completed by the said money by employing skilled, experienced and honest persons. On the above understanding, defendant No.2, out of his own volition, had sworn an affidavit and also executed an agreement on 15.02.2005. Thereafter, defendant No.3 in order to complete all works of the partly constructed building of the project appointed (a) Ishtiaque Ahmed of flat No.3/B, (b) Md. Saiful Islam Bhuiyan of flat No.3/A, (c) Abdullahil Rakib of flat No.4/A and (d) Mozammel Hossain of flat No.2/A as attorneys by executing a power of attorney on 16.05.2005 giving them powers to complete the remaining works of the project 'Heritage<sup>1</sup> and to take various connections therein including the power of sale of the suit flat after making it ready for living and to collect money from the buyer. Thereafter, defendant No.3 and the buyers of the builder's company jointly completed the construction of the project 'Heritage apartment' including the suit flat and the suit flat was sold to one Nesarul Islam, son of late Shamsuddin Mollah on 12.09.2005. Possession of the suit flat was delivered to said Nesarul Islam and he has been in possession thereof peacefully with his family members. Flat Nos.3/A, 2/A, 4/A and 3/B are being possessed by Saiful Islam Bhuiyan (defendant No.9), Mozammel Hossain, Abdullahil Rakib and Ishtiaque Ahmed respectively. The other 5(five) flats being flat Nos.l/A, 1/B, 2/B, 5/A and 5/B were in possession of defendant No.3 who got those flats as the owner of the suit land as per terms of the agreement. The plaintiff neither entered into any contract with defendant No.3 nor with his attorney about the sale of the suit flat and she has no right, title and possession therein. Defendant No.3 died on 25.05.2006 leaving behind defendant Nos.4 and 5 and another daughter named Nilufer Atique and now they are in possession of the flats of defendant No.3 ™~ nlaintiff filed the suit at the ill advice and in collusion with defendant No.2 by creating false and fraudulent papers for illegal gain, so the plaintiffs suit was liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>The Director and the Administrator of Military Estate, Dhaka Cantonment, defendant Nos.10 and 11 in their written statement stated, inter alia, that the suit land was allotted in the name of defendant No.3 as a lease for 99 years. The lease deed was executed on 26.04.1961. The defendants approved a plan for construction of a multistoried building on the said land. The owner of the land took permission from the Cantonment Board and defendant No.l started construction on the suit land as per agreement. On 20.02.2006, the plaintiff informed the Cantonment Board that she purchased the suit flat at taka 35,00,000.00 and there was a tripartite agreement between the plaintiff, defendant No.2 and defendant No.3. But, Bridg. General M. Atiqur Rahman, defendant No.3, did not put his signature on the deed of agreement. She requested the defendants to take steps  so that the process of transfer of the suit flat to any one else could be not completed till disposal of his complaint.<br/> <br/>The learned Joint District Judge framed four issues in the suit, the issues being:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">মামলাটি অত্রাকারে  রক্ষণীয় কি না?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">(২) মামলাটি তামাদি বারিত কি না?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">বাদী ও ১-২ নং বিবাদীগণের মধ্যে নালিশী ফ্ল্যাট ক্রয়-বিক্রয়ের চুক্তি হইয়াছিল কি না এবং উহা ৪-৫ নং বিবাদী পক্ষেও উপর বাধ্যকর কি না?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">প্রার্থীত প্রতিকার পাইতে বাদী হকদার কি না?</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The learned Joint District Judge considering the pleadings of the parties and the evidence on record, oral and documentary, decided all issues in favour of the plaintiff and decreed the suit by judgment and decree dated 27.08.2007.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree passed by the learned Joint District Judge, defendant Nos.4 and 5 preferred First Appeal No.328 of 2007 before the High Court Division. A Division Bench of the High Court Division hearing the. appeal dismissed the same; hence this petition for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioners, has sub-mitted that as the developer without performing its part of obligation abandoned the project after misappropriating the money from the buyers, the contract executed between the developer and the land-owner had ceased to exist and therefore, there was nothing to compel the land owner to perform his part of obligation. He has further submitted that after taking over possession of the project site, the land owner collected money from different sources, such as: from other flat owners and by selling the suit flat to a third party and then got the unfinished work completed; third party to whom the suit flat was sold being a bonafide purchaser for value, was a necessary party in the suit, but he was not made a party. Therefore, the suit was not maintainable in law and the same was liable to be dismissed on that ground alone. He has lastly submitted that since the land owner did not sign the tripartite agreement and thus, there was no agreement between the plaintiff and the land owner, the plaintiff was not entitled to a decree for specific performance of contract against the petitioners being the heirs of defendant No.3, but the learned Judges failed to consider these factual and legal aspects of the case in its proper perspective and thus erred in law in concurring with the judgment and decree of the learned Joint District Judge and as such, the impugned judgment and decree calls for interference by this Division.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mahmudul Islam, learned Counsel, entering caveat on behalf of the plaintiff-respondent, on the other hand, has contended that after the execution of the first agreement dated 18.10.2001 between the developer compa-ny and the land owner, defendant No.3, two other agreements were executed between them being dated 18.08.2002 and 16.08.2004, the last one having been styled as 'supplementary deed of agreement' and in the last deed the parties made an amicable partition of the flats to be constructed on the suit land; as per clause 11 of the supplementary deed of agreement the suit flat fell in the share of the developer who entered into an agreement with the plaintiff for selling the same on 19th August, 2004, that is, within 4 days of the execution of the 'supplementary agreement' and the plaintiff being a bonafide purchaser for value is entitled to a decree for specific performance of contract. He has lastly submitted that mere non-signing of the tripartite agreement by the land owner shall not, in any way, affect the said right of the plaintiff, the High Court Division rightly dismissed the appeal concurring with those of the learned Joint District Judge and as such, no interference is called for with the impugned judgment and decree and the leave petition be dismissed.<br/> <br/>From the judgment and decree of the learned Joint District Judge, it appears that he decreed the suit on the finding, inter alia, that defendant Nos.4 and 5 in paragraph 21(Kha) and (Ga) of their written statement clearly admitted that 10(ten) flats to be constructed on the suit land would be equally owned by the developer and the land owner and the suit flat along with other flats fell in the share of defendant No.l; the defendants further stated that except the suit flat defendant No.l sold the four flats and thus ownership of defendant No.l-company in respect of the suit flat was admitted; exhibits-'Ka', 'Kha' and 'Ga', the documents filed by the defendants also proved the fact of ownership of the developer company of 5(five) flats; exhihit-'8' proved that defendant No.2 who is the Chairman of defendant No.l-developer-company entered into an agreement with the plaintiff for selling the suit flat i.e. flat No.4-B; defendant No.3 who died in the meantime, entered into a contract with defendant Nos.l and 2 and though defendant No.9 was not legally empowered, yet their non-cooperation and illegal behaviour (BQ1Z) with defendant No.2 in transferring the suit flat to the plaintiff demonstrated their weakness and in spite of the fact that defendant Nos.4 and 5 in their written statement admitted that the suit flat fell in the share of the developer (defendant No.l-company) by creating some illegal papers and by applying force in collusion with defendant No.9 resisted the legal right of the plaintiff in respect: of the suit flat.<br/> <br/>The learned Joint District Judge disbelieved exhibit-'Q' the agreement dated 15.02.2005 allegedly executed by defendant No.2 on the ground that although the same was shown to have been executed amongst 5(five) persons, the same bore the signatures of four persons on its first and second pages of taka 100 and taka 50 stamps and the 3rd page being a cartridge paper was signed by each of the five persons and at the typed column 6th party (ষষ্ঠ পক্ষের ঘরে) none signed. The learned Joint District Judge did not rely on the power of attorney, exhibit-'P' on the ground that the same was typed on four stamps of taka five having a seal of Gulshan Sub-Registrar's Office and moreso, after the amendment brought in the Registration Act, 2004, the power of attorney and the agreement for sale were compulsorily registerable. In not putting reliance upon exhibits-'Q' and 'P', the learned Joint District Judge also considered the case of defendant Nos.l and 2 that defendant No. 9 and Abdullahil Baqui went to the house of defendant No. 2 on 28.02.2005 arid played a false trick on him that he would be paid the money and got him boarded in a car and after obtaining his signatures on some blank stamp paper and cartridge paper by force dropped him from the car and he lodged a G.D. Entry with Ramna Police Station vide exhibit-'Gha' complaining the said incident; the learned Joint District Judge concluded by saying that Ô....এবং, ইহার ধারাবাহিকতায় প্রদর্শনী-‘চ’ সৃজন করা হইয়াছিল। ফলে, প্রদর্শনী-‘চ’ আইনগত কারনেই আর গ্রহনযোগ্যতা থাকে না।Õ With the above findings, the learned Joinl District Judge disbelieved the case of defendant Nos.4 and 5 that defendant No. 2 voluntarily entered into an agreement with the other people including defendant No. 9, executed a power of attorney giving authority to them to undertake tie remaining construction work of the apartment of the project in question and also swore an affidavit to the said effect.<br/> <br/>The learned Joint District Judge consid-ering   the   evidence   adduced   on behalf of defendant Nos.4 and 5 further held that the witnesses examined on their behalf stated in their deposition that the suit flat fell in the share of defendant No. 1 and the same was sold to the plaintiff. The learned Joint District Judge on consideration of sections 12(c) and 27 of the Specific Relief Act further held that even if the property under contract of sale is sold to a third party or remains in possession of the third party, the right, title and interest of the person with whom contract was first entered into, shall not, in any way, be affected and as such, the plaintiff was entitled to get the suit flat as per terms of the agreement. The learned Joint District Judge further found that the plaintiff is an old lady and she paid the entire consideration money.<br/> <br/>From the judgment and decree of the High Court Division, it appears that the learned Judges of the High Court Division concurred with all findings of the trial Court as jotted down hereinbefore on consideration of the evidence on record, both oral and documentary. The learned Judges while concurring with the learned Joint District Judge as to the entitlement of the plaintiff to get decree for specific performance of contract considered clauses 8 and 9 of the agreement dated 18.10.2001 and came to the finding that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"From the words employed in clause-9, it does not show that the right to choose of purchasers by defendant No. 2, depends subject to the condition of signing of defendant No. 3 on the tripartite agreement. In clause 9 of the agreement, it is only written 'the developer will have the right to choose purchaser and a tripartite agreement would be executed in which defendant No. 3, land owner would be a party.' No where it is written in clause 8 and 9 of the agreement that if defendant No.3, the owner of the landfalls to put his signature, the tripartite agreement would be void. Rather as per clause 8 and 9 respondent No. 3, the land owner has no option but to put his signature in the agreement and if he does not put his signature in the agreement, he will be failing in his duty according to the terms of agreement and this will not render the agreement void."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The High Court Division further observed that in the agreement the right of the developer to select the purchasers was not restricted in any way. The High Court Division also noticed the pleadings of the parties namely: the plaintiff, defendant Nos.l and 2 and defendant Nos.4 and 5 and then observed that "It is admitted that flat No.4-B was in the share of the defendant No.2. It is stated that 80% of the works of the project was completed. If defendant no.2 failed to complete the project, the remedies lie otherwise, but not by selling his flat No.4-B without his consent." The High Court Division in line with the learned Joint District Judge, considering the GD Entry lodged by defendant No.2 and the petition of complaint filed by him before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka wherein allegations were made that his signatures were taken on some blank stamps and cartridge papers forcibly and also the fact that though police submitted final report after investigation in respect of the petition of complaint filed by defendant No.2, he filed naraji against the said final report which was rejected, defendant No.2 filed Criminal Revision No.251 of 2006 and also filed a suit for permanent injunction being Title Suit No.151 of 2005 which is still pending for hearing, disbelieved the case of defendant Nos.4 and 5 that defendant No.2 executed an agreement voluntarily to complete the project by selling the suit flat. The learned Judges of the High Court Division considered the evidence of PW1, Shahid Ahmed, son of the plaintiff who was examined on behalf of his mother. PW2, Monowar Habib? interior designer, an indepen-dent witness, DW1-(defendant No.2), DW2-who deposed on behalf of defendant Nos.4 and 5, DW3-Secretary of DOHS and came to the clear finding that defendant No.2 got the suit flat (4-B) in his share; defendant Nos.10 and 11 who are the Director and the Administrator of the Military Estate, Dhaka Cantonment respectively stated in their written statement that they had no objection if the suit flat was given to the plaintiff and defendant No.2 admitted that he took money from the plaintiff for selling the suit flat to her.<br/> <br/>From the findings of the two Courts below, it is apparent that findings as to (a) the execution of agreement between defendant Nos.l and 2 and the deceased defendant No.3, the owner of the suit land for construction of an apartment building on the suit land with 10(ten) flats, under the name 'Heritage' (b) as per terms of the agreement executed between defendant Nos. l, 2 and deceased defendant No.3, the suit flat along with flat Nos.3/A, 2/A, 4/A and 3B fell in the share of the developer company (c) as per terms of the agreement, defendant No.l the developer company had absolute authority to choose its buyers and defendant No.3 could not have any say in the matter and he was simply obliged to sign the tripartite agreement (d) defendant No.2 entered into an agreement with the plaintiff for selling the suit flat at taka 35,00,000.00 and the plaintiffs made payment pursuant to the agreement (e) defendant No.2 did not execute any power of attorney and any deed of agreement voluntarily with defendant No.9 and the other buyers of the flats for undertaking construction of the remaining work of the project 'Heritage' on the suit land (f) the defendants (not defendant Nos.l and 2) had no right or authority to sell the suit flat to any one else (g) the developer finished the construction work of the project 'Heritage' more than 80% are concurrent. It is also necessary to state that of the concurrent  indings noted hereinbefore, the first two findings are based on the admission of defendant Nos.4 and 5 in their written Statement. Mr. Mahbubey Alam also failed to show with reference to the evidence on record, both oral and documentary, that those concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below are the result of misreading or non-consideration of any material evidence or the misconstruction of the documents particu-larly the agreements entered into between the developer company and the deceased defendant No.3, so we see no scope of interference with those findings of facts.<br/> <br/>The High Court Division rejected the objection raised by the appellants (petitioners herein) that the suit was bad for defect of party as Mr. Nesarul Islam, the subsequent purchaser, was not made a party in the suit on the clear finding that <em>"Admittedly no registered kabala was executed for sale of the suit flat No. 4 IB to Nesarul Islam" and since there was no document on record to show that the suit flat was sold to Nesarul Islam, he was not a necessary party in the suit. Therefore, there was no defect of party in framing the suit. Mr. Mahbubey Alam could not also refer to any registered document on record to dislodge the said finding of the High Court Division. In this regard, Mr. Mahmudul Islam has rightly referred to the evidence ofDW2 (he was examined as the attorney of defendant Nos.4 and 5) in his cross-examination to the effect </em><em>"</em>....নেসারুল ইসলাম এর কাছে নাঃ ফ্ল্যাট রেজিষ্ট্রী দলিল মুলে দেওয়া হয় নাই। তার সাথে বিক্রয়ের বায়না হয় কিনা আমার জানা নাই। মিউটেশন হয় নাই।" And these evidence of DW2 show that the learned Joint District Judge and the High Court Division took the correct view as to objection of the defect of party in framing the suit.<br/> <br/>In view of the above, the only point remains for consideration by this Division is whether the plaintiff was entitled to get the decree for specific performance of contract in respect of the suit flat against defendant No.3 and on his death against defendant Nos.4 and 5, though defendant No.3 did not sign the tripartite agreement. The learned Joint District Judge answered the point in the positive with the finding as under: "যেহেতু বাদিনীর সহিত ২নং বিবাদী ৪-বি নং ফ্ল্যাটটি বিক্রয়ের চুক্তি হইয়াছে এবং যেহেতু ৩নং বিবাদী ল্যান্ড ওনার এর সহিত ১-২নং বিবাদী ডেভোলোপার এর স্বীকৃত চুক্তি মোতাবেক ৪-বি নং ফ্ল্যাটটি ২নং বিাবদীর অংশভূক্ত ফ্ল্যাট সেহেতু ঐ ফ্ল্যাট পাইতে বাদিনী আইনতঃ হকদার।"<br/> <br/>In coming to the said conclusion, the learned Joint District Judge considered the provisions of sections 12(c) and 27 of the Specific Relief Act. The learned Judges of High Court Division also took similar view.<br/> <br/>Now let us see whether the Courts below were correct in taking the above view.<br/> <br/>In deciding the point, we are to remember that the concept of undertaking construction on one's land by a developer company is a new development in our country, and it is still developing, and definitely when the Specific Relief Act was enacted in 1877 none even conceived of this kind of transaction. In this kind of transaction like the instant case, the land owner first enters into an agreement with a developer company to undertake construction works on his land on the terms and conditions as stipulated therein and also gives a power of attorney to the developer to undertake all necessary steps and works for undertaking   such construction on his land. As usual the developer company which  invests  its capital or money in undertaking the construction  work  on  the   land  of the owner is given the right to forward sell the flats which fall in his share as per terms of the agreement and by virtue of the said right, the developer company forward sells or enters into agreement with the buyers for sale of the flats within his share and a stipulation is also made in the contract between the developer and the owner of the land to sign the contract of such forward sale along with the prospective buyer which is called a tripartite agreement. And now this kind of transaction is known as real estate business. It is also to be noted that in this kind of deal or transaction, the entire financial investment is made by the developer. Same thing happened in the instant case. This will be clear if we consider the preambles and the terms of the 3 (three) contracts executed between the land owner and the developer company, defendant No. 1.<br/> <br/>The first contract between the land owner, (deceased defendant No.3) and the developer company (defendant No.l) was signed on 18.10.2001, the first paragraph of the preamble of the said agreement reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"WHEREAS the land owner has offered his land executioned and described in the scheduled for developer in order to construct a G+5 stored (sic) building. The developer has agreed to develop the same by constructing a G + 5 storied building having with moderns amenities by spending his own money or with the help of advance money taken from buyers or by taking loan from Bank or Financial Institution. The developer shall sell flats to buyers after keeping 50 % flats for the land owner.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Clauses 8 and 9 of the said agreement read as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"08. That the developer will have the rights to register deed of conveyance to the purchasers of the 50% flats. </em><br/><em>09.   That the developer shall have the liberty to forward sell flats and obtain part payment as advance from intending buyers and execute deed of agreement showing undivided interest in the soil in favour of buyers and in that case a tripartite deed of agreement shall be executed to which the land owner would be one of the parties. Liabilities   for   advance   money   thus received shall be of the developers only. "</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>This agreement was followed by another agreement executed on 18.08.2002 between defendant No.3 and the developer-company making provision for constructing 2(two) more stories subject to the approval by the Cantonment Board. The first two paragraphs of the preamble of this agreement read as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"WHEREAS, the Land Owner has offered his land executioned and described in the schedule for the developer in order to construct, at first, a Six storied building (Ten Flats) and after approval from the Cantonment Board, to construction additional two story i. e.

The Developer has agreed to develop the same by constructing at (sic) a Six storied building (Ten Flats) and after approval from the Cantonment Board to construct additional Two story i.e. Eight story flat building (Fourteen Flats) having modern amenities by spending his own money or with the help of advance money taken from buyers or by taking a loan from the Bank or a Financial Institution. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>The Developer shall sell the first 5 (five) flats to buyers and after approval from the Cantonment Board for Eight Story Construction, an additional 2(two) flats, i.e. Total 7(seven) Flats.

The foundation for the Eight Storied building will now be made."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Clauses 7-10 of the agreement are as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"7. That the Developer shall have the rights to register the Deed of Conveyance to the purchasers of the 50% Flats giving full possession of the 50% Flats and 50% of Parking Space to the Land Owner.

" </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>And this deed was again followed by another deed dated 16.08.2004 under the style <em>"</em><em>SUPPLEMENTARY DEED OF AGREEMENT</em><em>."</em><br/><br/>Paragraphs 1, 5 and 6 of the preamble of his supplementary agreement read as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"AND WHEREAS the LAND OWNER has mutually agreed to make changes in the original DEED OF AGREEMENT dated 18.08.2002 and the parties made this Supplementary Deed of Agreement</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>WHEREAS the land Owner has offered his land executioner and described in the scheduled for the developer in order to construct a six-storied building (Ten Flats).

Land Owner would have no liabilities of any manner."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is also to be noted that defendant Nos.4 and 5 never denied the execution of the three agreements by their predecessor, deceased defendant No. 3 with the developer company. Rather DW2 in his examination-in-chief as well as in cross-examination by the plaintiff cearly admitted execution of the said three agreements by deceased defendant No. 3. Relevant portion of the evidence of DW2 is as follows:"......৩নং বিবাদী ১৮/১০/২০০১ ইং তাং ১৮/৮/২০০২ইং ১৬/৮/২০০৪ইং তারিখ তিনটি চুক্তি করেছিল ডেভেলপার এর সাথে।"<br/> <br/>The major difference between the first 2(two) agreements and the last agreement (supplementary agreement) was that in the last agreement the parties, i.e. the developer and the land owner (defendant No. 3) made an amicable partition between them of the flats to be constructed on the suit land and as per the said partition, the suit flat fell in the share of the developer, defendant No. 1 of which defendant No.2 is the Chairman. It is also significant that the agreement to sell the suit flat by the developer to the plaintiff was entered into on 19.08.2004, i.e. after the execution of the supplementary agreement on 16.08.2004 and defendant Nos.l and 2 in their written statement categorically admitted the fact of entering into agreement with the plaintiff (exhibit-8) for selling the suit flat which fell in their share. It is also very pertinent to state that defendant Nos.4 and 5 in their written statement clearly admitted the fact of selling the four other flats by the developer to the other sellers, namely: defendant No.9-Md. Saiful Islam, Ishtiaque Ahmed, Abdullahil Rakib and Mozammel Hossain and no question was also raised by them about the signing of the tripartite agreement by deceased defendant No.3 while selling 4(four) flats to them. Defendant Nos.4 and 5 raised the dispute only about the sale of the suit flat. The paragraphs of the preambles of 3(three) agreements and the clauses as quoted hereinb-efore clearly show that the land owner undertook to sign the agreement to be executed in between the developer and the purchaser to be called as tripartite agreement. It is also noteworthy to mention that the terms of the agreements clearly show that the land owner had/has no stake whatsoever in selling the flats by the developer to the buyers and that he would have no choice but to sign the agreement which would be executed and signed by the developer with the buyer. The terms of the agreements further show that the land owner gave unqualified power and authority to the developer to forward sell the flats of its share and to receive part payment as advance money against such sale of the flats from the buyers including the power to register the deed of conveyance and also to enter into agreement for such sale. But, the facts as emerged from the pleading show that defendant No.3 preferred not to sign the agreement entered into between the plaintiff and the developer and in the suit defendant Nos.4 and 5 took the plea that since defendant No.3 did not sign the tripartite agreement, they were not bound by the agreement executed between defendant No.2 and the plaintiff on 19.08.2004; in other words, defendant No.3 not being party to the agreement, the same could not be specifically enforced against defendant Nos.4 and 5 who are the heirs of defendant No.3(since dead).<br/> <br/>Now, the question is when defendant No.3 in three written agreements specifically undertook to sign the tripartite agreement to be executed between the developer and the buyer, could he, and in his absence, defendant Nos.4 and 5, take the plea that since defendant No.3 did not sign the tripartite agreement specific performance of contract entered into between the plaintiff and defendant Nos.l and 2 could not be enforced against them. Our answer is-no. Because in that case, the purchaser-plaintiff who having seen the agreements executed between the land owner and the developer, on good faith, entered into agreement with the developer to purchase the suit flat and paid her good money for the purpose, shall be defrauded. Further, reading the clauses of 3(three) agreements executed between the land owner and the developer as quoted hereinbefore, it appears to us that the land owner having allowed the developer to forward sell of the flats of their share to the buyers by entering into agreement and accepting part payment as advance, was duty bound to sign the tripartite agreement. We are also of the view that since the land owner in clear terms undertook in the agreements executed between him and the developer to sign the tripartite agreement, he was estopped from taking such plea within the meaning of section 115 of the Evidence Act, because, he by signing the 3 (three) agreements with the developer in the terms as quoted hereinbefore caused a belief in the mind of the plaintiff, a buyer that he would put his signature in the tripartite agreement as a matter of course. The plea of defendant Nos.4 and 5 also sounds to us a bit strange and self contradictory as, though they admitted the fact of sale of the other flats by the developer to four persons (names have been mentioned hereinbefore), they took a completely revetse plea in respect of the suit flat. It is also to be noted that defendant Nos.4 and 5 clearly admitted the fact of getting the flats which fell in their share. One thing we must point out here is that in support of the case <em>of </em>defendant Nos.4 and <em>5 </em>that defendant No.2 having failed to undertake the construction work of the project 'Heritage' had abandoned the project, the defendants failed to file a single scrap of paper to show that either they or the other purchasers from the developer ever made any correspondence with the developer company and gave any notice to them asking them to complete the construction of the project. And this in fact substantiates the case of defendant Nos.l and 2 that defendant No.2 never executed any deed of agreement in favour of defendant No.9 and other fiat purchasers and any power of attorney giving them any power to complete the rest work of the project 'Heritage'. It is also very important to state that in the 1st and the last agreement executed between the land owner and the developer there were provisions for penalty at the rate of taka 50,000.00 per month to be paid to the land owner by the developer in case the developer failed to hand over the flats to him within the time stipulated therein. Therefore, defendant No.3 had no reason or cause to disengage the developer from undertaking the remaining work of the project and then to take step to complete the works by engaging others as alleged by defendant Nos.4 and 5. The plea that since defendant No.3 did not sign the tripartite agreement, defendant Nos.4 and 5 are not bound by the contract entered into between the plaintiff and defendant Nos.l and 2, does not also appear to us bonafide. If such plea is given countenance to, then, the intending buyers from the builder construction companies shall be put into unnecessary harassment and suffering which shall have also a negative impact upon the real estate business.<br/> <br/>In the context, we feel it necessary to consider clauses (a)(b)(c)(d)(e) and (f) of the interpretation clause of the Contract Act as given in section 2 thereof in order to see whether mere non-signing of the tripartite agreement shall absolve defendant No.3 4nd in his absence defendant Nos.4 and 5 from being bound by the agreement which was signed by the two other parties, namely, the developer and the plaintiff.<br/> <br/>Clauses (a)-(f) of  the interpretation 'clause read as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(a)     When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal:<br/>(b)    When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal, when accepted becomes a promise:<br/>(c)     The person making the proposal is called the <em>"promisor," </em>and the person accepting the proposal is called the <em>"promise".</em><br/>(d)    When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains, from doing or promises to do or to abstain from doing something,   such act or abstinence or promise is called a consideration for the promise:<br/>(e)     Every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration for each other, is an agreement:<br/>(f)     Promises which form the consideration or part of the consideration for each other are called reciprocal promises:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From a combined reading of the above clauses of section 2 of the Contract Act read with the paragraphs of the preambles and the terms of 3(three) agreements as discussed above, it is abundantly clear that defendant No.3 entered into an agreement: with defendant Nos.l and 2 to sign the tripartite agreement without any reservation, whatsoever, in case the developer forward sells its share of the flats of the project 'Heritage<sup>1</sup>. As already stated hereinbefore, in paragraphs 21(ga) of the written statement defendant Nos.4 and 5 categorically admitted that flat Nos.2/A, 3/A, 3/B, 4/A and 4-B fell in the share of the developer. So, defendant No.2 did not commit any wrong or illegality in entering into contract with the plaintiff to sell the suit flat. In this regard, we may also refer to section 10 of the Contract Act. This section has clearly spelt out that all agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract for a lawful object and are not "hereby expressly declared to be void." "Hear" refers to second part of the section (second part of the section is not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the instant case). Now .if we flashback to the preambles and the clauses of the agreements as entered into between the developer-company and defendant No'. 3 as quoted hereinbefore and consider those along with clauses (a)(b)(c)(d)(e) and (f) of section 2 and section 10 of the Contract Act, it would prima facie appear that the land owner of his own accord agreed to sign the agreement to be executed between the developer and the buyers of the flats which fell in the share of the developer, therefore, the plea of defendant Nos.4 and 5 that their predecessor defendant No.3 not being a signatory to the tripartite agreement the same cannot be enforced against them is not legally sustainable.<br/> <br/>It is very significant to state that defendant Nos.4 and 5 never took the plea that defendant No.3 rescinded or cancelled the contract executed with the developer-company. It is also very pertinent to state that in paragraph-20 of the last agreement (the supplementary agreement), it has been specifically stipulated that "any dispute or differences arising between the parties of this Deed with regards to the construction shall be referred to Military Estate Officer (M.E.O) Dhaka Cantonment, Dhaka and has them settled once for all." But, the land owner (deceased defendant No.3) never resorted to the said arbitration clause, though the case of defendant Nos.4 and 5 was that as the developer could not complete the work of the project satisfactorily they had abandoned the project and then defendant No. 3 completed rest work of the project by engaging his own men including the other flats' buyers from the developer-company. Rather it is the plaintiff who approached the Cantonment Board by filing an application on 20.12.2006 complaining that though the developer signed the tripartite agreement in respect of the sale of the suit flat, the land owner did not sign the same as admitted by defendant Nos.10 and 11 in their written statement. The plea of defendant Nos.4 and 5 that defendant No.2 voluntarily executed an agreement on 15.02.2005 in favour of the other flat owners to complete the remaining works of the project 'Heritage' by expressing his inability to finish the work is purely question of fact and the plea has been disbelieved by the Courts below by giving reasons with reference to the evidence as already discussed hereinbefore (we do not discuss it here to avoid repetition). More interesting part of the case is that defendant Nos.4 and 5 in their written statement categorically admitted the fact of sale of other four flats by the developer to four buyers (except the suit flat) and also receipt of taka 1,36,03,000.00 from them and thus admitted the fact of ownership of the developer about 5 (five) flats including the suit flat and also their right to transfer those flats then how defendant No.3 and after his death defendant Nos.4 and 5 could deny their liability to execute and register the kabala in respect of the suit flat? We also failed to understand how defendant No.3 and other flat buyers from the developer of the project in question could claim to sell the suit flat when admittedly the same fell in the share of the developer and defendant No.2 as its Chairman entered into an agreement with the plaintiff to sell the same. Such a case of defendant Nos.4 and 5, sounds to us absolutely illogical as well as unconscionable. And moreso, when the agreem-ents entered into between the land owner and the developer had remained in force till date.<br/> <br/>Chapter 11 of the Specific Relief Act has dealt with "Of the Specific Performance-for Contracts". Section 12 of the Act has dealt with the contracts which may, in the discretion of the Court be enforced in the discretion of the Court except as otherwise provided in the Chapter. In the context, wc are concerned with clause (a) of section 12. From a reading of clause (a) and the main section it is° clear that when the act agreed to be done is in the performance wholly or partly, of a trust that can be specifically enforced. In the instant case, defendant No. 1 developer having the right to forward sell the suit flat entered into an agreement vide exhibit-'S' with the plaintiff by signing the same and the plaintiff having paid the part payment of the contracted money which has also been admitted by defendant Nos.l and 2 in their written statement, the act agreed to be done was partly performed and was in the nature of a trust, the land owner having agreed in unequivocal term to sign the tripartite agreement in case the developer forward sells out the flats of its share could not have a different identity other than a party with the developer and could not keep himself away by not signing the agreement. And/defendant Nos.4 and 5 being the heirs or defendant No.3, specific performance of the contract, can very much be enforced against them within the meaning of section 27 of the Specific Relief Act. Therefore, the Court below rightly decreed the suit. It may be stated that breach of agreement to sell a flat to be constructed on the suit land cannot be adequately compensated by money as explained by the legislature in the explanation appended to the section and therefore, clauses (b) (c) and (d) to section 12 are also attracted in the instant case.<br/> <br/>In view of the above, the High Court Division did not commit any illegality in concurring with the decision of the learned Joint District Judge in decreeing the suit.<br/> <br/>From the statements made in the plaint and the written statement of defendant Nos. 1 and 2 and the evidence on record one thing is clear that after 80% of the works of the project 'Heritage' particularly, the suit flat was completed the land owner somehow disengaged the developer from completing the remaining work of the project and then it was done by him through his men. So, defendant Nos.4 and 5 are entitled to get the cost incurred in completing the 20% works of suit flat from the developer company which escaped the notice of the learned Joint District Judge as well as the High Court Division. In this regard, it may be stated that though in paragraph-5 of the plaint, the plaintiff specifically stated that 80% works of the project was completed when she was giving pressure upon the developer to get the signature of defendant No.3 in the agreement dated 19.08.2004, defendant Nos.4 and 5 after quoting the said portion of the plaint in their written statement simply denied the same in a general way without stating their version of the progress of the work. Defendant Nos.l and 2 also in their written statement asserted that they completed more than 80% work of the project and these assertions of defendant Nos.l and 2 were also not denied by defendant Nos.4 and 5 in their written statement. Defendant Nos.4 and 5 have also not stated how much cost was incurred for the completion of the remaining 20% works of the suit flat (we are not concerned about the other flats of the project). It is also noteworthy that in paragraph 21 of the written statement where actual facts have been stated defendant Nos.4 and 5 have not stated at what stage of the work of the project the developer had allegedly abandoned the same. Be that as it may, assessment of cost is basically a question of fact and this is neither desirable nor possible for this Division. If, so advised, defendant Nos.4 and 5 may demand the amount of 20% of the cost incurred by them in completing the work of the suit flat from the developer by giving notice in writing within one month from the date of receipt of this judgment by furnishing accounts of such cost and if any dispute arises as to the quantum of cost between them, then the parties may resolve the matter by resorting to clause 20 of the supplementary agreement dated 16.08.2004.<br/><br/>With the above observations, this petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> <br/> </div></div></div>

Azimuddin, son of Md. Abdus Sobhan a sum of Taka 40,000/- for the purchase of his land but the said Azimuddin did not execute and register the sale of the land concerned nor did he return the money on various excuses even after several reminders to him; that on 20.5.97, around 4.30 p.m. the said Azimuddin along with two faithful associates namely Md. Abed Ali and Md. Ashraf Ali, the  accused petitioners herein, took the deceased Kayemuddin to the hat at Jigatola and after he finished his shopping in the hat the accused persons called the deceased out of the hat  for the discussion about the monetary transaction relating to the said purchase of land; that a number of witnesses saw the accused persons talking to deceased Kayemuddin and he was seen going out of the hat with the accused persons; that the deceased Kayemuddin did  not return home and at about 1.30 a. m. to 2.00 a. m. the accused persons awakened the complainant  and called him out of his hut whereupon he became afraid and raised  alarm when the close relatives rushed to him and the accused fled away; that on the following day the dead body of the father of the complainant  was found hanging from a tree; that the accused petitioner Md. Abed Ali registered an unnatural death case in respect of deceased Kayemuddin; that the dead body was sent to the local hospital for post mortem which reported that the father of the complainant was killed.<br/><br/>Thereafter the case was investigated by the police, who submitted charge sheet under section 264/302/201/34 of the Penal Code against the persons including the appellants on 23.6.1998.<br/><br/>Thereafter the case was transmitted to the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Naogaon for trial and registered as Sessions Case No. 9 of 1999 wherein charge was so framed against the accused persons under section  302/201/34 of the Penal Code which was read over to the accused persons wherein they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>The defence case as it transpires from the trend of cross- examination of the P.Ws. that the case was false and they were implicated falsely out of enmity and also victim of circumstances in this case.<br/><br/>During trial the prosecution examined 10 witnesses  and defence examined none. Thereafter the appellants were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure   wherein they again claimed to be innocent.<br/><br/>Considering the deposition of the prosecution witnesses and hearing the parties, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Ist. Court, Naogaon convicted and sentenced the accused appellants as stated above. Being aggrieved there against the appellants preferred the instant 2(two) separate appeals. <br/><br/>The learned advocate appearing for the appellants submits that this is absolutely a case of no evidence and the prosecution has failed to prove the charge by adducing any corroborative evidence of the prosecution witnesses, in view of the matter since the appellants were convicted on mere surmises and conjecture and they are benefit of doubt at least  and as such the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>The learned Assistant Attorney General appearing for the respondent submits that the trial court committed no illegality in convicting them of the offence as alleged and further submits that the trial court has correctly assessed the evidence on record and rightly convicted and sentenced them and as such there is nothing to interfere in the impugned judgment and he thus prays for dismissal of the appeals.<br/><br/>Heard the learned advocate of both the sides and perused the L.C.Records and the impugned judgment. In view of the submission that this is a case of no evidence on the very out set we like to see  the evidence of the prosecution side.<br/><br/>P.W.1 Md. Abdur Razzak stated in his deposition that at about 4.30 p.m on 20.5.1997  accused Abed and Ashraf Ali called his father and went to market to purchase goods  from the market, when on quarry of his uncle he said that he will be late to come, he  further disclosed that his father  was then staying with accused Abed, Tajimuddin, Ashraf, Sobhan, Azimuddin and Ala Box and thereafter his father did not return back home, he then taking anxiety went on sleep; at about 1.30 a.m. at night accused Abed, Ashraf and Tajimuddin called him through window and asked him to come out, on the torch light he found to recognize them they were holding  stick on their hand and accordingly on fair he declined to go out to his house. On quarry about his father he did not make  any reply. He further disclosed  that at that time he went to  his mother, younger brother  uncle Salimuddin  but he later called  them and noticing their presence the accused persons went away from the  window. On fear he did not go out of his room on the night. On the following morning  one Amisa,  wife of  Abdul Sheikh informed that the deadbody of his  father  is hanging on the Jam tree near to the pond of Riaz uddin. He  then rushed to the spot  and found the dead body on hanging undressed. Viewing the same he  become abnormal and thereafter he came to know  that accused Abed Ali went to the police station, thereafter the police went to the place of occurrence and prepared the surathal report and  sent the dead body for postmortem  and thereafter the dead body was buried. Few days thereafter accused Ala Box confessed and disclosed that accused Abed, Tazimuddin and Ashraf killed his father on the night. After  the occurrence accused persons left the village. After postmortem and taking all news  of his fathers death, he lodged the FIR. He identified the accused persons on dock, in his cross-examination  he further stated that he has two other brothers, one is farmer and another is student of Madrasha, he has 2 uncles Kalimuddin and Nayeb Ali, he has got  maternal uncle. He further disclosed that Jigatala  hut sits twice a week from 3 P.M to 9 P.M but having no permanent  structure of the shop Mehespur and Shibpur hat is big and peoples of the village goes to that hat. At the stage his deposition was postponed on 26.9.2000 and it was further taken on 08.07.2003 wherein he denied the defence suggestion that his father was not called by the accused to the hut and not been killed by the accused persons.<br/><br/>P.W.2. Md. Sekandar Ali declared hostile.<br/><br/>P.W. Most. Omesa Bibi, P.W.6 Biraj and P.W.7 Md.Yeasin Ali were tendered by the prosecution and the defence declined to cross-examine them.<br/><br/>P.W.4 Abdul Hamid, union parishad member, a witness of the surathal report proved his signature  in the surathal report, stated in his deposition that “মৃত কাইমুদ্দিন গলায় ফাঁস দিয়া গাছের সহিত--­----আত্মহত্যা করিয়াছে শুনিয়াছি।”<br/><br/>P.W.5. Md. Abul Hossain stated in his deposition  that on 21.5.97 one man was committed suicide, on the following day  he came to know the dead body of Kayemuddin. P.W. 8 Doctor Mozammel Haque, who held the autopsy and submitted postmortem. P.W.9 Magistrate Salina Sahadat, who recorded the confessional statement of accused Ala Bax. P.W.10. S.I. Sukumar Mohanta deposed in court as investigating officer of the case, who submitted  charge sheet and proved the charge sheet. In this case accused Ala Box Sheikh made a confessional statement. These are the evidences adduced by the  prosecution side.<br/><br/>It has been alleged in the FIR that the accuseds called the victim from his house subsequently the victim went to the hat and thereafter informants uncle Salimuddin saw  the victim to go with the accused persons and thereafter the victim was not found to have been back to his home and following  morning  his dead body was found hanging. In this case neither  Salimuddin  who saw the victim to go with the accused persons,  deposed in court to prove the said version of last departure of the victim with the accused persons and the informant  while deposing in court as P.W.1 also did not reiterate  the said versions of the FIR that the accused persons called the victim from his house to the  market rather he has said that the accused  persons call the victim from the market  to have been seen by  his uncle Salimuddin. Thus according to the deposition of P.W.1, the first calling  by the accused persons from the house was not been proved even by the informant himself and the next story of last seen to go the victim with the accused persons as narrated  by the informant’s uncle Salim Uddin also not been proved, by the said Salimuddin, since he did not depose in court. Thus in any view of the matter the story of calling the victim by the  accused persons was not been proved by adducing any evidence. In this case there is no other evidence other than P.W.1 to come forward to prove the prosecution story. All other reliable witnesses  either were declared hostile  or been tendered  by the prosecution side. Thus in this case only P.W.1 was remained as sole witness to prove the prosecution story but on plain reading of the deposition of the P.W.1 as we have observed above that he failed to connect  the accused persons with the alleged  occurrence. In this case there  is no evidence on record to show that the victim in any way was called by any of the accused persons, only a circumstance  has been tried to make out to connect the accused persons  in committing offence of killing the victim but when the vital witness, named Salimuddin who alleged to saw the victim to go with the accused persons and the other witnesses as alleged  in the FIR since not been produced in court to examine and to substantiate the charge  brought in this case, the appellants are absolutely entitled to get the benefit of section 114G of the Evidence Act. In this case we have also found that a statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was taken from a accused Ala Box Sheikh but while examining  Ala Box Sheikh by the court under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the said accused also disclosed before the court  that the said statement was taken  on torture and it was not  voluntary and true enough. Further the confession of the accused  even if taken to be true is not sufficient enough to found him guilty, since there is no other evidence to connect the present appellants in the alleged commission of offence. The trial court thus appears to have passed the impugned judgment  and convicted the appellants only on mere surmises and conjecture. Since the prosecution has failed to prove the charge levelled against the appellants, they are entitled to get benefit of doubt at least.<br/>Considering all these aspect of the case, we found that  this is absolutely a case of   no evidence and the trial court convicted the appellant on mere surmises and conjecture which is liable to be set aside. We thus found merits in these 2 (two) appeals.<br/><br/>In the result, the 2(two) appeals are allowed and the judgment and order dated 12.09.2006 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Ist. Court,Naogaon in Sessions Case No. 09 of 1999 is hereby set aside and the appellants are found not guilty of the charge levelled against them and they are hereby acquitted and is directed to set at liberty at once if not wanted in connection with any other case.<br/><br/>        Send down the L.C. records at once along with the judgment.<br/><br/><strong>          Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The defendants case is that the defendant No.3 proposed to sell the suit land to defendant Nos.4 and 5 but they refused to purchase but the defendant Nos.1-2 agreed to purchase with Tk.75,000/- and date was fixed on 27.12.1990 for registration of the deed but due to non-availability on the consideration money it was not registered; that the Sub-registrar was absent due to leave for some days and as such the deed was registered at Sharsa Sub-registrar office and some land of defendant No.3 was written in the schedule of the deed and the defendant nos.1-2 got possession. The alleged kabala deed of the plaintiff is false, collusive and illegal. Thus, the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>It is stated in the revisional application that the defendant No.4 being pre-emptor filed pre-emption case No.10 of 1993 against the kabala dated 27.12.1990 and both the case was heard and disposed of analogously by the trial Court.<br/> <br/>That the learned Assistant Judge framed three issues in the suit:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">Is the Kabala 27.12.1990 collusive, illegal and void?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Has the plaintiff title and possession to the suit land?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Is the plaintiff entitled to get the relief as prayed for?</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">After hearing the parties learned Assistant Judge, Sadar, Jessore by his judgment and decree dated 29.11.1993 decreed the suit of the plaintiff.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and decree the defendant Nos.1 and 2 filed Title Appeal No.32 of 1994 before the District Judge, Jessore which was transferred to the Subordinate Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Jessore who by his judgment and decree dated 6.6.2001 dismissed the appeal.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 6.6.2001 passed in Title Appeal No.32 of 1994 defendant petitioner preferred this Civil Revision before this Court and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/>No one appears on behalf of the petitioner at the time of hearing of the Rule.<br/> <br/>On the other hand Mr. A.K. Monzurul Haque, the learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the opposite party No.1.<br/> <br/>I have perused the revisional application, impugned Judgment and decree passed by both the Courts below and other documents on record. I have also heard the learned Advocate for the opposite party No.1.<br/> <br/>It is stated in the revisional application that both the Courts below did not apply their judicial mind to consider the oral and documentary evidence produced by the defendants in support of this case rather have misread and misconstrued the same and thus committed error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/>It is further stated that 2 decimals land of S.A. Plot No.973 of Mouza Tengrali of Police Station Sharsa under District jessore was maternal property of the vendor of the kabala deed dated 27.12.1990 and as such Section 28 of the registration Act does not create any bar against the said kabala and non-considering the fact both the courts below committed error of law resulting an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. It is also asserted that the land of schedule was not inserted in the schedule of the kabala dated 18.12.1990 only to give the jurisdiction but it was sold to the defendant Nos.1-2 with valuable consideration and the defendant Nos.1-2 have been possess-ing the same as their own and non-considering the aforesaid fact both the courts below committed error of law resulting an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/>It is also asserted in the application that after due execution and registration of the kabala dated 27.12.1992 in favour of the defendant Nos.1-2, Vendor the defendant No.3 in collusion with his nephew plaintiffs falsely created the alleged kabala dated 13.2.1991 claiming a concocted story of the bainanama dated 22.7.1990 and moreover the full brother of the vendor defendant No.3, the defendant No.4 admitting the validity of the kabala dated 27.12.1990 filed the pre-emption Miscellan-eous Case No.10 of 1993 against the said kabala and the plaintiffs and their full uncle the defendant Nos.3-4 are taking all roots to deprive the defendant Nos.1-2 from the suit land which is against the natural justice and non-considering the fact both the courts below committed error of law resulting an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/>Mr. A.K. Monzurul Haque, the learned Advocate for the opposite party No.1 submits that both the courts below concurrently found that the alleged kabala dated 27.12.1992 was registered at the Sharsha Upa Zila, District Jessore which is out of jurisdiction and there is no existence of such land. He further argued that the defendants in their cross-examination admitted that they have no knowledge and possession in the aforesaid 2 decimals of land. Finally he argued that Section 28 of the Registration Act is barred in such type of insertion in the schedule to create jurisdiction to a different Sub-registrar office and the plaintiff was not a party of that kabala of that registration rather he is a  third party. As such the learned District Judge as a last court of fact found that the learned Assistant Judge on considering of the evidence on record and also considering Section 28 of the Registration Act lawfully passed the decree in favour of the plaintiffs and there is no illegality in the impugned judgment. Thus, the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/>One Abdul Sobahan was the owner of the suit land of plot No.570, who transferred the same to his sons defendant Nos.3-5 by kabala dated 22.7.1990; plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant No.3 to purchase his share with Tk.60,000/- only out of which Tk.20,000/- only was paid as earnest money on 15.12.1990 and thereafter the defendant No.3 executed and registered kabala by receiving the rest of Tk.40,000/- only; that the plaintiffs asked to pay the rent on 1.9.1991 to the defendant No.4 who disclosed that the defendant No.3 has sold the suit land to defendant Nos.1-2 against which the defendant No.4 has filed pre-emption case and thereafter the plaintiff opposite party No.1 filed the suit.<br/> <br/>The defendant Nos.1-2 in their written statements stated that the defendant No.3 proposed to sell the suit land to defendant Nos.4 and 5 but they refused to purchase but the defendant Nos.1-2 agreed to purchase with Tk.75,000/- and date was fixed for registration on 27.12.1990 but due to non-availability of the consideration money it was registered later on and due to absence of the sub-registrar, deed was registered at Sharsha Sub-registry Office.<br/> <br/>The learned Assistant Judge after considering the evidence adducing by the parties found that the defendants included 2 decimals of land at Sharsha Upa Zila which is fictitious and non-existence. In support of his aforesaid findings the learned Assistant Judge found that: “ ডি,ডব্লিউ (১) মো: দাউদ হোসেন জেরাতে বলেন যে, টেচয়ারী মৌজার ৯৭৩ ও হাল ৪৪৭ দাগের জমি আমি চিনি না এবং ঐ জমি জীবনে দেখিনাই। ঐ জমি সংক্রন্ত কোন কাগজপত্র বা দলিল আমি দাখিল করিনাই এবং দাখিল করতে পারবো না। ৯৭৩ দাগটি আমি দখল করি না।”<br/> <br/>On its turn appellate court found that the learned Assistant Judge lawfully decided the matter in favour of the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>In the case of Syed Kawsar Ali…Vs. Gahar Kazi and others reported in BCR 1985 AD 309. Wherein it is decided that, “ Inclusion of a fictitious plot situated in a different place to give jurisdiction to a different Sub-Registrar office for the purpose of registration of the kabala within the jurisdiction of that Sub-Registrar office affecting the interests of a third party-If the affected party is bound by the fraud-Whether the inclusion of fictitious land in a deed of sale is a fraud in the law of registration-Whether the inclusion of a fictitious plot in the kabala invalidates the registration of the kabala.”<br/> <br/>Considering the aforesaid decision appellate Court found: “ উক্ত রুলিং এর সারমর্ম হইল কোন অলিক, অকিঞ্চিতকর বা আদৌ অবস্থিত নহে এইরুপ কোন সম্পত্তি কোন সাব-রেজিষ্ট্রারের এলাকা ভুক্ত দেখাইয়া কোন দলিল জালিয়াতি করিয়া রেজিঃ করিয়া লইলে সেইরুপ দলিলের বৈধতা সম্পর্কে সংশ্লিষ্ট পক্ষগণ আপত্তি তুলিতে পারিবে না, তবে ৩য় পক্ষ সংক্ষুব্ধ হইলে তঞ্চকির বিষয় উত্থাপন করিতে পারিবে। তর্কিত দলিলে শার্শা থানাধীন ৯৭৩ দাগের জমি কাল্পনিক জমি বলিয়া সাক্ষী সাবুদে প্রমানিত হইয়াছে। ফলে তর্কিত দলিলটি অবৈধ। বিজ্ঞ নিম্ন আদালত উভয়পক্ষের সাক্ষী সাবুদ বিচার বিবেচনা করিয়া সিদ্ধান্ত দিয়াছেন যে, ৩১-১২-৯০ ইং তারিখের ৩ নং বিবাদী দত্তা ১/২  নং বিবাদী গ্রহীতা ১০৬০৯ নং দলিলটি বেআইনী অবৈধ। বিজ্ঞ নিম্ন আদালতের উপরোক্ত সিদ্ধান্ত আইনত: হস্তক্ষেপ যোগ্য নয়।"<br/> <br/>It is further found that the plaintiff is a third party and being affected by the disputed deed of the defendant filed the suit. It has been mentioned that the disputed deed was registered at Sharsha Upa Zila but D.W.1 in his cross-examination stated that he has no knowledge about the aforesaid land and he is not possessing the same.<br/> <br/>For the reasons stated above and considering that the courts below concurrently decided the matter in favour of the plaintiff and found that according to Section 28 of the Registration Act kabala deed dated 31.12.1990 is illegal and void. I do not find any illegality in the impugned judgment and decree. Thus, the Rule fails.  <br/> <br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/>The judgment and decree dated 6.6.2001 passed by the Subordinate Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Jessore in Title Appeal No.32 of 1994 affirming those dated 29.11.1993 passed by Assistant Judge, Jessore, Sadar in Title Suit No.222 of 1991 is hereby upheld.<br/> <br/>Send down the lower court records along with a copy of this judgment at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Ruhul Quddus, J</u></strong>:</span><br/> <br/>This Rule, at the instance of the plaintiffs, was issued on an application under section 115 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure to examine the legality of order dated 7.7.1999 passed by the Assistant Judge, Shibpur, Narshingdhi in Title Suit No.3 of 1998 rejecting their application under Order XI rule 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure for a direction upon the defendants to produce certain documents. <br/> <br/>Facts relevant for disposal of the Rule are that the petitioners as plaintiffs instituted a suit for perpetual injunction against the Government and its officials in Narshingdi on the averments inter <em>alia</em>, that they (plaintiffs) are the lawful owners-in-possession of the suit land, which is their only homestead. The defendants initiated L. A. Case No.2/1996-97 for acquisition of the land without following the legal procedures and service of statutory notices. They (plaintiffs) had filed written objection to the Deputy Commissioner, but without disposing of their written objection, the officials attempted to evict them from the suit land by deploying police force on 25.1.1998 giving rise to the suit for perpetual injunction.<br/> <br/>The defendants were contesting the suit by filing two sets of written statement denying the material facts of the plaint contending inter <em>alia</em>, that the suit land had been acquisitioned as per provision of law and it became the property of Social Welfare Department. The Public Works Department already started construction of a Training and Rehabilitation Center thereon for socially retarded women. The notices under articles 3, 6 and 7 of the Acquisition and Requisition of the Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982 were duly served and some of the plaintiffs received the same.  Beside, the suit was not maintainable as being bared by law.<br/> <br/>On the aforesaid pleadings, the trial Court framed the issues and proceeded with trial. At one stage, the plaintiffs filed an application before the trial Court on 7.7.1999 under Order XI rule 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure for a direction upon the defendants to produce the documents namely certified copy of a revisional application filed in the High Court Division by the defendants and proof of deposition of compensation money by the requiring authority. The learned Assistant Judge heard the application and rejected the same by his order dated 7.7.1999. The plaintiffs moved in this Court challenging the said order, obtained the Rule and an order staying all further proceedings in the suit.<br/> <br/>Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners submits that the documents mentioned in the plaintiffs’ application are necessary for resolving the issues involved in the suit, but the learned Assistant Judge without assigning any reason, has rejected the plaintiffs’ application by a non-speaking order, which is no order in the eye of law. Therefore, the impugned order being bad in law is liable to be set aside and the application should be disposed of on merit to meet the ends of justice.<br/> <br/>On the other hand Mrs. Nowazish Ara Begum, the learned Assistant Attorney General appearing for the opposite parties submits that in view of article 42 of the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982 the suit itself is not maintainable. This is the settled principle of law that the plaintiffs are to prove their own case by adducing evidence oral and documentary, she argues. If the defendants fail to produce any documents in support of their case, they will face its legal consequence and the plaintiffs will get benefit from such nonproduction and therefore, they should not have any grievance, if the documents are not produced.<br/> <br/>I have perused the revisional applicat-ion, gone through the impugned order and considered the submissions of the learned Advocates for both the parties. It appears that the suit was at concluding stage and fixed for argument. The trial Court rejected the application to avoid the delay in disposal of the suit and passed its order on the reasons that there is no mention of any civil revision in the written statements, and that if the defendants do not produce any relevant document, their claim may not be accepted. Therefore, the said order cannot be termed as a non-speaking one.<br/> <br/>If the defendants do not produce documents in support of their case, they will face the legal consequence for withholding the documents, if those are relevant at all. But in a suit for perpetual injunction the moot question is whether the plaintiffs are in lawful possession over the suit land. In some cases the prima facie title can incidentally be looked into. In that view of the matter the documents, sought to be produced, are not relevant to decide the issue in the present suit for perpetual injunction.  <br/> <br/>For the reasons stated above, I do not find any illegality in the impugned order. Accordingly the Rule is discharged, however, without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/>Communicate a copy of this judgment at once.  <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The defendant No. 1 and 2 procured Income Tax Clearance Certificate on 24.12.1970 and the life of the said Income Tax Clearance Certificate was valid till 31.3.1971. ultimately the defendant No. 1 and 2 as plaintiffs instituted Other Suit No. 41 of 1974 in the Court of Sub-ordinate Judge, 1st court, Chittagong for Specific Performance of Contract impleading the present plaintiff as defendant and that suit was decreed on contest by the judgment and decree dated 30.11.1977. The present plaintiff respondent being aggrieved by the said judgment and decree preferred First Appeal No. 9 of 1978 and the appeal was dismissed by the judgment and decree dated 18.03.1984 (exhibit-‘kha’). Thereafter the present plaintiff preferred Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 274 of 1984 before the Appellate Division and that was dismissed by the judgment and order dated 28.02.1985 vide exhibit ‘Gha’. The Appellate Division directed the present appellant (defendant No. 1 and 2 of the instant suit) to make payment of a solatium of Taka 1, 00, 000/- within 30 days from the date of the order. As such the plaintiff of the instant suit was entitled to Taka 3, 97,000/-. It was the further case of the plaintiff that the defendant No. 4 entered into the suit land as a vharatia under the present plaintiff on the strength of an agreement dated 28.02.1997. At one stage the defendant No. 4 started depositing rent with the Rent Controller under section 19 of the premises Rent Controller Ordinance vide HRC case No. 224 of 1983 in favour of the plaintiff. The plaintiff withdrew Taka 1, 80,000/- from the Rent Controller. For want of Income Tax Clearance Certificate, the defendant No. 1 and 2 (present appellants) failed to get the kabala deed executed and registered through Court on the strength of the judgment and order passed by the Appellate Division. It was their further case that the present appellants started Execution Case No. 20 of 1985 for Execution of the judgment and decree dated 30.11.1977 passed in other class Suit No. 41 of 1974 (Exhibit-‘ka’) and the proceeding of that case was stayed. It was the further case of the plaintiff respondent that before getting a kobala deed executed and registered, through Court, the defendant No. 1 and 2 was added as parties in the HRC Case No. 224 of 1983 and beyond the notice of the plaintiff they withdrew Taka 36,0000/- from the said case, although the rent was being deposited by the defendant No. 4 in the name of the plaintiff. The defendant No. 1 and 2 (appellants) were not entitled to withdraw that amount before getting the kobala deed executed and registered. It was the further case of the plaintiff that the defendant No. 1 and 2 failed to deposit soletium within the time limit as granted by the Appellate Division and as such they were not entitled to get any deed executed and registered through Court and the decree became infructious. The plaintiff submitted an application on 29.4.1986 for getting back the rent from the defendant No. 1 and 2 and that was objected by the defendants. It was the plaintiffs case that for the cause of failure of depositing taka 3, 97,000/- as per order of the Supreme Court and for the cause of withdrawal of Taka 36,0000/- from the HRC case No. 224 of 1983, the decree passed in the Other Class Suit No. 41 of 1974 became infructious. As a result the plaintiff instituted the instant suit being Other Suit No. 100 of 1995 for the reliefs as mentioned above.<br/> <br/>The defendant No. 1 and 2 (present appellants) contested the suit by filing written statement contending inter alia that the suit was not maintainable in its present form and barred by waiver estoppel and acquiesce. It was their case that the predecessor of the plaintiff entered into a contract for sale of the suit land on 18.7.1970 at a consideration of Taka 3,33,000/- with the defendant No. 1 and 2`s vendor. The defendant No.1 and 2 subseque-ntly purchased the agreement as well as all assets of the 2nd party of the agreement and instituted the Other Suit No. 41 of 1974 for Specific Performance of Contract against the plaintiff. It was their case that the Income Tax clearance certificate was procured on 24.12.1970 which became ineffective as it was not possible for getting the kabala deed executed and registered within the life time of income tax clearance certificate due to liberation war. Thereafter the defendants requested the present plaintiff to execute and register a Kobala but ultimately that was not done and as such the Other Suit No. 41 of 1994 was instituted seeking for Specific Performance of Contract. That suit was decreed on 30.11.1977 on contest against which the present plaintiff respondent preferred First Appeal No. 9 of 1978. That appeal was dismissed on 13.12.1983. The present plaintiff respondent preferred Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 274 of 1984 and that was dismissed on 11.3.1985. Thereafter the present appellants started Execution Case No. 20 of 1985 for executing the decree. The defendant No. 1 and 2 depos-ited the balance consideration on 12.3.1984 vide Exhibit-‘Ga’ within 90 days of the judgment and decree and also deposited Taka 1, 00, 000/- towards soletium on 9.4.1984 vide Bank Draft No. 1719594 dated 9.4.1985 with the Pubali Bank, Mahendigonj Branch, Chittagong. It was the further case of the defendant appellant that the plaintiff respondent has admitted the fact of receiving payment on 09.04.1985 by filing a receipt. It was the further case of the defendant appellants that after passing the judgment and decree by the Supreme Court (Appellate Division) the plaintiff was ceased to retain any interest in the suit property and as such the defendant No. 1 and 2 were added as party in HRC case No. 224 of 1983. It was their further case that the plaintiff has filed the instant suit only to deprive of the defendants from enjoying the fruit of the decree passed in other suit no 41 of 70 and from executing the same vide Execution Case No. 20 of 1985. With these averments the appellants prayed for dismissal of the suit.<br/> <br/>The learned Sub-ordinate Judge framed the following issue:-</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Is the suit maintainable in its present form?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Is the suit barred under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Whether the defendant No. 1 and 2 have legal title and possession in the property of Other Suit No. 41 of 1974?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Whether the defendant No. 1 and 2 had authority to withdrow money from HRC Case No. 224 of 1983?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Whether the plaintiff is entitled to get a decree as prayed for?</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Both the parties examined witness and their documents were admitted into evidence.<br/> <br/>The learned Sub-ordinate Judge by the impugned judgment and decree dated 02.11.1996 decreed the suit on contest holding that the defendant No. 1 and 2 (appellants) are not entitled to get any kabala deed executed and registered through Court vide Execution Case No. 20 of 1985.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the said judgment and decree the defendant No. 1 and 2 have preferred this appeal.<br/> <br/>Mr. Fazlul Karim with Mr. Md. Omar Faruk, the learned Advocates entered appearance for the appellant. No one appeared for the respondent.<br/> <br/>Mr.Omar Foruq submitted that the suit itself is not maintainable in its present form. He further submitted that by filing the instant suit, the plaintiff has virtually sought for a declaration for making the force of the Appellate Division’s judgment inoperative. He further submitted that the suit is barred under Article 111 of the constitution of the peoples Republic of Bangladesh. He further submitted that the earlier suit was for Specific Performance of Contract being No. 41 of 1974, was decreed on contest and that decree was made up held up to the Appellate Division and there after the Execution Case No. 20 of 1985 was started within limitation, which is pending for disposel. He submitted that so long the judgment and decree of the Appellate Division stands, the suit itself was not maintainable as being barred by resjudicata in as much as the material issues of Other Suit No. 41 of 1974 were directly and substantially in issues of the instant suit but the learned subordinate judge erroneously framed other issue just to take away the sight of others from the issues framed in the earlier suit. With these averments he prayed for setting aside of the impugned judgment and decree.<br/> <br/>Upon considering the case of both the parties as made out in their respective pleadings we need to frame the following issues for determining the matter in controversy between the parties:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align:justify">Whether the defendant decree holders have waieved their right to proceed on with the other execution case No. 20 of 1985 pending before the sub-ordinate judge 1st court Chittagong for the cause of withdrawal of taka 3,60,000.00 from the account of H.R.C case No. 224 of 1983 of the House Rent controller and Assistant Judge,. 1st court Chittagong?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Whether the proceeding of other execution case No. 20 of 1985 pending before the sub-ordinate Judge 1<sup>st</sup> Court Chittagong has become infructuos and in executable?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Whether there caused any delay in filing the execution case No. 20 of 1985 resulting the force of the judgment and decree passed in other suit No. 41 of 1974 frustrated or in infructuos?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Whether the decree holders have lost their right to execute the decree passed in other suit No. 41 of 1974 of the subordinate judge 1st court, Chittagong?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Whether there caused any delay in depositing soletium of taka 100000.00 as per the direction of the Appellate Division of the supreme court of Bangladesh resulting the decree passed in other suit No. 41 of 1974 infructuos and inexecutable.</li><li style="text-align:justify">What amount is payable by the decree holder towards income tax for getting the kobala deed executed and registered?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Whether the impugned Judgment and decree are sustainable in law?</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Let us take up issue No. i, ii, iii and iv together for consideration and decision:-<br/>The plaintiff respondent has examined only one witness to prove his claim. We have gone through the evidence of PW1. It is to be noted here that the instant suit being No. 100 of 1995 is the second round legal battle between the parties to the suit upon the same subject matter. The 1st round battle was started in 1974. The background of that battle was that the present plaintiff respondent entered into a contract for sale of the suit land in favour of M/S Imperial commercial Industries Ltd and accordingly an agreement for sale was executed and registered on 17.08.1970. M/S Imperial commercial Industries Ltd. Sold out its entire assets to the defendant No.1 and 2 of the instant suit (appellants) and they stepped into the shoes of M/S Imperial commercial Industries. From the evidence of PW1 we find that those facts have been admitted by the PW1. The PW1 has also admitted in his examination in chief that the defendant appellants instituted other suit No. 41 of 1974 for specific performance of contract on the strength of the registered agreement dated 17.8.1970 (exhibit 3) and that suit was decreed on 30.1.77 on contest. From exhibit 3 it shows that total consideration was fixed at taka 3,30,000.00. The judgment and decree dated 30.1.77 has been marked as exhibit 4 series. The PW1 further admitted in his examination in chief that the present plaintiff respondent preferred F.A. No. 9 of 1978 before this court as against the judgment and decree dated 30.1.77 and that appeal was dismissed on contest by the judgment and decree dated 18.3.1984. Thereafter the plaintiff respondent preferred civil petition for leave to Appeal No. 274 of 1984 and that was dismissed by the judgment and order dated 28.2.1985. The Appellate Division directed the decree holder to pay Soletium of taka 100000.00 to the judgment debtor within 30 days from 28.2.1985. From the record it shows that the balance consideration of taka 2,97000.00 was paid on 12.3.1984 by treasury challan vide exhibit ‘Ga’ which was within 90 days of passing of the High Court`s Judgment. The soletium of taka 100000.00 (one lac) was paid by Bank Draft No. 1716594/85 dated 9.4.1985 vide exhibit “umo” which was within 40 days of the Appellate Division`s judgment dated 28.2.1985.<br/> <br/>It further appears from the record that there is a two storied building upon the suit land. The defendant No. 4 was inducted into the said building by the plaintiff respondent (judgment debtor) as tenant who started depositing rent with the House Rent controller vide H.R.C case No. 224 of 1983. It further appears that after disposal of the leave petition No. 274 of 1984 and after paying soletium of taka 100000.00 (one lac) the present appellants (decree holder of earlier suit) submitted on application on 16.4.1986 in the H.R.C case No. 224 of 1883 for adding them as parties in the said case and transposing them in place of the plaintiff respondent and that application was allowed. Admittedly the House Rent Controller allowed the appellants (decree holder) to withdraw taka 3,60000/= (Three lacs and sixty thousand) only from the said H.R.C case. The PW1 admitted in his evidence that, to execute the decree, passed in other suit No. 41 of 1974, the decree holders have started execution case No.20 of 1985 before the sub-ordinate judge, 1st court Chittagong. That case is still pending as all further proceeding of the case was stayed by order No 2 dated 8.7.1995 by the sub-ordinate judge, 1st court Chittagong on the instant suit No. 100 of 1995. That execution case has been submitted on 19.11.1985, within 9 months of the Appellate Division judgment and order dated 28.2.1985. The withdrawal of taka 3, 60000.00 from the H.R.C case No. 224 of 1983 has got no bearing upon the proceeding of execution case No. 20 of 1985. The concern House Rent controller has allowed the appellants (decree holder) to withdraw money being satisfied that the entire consideration money of the suit land and the soletium was paid in full. From the record it appears that by order No. 37 dated 16.8.86 the defendant appellants were transposed in place of the plaintiff respondent in H.R.C case No. 224 of 1983. That prayer for transposition was not opposed by the plaintiff respondent. From the record it further appears that the House Rent controller allowed the defendant appellants to withdraw rent vide order dated 5.8.1986, 5.1.1987, 6.12.1987, 3.12.1988 and 21.5.1991. By those order the rent of two storied building, amounting to taka 3,60,000/=three lac sixty thousand) only was withdrawn from the account of H.R.C case No. 224 of 1983. It is true that the execution case is still pending and the kobala deed has not been registered as yet but the agreement dated 17.8.1970 was a registered agreement for sale. The contractual amount has been paid by the decree holder. From exhibit ‘Ta’ it shows that the judgment debtor submitted an application on 14.5.1986 before the executing court expressing willingness to execute and register kobala deed in favour of the defendant appellant. It further shows from the record of execution case No. 20 of 1985 that the said court directed the decree holder to put in stamp papers for writing a kobala deed and stamp papers were duly supplied on 18.1.1992. The kobala was written and executed by the executing court on 22.2.1992 which is evident from exhibit ‘Tha’. The said court presented the kobala before the concern sub-Register for registration. The sub-register assessed tax, towards transfer, amounting to taka 25, 15,625.00 and for want of paying that amount the kobala deed has not been registered as yet. In the meantime the further proceeding of the execution case was stayed by order dated 18.7.1995 by the sub-ordinate judge, Chittagong in other suit No. 100 of 1995. From the facts and circumstances as discussed above we are of the view that the plaintiff respondent has been ceased to retain any right title and interest in the suit land. As soon as the consideration money and the soletium have been paid, the judgment debtor (plaintiff respondent ) has been ceased to claim any title in the suit land. In a suit for specific performance of contract the plaintiff is required to prove existence of a valid contract, due execution of agreement by the sellor and payment of earnest money or entire consideration money. In the earlier suit those requirements have been proved and the judgment and decree passed by the trial court allowing specific performance of contract has been affirmed by the appellant Division. Now the executing court is bound to execute the decree as it stands. In the meantime the executing court has executed the kobala deed. In view of the above facts and circumstances the question of waiver of in executing the decree does not stand for the cause of withdrawal of taka 3,60000/= from the account of H.R.C case No. 224 of 1983. The proceeding of execution case No. 20 of 1985 has not become infructuous in as much as there is no bearing of H.R.C case No. 224 of 1983 upon the proceeding of other execution case No. 20 of 1985 of the court of sub-ordinate judge, 1st court, Chittagong. The H.R.C case has been filed by tenant under section 19 of the Premises Rent control ordinance for depositing monthly rent-but the other execution case No. 20 of 1983 has been filed for execution of the decree passed in other suit No. 41 of 1974 of the sub-ordinate judge, 1st court, Chittagong. The said execution case was filed only within 9 months of disposal of the suit finally. Under Article 182 of the limitation Act the period of limitation for starting execution case is 3 years and as such there caused no delay in submitting the execution case. And as such, the question of frustration of the force of the decree passed in title suit No. 4 of 1974 does not arise. Accordingly the issue No. i, ii, iii, and iv are decided negatively against the plaintiff respondent. The execution case being a pending proceeding and having been started within the period of limitation, we have no hesitation but to hold that the decree holders have every right to execute the decree and the said decree is executable as it stands.<br/> <br/>Let us taka up issue No. v as to whether the execution case No. 20 of 1985 has become inexecutable on account of failure of depositing soletium of taka 100000.00 within 30 days, as per direction of the Appellate Division? We have gone through the judgment and order dated 28.2.1985 passed by the Appellate Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 274 of 1994. By the said judgment the appellant decree holders (defendant No. 1 and 2 of other suit No. 41 of 1974) were directed to pay a soletium of taka 100000.00 to the judgment debtor within 30 days. There was no default clause in the said judgment. In the case of wali reported in 19 DLR (Sc)- 143 it has been held that the direction for doing anything without a default clause is directory. In the instant case the soletium of taka 100000.00 (one lac) was deposited vide exhibit “uma” within 40 days. Since there was no default clause the deposit of soletium beyond 30 days was a lawful compliance of the direction given by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. Accordingly the execution case No. 20 of 1985 is very much executable. Accor-dingly we decide the issue No. v negatively against the plaintiff respondent.<br/> <br/>Let us taka up issue No. vi for decision:-<br/>        The agreement for sale of the suit land was executed on 17.8.1970 for transfer of the suit land at a consideration of Taka 333,000/-. To compel the defendant of other class suit No. 41 of 1974 for executing and registering a kobala deed, the present appellants, as plaintiffs instituted the said suit for specific performance of contract, that suit was instituted in 1974. The Suit was decreed on 30.11.1977. The present respondent fought upto the Appellate Division by filing C. P. L. A. No. 274 of 1984 and got defeated on 13.3.1985. The execution proceeding, was stayed by order dated 18.4.1995 by the sub-ordinate Judge, 3rd Court Chittagong in Other Suit No. 100 of 1995. It is the settled law that the plaintiffs position shall be taken into account, which was, on the date of institution of the suit and the subsequent event shall not change or affect the position of the plaintiff. That principle has been settled upon the question of payment of advalorem Court fees. In that case the plaintiff was in possession in the suit land on the date of filing of the suit but thereafter was dispossessed. This court decided that the plaintiff need not pay advalorem Court fees as he was in possession on the date of institution of the suit. That decision has been reported in 28 DLR(HD) page 392. The said case law is squirely applicable in the instant case on the question of paying income tax towards registration of deed in Execution Case No. 20 of 1985. It is true that, the valuation of the property as was in 1970 has been increased, hundred times greater, than that, of 1970 but appeal is the continuation of the original suit. After deciding a Suit for Specific Performance of Contract, the judgment debtor can not claim more money towards consideration. Litigation may continue for 100 years but taking advantage of prolongation of litigation as well as increasing of valuation of the suit land, the income tax authority can not claim more money towards income tax clearance certificate beyond the tax payable upon the contractual amount. Had the kabala deed been executed normally in 1970 the income tax authority would have realized tax upon taka 3, 33000/-. Since appeal is the continuation of suit, the income tax ought to the have been assessed upon taka 3, 33000/- which was the actual price of the suit land. The soletium of 1, 00, 000/- is not the price of the land. Soletium means a sum to be paid to a person as compensation or continuation for injured feelings. So, far the question of collecting income tax clearance certificate is concerned for registration of kabala in other execution Case No. 20 of 1985, the income tax is required to be paid upon taka 3,33000.00. The income tax authority is estopped from collecting more money beyond the tax payable upon taka 3,33000/-<br/> <br/>Now let us take up issue No. vii for decision as to whether the impugned judgment and decree are sustainable in law? Upon perusal of the plaint of the other suit No. 100 of 1995 it appears to us that, the matter in issue of the earlier suit No. 41of 1974 and the matter in issues in the instant suit are common but in different form. This is the 2nd round legal fight upon the self same subject matter and upon common issues which have already been decided finally. The learned joint District judge, framed some irrelevant issues. The subject matter of the suit has already been decided by the Appellate Division. The instant suit is barred by resjudicata out and out and the plaint is liable to be rejected. Accordingly we find merit in the appeal. The impugned judgment and decree are not sustainable in law. The appeal is liable to be allowed with a cost of taka 1,00, 000/- lac in view of the fact that after deciding the matter up to the Appellant Division of the supreme court of Bangladesh, the plaintiff has instituted the instant suit only with an unholy intention to deprive of the decree holder from enjoying the fruit of the decree and for enjoying the rent deposited with the Rent controller for the suit land. The plaint of Title Suit No. 100 of 1995 is hereby rejected under section 151 of the code of Civil Procedure. It is to be recorded here that there was no latches on the part of the decree holder for taking steps towards executing the decree. The impediment took place for the cause of assessing excessive income tax for registration of the document. The said assessment was made upon the existing market value of the property as was in 1985 and that was not legal as per law.<br/> <br/>We further need to record a note that the instant suit is a vexatiows suit, instituted to deprive of the defendants decree holder from enjoyment of the fruit of the decree. In the meantime 16 years have passed under the coverage of the instant vexatious litigation. In view of the above and in applying our power conferred under section 35 A of the code of civil procedure, we award a cost at taka 1, 00, 000/- (one lac) against the plaintiff respondent. They are directed to deposit the said amount in the credit of the appellants within 60 days from date, failing which the appellants shall be able to realise the said cost by executing the order of this Court under section 36 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/>From the facts and circumstances and the discussions as made above we find merit in the appeal.<br/> <br/>In the result the appeal is allowed with costs Taka 1, 00, 000/- (one lac). The impugned judgment and decree dated 02.11.1996 passed by the learned Sub-ordinate Judge, Court, 3rd Court, Chittagong in Other Suit No. 100 of 1995 are set aside. The order of stay of execution of other execution case No. 20 of 1985 stands vacated. The executing court is directed to execute the decree as it stands within one month including handing over possession in the suit land in favour of appellants through court.<br/> <br/>The office is directed to send down the lower Court’s record at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Her name was duly registered in the register book. As per the existing law her share holdership is still existing. The valuation of each share was at the rate of Taka 100.00 only. The share certificate number of plaintiff is 02401 and share numbers being 512992- 543338. Those shares have been deposited with the defendant No.1, namely Pubali Bank Ltd., Head Office, 26 Dilkusha Commercial Area, Motijheel, Dhaka.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff made a number of request to the defendant Nos.1-4 to hand over her share to her but with no result. She came to know by the by on 21.5.1990 that, the defendants in collusion with each other were trying to transfer her shares in favour of Muniruddin, Ataur Rahman, Altaf Hossain by forging her signature and further came to know that Md. Sarkune Ali, Director of defendant Bank had deposited the share certificate to the Bank. The plaintiff, thereafter, submitted an application on 21.5.1990 to the defendant No.2 for canceling the prayer for transfer of share.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff further prayed on 21.5.1990 for transferring shares in the names of her 5(five) sons and husband but the defendant kept those shares in their custody. The plaintiff without getting any reply of her prayer dated 21.5.1990 again submitted an application on 23.7.1990 to the defendant Nos.1-4 for transferring 21,347 share in favour of her husband and sons and for transferring 6000 share in favour of defendant No.6. She signed the share-transfer form but the defendants had neither taken any steps nor replied to the said prayer.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff again on 31.7.1990 submitted another application to the defendant to give effect to the application dated 23.7.1990. By the said letter she requested to the defendants not to transfer any share to anybody else but with no result.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Thereafter the plaintiff requested the defendant No.4 on 04.9.1990 to supply her the copy of extract of the register of Members. Upon receiving the said letter of request the defendant No.4 on 13.9.1990 supplied to the plaintiff the copy of extract of the register of Members, wherefrom the plaintiff came to learn that she was shown as a share holder since 11.12.1985.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Despite of repeated requests the defendant Nos.1-4 did not hand over share certificate to the plaint-iff. On 09.4.1991 the defend-ant No.4 informed the plaintiff that upon receiving number of letters from the plaintiff they reached to a bewildered position and further informed her that the share certificate had been given to the custody of Bank's Director Sarku-me Ali, the defendant No.6. The defendant No.4 requested the plaintiff to make a compromise about the dispute with the defendant No.6. Upon receiving the said letter the plaintiff on 25.4.1991, by submitting a letter of request to the Board of Directors of Pubali Bank Ltd. asserted that it was the duty of the defendant Nos.1-4 to hand over share certificate to the plaintiff. By another letter dated 05.4.1994 she disclosed that, to pay loan of Hotel Zakaria she need to transfer her share and she prayed for getting back her share. She further requested to let her know as to whether those shares were given lien against any loan but no reply was made to those letters.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff came to know on 03.7.1994 that the defendant Nos.1-4 in collusion with each other were trying to transfer the shares of plaintiff in favour of Moazzem Hossain. Thereafter on 05.7.1994 she wrote a letter to the defendants not to transfer her share in favour of anybody else. She further informed that she did neither transfer any share nor put any signature for transferring her share and further asserted that if any share was found to be transferred that was done by forging her signature. Despite of repeated request for getting back her shares there held no enquiry against those persons who were involved with the process of forgery. The plaintiff was not given back her shares. As per the letter dated 09.4.1991 the defendant No.4 made several communication with Md. Sircum Ali but did not get back her shares. It was informed to her that the shares were kept with the defendant No.4. Thereafter the plaintiff requested Sircum Ali to take necessary steps for returning back her share and Sircum Ali informed the defendant No.2 on 20.11.1995, by a letter that, the shares of the plaintiff were kept with defendant No.4. He further informed that if the shares were returned back to plaintiff he had no objection. The defendant Nos.1-4 did not take any effective step for returning back the shares of the plaintiff to her. Thereafter the plaintiff issued a legal notice upon the defendants on 31.3.1996 through Mr. Aminul Hoque, a learned advocate for getting back her shares but with no result. Thereafter the plaintiff informed everyth-ing to the proforma defendant No.5, who requested the defendant No.3 to hand over shares to the plaintiff. The defendant No.4 by letter dated 09.4.1991 informed that he got those shares from Sircum Ali and thereafter returned back those shares to said Sarqum Ali but Sirqum Ali by letter dated 20.11.1995 informed that those shares were mortgaged with the defendant No.4. The defendant No.6 on 20.11.1995 wrote a letter to the defendant No.2 and informed him that he would not have any objection if those shares were returned to the plaintiff. On the other hand Moazzem Hossain, applied on 03.7.1994 for transfer-ring those shares in his name. The defendants although gave divident twice to the plaintiff but failed to return back the shares to plaintiff or to her husband or sons.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The defendant No.7 taking resort to forgery had allegedly purchased 30347 shares but upon receiving the letter of the plaintiff dated 05.7.1994 the defendant Nos.1-4 could not transfer those share in favour of defendant No.7. Those 30347 shares have been remaining in the name of the plaintiff in the register of share. The defendant Nos.1-4 might have transferred those shares in favour of defendant No.7 beyond the knowledge of the plaintiff and the defendant No.7 might have procured transfer certificate for getting the share sale certificate issued in the name of plaintiff. The defendant No.7 with a view to get those shares transferred in his name submitted an application on 03.7.1998 along with forged transfer certificate before the defendant No.1 and those certificates were lying with the custody of defendant Bank.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The defendant Bank gave divident to the plaintiff for the financial year 1986-87, 1987-1988 an amount of Taka 1,82,082.00. The plaintiff was given 7585 bonus share on 20.12.2001 bearing certificate No. 18909.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The defendant No.1 on receipt of the plaintiff's letter dated 05.7.1998 refused to issue share certificate in favour of defe-ndant No.7 and those were kept in custody of the defendant Nos.1-4 till date. The defendant No.7 was not entitled to have share certificate in his name.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff submitted an application under section 158 of the Company's Act before the High Court Division and that was registered as being Matter No.3 of 1997. The case was withdrawn on 02.6.1999 with a view to submit a suit before appropriate court and accordingly she instituted the suit.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The defendant No.1 submitted a written statement contending inter alia, that the suit is not maintainable, barred by the principles of estoppel, acquiescence, waiver, bad for insufficient of Court fees. The real fact of the written statement were as under:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align:justify">That the plaintiff, Tahsia Khanam in 1985 bought 30,347 shares of Pubali Bank Ltd. by way of transfer from M/S. M.M. Ispahani Limited. This transfer of shares was duly approved by the Directors of the Bank and a share certi-ficate bearing No.02401 was issued by the Bank and received by the plaintiff on 18.12.1985. The bank sent dividents for the years 1986-1988 to the plaintiff at her address as given and recorded in the Register of Shares.</li><li style="text-align:justify">That the current ownership of the shares, however is uncertain due to the existence of various applications submitted to the Bank for the transfer of the shares, purportedly under the signature of the plaintiff herself.</li><li style="text-align:justify">That on 14.5.1990 Md. Sarqum Ali, Director of the defendant bank submit-tted the original share certificate along with three instruments of transfer, con-taining the signature of the plaintiff, to the bank. After verification of the signature of the plaintiff, the bank cancelled the original share certificate as requested and split the same into three scripts. Before the memo of the transfer could be placed at the Board Meeting for approval, defendant bank received two letters dated 21.5.1990 from the plaintiff. In one of the letters the plaintiff informed the bank that the three instruments of transfer should be cancelled. And in the other letter the plaintiff instructed the bank to transfer 21,347 shares to six different persons namely Md. Zakir Hossain Miah, Md. Zahir Hossain Miah, Md. Jahangir Hossain Miah, Md. Akbar Hossain Miah, Md. Ali Hossain Miah and Md. Altaf Hossain Ashu Miah and to retain the balance of 9000 shares in her own name. The plaintiff also forwarded six instruments of transfer duly signed by her as the transferor with the signature of the respective transferees.</li><li style="text-align:justify">That Md. Sarqum Ali by his letter dated 26.5.1990 informed the bank that there has been a change in the decision to transfer the shares in favour of the spouse of the plaintiff, Altaf Hossain Ashu Miah, Moniruddin and Ataur Rahman as proposed earlier. The defendant bank accordingly returned the share certificate and the three instruments of transfer to Md. Sarqum Ali submitted by him as well as the six instruments of transfer submitted by the plaintiff.</li><li style="text-align:justify">That the plaintiff thereafter by her letter dated 23.7.1990 requested the Bank to transfer the shares to her husband, her five sons and Md. Sarqum Ali canceling her earlier application of 21.5.1990. This request was reiterated by the plaintiff by her letter dated 31.7.1990.</li><li style="text-align:justify">That the plaintiff by her letter dated 04.9.1990 requested the bank to supply her with an extract of the share register relating to the aforesaid shares and accordingly on 13.9.1990 the same was supplied to the plaintiff under cover of a registered letter.</li><li style="text-align:justify">That upon receipt of the extract of the share register as requested, the plaintiff informed the bank for the first time by her letter dated 17.9.1990 that she had never received the share certificate nor had she mortgaged her shares or made any lien against the said shares. The plaintiff further requested the defendant bank to forward the share script or to issue a fresh/ duplicate script.</li><li style="text-align:justify">That in the above circumstances, the defendant bank by its letter dated 09.4.1991 informed the plaintiff that it was unable to register any transfer of shares and requested the plaintiff to take up the matter for settlement with Md. Sarqum Ali.</li><li style="text-align:justify">That on 04.5.1994 the plaintiff reques-ted the bank to settle the outstanding issues. The plaintiff also asked the bank for confirmation whether a lien had been created against the said shares for adjustment of loan liabilities of Altaf Hossain Ashu Miah, husband of the plaintiff, in respect of loan facilities availed by him from Pubali Bank.</li><li style="text-align:justify">That on 03.7.1994 Syed Moazzem Hossain submitted the share certificate along with an instrument of transfer duly signed by the plaintiff as transferor and himself, as transferee. But only after two days of submission of the transfer instrument by the plaintiff, she denied the said transfer and alleged that the signature on the said instrument submitted to the bank had been forged. But so far the defendant bank knew that the plaintiff did not take any step for such forgery.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">That in the facts and circumstances of the case, as stated above, Pubali Bank Ltd. fulfilled its obligations and its officers acted bonafide and within authority in accordance with the provisions of Article 34 of the Articles of Association of Pubali Bank Limited in refusing to comply with the inconsistent and confusing instructions made by the plaintiff.<br/><br/>That it is stated that the plaintiff on 05.11.1997 filed an application under section 158 of the Companies Act, 1994 to the Hon'ble High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh which was registered as Company matter No.3 of 1997 but afterwards did not press the matter. The plaintiff in order to harass the defendants filed the said application in the wrong forum with no cause of action. From the actions and conduct of the plaintiff it is abundantly clear that she, with a malafide intention filed the present suit to harass the defendants and cause damage to the goodwill of the bank.<br/> <br/>The defendant No. 7 submitted a written statement contending inter alia, that the suit was not maintainable for want of cause of action; that the suit was barred by limitation; that the suit was barred under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act and barred by waiver, estoppel and acquiescence. The suit was barred by resjudicata. The statements made in the plaint are false, collusive and purposely made. The suit is a test suit and liable to be dismissed. The real facts were as under:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align:justify">Defendant No.1 transferred 30347 shares in favour of M.M. Ispahani Ltd. Thereafter Md. Altaf Hossain (Ashu Mia), the husband of the plaintiff purchased those shares in the name of his wife, Tahsia Khanam bearing Share Certificate No.02401. In the Board meeting of defendant No.1 the share index of the plaintiff was registered as 148 and new share certificate was issued in the name of the plaintiff. One of the Directors named Sharkum Ali and the plaintiff's husband were friends.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff's husband was in need of money for his business and requested Sirkum Ali to purchase/mortgage/lien of the shares and to provide him necessary fund as loan and accordingly took signature of the plaintiff upon the instrument of transfer of share in presence of witness. The plaintiff's husband and Sarqum Ali jointly placed the said signatures to the concerned officer of the bank to get verified the signature of the plaintiff's with the signature lying with the share department (the signature as contained with the signature taken in form 117) and the concerned officer verified and found the signature of the plaintiff to be identical. Thereafter the officer gave seal and signature upon form 117. At the time of taking signature of the plaintiff upon form 117 for transfer of 30347 shares the name of purchaser was not written as it was not known as to who would be the purchaser. The plaintiff's husband and Sarqum Ali failed to sell or mortgage shares and ultimately requested the defendant No.7 to purchase the shares. The defendant No.7 having had a discussion with the plaintiff and being requested by the plaintiff, the defendant No.7 paid the entire money of those shares. At the time of payment of such money it was agreed upon that the plaintiff and her husband if failed to repay the money back to the defendant No.7, Sarqum Ali would take signature of the plaintiff upon form No.117 (share certificate) and would sale the share elsewhere.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff or her husband failed to pay money to defendant No.7 or Sircum Ali on repeated request. Thereafter Sircum Ali took signature of the plaintiff upon form No.117 and transferred 30347 shares in favour of the defendant No.7, Moazzem Ali. Before said purchase, Moazzem Ali personally went to the plaintiff's house and had a discussion with her and her husband. They expressed that they had no objection to sale the shares and accordingly the defendant No.7 purchased those shares for valuable consider-ation. Sircum Ali obtained signature of plaintiff upon form No.117. Thereafter the defendant No.7 on 03.7.1994 submitted form No.117 and share certificate before the bank for transfer-rring the share certificate in his name. The defendant did not forge the signature of the plaintiff upon form 117 of the share certificate. The signature of plaintiff as contained in form 117 were found identical with her admitted signature preserved with the bank. Moreover the plaintiff had not file any case of forgery as against the transfer of shares is concerned and the signature taken in form 117. She did not lodge any G.D. with the police station about forging her signature in form 117.</li><li style="text-align:justify">After receiving application from the defendant No.7 the Bank's Board of Directors scheduled a date for holding meeting upon transfer of those shares and at that stage the plaintiff with a view to be benefited illegally submitted an application on 05.7.1994 before the defendant No.1 raising objection. The Board of Directors decided to take final decision after taking opinion from legal advisor, Dr. Kamal Hossain and Associates. Dr. Kamal Hossain and Associate on 27.9.1994 opined for approval of transfer of shares in the name of the defendant No.7. Mr. Khan Saifur Rahman, learned advocate of bank by his opinion dated 26.9.1994 opined for approval of the transfer of share in favour of the defendant No.7 and requested the bank to do the needful for transferring share certificate in favour of the defendant No.7. The suit having filed after 5 years of said transfer is barred by limitation.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The plaintiff after getting defeated in the High Court Division in a proceeding under section 158 of the Company Act got no locus standi to file the instant suit. The defendant No.7 has purchased 30347 shares from the plaintiff paying due consideration and as such the suit is liable to be dismissed. The plaintiff has not made any prayer for cancellation of share, purchased by the defendant No.7. With these averments the defendant prayed for dismissal of the suit.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The learned Joint District Judge framed the following issues:-</strong></div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align:justify">Is the suit maintainable in its present form?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Is the suit barred by limitation?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Is the plaintiff entitled to get a decree as prayed for?</li><li style="text-align:justify">What more relief the plaintiff is entitled to get?</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The husband of the plaintiff named Altaf Hossain was examined as the sole witness for the plaintiff and the following documents were admitted into evidence:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align:justify">Dividend notice dated 29.6.1989 signed by the Secretary of the defendant No.1 giving 10% divident for the year 1988 was marked as exhibit-1.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Dividend granted at the rate of 6% per each share for the year 1986 was marked as exhibit-2.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Dividend notice granted for the year 1986 and issued on 25.9.1989 was marked as exhibit-2(Ka).</li><li style="text-align:justify">An application dated 04.8.1990 submitted by the plaintiff before the Chairman, Pubali Bank Ltd.

Taking us through the plaint's statement and prayer portion of the plaint he submitted that the trial court has granted a gratuitous relief to the plaintiff, beyond the pleadings. He submitted that the suit is barred under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act. Referring to the case law reported in 60 DLR (AD) 90 and 54 DLR (AD) 7 he submitted that against alleged creation of forged document of transfer of share, the suit for simple declaration of title without a prayer for declaration that the signature of the plaintiff, taken in share certificate to be forged, the suit is not maintainable.</li><li style="text-align:justify">2ndly he submitted that the suit is barred by limitation. In elaborating his submission he took us through paragraph No.12 of the plaint and submitted that the shares are not in the hands of the plaintiff. She made her last claim on 20.11.1995 and instituted the suit on 26.8.1999 and as such the suit is barred by limitation. Referring to exhibit 3(Kha) and 3(Gha) he submitted that the plaintiff prayed for issuing certificate of shares to her on 27.8.1990 but that was refused vide exhibit- 3(Gha) dated 13.9.1990 and as such the suit was barred by limitation.</li><li style="text-align:justify">3rdly he submitted that as per section 38 of the Company's Act the transfer of share occurs in the following manner:-	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li>There must be an instrument of transfer of share.</li><li>That instrument be executed by both the transferor and transferee.</li><li>Thereafter the transfer must be stamped.

He submitted that when the process of entering the name of the defendant No.7 into the register was on process and at that stage the plaintiffs on 05.7.1994 submitted a prayer to the defendant No.1 for abstaining from transferring share although after receiving money against shares she had no authority to raise any objection. He submitted that after receiving consideration money against shares the plaintiff has been ceased to have any right in the subject matter of share. He submitted that for the cause of plaintiff's objection dated 05.7.1994 the name of defendant could not be entered into the register but that will not disentitle the defendant from claiming ownership in the share. He submitted that the trial court without discussing and considering material evidence on record has decreed the suit illegally. He prayed for setting aside of the impugned judgment and decree and dismissal of the suit.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Dr. M. Zahir, the learned advocate appearing for the respondent No.1 on the other hand, formulated the following points of arguments in reply to the submissions made by Mr. Ahsanul Karim, the learned advocate for the appellant:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align:justify">Initially the suit was filed paying fixed court fees but the plaint was amended and ad valorem Court fees was paid. In view of said amendment of plaint the suit has become maintainable and not barred under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Referring to section 31 of the Company's Act he submitted that the name of the plaintiff is still existing in the certificate of share and the said certificate is the prima facie evidence of the title of the plaintiff.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Referring to section 34 of the Company's Act he submitted that the name of the plaintiff is still in the book of register of Companies Member and as such the plaintiff is entitled to the relief as prayed for.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Thereafter he submitted that as per the plaintiff's prayer the defendant No.1 supplied to the plaintiff, the Index of Members of Company and the name of the plaintiff is very much in the said index and that has not been rectified in the name of defendant No.7 and as such the appeal is liable to be dismissed.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Referring to section 43 of the Company's Act he submitted that the defendant No.7 did not come forward before the court to get his name registered in the Share Register Book and as such he (defendant No.7) has no interest in the subject matter of the suit. It is absurd to believe that a person purchasing share in 1994 would not come before the court for registering his name in the share register book. With these submissions he prayed for dismissal of the appeal. Dr. M.

By amendment of plaint the only change has been made in the plaint seeking declaration of ownership of the plaintiff in the shares. Earlier the plaint was stamped at Taka 200.00. By amendment of plaint the plaintiff has paid ad valorem court fees upon the suit valuation.<br/> <br/>Section 2(v) of the Companies Act, 1994 defined share as under-<u> "Share" means a share in the capital of the company, and includes stock except when a distinction between stock and shares is expressed or implide.</u> So, share is a movable property of the company having market value. By the amended prayer of the plaint it has been made for recovery of possession of shares. The shares got its market value. As per the statements made in the plaint the valuation of each share is at Taka 100.00 only. Section 7 of the Court Fees Act provides the provision for paying ad valorem court fees as the "share" is a movable property having market value. Accordingly the court fees paid in the earlier plaint (before amendment) was insufficient and by way of amendment that has been cured by paying advalorem court fees.<br/> <br/>Mr. Ahsanul Karim, the learned advocate appearing for the defendant No.7- appellant submitted that the suit as stands framed is not maintainable without a prayer for consequential relief. Mr. Karim relied upon the case of Government of Bangladesh vs. Sheikh Hasina and another, reported in 60 DLR (AD) 90 and the case of Dudu Mia and others vs. Ekram Mia Chowdhury and others, reported in 54 DLR (AD) 7. Consequential relief means a substantial and immediate remedy in accorda-nce with the title which the court has been asked for declaration. In the case of Dudu Mia and others vs. Ekram Mia Chowdhury and others, it has been held that in a case where plaintiff is a party to a document or decree that has clouded his title to the property in suit, he has title to the property in suit, he is to seek declaration either way, that is that the document or decree is void or void-ab-initio or that for declaration as well as for cancellation.<br/> <br/>In the instant case the plaintiff has sought for simple declaration that the plaintiff may be declared as owner to 30347 shares stood in the name of the plaintiff and for an order that the defendant Nos.1-4 be directed to return back 30347 shares to the plaintiff. The only witness of plaintiff (P.W.1) in his examination in chief has substantiated the claim of plaintiff adducing only "আমরা বাদিনীর শেয়ার ফের‡তর জন্য মামলা ক‡রছি". During cross- examination the P.W.1 admitted the fact of transfer of all the shares by adducing the following evidence-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"২১/৫/৯০ আমার স্ত্রী শেয়ার হস্তান্তরের জন্য আবেদন করে।-----<u>সত্য ন</u><u>হে যে, মোয়াজ্জেম হোসেন বরাবর শেয়ার বৈধভাবে হস্তান্তর করা হয়। উক্ত হস্তান্তর জাল জালিয়াতি করে করা হয়।</u> অামরা কোন কিছুই জানি না মোয়াজ্জেমর বরাবর শেয়ার হস্তান্তরের বিষয়।----<u>ইহা সত্য নহে যে, বিবাদী মোয়াজ্জেম হোসেন আমাদের শেয়ারগুলি নিয়েছিল। শেয়ারগুলি পাওয়ার জন্য </u><u>মামলা করেছি। ----- মামলার পূর্বে</u><u> সার্টিফিকেট জাল করার কথা জানতে পারি। </u>-------১-৪নং বিবাদী ৩/৭/৯৪ ইং হতে ৭নং বিবাদীর শেয়ার হস্তান্তর করতে না পারে এবং জাল জালিয়াতি হস্তান্তর না করতে পারে তার জন্য দরখাস্ত দিয়েছিলাম।---মোয়াজ্জমের নামে হস্তান্তর করতে পারে সেই জন্যই দরখাস্ত করেছিলাম। ---- ইহা সত্য নহে যে, বাদী নাঃ শেয়ার ৭নং বিবাদীর বরাবরে হস্তান্তর করায় শেয়ারের মালিক ৭নং বিবাদী। ফোরজারী কেস, ৭নং বিবাদীর বিরুদ্ধে করি নাই। ---<u>৯৪ সনে বাদীদের শেয়ারগুলি ফোরজারী করে ৪নং বিবাদীর কাছে হস্তান্তর করেছে</u><u> তা ডাইরেক্টর হাবিবুর রহমানের মাধ্যমে জানলাম সৈয়দ মোয়া</u><u>জ্জম হোসেনে</u><u>র বরাবর হস্তান্তর প্রক্রিয়া</u><u> চলছে। ----৯৪ স</u><u>নে আমি শেয়ারগুলি অবৈধভা</u><u>বে হস্তান্তর করেছে</u><u> তা জানতে পারি।"</u> (underlining by us).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the above quotted admission of P.W.1 it is clear enough that the shares of the plaintiff has been transferred long before filing of the suit. Whether those were transferred in usual course of business or taking resort to forgery is the moot question and the suit ought have been framed seeking appropriate relief. The P.W.1 admitted that the process of transfer was made taking resort to forgery. At paragraph 10 of the plaint the plaintiff admitted the fact of transfer in favour of defendant No. 7 by making the following statements: “অপর দিকে ঐ শেয়ার সার্টিফিকেট সৈয়দ মোয়াজ্জম হোসেন তাহার নাম হস্তান্তরের জন্য ৩/৭/৯৪ ইং তারিখে জমা দান করিয়াছে মর্মে বিবাদীগন উল্লেখ করিয়াছেন কিন্তু বাদিনী বারবার ফেরত চাওয়া স্বত্তেও যদিও ইত্যবসরে পরস্পর দুইবার তাহাক সংশ্লিষ্ট শেয়ারের ডিভিডেন্ট প্রদান করা হইয়াছে কিন্তু তাহার নামের শেয়ার সার্টিফিকেট তাহাকে অসৎ উদ্দেশ্য বিবাদীগন অদ্যবধি ফেরত প্রদান করেন নাই।” This statement of plaint if read together with the admission of the Pw1 as quoted above it appears to us that the plaintiff being well aware of the fact of transfer of her shares have instituted the suit. If the transfer was made taking resort to forgery the instrument of transfer comes within the amibit of voidable transfer. In that case the plaintiff was required to file a suit for cancellation of the “Transfer of share instrument”. In the case of Chittaranjan Chokraborty V.S Md. Abdur Rab 49 DLR (A.D)-96 it has been held “ If the instrument is voidable then it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to have it cancelled or set-aside under section 39 of the Specific Relief Act. In the case of Rustom Ali Bhuiyan V.S Md. Taser Ali 10 MLR (A.D)- 85 it has been settled “The decree of a suit framed under section 39 of the specific Relif Act must contain indispensably a declaration as to the documents, whether it is void or voidable, and if the court finds it voidable, then only the further consequential relief by way of cancelled of the instrument would find its place in the decree. In the instant case the exhibit ‘x’ is the instrument of transfer of share certificate executed by both the plaintiff and defendant No. 7. The plaintiff did not deny the said exhibit ‘x’ in her plaint or in the deposition of Pw1. Since it is asserted by the Pw1, during examining him in court on oath that, the said document was procured taking resort to forgery, the suit ought to have been filed under section 39 of the specific Relief Act but not under section 42 of the said Act. Moreover the Pw1 in his examination in chief only prayed for “আমরা বাদিনীর শেয়ার ফেরতের মামলা করেছি” and abandoned the rest of the claim made in the plaint. In view of the above the legal positition is that the suit was not maintainable as it stood framed.<br/> <br/>Exhibit- X is the document of transfer of 30347 shares by the plaintiff in favour of defendant No.7. The exhibit 'X' contains the seal of the defendant Bank and executed by the plaintiff as well as by the defendant No.7. That transfer was made on 30.5.1994 as it appears from the said exhibit 'X'. That exhibit 'X' discloses transfer of 30347 shares being paid up number from 512992 - 543338 at Taka 3034700.00 only. That instrument was written by A. Quayum Khan of 35/A Lake Circus, Kolabagan, Dhaka 1205 and his signature was marked as exhibit- X(1). The signature of the plaintiff appearing in the 1st page of the plaint as well as in the Vokalatnama executed by the plaintiff in the instant appeal appear to be executed by the same person. We have compared the signature of the plaintiff contained in exhibit 'X' with the signature as contained in the plaint and vokalatnama. We found that all the signatures are identical. The P.W.1 although in his cross-examination had admitted the fact that the shares had been transferred in favour of the defendant No.7 taking resort to forgery but no such declaration has been sought for. At paragraph No.10 of the plaint it has been disclosed clearly and specifically that the shares have been transferred in favour of Moazzem Hossain but he was not made a defendant in the suit and no relief has been sought against Moazzem Hossain (defendant No.7). Even after adding the defendant No.7, the plaintiff failed to seek any remedy against said defendant No.7. Admittedly the plaintiff is not in possession of the shares. The case law as cited by Mr. Ahsanul Karim reported in 54 DLR (AD) 7 is squirely applicable in the instant case. In the instant case the suit is not maintainable without seeking any remedy as against exhibit 'X' to the effect that the said instrument was created taking resort to forgery. Upon a careful reading of the plaint it appears that the plaintiff, although has made out a case as against the defendant No.7 but ultimately failed to seek any remedy against the defendant No.7 (appellant). In the case of M/S Malik Huq vs. Md. Shamsul Islam Chowdhury, reported in 13 DLR (SC) 228 it has been held "Right to moneysuit lies for recovery of money. Declaration can not be granted. Along with declaration the plaintiff had to seek for further relief in the form of payment of money or shares. <u>Share means capital, means money. Since the fact of transfer is admitted, although pleaded forgery but since no relief has been sought for praying</u> for setting aside the exhibit 'X', the suit is not maintainable in its present form.<br/> <br/>Exhibit 'Tha' is a letter dated 05.7.1994 written by the plaintiff to the Secretary, Pubali Bank, contents whereof runs thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"The Secretary,<br/>Pubali Bank Limited,<br/>Board of Directors,<br/>Board Division,<br/>Head Office,<br/>Dhaka.<br/><br/>Sub-   Prayer for abstaining from transfer any share from share certificate No. 02401 consisting of 30,347 shares mentioned in index No. T-148 in your Bank.<br/><br/><strong>Dear sir,</strong><br/>It has come to my knowledge that an instrument of transfer of shares has been submitted recently to the Bank containing my signature with proposal for transfer of my shares.

The transfer of share was made vide exhibit 'X' on 30.5.1994 and the application exhibit 'Tha' was submitted by the plaintiff on 5.7.1994. By exhibit' Tha' it has been claimed that her signature, taken in the exhibit 'X', was forged signature. Thereafter the plaintiff instituted the suit. Unless a prayer is made to the effect that the signature, contained in exhibit 'X' is forged the suit is not maintainable. Considering the facts and circumstances, the evidence on record as well as the statements made in the plaint we are constrained to hold that the suit was not maintainable as it stood framed.<br/><br/><strong><u>Let us take up issue No.(v) as to whether the suit is barred by the doctrine of waiver, as per the evidence of P.W.1 as well as the statements made in plaint? </u></strong><br/> <br/>Waiver is the abandonment of right, and is thus a defence against its subsequent enforcement. It may be express or, where there is knowledge of the right, it may be implied from the conduct which is inconsistent with the continuance of the right (Halsbury"s Laws of England 3rd edition volume 37, page 152).<br/> <br/>In the case of Associated Hotels vs. Ranjit Singh, reported in AIR  1968 (SC)- 933 it has been held- "waiver is an intentional relinquishment of a known right. There can be no waiver unless the person against whom the waiver is claimed that full knowledge of its rights and of facts enabling him to effectual action for the enforcement of such rights.<br/> <br/>In the instant suit, the plaintiff at paragraph No.10 of the plaint although has made out positive statements that Moazzem Hossain submitted application on 03.7.1997 for getting share certificate transferred in his name but failed to make Moazzem a party in the suit and failed to seek any remedy against him.<br/> <br/>At paragraph No.20(x) of the written statement submitted by the defendant No.1, the following positive facts have been disclosed- <u>"that on 03.7.1994 Syed Moazzem Hossain submitted the share certificate along with an instrument of transfer duly signed by the plaintiff as transferor and himself as transferee. But only after two days of submission of the transfer instrument by the plaintiff. She denied the said transfer and alleged that the signature on the said instrument submitted to the Bank had been forged. But so far the defendant bank knew that the plaintiff did not take any step for such a forgery."</u> The copy of the said written statement was served upon the plaintiff's advocate on 12.9.2000. (underlining by us)<br/> <br/>Despite of the said discloser of fact that the plaintiff transferred her share certificate to Moazzem Hossain (defendant No.7), the plaintiff abstained from amending her plaint, seeking proper remedy. The plaintiff proceeded with the disposal of her suit claiming relief only against the defendant No.s.1-4 and making the defendant Nos.5 and 6 as proforma defendant. The suit came up in the peremptory hearing list on 12.11.2001. The P.W.1 was examined on oath on 15.3.2003 and he failed to seek any relief in open court against Moazzem Hossain despite of discloser of definite case of transfer as made out in the written statement of the defendant No.1.<br/> <br/>24.3.2003 was fixed for further hearing and on that date the defendant No.7 came forward with an application under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying for adding him as defendant and that prayer was allowed on 24.3.2003. The defendant No.7 sub-mitted written statement on 17.5.2003. Copy of the written statement was served upon the plaintiff on 17.5.2003. At paragraph No.4(Da) of the written statement the defendant No.7 specifically asserted the facts that he had purchased the shares for valuable consider-ation. Despite of the said discloser the plaintiff did not amend her plaint and willfully abstained from seeking any remedy against the defendant No.7. Moreover the Pw1 in his cross-examination has admitted the following-......From the above admission of Pw1 it is proved beyond doubt that the main clash of contest over the ownership of share has been centered between the plaintiff and the defendant No. 7 but the plaintiff deliberately failed to seek any remedy against the defendant No.7 (appellant). The plaintiff has not come forward to depose in her case. She did not deny the defendant No. 7`s claim over the shares in question. The plaintiff instituted the suit for getting back her share but abstained from seeking any relief against the defendant No.7 despite of admission that the plaintiff transferred the shares in favour of defendant No. 7. The circumstance and the evidence on record clearly made out a case of wairer in claiming share against the defendant No.7.<br/> <br/>Before filing the instant suit the plaintiff unsuccessfully moved before the High Court Division under section 158 of the Companies Act without impleading the defendant No.7 in the said case. The defendant No.7 was added as a party before the High Court Division in Matter No.3 and disclosed about his purchase of shares. After the said discloser of purchase the plaintiff prayed for withdrawal of her proceeding brought under section 158 of the Companies Act and instituted the instant suit without impleading  the defendant No.7 as a defendant and without seeking any remedy against him. The P.W.1 admitted in his cross- examination about the transfer of shares by plaintiff in favour of the defendant No.7. Considering the facts and circumstances as discussed above and from the admission made by P.W.1 in his cross- examination we are constrained to hold that the suit is barred by the doctrin of waiver in getting any remedy against the defendant No.7. At paragraph 1(Uma) of the written statement of the defendant No.7 it has been pleaded that the suit is barred by waiver, estoppel and acquiescence. In view of the above the suit was liable to be dismissed as being barred by waiver. Accordingly this issue is decided affirmatively against the plaintiff.<br/> <br/>It is to be noted here that from the statements made at paragraph No. 10 of the plaint it is admitted that the shars in question was transferred to Moazzem in 1994. At first the plaintiff moved before the High Court Division under Section 158 of the Companies Act, without impleading the defendant No. 7 as a party and thereafter instituted the instant suit without impleading the defendant No. 7 as a defendant. In both the matters the plaintiff abstained from seeking any remedy as against the defendant No.7. In both the matters the defendant No. 7 after coming to know of the legal proceeding come forward to protect his interest and contested those legal proceedings. The plaintiff has to come before a Court of law with clean hands for seeking remedy under the Specific Relief Act is the settled law. In the instant case it has been proved that the plaintiff took attempts to get her remedy behind the back of defendant No. 7 despite of the admission made by PW-1 that the plaintiff transferred her share to defendant No. 7. She tried to keep the defendant No. 7 in darkness and behind his back attempted to have declaration as prayed for. The affords taken by the plaintiff were not fair to have declaration as prayed for. Non impleading of defendant No. 7 before the High Court Division as well as before the learned Joint District Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka signifies that the plaintiff tried to have her declaration practicing fraud upon the Court and concealing the fact of transfer of her share. She does not deserve any consideration from a Court of law.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Let us take up the issue No.ii whether the suit was barred by limitation? </u></strong><br/> <br/>The suit was instituted on 26.8.1999. P.W.1 admitted in his cross-examination that the shares of the plaintiff were sold in 1994-although stated that, <u>"৯৪ সনে বাদীর শেয়ারগুলি ফোরজারী করে ৪নং বিবাদীর কাছে হস্তান্তর করেছে</u><u> তা ডাইরেক্টর হাবিবুর রহমানের মাধ্যমে জানলাম সৈয়দ মোয়াজ্জম হোসেনের বরাবরে হস্তান্তর প্রক্রিয়া চলছে ----৯৪ সনে আমি শেয়ারগুলি অবৈধভাবে হস্তান্তর করেছে তা জানতে পারি ৯৯ স</u><u>নে মামলা দায়ের করি।</u><u>"</u>. From the above quoted evidence of P.W.1 it is proved that the suit was instituted after 5(five) years of coming to know about the transfer of shares allegedly taking resort to forgery. Article 91 of the Limitation Act provides 3(three) years limitation for filing suit to cancel or set aside an instrument, become known to him. The plaintiff at first came to know about the said transfer before 05.7.1994 as it appears from exhibit- 'Tha'. Accordingly the plaintiff had to file the suit within May, 1997 for setting aside of the alleged transfer of shares instrument. Accordingly we have no hesitation but to hold that the suit was barred by limitation and was liable to be dismissed on the ground of limitation. The learned Joint District Judge deliberately avoided to decide the question of limitation. Section 3 of the Limitation Act 1908 imposed obligatory duty upon a court to dismiss a suit if instituted beyond the prescribed period of limitation.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Let us take up issue No. iii for decision as to whether the plaintiff got any right title and interest in the 30347 shares in question? </u></strong><br/> <br/>The defendant was added as a party during examining the Pw1 in open court. Thereafter the defendant submitted written statement and produced before the court, a lot of important documents, applications, signed by the plaintiff and those were marked as exhibit খ-ঠ and ‘x’. The plaintiff received the copy of the written statement filed by the defendant No.7 on 17.05.03. Thereafter the plaintiff failed to amend her plaint. She did not deny the genuineness of exhibit “খ-ঠ and “x”. Exhibit “খ” series disclosed that shares were transferred by the plaintiff in favour of 1) Munir Uddin 2) Ataur Rahaman and 3) Altaf Hossain Ashu Mia on 20/05/1990 and thereafter those instrument of transfer was cancelled on 21/05/1990. Exhibit ‘গ’ disclosed that the (plaintiff) requested the chairman Pubali Bank to transfer her shares in favour of Jakir Hossain and others (5 Persons) and accordingly shares were transferred on 21/5/90 in favour of Zakir Hossain and others vide exhibit “ঘ” to ঘ (৫)” and afterwords those were cancelled. The exhibit ‘ঙ’ is an application signed by the plaintiff to the chairman Pubali Bank dated 23.7.90 requesting the later to transfer shares in the name of 8 persons. By exhibit “ছ” dated 31.7.1990, the plaintiff requested secretary Pubali Bank to confirm her about the transfer if made persnant to her application dated 23.7.1990 (Exbi. ‘P’). Exhibit ‘V’ is an impor-tant application submitted by the plaintiff dated 4/5/94 the contents where of runs thus:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>বরাবর, </strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">ব্যবস্থাপনা পরিচালক,<br/>পূবালী ব্যাংক, লিঃ<br/>হেড অফিস,<br/>মতিঝিল, ঢাকা।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>বিষয়ঃ-         শেয়ার সার্টিফিকেট প্রদান সম্পর্ক।<br/><br/><strong>জনাব, </strong><br/>বিনীত নিবেদন এই যে, আমি পূবালী ব্যাংক লিঃ এর একজন গর্বিত শেয়ার হোল্ডার আমার শেয়ার সার্টিফিকেট এন্ট্রি তাং ১১/১২/১৯৮৫, এলটমেন্ট লেটার নং ০১, ট্রান্সফার রিসিট নং ১২১/৮৫ ডিস্টিংটিভ নং ৫১২৯৯২ থেকে ৫৪৩৩৩৮ পর্যন্ত, শেয়ার সার্টিফিকেট নং-০২৪০১, শেয়ার সংখ্যা ৩০৩৪৭ টি। ইহার অরিজিন্যাল সার্টিফিকেট আমাকে দেওয়া হয় নাই। তাই অনুগ্রহ পূর্বক অরিজিন্যাল অথবা ডুব্লিকেট সার্টিফিকেট দেয়ার জন্য অনুরোধ জানাচ্ছি| কেননা, আমার স্বামী জনাব আলতাফ হোসন আশু মিঞার নাম হোটেল জাকারিয়ায় এবং অন্যান্য জায়গায় যথেষ্ট ঋণ রহিয়াছে। তাই হয়তো এটা বিক্রয় করিয়া ঋণ পরিশোধ করিতে হইবে। উল্লেখ্য যে, যদি উক্ত শেয়ার আপনার হোটেল জাকারিয়ার ঋণের বদলে কোন লীন করিয়া থাকেন তাও অনুগ্রহ পূর্বক আমাকে জানাইয়া দিবেন। কেননা, এর আগেও বহুবার উক্ত সার্টিফিকেট পাওয়ার জন্য দরখাস্ত করিয়াছিলাম। আমি আশা করি কতৃপক্ষ সার্টিফিকেট প্রদানের ব্যবস্থা করিয়া আমাক বাধিত করিবেন। ধন্যবাদান্তে- (underling by us).</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>আপনার বিশ্বস্ত<br/>তাসিয়া খানম</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">তারিখ-৪/৫/৯৪ ইং</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Exbit “V” is not denied by the plaintiff From exhibit ‘ট’ it appears that the plaintiff and her husband were suffering from accute financial deficiency and had some loan too. She expressed her willingness to transfer her shares. The exhibit ‘x’, the Instrument of transfer of share is not denied by the plaintiff. The exhibit ‘x’ was executed by the plaintiff as well as defendant No. 7 on 30.5.94. If the exhibit ‘ট’ and ‘x’ are read together it proved beyond doubt that to solve financial crisis of the plaintiff’s family debts the shares in question were sold by exhibit ‘x’ on 30.5.1994. Moreover, As per the evidence of P.W.1 the shares have been sold taking resort to forgery. No prayer has been made in the suit seeking declaring that the transfer was made taking resort to forgery. So long such declaration is made the plaintiff is ceased to claim any interest in those transferred shares. The P.W.1 failed to adduce any evidence claiming that transfer of share was taken place by forgery. Since transfer of shares was made in 1994 is admitted, the plaintiff was ceased to retain any interest in those shares in 1999. As a result this issue is decided negatively against the plaintiff. The plaintiff has been ceased to retain any interest in the transferred share.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Let us take up issue No. iv, v and vi for decision as to whether there created any right title and interest of the defendant No.7 in the 30347 shares of the plaintiff on the strength of exhibit-X and what are the essentials for transfer of share? </u></strong><br/> <br/>The P.W.1 himself in his evidence has admitted the fact of transfer made in 1994. Exhibit-X came from the possession of the defendant No.7- appellant which shows that 30347 shares were transferred at Taka 3034700.00. Section 38 of the Companies Act provides the provision for transfer of shares which runs thus:-<br/>"Transfer of shares:-</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">An application for the registration of the transfer of shares in a company may be made either by the transferer or the transferee, provided where such application is made by the transferer no registration shall in case of party paid shares be effected unless the company gives notice of the application to the transferee and subject to the provisions of subsection (7) the company shall, unless objection is made by the transferee two weeks from the date of receipt of the notice, enter in its register of members the name of the transferee in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as if the application for registration was made by the transferee.</li><li style="text-align:justify">For the purpose of sub-section (1) notice to the transferee shall be deemed to have been duly given if dispatched by prepaid post to the transferee at the address given in the instrument of transfer and shall be deemed to have been delivered in the ordinary course of post.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It shall not be lawful for the company to register a transfer of share in or debentures of the company unless the proper instrument of transfer duly stamped and executed by the transferor and the transferee has been delivered to the company along with scrip.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Provided that, where it is proved to the satisfaction of the directors of the company that an instrument of transfer signed by the transferor and transferee has been lost, the company may, if the directors think fit, on an application in writing made by the transferee and bearing the stamp required by an instrument of transferor register the transfer on such terms as to indemnity as the directors may think fit.</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">If a company refuses to register the transfer of any shares or debentures, the company, shall, within one month from the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged with the company, send to the transferee and the transferor notice of the refusal.</li><li style="text-align:justify">If default I made in complying with sub-section (4) of this section, the company shall be liable to a fine not exceeding one hundred taka for everyday during which the default continues and every director, manager secretary other officer who is knowing by a party to the default shall, be liable to a like penalty.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Nothing in sub-section (3) shall prejudice any power of the company to register as shareholder or debenture holder any person to whom the right to any share in or debentures of the company has been transmitted by operation of law.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Nothing in this section shall prejudice any power of the company under its articles to refuse to register the transfer of any shares."</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Upon a careful reading to the said provision it appears to us that the essentials for transfer of shares are :-<br/>1) the document of transfer has to be executed by both the transferor and transferee, 2) thereafter the transfer of share document must be stamped, 3) Such instrument of transfer must be delivered to the company, and 4) thereafter the duty of the company is to enter the name of the transferee into the share Register Book. In the instant case exhibit-X was executed by both the plaintiff and the defendant No.7. From the said document it shows that Taka 3034700/- has been paid against the price of shares. That document has been delivered to the company. No relief has been sought for as against the exhibit-X. The plaintiff is not in possession of the shares in question. From exhibit- Tha, it shows that the plaintiff raised objection before the Secretary of Bank not to approve the transfer made vide exhibit-X. No relief has been prayed for against the defendant No.7 denying his interest in the share. The process of transfer although has not been completed as yet but from the admission made by P.W.1 it has been proved beyond doubt that the shares in question have been sold to the appellant vide exhibit-X. Registration although has not been completed as yet but the payment of consideration having had made there created interest in favour of defendant No.7 on the shares in question. Accordingly the issues are decided in favour of the defendant No.7 appellant.<br/> <br/>The suit was although instituted under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act seeking certain declaration upon 30347 shares but Dr. M. Zahir the learned advocate for the petitioner without making any submission upon the question of entitlement of getting declaration of ownership of the plaintiff upon the shares in question kept his argument confined only referring to section 31, 34 and 43 of the Companies Act and submitted that since the name of the defendant No.7 had not been registered in the share Register Book there is no bar in getting declaration as prayed for.<br/> <br/>Section 31 of the Companies Act runs thus:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"31.  Certificate of shares or stock-A certificate under the common seal of the company specifying any shares or stocks held by any member shall be prima facie evidence of the title of the member to the shares or stock therein specified."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>After perusal of section 31 of the Companies Act it appears to us that the argument made by the learned Counsel for the plaintiff was good in absence of exhibit 'X' and exhibit 'Tha'. After admitting the fact of transfer of shares the plaintiff cannot take advantage of section 31 of the Act. Accordingly that argument does not come to any help to the plaintiff.<br/> <br/>Section 34 of the Companies Act runs thus:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"Sec 34. Register of member:-<br/>(i) Every company shall keep in one or more book of register of its members, and enter therein the following particulars:-<br/>(ii) the name and address, and the occupations, if any of the members;<br/>(iii) in the case of a company having a share capital, a statement of the shares held by each members, distinguishing each share by its number and of the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid on the shares of each member;<br/>(iv) the date at which each person was entered in the register as a member;<br/>(v) the date at which any person ceased to be a member."<br/>Upon perusal of the above provision it appears to us that the section 34 of the Companies Act has got no manner of application in deciding the matter in issues lawfully. Accordingly the points raised by Mr. Dr. M. Zahir is kept out of consideration.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The learned Counsel for the plaintiff respondent referred to section 43 of the Companies Act and submitted that the name of the plaintiff is in the Register and as such she is the owner of the shares in question. Section 43 of the Companies Act provides the provision for rectify register by a court. The matter in dispute is not with regard to rectification of register and as such the argument set forth by Mr. Dr. M. Zahir got no relevancy with the subject matter of suit. Accordingly the point raised by the learned Counsel is kept out of consideration.<br/> <br/>After pronouncement of the operative part of the judgment Mr. Ramjan Ali Sikder, the learned Advocate appearing for the defendant No.1 verbally informed the court that the defendant No.1 has complied with direction made by the trial court. We have perused the entire record as well as order book of the appeal. Mr. Ramjan Ali Sikder, the learned Advocate entered appearance only on 15.3.2011 on behalf of respondent No.2 by filing power. Save and except filing power there is nothing on record that any change has been made with the fate of the shares in question. The respondent No.2 did not inform this court by filing application that they have complied with the lower court's direction. Appeal is the continuation of suit is the settled law. The suit was decreed on 31.3.2005 and the instant appeal was presented on 11.5.2005 which is within limitation. From the judgment it appears that the defendant Nos.1-4 were directed to return the shares to the plaintiff within 90 days from 31.3.2005. The defendant No. 1 (respondent No.2) has contested the suit and supported the defendant No.7's case at paragraph No.20(x) of the written statement. <u>From the order book it appears that by order dated 16.5.2005 the operation of the impugned judgment and decree has been stayed and the notices upon the respondents were served between</u> 16.10.2008 to 19.10.2009. Since the operation of the impugned judgment was stayed, the information supplied to the court by the learned counsel for the respondent No.2 is not acceptable without any written instrument. If the shares were handed over to the plaintiffs by the respondent No.2 that would have been specifically pleaded by the learned Counsel for the plaintiff. The respondent No.2 cannot do anything during pendency of the appeal and as such the information supplied by Mr. Ramjan Ali Sikder does neither help the court for arriving at its decision nor absolve the defendant No.1 from its responsibility. Moreover the said information is contradictory with the stand taken by the said defendant in the trial court by filing written statement. Accordingly we cannot take notice of the said information. Moreover the Bank has neither filed any appeal nor cross appeal. As such the stand taken by the learned Counsel for the Bank goes against the sanctity of the Banking business. The respondent No.2 is bound by the final result of the appeal.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Let us take up issue No. viii for decision.</u></strong><br/><br/>From the facts and circumstances and the evidence on record as well as the decision taken by us, we are of the view that the impugned judgment and decree are not sustainable in law. The learned Joint District Judge without discussing the material evidence on record has decreed the suit although the suit was not maintainable and was barred by waiver and limitation. The impugned judgment and decree are liable to be set aside. Accordingly we find merit in the appeal.<br/> <br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed however, without any order as to costs. The impugned judgment and decree dated 31.03.2005 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 5th Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No.181 of 1999 are set aside. The suit is dismissed, however without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/>Send down the records at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Montu (PW-1) was married with Md. Moksed Ali (condemned-prisoner) son of late Basu Mandal before 22/23 years of the occurrence. During their wedlock two sons and one daughter born. Their conjugal life was not happy as her husband was a wine drinker. Her husband used to torture her for tifling matter. On 02-08-2002 at noon her accused husband came from outside and picked up a quarrel with her for food and abused her in filthy languages, she, then came out from the house and sat on eastern side of a road adjacent to her house (briefly as P.O.). Then at 1:15 p.m. her accused husband dealt a hasua blow upon her neck causing profuse bleeding injuries. On her screaming, her son, sister and other locals namely Sima (PW-3), Md. Milon (PW-2), Md. Sowdagar (PW-4), Akramul Huq (PW-5), Md. Abdul Hamid(PW-6) and Md. A. Wahab (PW-8) happened at the spot and her accused husband departed from the scene with hasua. She died on the spot. Having had heard the incident her brother Md. Montu rushed to the P.O. and found her dead-body. Later, after being informed from the above witnesses he as informant lodged the FIR which was recorded as Charghat P.S. Case no. 03 dated 02-08-2002 corresponding to G.R. no. 491 of 2002.<br/> <br/>The Police after investigation submitted charge-sheet under section 302 of the Penal Code accusing the condemned-prisoner as accused.                            <br/> <br/>Eventually, the accused was called upon to answer the charge under section 302 of the Penal Code to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/> <br/>In course of trial the prosecution in all examined fourteen witnesses out of twenty three charge-sheeted witnesses and the defence examined none.<br/> <br/>After closure of the prosecution case the accused was examined under Section 342 of the Code again he repeated his innocence but led no evidence in defence.<br/> <br/>The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses are that of innocence and false implication. It was divulged in defence that deceased Rashida Khatun died by falling on a sharp cutting weapon.<br/> <br/>After trial the learned Judge convicted the accused as aforesaid holding:</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">That the prosecution successfully proved the charge under Section 302 of the Penal Code against the accused.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The prosecution by uniform and consistent evidence succeeded to prove the complicity of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State candidly submits that on perusal of the record it appears that the accused was a man of unsound mind and was a mental patient during trial and there is no materials on record to show that he was quite fit to face the trial. He lastly submits that the case should be sent to the trial Court for holding new trial.<br/> <br/>The learned Counsels appearing for the condemned-prisoner by their common contentions seek to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on two fold arguments:<br/><strong>        <u>Firstly:</u> </strong>The appellant was a mental patient and was of unsound mind during trial, consequently incapable of making his defence but there is no materials on record to show that he was capable for facing trial. There is no finding of the trial Court to that effect which seriously prejudiced the convict.<br/>        <strong><u>Secondly</u> </strong>It is a fit case to send it for new trial.<br/> <br/>Before deciding the case on merit we are inclined to answer the submissions advanced by both the learned counsels regarding new trial.<br/> <br/>On going to the materials on record it transpires that before commencement of trial accused Md. Moksed Ali was detained in Rajshahi Central Jail wherein he was under going treatment as a mental patient. Accordingly, Senior Jail Superintendent, Central Jail, Rajshahi, by his Office letter dated 17-10-2002 sought for an order to the Magistrate, first Class “Kha” Zone Rajshahi for transfer of the accused from Rajshahi central Jail to Pabna District Jail for better treatment at Pabna Mental hospital pursuant to the advise of medical expert. Meanwhile, on 19-10-2002 the accused was transferred to Pabna District Jail for such treatment. It is a matter of surprise that the  learned Magistrate without receiving any report regarding progress of treatment transferred the case record to the Court of Sessions Judge, Rajshahi for trial.<br/> <br/>On receipt of the case record the learned Sessions Judge, Rajshahi by the order dated 10-11-2002 took cognizance of the offence under Section 302 of the Penal Code against the accused  and issued PW, fixing 27-11-2002. Subsequently the learned Judge by the order dated 27-11-2002 called for a medical report from concern Jail authority regarding fitness of the accused for facing trial fixing 15-02-2003 for report. Meanwhile the Jail authority made different correspondence regarding the health condition of the accused. Later, the Pabna Mental hospital without furnishing any report asked to produce any nearest relation of the accused for collecting past history regarding such disease. Eventually, one of the nearest relation namely Abdul Hamid was directed to appear before the Court on 28-04-2004, but we do not find any material that said Abdul Hamid either appeared in the Court or before the authority of Pabna Mental hospital. It appears from the order dated 28-04-2004 that the case was transferred to the second Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Rajshahi for trial who ultimately in subsequent dates without any specific finding as to the mental and physical condition of the accused commenced the trial by framing charge and after trial convicted the accused as aforesaid.<br/> <br/>Chapter XXXIV provides the Provisions for procedure of trial incase of a person being lunatic.<br/> <br/>For the convenience of understanding Sections 464 and 465 of the Code read as hereunder:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>    “Section 464- Procedure in case of accused being lunatic: (1) When a Magistrate holding an inquiry or a trial has reason to believe that the accused is of unsound mind and consequently incapable of making his defence, the Magistrate shall inquire into the fact of such unsoundness, and shall cause such person to be examined by the Civil Surgeon of the district or such other medical officer as the Government directs, and thereupon shall examine such Surgeon or other officer as a witness, and shall reduce the examination to writing.</em><br/><em>    (1A) Pending such examination and inquiry, the Magistrate may deal with the accused in accordance with the provisions of section 466.</em><br/><em>    (2) If such Magistrate is of opinion that the accused is of unsound mind and consequently incapable of making his defence, he shall record a finding to that effect and shall postpone further proceedings in the case.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Section 465- Procedure in case of person being lunatic before Court of Sessions- (1) If at the trial of any person before a Court of Sessions, it appears to the Court that such person is of unsound mind and consequently incapable of making his defence, the Court shall, in the first instance, try the fact of such unsoundness and incapacity, and if the Court is satisfied of the fact, it shall record a finding to that effect and shall postpone further proceedings in the case.</em><br/><em>    (2) The trial of the fact of the unsoundness of mind and incapacity of the accused shall be deemed to be part of his trial before the Court.”</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">It appears from the record that the learned Judge of the trial Court neither followed the above Provisions nor took any positive step for taking the opinion asto the physical and mental condition of the accused from the Pabna Mental hospital.<br/> <br/>After meticulous examination of the record we find that before commencement of trial the accused was sick and not fit for facing trial. Therefore we hold that the accused was seriously prejudiced by the trial of the case.<br/> <br/>It is a matter of great regret that the learned Judge of the trial Court in his judgment dated 24-05-2007 observed in the following manner:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“</em>ইতিপূ­র্বে আসামী পাগল ছিল কিনা তাহা বিস্তারিত আ­লাচনা হই­তে আদালত সিদ্ধা­ন্ত আসিয়া­ছে যে, ঘটনার সময় আসামী মানষিক রোগী বা পাগল ছিল না।<em>”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The aforesaid observations is absolutely erroneous inasmuchas there is no finding of the learned Judge regarding physical and mental condition of the accused at the time of trial.<br/> <br/>Moreso, in such situation earlier the learned Sessions Judge was not empowered by law to transfer the case to the second Court of Additional Sessions Judge, for holding trial without obtaining any opinion from the concern authority regarding physical and mental condition of the accused. The learned Judge of the trial Court also without collecting such report concluded the trial and convicted the accused as aforesaid which, in our view seriously prejudiced the accused. So both the learned judges of the Court below including the learned Magistrate violated the mandatory Provisions of law as provided above.<br/> <br/>Therefore, we hold that the case should be remanded to the Court of Sessions, Rajshahi for holding new trial, pursuant to the Provisions laid down in Section 376 of the Code which reads as hereunder:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>      “376-  Power of High Court Division to confirm sentence or annul conviction.
