Furthermore, just because the names of one or two of its members have not been mentioned in the cause title of the writ petition as petitioners, the <em>locus standi</em> should not be denied when we are convinced that the petitioner-association in this case is bonafide in espousing the cause of it’s members.

The impugned decision does not even show any urgent state necessity or disastrous event to justify direct procurement under section 68. The impugned decision has not only affected the interests of prospective ship-builders in this country, it has deprived the members of the petitioner of their right to participate in the tender for no fault of them. Thus, we hold that the impugned decision does not come under the purview of exceptions as provided by section 32 and 68, and as such we are inclined to hold that the same is without lawful authority and of no legal effect. . . .(10)</strong><br/> <br/><strong><em>Dada Match Workers Union Vs.

The members of the Association are engaged in ship-building, and some of them have already acquired high reputation by exporting ships constructed/built by them. The Government having taken decision to procure four  108 TEU multipurpose container vessels  (hereinafter called“ the said vessels), it obtained report from BUET through Project Evaluation Committee which in its meeting held on 29.06.2009 decided, amongst others,  to float tender in this regard. Subsequently, on 22.12.2009, in a meeting of the Executive Committee for National Economic Council (ECNEC), the project for procuring the said vessels has been  approved and the procurement   cost has been determined as Tk. 137,79,00,000/-. However, in the said meeting the  ECNEC took the impugned decision for  procuring the said vessels directly from Khulna Ship-Yards and Chittagong Dry Dock, two government owned ship builders, without any tender, and respondent No 11 has communicated the same to the concerned authorities vide  letter dated 11.01.2010. Being aggrieved by this, the petitioner association moved this court and obtained the rule. The rule is contested by respondent No. 1,3,5 10 &amp; 11, however, respondent No. 10 and 11 have filed separate Affidavits-in- Opposition, although the contentions of the contesting respondents are almost same.<br/> <br/>Mr. Nakib Saiful Islam, the learned Advocate for the petitioner, submits that the provisions of Public Procurement Act 2006 (“the said Act”)  and the Rules framed thereunder, namely Public Procurement Rules 2008, made it mandatory for the government procurement authorities of Bangladesh to do procurements through open public tender except in few cases specifically provided by the said Act. He submits that only under situations mentioned in section 32 and section 68 of the said Act, the procurement authority can deviate from the mandatory procurement by open tender. However, he submits, the impugned decision to procure the said container vessels directly from Khulna Shipyards and Chittagong Dry Dock grossly violated the said mandatory provisions as the decision  does not come under the categories of exceptions as provided by section 32 and section 68.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Mojibur Rahman Miah, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for respondent Nos. 1,3 &amp; 11, submits that the petitioner association being not a person aggrieved as provided under Article 102 of the constitution it does not have locus standi to move this Writ Petition  against the impugned  decision in a representative capacity. In this regard he refers to some decisions of this court, namely Dada Match Workers Union Vs. Bangladesh reported in 29 DLR, page-188, Bangladesh Shangbadpatra Parishad Vs. Government of Bangladesh reported in 43 DLR (AD), page-126, and Bangladesh Electrical Association Vs. Bangladesh reported in 46 DLR, page 221, and mainly relies on Shangbad Patra Parishad Case. He further submits that the impugned decision is a policy decision of the Government and as such the same is not amenable to writ jurisdiction as held by our apex Court in Prof. A. Rahim and others Vs. Ministry of Industries and others reported in 7 BLT (AD), page-313. Mr. Azmalul Hossain Q.C, the learned Senior Counsel representing respondent No. 10, submits that the project will economically benefit the country as it is evident from the discussion in the impugned decision and as such ECNEC can avoid tender procedure for greater public interest and the interest of the country. He submits that for public interest and  greater interest of the country, the government has the right to negotiate with any individual for procurement and in this regard he refers to an Indian Supreme Court decision, namely  Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy Vs. State of Jammu and Kashmir reported in AIR 1980 S C-1992. The learned Advocates for respondents further submit that the impugned decision  comes under the exception provided in section 32(1) ( M) (E) and as such the decision in no way has violated the provisions of the said Act. In reply to objections as regard standing of the petitioner, Mr. Nakib Saiful Islam refers to the landmark decision of our appex court in Dr.  Mohiuddin Farooque Vs. Bangladesh and others reported in 17 BLD (AD) page-1 and submits that after this decision our Appellate Division has expanded the concept of locus standi and came out of the traditional rigid view of “person aggrieved”. He submits that the petitioner association being a registered association of its members under Company Act, it has sufficient interest to move this Writ Petition for and on behalf of its members against a gross default or abuse by the executives.<br/> <br/>Perused the Writ petition, Affidavit-in-Opposition and papers as annexed thereto and considered the submissions made by the learned Advocates. Since the question of Locus standi has been seriously raised by the learned Deputy Attorney General, we need to address the same first although this issue has by this time been settled by our appex court in Dr. Mohiuddin Farooque’s case as cited by the learned Advocate for the petitioner. In Dr.Mohiuddin Farooque’s case the case of  Shangbadpatra Parishad has been considered and our Appellate Division moved forward leaving behind the traditional view of “person aggrieved” as formulated in the Shangbad Patra Parishad case and held that persons with sufficient interest, not being a busy body, should be entitled to have audience under writ jurisdiction challenging the illegality committed by the State and its machineries. His Lordship Justice Mostafa Kamal, while delivering the main judgment, observed that the Shangbadpatra Parishad case was not an authority even for the proposition that an association could never be a person aggrieved if it espoused the causes of its members in a representative capacity. His Lordship made the point with the following observation (at page-18):</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“With the power of the people looming large behind the constitutional horizon it is difficult to conceive of Article 102 as a vehicle or mechanism for realizing exclusively individual rights upon individual complaints. The Supreme Court being a vehicle, a medium or mechanism devised by the Constitution for the exercise of the judicial power of the people on behalf of the people, the people will always remain the focal point of concern of the Supreme Court while disposing of justice or propounding any judicial theory or interpreting any provision of the Constitution. Viewed in this context interpreting the words “any person aggrieved” meaning only and exclusively individuals and excluding the consideration of people as a collective and consolidated personality will be a stand taken against the Constitution.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Apart from above, in some other cases also this court has allowed locus standi to the persons having sufficient interests. As for example, in Bangladesh Retired Government Employees Welfare Association Vs. Bangladesh reported in 46 DLR page-426, the High Court Division has allowed locus standi to an Association of retired government employees to espouse the causes of its members. Although this decision has been over- ruled by the Appellate Division on a different point [51 DLR (Ad) page-121], the petitioner-Association’s locus-standi as allowed by the High Court Division was not interfered with. Resonating the words of Justice Naimuddin Ahmed in the above mentioned Retired Government Employees Case [46 DLR-426], we like to hold that the Constitution of our country is not a morbid document but a dynamic instrument capable of being interpreted and applied in the ever-changing socio-economic context of society. Therefore, to make it dynamic in the practical sense, the pedantic and lexicographic interpretation of the words “ person aggrieved” should, as far as possible, be avoided if it can be done without causing repugnancy  to a specific provision of the Constitution. In the instant case, we also do not think that by expanding the meaning of the words “ person aggrieved” we are causing any repugnancy to any provision of the Constitution.  Considering the above reported cases and the fact that the petitioner association is a registered association under the Companies Act espousing   the  cause of its members, we do not find any reason to disallow it right to audience under writ jurisdiction for challenging the impugned decision as the impugned decision directly affected the interests and rights of its members to participate in the open tender. Furthermore, just because the names of one or two of its members have not been mentioned  in the cause title of the writ petition  as petitioners, the locus standi should not be denied when we are convinced that the petitioner-association in this case is bonafide in espousing the cause of it’s members. Besides, the impugned decision being a specific decision for specific procurement, it can not be a policy decision as suggested by the learned Deputy Attorney General.  Therefore, we hold that this writ petition is maintainable.<br/> <br/>Now, as to the merit of the case, it appears that section 3 of the said Act provides for applicability of the provisions of the said Act in procurements by spending government fund, and section 4 has given the provisions of the said Act over-riding effect. Section 31 provides for open-tender procedure as a priority in public procurement, however, section 68 provides that in case of <u>urgent state necessity</u> or <u>to face any disastrous event, </u>government, <u>in public interest,</u> can take recourse to direct procurements  in accordance with section 32 or any other method. Sub section (2) of the section 68 further emphasises that the government will procure as per provisions of the said Act unless different decision is taken by the government on the ground of <u>national security</u> or <u>in the interest of national defence</u>  (underlines supplied to give emphasis).  Now let us examine section 32 of the said Act, which is heavily relied upon by the learned Advocates for the respondents. The learned Advocates mainly rely on section  32 (1)(M) (E). The relevant portions of section 32 are quoted  below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“৩২। <u>পণ্য, কার্য, ইত্যাদি ত্রুযে অন্যান্য ত্রুয় পদ্ধতির প্রয়োগ।</u></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"> (১)  ত্রুয়কারী কার্যালয় প্রধান বা তৎকর্তৃক ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত কোন কর্মকর্তার অনুমোদনত্রুমে ধারা ৩১  এ উল্লিখিত পদ্ধতি ব্যতীত অন্য কোন পদ্ধতিতে পণ্য, সংশ্লিষ্ট সেবা, কার্য বা ভৌত সেবা ত্রুয়ের ক্ষেত্রে, <u>কারিগরী অথবা অর্থনৈতিক কারণ যুক্তিযুক্ত বিবেচিত হইলে</u> ত্রুয়কারী নিমণবর্ণিত যে কোন পদ্ধতি প্রয়োগ করিতে পারিবে, যথাঃ-</div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(ক)  নিম্নবর্ণিত ক্ষেত্রে সীমিত দরপত্র পদ্ধতি প্রয়োগ করা যাইবে, যথাঃ-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">(অ)  .............................................<br/>(আ) .............................................<br/> (ই) .............................................</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"> (খ)  <u>সম্ভাব্য প্রতিযোগিতা এড়াইবার জন্য বা দরপত্রদাতাদের মধ্যে বৈষম্য সৃষ্টি করিতে পারে </u>এমন কোন পন্থা অবলম্বন না করিয়া নিম্লবর্ণিত ক্ষেত্রে সরাসরি ত্রুয় পদ্ধতি প্রয়োগ করা যাইবে, যথাঃ-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">(অ)  .............................................<br/>(আ) .............................................<br/> (ই)  .............................................<br/> (ঈ)  .............................................</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">(উ) সরকার ভিন্নরতপ সিদ্ধামত গ্রহণ না করিলে, বিশেষ ক্ষেত্রে সরকারী    মালিকানাধীন কোন শিল্প প্রতিষ্ঠান বা কারখানা হইতে সরকারের নিজস্ব  অর্থে পণ্য ত্রুয় করা হইলে,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">(ঊ)  .............................................</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 120px;">(২) ...............<br/>(৩) ...............</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 120px;">(Underlines supplied to give emphasis)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears from the above provision that sub-section (1) of section 32 enables the procurement authority to take recourse to direct  procurement from government owned industrial establishments or factory if the same is found to be  <u>logical on  mechanical</u>  or  <u>economic consideration</u> (কারিগরী অথবা অর্থনৈতিক কারন যুক্তিযুক্ত বিবেচিত হইলে) and the same  has to be done by not adopting a method <u>avoiding prospective competition</u> or <u>creating discrimination among the tenderers</u> (underlines supplied to give emphasis). However, the minutes of the concerned ECNEC meeting as reproduced by the petitioner in the Writ petition shows that although  there was one proposal for open tender to encourage competition, the ECNEC took the impugned decision to do direct procurement from Khulna Shipyard and Chittagong Dry Dock, two government owned ship-builders, without assigning any reason for such direct procurement and/or without holding that such method was required on the mechanical or economic necessity as provided by sub section (1) of section 32. We have read the discussions prior to reaching the impugned decision, but found not a vestige of discussion on the applicability or non-applicability of the provisions of Public Procurement Act 2006 and the Rules made there under. It has been decided in several cases by the Supreme Court of this Sub-Continent that the government  can not act like an individual in disposing of state properties or in granting any benefit or  largess infavour of any particular person because of the simple reason that the government is not the owner of the said properties and benefits. They belong to the people of the country and the government is only a trustee for the people and as such they can only act in accordance with law. The  ratio of Kasturi Lal case as cited by  Mr. Azmal Hossain QC  rather supports the above view. Speaking for the  court in Kusturi Lal, Bhagwati, J observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Every activity of the Government has a public element in it and it must, therefore, be informed with reason and guided by public interest. Every action taken by the Government must be in public interest; the Government can not act arbitrarily and without reason and if it does, its action would be liable to be invalidated.”</em> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Before Kasturi Lal, the Indian Supreme Court in the landmark case of Ramana Dayaram Shetty Vs. International Airport  Authority reported in AIR 1979 SC-1628 emphasized that the government can not act  in a discriminatory manner in warding a contract.<br/> <br/>We are of the view that the ECNEC or any executive authority, how high so ever, can not grant any benefit in favour of any one at its sweet will. It will have to act in accordance with law, and in the instant case the said law is Public Procurement Act, 2006. Since the ECNEC has dicided in the instant case to do direct procurement not on mechanical or economic ground as provided by section 32 (1), we are of the view that it has acted illegally. The impugned decision does not even show any urgent state necessity or disastrous event to justify direct procurement under section 68.The impugned decision has not only affected the interests of prospective ship- builders in this country, it has deprived the members of the petitioner of their right to participate in the tender for no fault of them. Thus, we hold that the impugned decision does not come under the purview of exceptions as provided by section 32 and 68, and as such we are inclined to hold that the same is without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/><br/>          In the result, the rule is made absolute without any order as to costs. The impugned decision of ECNEC taken in its 17<sup>th</sup> meeting held on 22.11.2009 for procurement / construction of four 108 TEU self propelled Multipurpose container ships engaging Khulna Shipyard and Chittagong Dry Dock without inviting any tender is hereby declared to have been taken without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/><br/>         <strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The petitioner defaulted to pay the said amount. The outstanding dues stood Tk. 15,18,678.09. So the Corporation instituted the instant Miscellaneous Case. The present petitioner who was the opposite party in the said Miscellaneous Case did not appear in the said case. Consequently the case was allowed ex parte with a direction to repay the dues by 10.9.1997. There was an order that, in case of failure to pay the said amount of Tk. 5,18,678.09, the corporation would be entitled to realise the dues by selling the mortgaged property. Against the said  ex parle order the petitioner filed an application under Order 9, rule 13  of the Code of Civil Procedure which was ultimately rejected. Against  which the petitioner preferred a Miscellaneous Appeal   in  the  High  Court Division which was registered as F.M.A.T. No.636/1997. In the  meantime,   the   House   Building   Finance   Corporation   filed   Title  Execution Case No. 83/1998 before the learned Artha Rin Adalat,  Khulna to execute the order as passed by the learned District Judge,  Khulna  in Miscellaneous  Case No.37/1997.  The  present petitioner  appeared  in the said Execution Case and filed an application for  dismissal of the said application stating that the Artha Rin Adalat has  no jurisdiction to execute the order as passed by the learned District  Judge in Miscellaneous Case under Article 27 of P.O.7/1983. The   Executing Court by the impugned order dated 21.4.2004 rejected the  said application and issued certificate in favour of the. Corporation as per  provisions of Section 33(5) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. Challenging the said order dated 21.4.2004 as passed by the Artha Rin Adalat, Khulna in Artha Rin Execution Case No.83/1998 the petitioner  moved this Court and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/>Mr. Sherdar Abul Hossain, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner, submits that the order passed by the learned District  Judge in Miscellaneous Case No.37/1997 is not executable before the <br/>Artha Rin Adalat in a regular Title Execution case in view of the fact that the adjudication order of the learned District Judge, Khulna is not a  decree and the said order has been passed in a proceeding of a  Miscellaneous Case not in a suit. The Adalat acted unlawfully in initiating the proceeding to execute the order as passed under the  provisions of Article 27 of P.O.7/1973. In support of his submission  Mr. Abul Hossain cited the decision in the case of Bangladesh House  Building Finance Corporation Vs. Jahan Ara Akhtar &amp; others, reported in 49 DLR (AD) 80.<br/> <br/> Mr.   Saheed  Alam,  the   learned  Advocate  appearing   for  the  respondent no.2, submits that the instant Execution Case has been filed  in 1998 and different steps have been taken including the decision to  sell   the  mortgaged   property   in   auction.   But  the judgment-debtor  petitioner did not raise any objection at any stage and allowed the  Executing Court to proceed with the  instant case.  At the time of considering the prayer of the Corporation to issue certificate in favour  of the Corporation the instant application has been filed which is not  at all tenable in law.<br/> <br/>Heard the learned  Advocates of both the sides, perused the writ petition and other materials on record.<br/> <br/>It appears that, on 5.2.1997, the respondent no.2, the House Building  Finance  Corporation   filed  Miscellaneous  Case  No.37/1997  before the learned District Judge, Khulna under the provisions of  Article 27 of P.0.7/1973. The said Case was allowed ex parte. The  learned District Judge directed the judgment-debtor petitioner to repay  the  outstanding  dues  of Tk. 15,18,678.09  within   10.9.1997  with  a  default  order  that  in   case  of failure  to   pay   the  said   amount  the  Corporation would  be  entitled to  sell  the  mortgaged  property  for  realisation of the dues. Thereafter, the Corporation instituted Title  Execution Case No.83/1998 before the Artha Rin Aaalat, Khulna for  executing the order as passed by the learned District Judge, Khulna and  at one stage the Corporation filed an application for getting certificate  under the provisions of Section 33(5) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain,  2003. On the other hand, the judgment-debtor petitioner filed an  application for dismissal of the Execution Case stating .that the order as  passed by the learned District Judge, Khulna in Miscellaneous Case  under Article 27 of P.0.7 of 1973 is not executable before the Artha Rin  Adalat and the Adalat acted illegally in entertaining such execution  case. The  Adalat  by  the  impugned  Order No.40  dated  21.4.2004 Rejected the said application holding, ’’নথি পর্যালোচনায় দেখা যায় অত্র জারী মোকদ্দমাটি ইং ২৮/১০/৯৮ তারিখে দাখিল করা হইয়াছে। তৎপর বহুবছর অতিক্রান্ত হইয়াছে। ২০০৩ সনের অর্থ ঋণ আদালত আইনের বিধান মোতাবেক অত্র জারী মামলা নিষ্পত্তির কার্যক্রম প্রায় শেষ প্রান্তে উপনীত হইয়াছে। দাইকপক্ষ ইতিপূর্বে আদালতের এখতিয়ার সম্পর্কে কোন প্রশ্ন উত্থাপন না করিয়া মামলায় নিষ্পত্তির এহেনো শেষ পর্যায়ে রুপ দরখাস্ত আনয়ন করা অত্র জারী মোকদ্দমার নিষ্পত্তিতে অযাচিত ও অনভিপ্রেত বিলম্ব ঘটাইবার নামান্তর মাত্র। কেননা ২০০৩ সনের অর্থ ঋণ আদালত আইনের আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠানের সংখ্যায় ডিক্রী দার প্রতিষ্ঠান আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান বলা নিষ্প্রয়োজন এবং ২/৪ ধারার বিধানের আলোকে বাদী ডিক্রী দার প্রতিষ্ঠান একটি আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান হইতেছে।’’<br/><br/>The only question is whether the order as passed by the learned District Judge in a proceeding under Article <em>27 </em>of P.O. 7/1 973 is executable before the Artha Rin Adalat or not.<br/> <br/>In the case as reported in 49 DLR (AD) 80, their Lordships of the Appellate Division have observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"Now it may be considered whether an application to the District Judge under article 27 can be said to be of the same category of a 'suit' or is a special provision made for realisation of loan. A Full Bench of the Bombay High Court in Farkhtmdali vs. VB Potdar AIR 1962 Bombay 162 observed that the word 'suit' is a term of art and ordinarily means a proceeding instituted in the civil Court by presentation of a plaint. It observed further that a proceeding under Section 54 of the Co-operative Societies Act was not a suit. We find ourselves in agreement with the statement of law as above and do not think that there will be two opinions on the point. Applying the said test there cannot be any difficulty in holding that an application under article 27 cannot be equated with a suit, for, in an application under that article none of the requirements as in a suit is attracted. No plaint, no court fee, no limitations, no written statement, no other necessary steps, no decree, nothing, the financial institution will get the relief or reliefs in a summary manner which is not available in the form of a suit. It cannot, therefore, but be said that article 27 is a special provision or procedure for realisation of loan which comes squarely within the proviso to section 5(1) of the Act. And it is well settled that a proviso excepts out of a previous enacting part of a statute something which but for the proviso would have been within the enacting part. The action contemplated under article 27 is, therefore, outside the concept of gvgjv which we have found to correspond with suit as provided in the main part of section 5(1) of the Act."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Their Lordships of the Appellate Division further held, "In view of the said provisions, the position is that a financial institution may institute a suit in connection with realisation of loan in the Artha Rin Adalat under the Act and by reason of the proviso to section 5(1) the special provision or procedure for realisation of loan provided in the law by which the financial institution is established will not be affected. The option is with the financial institution either to bring a suit under section 5(1) of the Act or take recourse to the special procedure provided in the relevant law."<br/> <br/>In the cited case it appears that a proceeding as initiated before the learned   District  Judge under the provision of article 27 of P.O. 7/1973 was transferred to the Artha Rin Adalat and their Lordships observed that the Artha Rin Adalat which has jurisdiction to try a suit and not proceedings under article 27 of the Act.<br/> <br/>In the instant case the order has been passed by the learned District Judge in Miscellaneous Case No.37/1997 as filed under article 27 of P.0.7/1973 which was allowed. Their Lordships of the Appellate Division has observed above that in the said proceeding no plaint is required to be filed, no court fee, no limitation, no written statement, no other necessary steps, no decree, nothing, the financial institution will get the relief or reliefs. That is the order as passed by the learned District Judge in the said Miscellaneous Case is not a decree within the meaning of Section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Even the said proceeding is not a suit. We are of the view that the order as passed by the learned District Judge is not a decree and the same is not executable before the Artha Rin Adalat as the action contemplated under article 27 is, therefore, outside the concept of “gvgjv” as mentioned in the Artha Rin Adalat Ain. In the instant case Bangladesh House Building Finance Corporation took recourse of the special procedure as provided in P.0.7/1973. So it has no option to execute the order taking resort or the provisions of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. The Artha Rin Adalat has acted illegally in entertaining the instant application for execution of the order as passed by the learned District Judge in-Miscellaneous Case. The proceeding as initiated before the Artha Rin Adalat in order to  execute the order as passed  by the learned  District Judge in Miscellaneous Case No. 37/1997 is wholly unlawful. So the entire execution proceeding is liable to be declared to have been made without lawful authority and is of no legal effect. <br/> <br/>Accordingly we find substance in the Rule. <br/> <br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute without any order as to costs. The impugned Order No.40 dated 21.4.2004 as passed by in Title Execution Case No. 83/1998 as pending before the Artha Rin Adalat, Khulna and the entire proceeding of the Execution Case is hereby declared to have been made without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/> <br/>The Artha Rin Adalat, Khulna is directed to transmit the case records to the Court of the learned District Judge, Khulna and the learned District Judge, Khulna is directed to proceed with the matter in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>Communicate this judgment at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Khatian No. 266, S.A. Khatian No.319 by purchase from its owner Ganga Ram Dash and Khoka Ram Dash by registered dead dated 06.04.1955 and having been in possession of the same he was dispossessed from the ‘Ka’ schedule land measuring .93 acre of land under plot No.  2385 of aforesaid khatians in the 1<sup>st</sup> part of Baisakh, 1406 B.S. and thereafter plaintiff asked the defendant to surrender possession of the same in the 1<sup>st</sup> part of 1409 B.S. and being denied filed the above suit under Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877.<br/> <br/>Defendant contested the suit by filing written statement contending inter alia that ‘Ka’ schedule land belonged to plaintiff Samironnessa and she sold the same to Akali Bibi, Afsar Uddin and Azizal Bepari by registered deed dated 16.01.1964 and got possession of the same. Akalibibi afterwards died leaving husband Matiulla, Sons- Afsar and Azizal and they sold the ‘Ka’ scheduled land along with other land in favour of Sahir Uddin, Kabir, Nazrul and Kulsum by registered deed dated 10.01.1980. Kabir transferred .05 acre of land in favour of Jharna Akhtar by heba-bil-awaj deed dated 16.12.1993. Jharna Akhtar transferred the aforesaid purchased land in favour of defendant by registered deed dated 15.11.1995. Kabir Uddin further transferred .07(1/2) acre of land in favour of defendant by registered deed dated 30.11.1994. Sahir Uddin also transferred .09(1/4)+.03 acre of land to the defendant by registered deeds dated 30.11.1994 and 04.12.1995. Najmul Islam transferred .12(1/4) acre of land to the defendant by registered deed dated 30.11.1994. Kulsum Bibi also transferred .06+.06(1/2) acre of land by registered deeds dated 20.01.1994 and 04.12.1995. Defendant have been in possession of his above purchase land along with ‘ka’ schedule land with the knowledge of the plaintiff using as homestead and on cultivation. Plaintiff never possessed the suit land and the suit is fictitious.<br/> <br/>Trial Court, on pleadings, framed the following issues-</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Is the suit maintainable in its’ present form?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Is the suit barred by limitation?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Is the suit properly valued and stamped?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the plaintiff had title and possession to the suit land?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the plaintiff was dispossessed by the defendant?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the plaintiff is entitled to get decree of khash possession?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the plaintiff is entitled to get any other relief?</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In the trial court plaintiff examined P.W. 1 Most. Samironnessa, the plaintiff, P.W. 2 Farid Hossain, P.W. 3 Arman Ali and P.W. 4 Abu Bakar Siddik and produced exhibits 1-3, a registered deed dated 06.04.1955, R.S.  khatian and a rent receipt.<br/> <br/>On the contrary, defendant examined D.W. 1 Abdul Malek, the defendant, D.W. 2 Md. Wares and D.W. 3 Najrul Islam and produced exhibits– ka-jha, different purchase deeds.<br/> <br/>Trial court in consideration of the facts of the pleadings and evidence on record decreed the suit.<br/> <br/>Defendant invoked the revisional jurisdiction against the decree passed by the trial court under section 115(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure before the District Judge. District Judge in his revisional jurisdiction on admission of the application set aside the judgment and decree passed by the trial court and remanded the suit to the trial court for adjudication of issues afresh.<br/> <br/>Plaintiff thus obtained the instant Rule.<br/>Now the pertinent question in the instant Rule involves-</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the District Judge retained the jurisdiction to hear the revisional application against the ‘decree’ passed by the trail court?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether it was justified to set aside the decree without being heard the plaintiff opposite party?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the application under section 9 of Specific Relief Act, 1877 was competent under the facts of possession and dispossession as alleged by the plaintiff?   </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Mrs. Reshma Sultana, the learned Advocate appears on behalf of the petitioner.<br/> <br/>On the otherhand, Mr. Syed Mamoon Mahbub, the learned Advocate appears on behalf of opposite party.<br/> <br/>Both the learned Advocates concede that the impugned judgment is corum-non-judice. Section 115(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure runs thus-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“(2) The court of District Judge may, on the application of any party aggrieved, call for the record of any suit or proceeding, in which <u>an order</u> has been passed by a court of Joint District Judge, Senior Assistant Judge or Assistant Judge from which no appeal lies, and if such Court appears to have committed any error of law resulting in an error in such <u>order</u> occasioning failure of justice, the Court of District Judge may, revise such  <u>order </u>and, make such order as it thinks fit (under line is mine).”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Section 115(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure provides revisonal jurisdiction of the District Judge against ‘<u>an order</u>’ passed by the Joint District Judge, Senior Assistant Judge or Assistant Judge from which no appeal lies’ but not against ‘<u>decree or an order</u>’ as it has been contemplated in section 115(1) of the Code, the application being filed before the High Court Division (under line is mine).<br/><br/>In the instant case the revisional application Under Section 115(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure before the District Judge was filed against the <u>decree</u> passed by the Senior Assistant Judge. Section 115(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure does not confer any revisional jurisdiction to the District Judge against the <u>decree</u> (under line is mine).<br/><br/>The revisional application before the District Judge was thus incompetent and impugned order passed thereby was corum-non-judice.<br/><br/>Trial court passed the order on contest hearing both the parties. It was unwarranted to set aside the decree passed by the trial court without issuing Rule to the plaintiff-opposite party.<br/><br/>On close security of the plaint it appears that the plaintiff filed the suit under section 9 of Specific Relief Act, 1877. It appears from apparent reading of the plaint that the suit was filed beyond the statutory period of limitation. The plaint contains- ‘নালিশের কারন বিবাদী গত <u>১৪০৬ সালের বৈশাখ মাসের ১ম ভাগে</u> জবরানে ও বেআইনীভাবে বাদিনীর স্বত্ব দখলীয় নালিশী (ক) তপশীল বর্নিত জমিতে ইটের প্রাচীর নির্মান পূর্বক বাদিনীকে বেদখল করিলে বাদিনী সর্বশেষ গত <u>১৪০৯ সালের কার্তিক মাসের ১ম ভাগে</u> নালিশী (ক) তপশীল বর্ণিত জমি হইতে বিবাদীকে তাহার নির্মিত প্রাচীর ভংগ করিয়া বাদিনীর বরাবরে দখল ছাড়িয়া দিতে বলিলে বিবাদী তাহা দিতে অস্বীকার করার পর অত্র আদালতের এলাকাধীন নালিশী মৌজায় নালিশের কারন উদ্ভব হইয়াছে (underline is mine)।’<br/><br/>A suit under Section 9 of Specific Relief Act, 1877 is governed by Article 3 of the Limitation Act, 1908.<br/><br/>Apparently the suit as under section 9 of Specific Relief Act, 1877 not being filed within six months from the date of dispossession, the plaint is liable to be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>The suit of the plaintiff thus appears as incompetent under section 9 of Specific Relief Act, 1877.<br/><br/>In view of the discussion made above the Rule bears no substance.<br/><br/>The Rule is, thus discharged.<br/><br/>Plaint is rejected under Section 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.<br/><br/>No order as to costs.<br/><br/>Send down the L.C.

The suit was subsequently renumbered  as  Other Class Suit No. 5 of 2002. The case of the plaintiffs in short is that the suit land originally belonged to Fayezulla and others and it was recorded accordingly in their names in R.S. record of  right,  who sold the suit land to Yusuf Abdul Karim and handed over possession along with all papers of the suit land to Yusuf Abdul Karim and accordingly the suit land has been recorded in his name being P.S. Khatian No. 17; that Yusuf Abdul Karim while in possession orally gifted the suit land to his faithful and dutiful personal driver Md. Abdur Rahman in 1965, who by spending huge money repaired  the building standing on the suit land and extended it by constructing 4 rooms. Later on, Yusuf Abdul Karim by swearing an affidavit on 9.3. 1970 confirmed his oral gift to Md. Abdur Rahman. The present plaintiff-petitioners are the heirs of Abdur Rahman (now deceased) and they  acquired the suit land by inheritance; that Abdur Rahman, the predecessor of the plaintiffs due to his serious illness could not take step for recording the suit land in B.S. record of right. The plaintiff No. 1 ( wife of  Abdur Rahman)  being a women also could not take any appropriate step for recording the suit land in their name though she  learnt from  her close relation that the suit land was recorded in the name of Abdur Rahman and so believing it took no other steps but they have been in possession in the suit land for more than 12 years from the time of their predecessor and  the defendants did not put any obstruction so long in the long possession of the suit land by the plaintiffs; that on 2.3.2000 the plaintiff No.3,  Md. Fakrul Islam learnt from defendant No.2 that the suit land has been recorded in the name of  the defendant No.1 in the B.S. Khatian and so they would be evicted from the suit land and then  the plaintiffs procured a certified copy of the B.S Khatian on 3.4. 2000 from the local revenue office and came to know  about it; that the defendants have got no title, interest and possession in the suit land, who  on the basis of wrong record of right are trying to evict the plaintiffs from the suit land and hence,  the suit. <br/> <br/>The defendant Nos. 1 and 2 contested the suit by filing a joint written statement denying most of the allegations of the plaint and contending, inter-alia, that the suit building is a part of Enesel Manson of  Chattaswrin Road which is the property of  Enesel Textile Mills Limited.  According to the memorandum of articles of Nur Sons Ltd. Yusuf Abdul Karim, Rashid, A. Karim, Hamid A. Karim and M. A. Sattar were shareholder directors of it, who   left this country during liberation war leaving the suit property as uncared  position and thereupon, the Government under the provisions of P.O. 16 of 1972 declared the suit property as abandoned property; that the Government by a circular on 14.12. 1972 handed over  the suit property along with other 18 industries to the defendant No.1,  who took possession therein and accordingly B.S. Khatian in respect of suit property has been recorded in the name of defendant No.1 correctly and the defendant No.1 paid rent to the Government up-to 1406 B.S; that Abdur Rahman was driver of Nur Sons Ltd. and he used to reside in the suit building and after the death of Abdur Rahman  on humanitarian ground the family of Abdur Rahman was permitted to reside therein; that when the defendant Nos.1 and 2 asked the plaintiffs to vacate the suit land  the plaintiffs by creating a false document dated 9.3.1970 instituted the suit falsely and as such  the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>The learned Assistant Judge on the pleadings of the parties framed the following issues for determination:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(i)   Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form and manner?<br/>(ii)  Whether the suit is barred by limitation?<br/>(iii) Whether the suit property is Enesel Textile Mills Ltd.?<br/>(iv) Whether the suit property was rightly declared as an  abandoned property?<br/>(v)  Whether the plaintiff has right, title and possession in the suit land?<br/>(vi) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to get a decree?<br/>(vii) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to get any other relief?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>At the trial plaintiff side examined in all 4 witnesses and defendant side examined in all 5 witnesses and both the parties also exhibited some documents to prove their respective cases. The trial Court on consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case and evidence on record found the claim of the plaintiffs true and decreed the suit as sought for by judgment and decree dated 10.11.2002.<br/> <br/>The defendant Nos.1 and 2,  thereupon,  preferred Other Class Appeal No.552 of 2002 before the learned District Judge, Chittagong challenging the legality of the judgment and decree dated 10.11.2002 which was ultimately heard  by the learned Additional District Judge, 1st Court, Chittagong,  who was pleased to  allow  the appeal and set-aside the judgment and decree dated 10.11.2002 by his judgment and decree dated 30.7.2006 on the ground of maintainability of the suit.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 30.7.2006 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 1st Court, Chittagong in Other Class Appeal No.552 of 2002 the present petitioners have come before this Court and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/>Mr. Zainul Abedin, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners in the course of his argument after placing the judgments of two Courts below, deposition of witnesses and other materials on record submits that the learned Judge of the appellate court below  misconceived the facts of the case and the judgment of the learned Assistant Judge as well and wrongly set-aside the same. He further submits that the learned Joint District Judge erred in law in reversing the judgment of the Trial Court without properly considering the vital aspect  of the case that the suit land as described in the plaint   was  not enlisted as an abandoned property and the case made out by the plaintiff-petitioners and the same has occasioned failure of justice. Finally, Mr. Zainul Abedin with all seriousness    criticized the observation of the appellate Court below that  the appellate Court below as last court of fact, without adverting the material findings of the trial Court and without properly considering the facts of the case and the case made out by the petitioners had abruptly reversed the findings of fact arrived at by the trial Court  on the point of maintainability of the suit in a summary manner and the same has occasioned failure of justice.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Advocate appearing for the defendant-opposite parties, on the other hand, submits that the original owner of the suit property Yusuf Abdul Karim left Bangladesh before liberation leaving the suit property with uncared  condition and   after liberation the property in question was found abandoned inasmuch as the whereabouts of the  owner of the suit property, Yusuf Abdul Karim was  not known to the Government and so it was taken over by the Government declaring  as an abandoned property and thereafter, the Government transferred the suit property by a registered deed of sale dated 4.10.1980 to Sena Kallyan Sangstha. Mr. Mahbubey Alam further submits that it is apparent from the record that  the property in question transferred by the Government to Sena Kallyan Sangstha in 1980 and long  twenty years after the heirs of Abdur Rahman filed the instant suit claiming the property on the basis of a plea of  oral gift without any legal basis whatsoever.<br/> <br/>Referring  to the affidavit dated 9.3.1970 Mr. Mahbubey Alam submits that it is  the positive case of the plaintiff-petitioners that Yusuf Abdul Karim by swearing an affidavit on 9.3. 1970 confirmed his oral gift to Md. Abdur Rahman (now deceased), the predecessor of the petitioners which appears to be a forged  document inasmuch as the alleged affidavit dated 9.3. 1970 clearly shows that stamp purchased in the name of  Guru Mia on 20.10.1962  and the same has been done by small letter in a congested manner to complete the document in one page by forging the signature of Yusuf Abdul Karim.  He further submits that there is nothing on record to suggest that the so-called oral gift was all acted upon inasmuch as admittedly the plaintiffs or their  predecessor,  Abdur Rahman neither did pay any rent to the Government nor took any attempt for mutating their name over a period of 30 years and in that view of the matter the learned Additional District Judge was perfectly justified in reversing the judgment and decree of the trail Court on the clear finding that the suit is an abandoned property  and as such the suit is  not maintainable. Mr. Mahbubey Alam further submits that the Government of People's Republic of Bangladesh has transferred Plot Nos.11,13 and 17 of Mouza-Joypahar to Sena Kallyan Sangstha on 4.10.1980 by a registered deed treating the same as abandoned property whereas the plaintiffs produced alleged deed of gift claiming the ownership in P.S Plot No. 21  without having any valid document whatsoever and the appellate Court below  after discussion of evidence on record has rightly come to the conclusion that the  trial Court committed wrong in decreeing the suit.<br/> <br/>Finally, Mr. Mahbubey Alam points out that PW-1, Md. Fakhrul Islam,  son of Abdur Rahman in his cross-examination admitted that P.S. Plot No.21 corresponds  to B.S. Plot No.17 and since Sena Kallyan Sangstha purchased Plot No.17  in the year 1980 and thus,  the  claim of the plaintiff-petitioners that holding No.281  does not correspond to the suit land is not at all relevant for deciding the instant suit.<br/> <br/>Ms. Sadia Arman, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners to refute the argument of Mr. Mahbubey Alam that the appellate court  below committed no wrong in holding that the suit is not maintainable   upon referring  to the order of the trial Court dated 4.6.2002 submits that after filing written statement the defendant-opposite parties filed an application under Order 7, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the plaint on 4.6.2002  on the ground that the suit is not maintainable as the suit property is an abandoned property, the trial court below rejected the said application against which the defendants did not prefer any appeal or revision. Ms. Sadia Arman, thereafter, upon   referring  to the schedule of the plaint and  gazette notification submits that the land in question mentioned in the gazette notification is not the suit and there is nothing on record to show that the Government formed an opinion as to why the suit land should be declared abandoned property and in that view of the matter the findings of the appellate Court below on the point of maintainability is perverse being contrary to law, evidence and materials on record.<br/> <br/>I have heard the learned Advocates of both the sides and perused the record including the plaint, the deposition of the witnesses and the impugned judgment as well as judgment of the trial Court.  Now, to deal with the contentions raised by the  learned Advocates for the respective parties it would be convenient for me  to decide first of all the maintainability of the suit.<br/> <br/>On perusal of the record, it appears that the petitioners   as plaintiff instituted Other Class Suit No.68 of 2000  in the Court of Joint District Judge, Commercial Court No.2, Chittagong for declaration of title and confirmation of possession in the suit land measuring  4 gandas of land along with further declaration that the suit land is not an abandoned property and the B.S. record of right in respect of the suit land is wrong.  It further appears that the defendant-opposite parties after filing written statement filed an application under Order 7, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the plaint on 4.6.2002 stating that: বিবাদী তাহার লিখিত বর্ননায় নালিশী সম্পত্তি পরিত্যওু সম্পত্তি হয় ও অত্র মোকদ্দমা পি, ও, ১৭/৭২ মতে বারিত বলিয়া আপত্তি উথুাপন করে। ......এমতাবস্থায় পরিস্থিতিতে অন্যান্য  issue শুনানীর জন্য গৃহীত হওয়ার পূর্বে মোকদ্দমায় রক্ষনীয়তা সম্পর্কে  issue  পূর্বে শুনানীর জন্য গ্রহন করা প্রয়োজন। অন্যথায় বিবাদীর সমুহ ক্ষতি হইবে। The trial Court below upon hearing the said application by its order No. 51 dated 4.6.2002 rejected the application and admittedly the defendant-opposite parties did not prefer any appeal or revision against that order dated 4.6.2002.<br/> <br/>At the trial both the parties led evidence to prove their respective cases. The Trial Court after closing of the evidence and hearing argument of the parties decreed the suit, holding that the plaintiff- petitioners have been able to prove unbroken possession in the suit property for the last  36/37  years and the suit is not barred by any law.  In appeal, the learned Joint District Judge, Commercial Court No.2, Chittagong by the impugned judgment and decree dated 30.7.2006 set-aside the judgment and decree dated 10.11.2002  mainly on 3 (three)  counts that : (i) the suit itself is not maintainable as the suit land is an abandoned property  (ii) the plaintiffs could not prove their oral gift as well as affidavit with regard to declaration of oral gift and (iii) the plaintiffs did not pay any rent, tax and bill to the Government in respect of the suit land over a period of 32 years i.e. 1970-2002.<br/> <br/>Now, to justify the finding of the Court of appeal below  that the suit  itself is not maintainable since the suit property is an abandoned property, I  feel it  necessary  to quote hereunder the schedule of the plaint for having a better view of the dispute in question which reads as follows:<br/><u>Schedule to the plaint.</u></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>            জেলা- চট্রগ্রাম, থানা- কোতয়ালী, মৌজা- জয়পাহাড়, আর, এস, খতিয়ান নং- ৩২ এর অধীনে আর, এস ১৫ দাগের অন্দর ও তৎসামিলের পি, এস, খতিয়ান নং- ৯৭ এর অধীনে পি, এস, ২১ নং দাগের অন্দর তৎসামিলে বি, এস, খতিয়ানে নং- ৩৬ এর অধীনে বি, এস, দাগ নং- ১৭ এর ২০১২ শতক ভূমির অন্দর ৮০০ শতক বা ৪(চার) গন্ডা ভূমি অতিদসিহত তদসিহত সেমি পাকা দালানগৃহ ও খালি জায়গাসহ চিহিুত মতে দখলীয় বটে।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">            চক নং- উত্তরে ইউছুপ আব্দুল করিম এর অবশিষ্ট জায়গা, দক্ষিনে- এন, জি, মোবারক ও ডাঃ তৌহিদুল আলম, পূর্বে- সিটি কর্পোরেশনের ড্রেন, পশ্চিমে- জনসাধারনের জন্য সিটি কর্পোরেশনের পথ।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Ms. Sadia Arman, the learned Advocate upon referring Ext.5,  tax receipt  submits that the suit property as described in the plaint is not an abandoned property inasmuch as  the property in question as described in Bangladesh Gazette dated 23.9.1986 does  not suggest that the suit property is an abandoned property whatsoever. She adds that Ext.5 tax receipt of City Corporation clearly shows that holding No.1380/1503 is the suit property belonged to the plaintiff-petitioners.<br/> <br/>In order to consider whether the suit property  as descried in  schedule of the plaint let me quote the property in question as described in Bangladesh Gazette dated 23.9.1986 which runs  as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>ক্রমিক নং- ৮৬                     </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 160px;">হোল্ডিং নং ৮৩৫/৯৩৭, বাগমনিরাম (আলফরিদ চেম্বার) ২৮১, চট্বেশ্বরী রোড, চট্রগ্রাম।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On comparison  of the above schedule of the plaint, Ext.5, tax receipt of City Corporation  and the holding of the property in question as described in Bangladesh Gazette dated 23.9.1986 it appears to me that the suit property as described in the plaint and Ext.5   and the property in question as described in the list of the abandoned property of Bangladesh Gazette dated 23.9.1986 are not same and similar. Therefore, I find no difficulty whatever in holding that the Court of appeal  below was plainly wrong in setting-aside the judgment and decree of the trial court on the ground that the suit was not maintainable since  the suit property enlisted as  an abandoned property. My view is, therefore, that  the  finding of  the Court of appeal  below is a product of non application of judicial mind and suffers from patent illegality.<br/> <br/>Having realized the difficulty,  Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Advocate at the fag end of the hearing  upon placing an application under Order 41,  Rule 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure for allowing the opposite parties to adduce additional evidence submits that after commencement of hearing of the instant case Sena Kallyan Sangstha on search found the original copy of the registered sale deed dated 04.10.1980 and  the main question now raised before this Court is as to whether the land mentioned in the gazette notification is the suit land or not and for determination of the said issue the sale deed dated 04.10.1980 is required to be admitted as additional evidence.<br/> <br/>On the contrary, Ms. Sadia Arman, the learned Advocate submits that the revisional court may in appropriate  cases consider additional evidence,  but in the instant case the suit land of the plaintiffs is not abandoned for the allowing reasons:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(a) The plaintiff petitioners are citizens of Bangladesh who came into ownership and possession of the suit land before the PO 16 of 1972 was passed.<br/>(b) The Government formed no opinion as to why the suit land should be declared abandoned.<br/>(c) There is no clear order declaring the suit land as abandoned property.<br/>d) There is no demarcation or description of the property that has been declared to be abandoned on any of the documents produced by the defendants.<br/>(e) Although the documents mention Enesel (N.S.L.) Mansion as abandoned, there is no evidence to show that the suit land was ever a part of Enesel Mansion.<br/>f) The plaintiff petitioners received no notification from the Government that the suit land has been declared abandoned and, for these reasons it is needless to admit the sale deed dated 04.10.1980 as additional evidence.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Ms. Sadia Arman has also emphatically urged another aspect before me that the  deed dated 09.03. 1970 is more than 30 years old and therefore the Court is entitled to presume that it is a genuine document. More so, under Muslim law, the gift has been made beyond recall, and there was no need to register the gift under the law of those times, when registration was not mandatory as it is today. The learned Advocate also forcefully agitated that even if the said Deed is defective and unregistered, the plaintiffs have been in possession beyond the statutory period of limitation to the complete ouster of the defendants and thus their imperfect title has been perfected by the passage of time.<br/> <br/>To this,  Mr. Mahbubey Alam, upon referring a decision reported in  51 DLR (AD) 141 submits that since the document was executed on 04.10.1980 and in the meantime 30(thirty) years time has been passed this Court can admit the same into evidence under Section 90 of the Evidence Act, considering the fact that same was executed on behalf of the president in favour of a statutory organization. He further contends to create an  ambiguity regarding identification of the suit land the plaintiffs are  now submitting  before this Court for the first time that the suit plot has not been made an abundant property though it is apparent from the record that the suit Plot No. 21 was recorded as B.S Plot No.17 which includes land of some other plots showing an area of .2018 acre which has been recorded in the name of Sena Kallyan Sangstha and sale deed dated 04.10.1980 clearly shows the sale of Plot No. 17 along with other plots of Mouza Joypahar and it has been  mentioned in the schedule of the plaint B.S. plot No. 17 with an area of .2012 acre which clearly corresponds to the sale deed dated 04.10.1980 and exhibit Kha B.S. Khatian of B.S. plot No. 17 and as such to resolve the dispute whether the land mentioned in the gazette notification is the suit land or not and for determination of the said issue the sale deed dated 04.10.1980 is required to be admitted as additional evidence.<br/> <br/>Finally,  Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Advocate submits that the trial Court below decreed the suit on the finding that the enlistment of the suit property in the list of the abandoned property was illegal and defective and the plaintiffs  against that  finding did not file any revision or appeal before the higher Court and  now, it does not lie in the mouth of the plaintiffs  that the suit property has been enlisted as an abandoned property.<br/> <br/>In reply, Ms. Sadia Arman submits that  in the facts and circumstance of the case the application under Order 41,  Rule 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure filed by the defendant-opposite parties  is plainly misconceived and not tenable in law inasmuch as the defendant-opposite parties had ample opportunity to produce the so-called deed at the trial stage, or even at the appellate stage, and make it an exhibit, but they did not produce any such document and as such they cannot be allowed to produce such document before this Revisional Court.  She further contends  that the defendant-opposite parties did not even produce their deed when the instant  Civil revision was filed, six years ago in 2006 and the opposite parties with the sole purpose of delaying the judgment and defeating the ends of justice have produced such document at the judgment stage when all submissions have already been made.<br/> <br/>It appears that  the trail Court  after discussion of evidence on record has come to the conclusion that admittedly the plaintiffs as successor of Abdur  Rahman are in possession of the suit land over a period of 36/37 years and the suit is not  barred by any law and as such the plaintiff are entitled to get decree, as prayer for. In coming to this conclusion the trial Court has noticed that the suit property has not been specifically mentioned  in exhibit-ka (gazette of the abandoned property).<br/> <br/>On a query by me  Ms. Sadia Arman admits that  the trial court below committed wrong in observing that the suit property was illegally included in the list of abandoned property. She next submits that from the materials on record it appears that the materials on record justify the judgment and decree of the trial court but the appellate court below without adverting any of the material findings of the trial Court abruptly in a sleep-short manner set-aside judgment of the trial court and the same has occasioned failure of justice.<br/> <br/>Ms. Sadia Arman further submits that the so-called deed of the opposite parties does not show anywhere that any land answering to the description of the suit land was transferred by the Government, either with reference to the holding number, or by any other reference and therefore the photocopy of the purported deed is quite redundant to prove any point. The other point agitated by Ms. Sadia Arman  that there is no reason to send the case back on remand to the lower appellate Court since evidence on all material points are there on record. Ms. Sadia Arman   to fortify her lengthy argument has relied on the decisions  reported in 27 DLR (1975) 170, 40 DLR (AD) 116, 28 DLR (1976) 27, 5 BLC (AD) 76, AIR(33) 1946 Allahabad 389, 8 BLT (AD) 185, 3 BLT 245, PLD 1952 Lahore 545, 10 DLR (WP) 14 = PLD 1957 Labore 574, AIR 1956 (Andhra) 250,  AIR 1957 ( Nagpur )15, 53 DLR (AD) 110, AIR 1991 Supreme Court 2027 (Para 2), AIR 1956 (Andhra) 250,  AIR ( 33) 1946 (Allahabad) 389, 7 BLT (1999)195.<br/> <br/>On a close perusal of the entire evidence and materials on record, it appears that the plaintiff-petitioners  for the first time raised before this Court as to whether the land mentioned in the gazette notification is the suit land or not. It further appears that DW1,  deposed on behalf of the Sena Kalyan Sangstha who  filed a photocopy of the aforesaid deed and stated as follows: "বাংলাদেশ সরকার কর্তৃক সেনা কল্যান সংস্থাকে প্রদত্ত নালিশী সম্পত্তি সংত্রুামত original deed Hl photocopy জমা দিলাম। But the same was not marked as Exhibit.  It also appears that defendant, Sena Kalyan Sangstha  stated in  its written statement that "" সরকার ৪/১০/১৯৮০ ও ৩২১৯৮ নং দলিল মূলে এনিসেল ম্যানসেনে তথা মিউনিসিপ্যাল হোল্ডিং নং ২৮১ এবং ১০২৫ আর, এস ১৭/৪৬/১১৯/১২০ খতিয়ানের জমি ও গৃহে সার্ভেন্ট কোয়ার্টার, দারোয়ান কোয়াটার ও ড্রাইভার কোয়ার্টার সহ সেনা কল্যান সংসহার বরাবরে হসতামতর করে।''<br/> <br/>It is also found  that  the Government of Bangladesh being defendant No.3 in the suit did not appear and contest the suit claiming the suit property as abandoned property by producing any paper. Furthermore, the admitted evidence  on record both oral and documentary suggests that the  suit land has a distinct holding number and there is  no demarcation or description of the suit land as described in the plaint  has been declared  to be an  abandoned  property.<br/> <br/>On perusal of the judgment of the appellate  Court and trial Court below as well it appears that trial Court had considered the material evidence in detail in coming to its finding of title and possession in favour of the plaintiffs, but the appellate Court, without discussing the evidence, had abruptly reversed the findings of fact arrived at by the trial Court  on the point of maintainability of the suit. Thus it appears that the impugned   judgment of the appellate Court was not a proper judgment of reversal.<br/> <br/>In view of all the facts noticed above I am of the view that the case should be decided by taking into consideration the case of the plaintiffs and defendants  as well and for the said purpose the defendant, Sena Kalyan Sangstha will be permitted to exhibit  registered deed dated 4.10.1980 in accordance  with law for determining the real question in controversy.  The Court of appeal below shall consider all aspects of the case and decide the appeal afresh. Since the defendant opposite parties are themselves to blame for their predicament but now they are getting a favourable order, they should bear the cost of the plaintiffs in the case.<br/> <br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute. The impugned judgment and decree dated 30.7.2006 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 1st Court, Chittagong in Other Class Appeal No.552 of 2002 is set-aside and the case is remanded to the appellate court for deciding the appeal afresh in the light of the observation made above.<br/> <br/>However, in the facts and circumstance of the case the defendant opposite party No.1, Sena Kallyan Sangstha is restrained by an order of injunction not to disturb with the peaceful possession of the plaintiff-petitioners in any manner till disposal of the appeal.<br/> <br/>Let a copy of this judgment along with the lower Court's record be sent down at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
