Abu Zafor Siddique, J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This Jail Appeal is directed against the judgment and order of conviction and sentenced dated 14.02.2006 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Comilla in Sessions Trial Case No.99 of 2005 arising out of Kotwali Police Station Case No.12 dated 05.01.2005, corresponding to G.R. No.11 of 2005 convicting the accused-appellant under section 302 of the Penal Code and sentencing him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life and pay a fine of Tk.20,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 1(one) year more.<br/><br/>The prosecution case, in short, is that the informant, having his posting at Sadar Traffic of Comilla District Town, was duty on 05.01.2005 at 14.00 to 18.00 hours along with traffic constable Selim, when on duty constable Selim cried out for help. At that time, the infor-mant saw a man running away with a knife in his hand and he also found constable Selim with stab injury on his abdomen, chest and head and the informant then took step to take Selim to the Sadar hospital. Police Sergeant Mahmudul Hasan followed the informant to the hospital. The victim was provided primary treatment and sent to Comilla Medical College Hospital for better treatment, but the victim Selim died at 18.15 hours.<br/><br/>Sergeant Mahamudul Hasan informed the matter to the higher authority and all concerned and came to know that the assailant was a rickshaw puller. The police arrested him and on interrogation, the accused confessed his guilt and disclosed his name as Abu Bakar Siddique alias Badal S/O A. Rashid of Village Siramgari, under P.S. Lalpur of District Nator. Thereafter the informant lodged the ejahar.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Humayan Kabir, Sub-Inspector of Police, Kotwaly Police Station, Comilla, investigated the case. During investigation, he visited the place of occurrence, prepared sketch map along with index and recorded statements of the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The investigating officer prepared inquest report and arrangement for post mortem of the deceased. Thereafter he also made arrangement for recording the confessional statement of the accused before the learned Magistrate, Ist Class, Comilla under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. After investigation, having found prima-facie case, he submitted charge-sheet under section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>After investigation, the case record was transmitted to the learned Sessions Judge, Comilla and it was registered as Sessions Trial Case No.99 of 2005 thereafter, cognizance was taken and charge was framed against the convict-appellant under section 302 of the Penal Code and the same was read over and explained to him and the accused pleaded not guilty and he prayed to be tried in accordance with law.<br/><br/>During trial, the prosecution examined as many as 12 witnesses out of 17 cited witnesses in the charge-sheet, but the defence examined none.<br/><br/>The defence case, as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, is that the appellant is completely innocent and he has been falsely implicated in the case out of enmity and no murder had been committed by the accused-person.<br/><br/>After conclusion of the hearing of both parties and on consideration of the evidence and the materials on record and in view of the facts and circumstances of the case the learned Sessions Judge, Comilla came to the finding that the prosecution proved the charge beyond all reasonable doubt and accordingly, the Court below convicted the accused.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence, the convict-appellant preferred the instant jail appeal through Comilla Jail authority for setting aside the judgment and order dated 14.02.2006 passed by the Court below.<br/><br/>Mrs. Hasna Begum, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that the learned Sessions Judge, Comilla has misread the evidence and misinterpreted the law and thus passed the judgment and order of conviction which is not tenable in the eye of law. She has further submitted that the prosecution has miserable failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, since there is no eye witness to the occurrence. Moreover, the convict-appellant had no pre-plan to commit alleged murder. She has further submitted that the convict-appellant had no intention to kill the deceased Selim. As such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>On the other hand Mr. Md. Fazlur Rahman Khan, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the State, has supported the impugned judgment passed by the trial Court and submits that the prosecution by producing sufficient evidence has been able to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubt. He further submitted that the convict-appellant made a confessional statement before the Magistrate under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and as such, there is nothing to be interfered by this Court and accordingly, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>We have heard the submission of both the sides and perused the impugned judgment of the trial Court and materials on record including the evidence adduced by the prosecution. For proper appreciation, the evidence is briefly discussed bellow.<br/><br/>P.W.1, Moin Uddin, constable of police, supported the prosecution case.

On the evidence on record of the prosecution witnesses, it apparent that there is no pre-plan by the convict-appellant to murder of the traffic police. Rather, as evident from the statement made by the appellant himself under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class, Comilla, the appellant was facing extreme mental pressure for the reason that- “গত কাল ৫/১/২০০৫ তারিখ সকাল ১১.০০ টার দিকে কান্দিরপাড় লিবার্ঢি~ সিনেমার সামনে ট্রাফিক মোড়ে ট্রাফিক সেলিম আমাকে লাঠি দিয়ে কয়েকটা বারি মারে এবং আমার রিক্সার চাকার সব ¯Œzd ভেংগে ফেলে, তার মার খেয়ে আমার সহ্য হয় নাই।”<br/><br/>From the above circumstances, it is abundantly clear that there was no pre-plan to commit the murder. Therefore, the offence would not fall within the purview of section 302 of the Penal Code; rather all the elements are present in the instant case to indicate that the offence would attract the exception as laid down in section 300 of the Penal Code, and accordingly, the appellant would be guilty of the murder under part-II of section 304 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>Having regards to the facts and circumstances of the case and the statement made by the appellant under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, we are inclined to hold that the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 14.02.2006, so far as it relates to the sentence, is liable to be interfered.<br/><br/>We have also taken note of the fact that at the relevant time, the appellant was only 35 years. By this time, a period of 8 years has elapsed and during this enter period from the date of his arrest i.e. on and from 06.01.2005, he has been in custody till date.<br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed in part.<br/><br/>The impugned judgment and order dated 14.02.2006, so far as it relates to the conviction of accused, is upheld.<br/><br/>However, the conviction under section 302 of the Penal Code is hereby altered to one under Part-II of section 304 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>Therefore, the sentence of imprisonment for life is reduced to a period of 10(ten) years that the appellant has already served as per Jail Code.<br/><br/>The imposition of the fine of taka 20,000/- in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonnment for 1(one) year is hereby waived.<br/><br/>The appellant Abu Bakkor Siddique alias Badal, son of Abdur Rashid be set at liberty forthwith, if not wanted in connected with any other case.<br/><br/>The office is directed to send down the lawyer court records along with a copy of the judgment at once.    <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
