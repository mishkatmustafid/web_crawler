Case No. 11 of 2007 under order 39, Rule 2(3) CPC rejecting the application under Order VII, Rule n of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/>Relevant fact leading to the filing of the present Civil Revision under section 115(4) CPC is that while the Violation Misc. Case No. 11 of 2007 was in progress the defendant-petitioner filed an application under Order VII, Rule 11 read with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the violation misc. case before the learned Assistant Judge, Hijla, Barisal.<br/> <br/>The learned Assistant Judge, Barisal upon hearing the parties by his order No. 162 dated 29.10.2009 rejected the application on the finding that the violation misc. case is a Quashi Criminal Case in which the defendant Nos. 3-4 could not show anything that the violation case is barred by limitation.<br/> <br/>In Revision, the learned Additional District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Barisal by the impugned judgment and order dated 12.5.2010 disallowed the Revision and affirmed the order dated 29.10.2009 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Hijla, Barisal on the main finding that in a violation misc. case the application under Order VII, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not lie.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Harunur Rashid, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners submits that both the Courts below erred in law in rejecting the application under Order VII, Rule n read with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the Violation Misc. Case No. 11 of 2007 without properly considering the facts of the case and  the  case  made  out  by  the  petitioners  and  the  same  has occasioned failure of justice.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate for the petitioners has placed before me the application under Order VII, Rule 11 read with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the Violation Misc. Case No. 11 of 2007 and the impugned judgment as well as order of the trial Court below.<br/> <br/>On perusal of the impugned judgment it is found that the learned Additional District Judge on the facts of the case and on consideration of the legal position rejected the Civil Revision on the finding that: সার্বিক বিচারে দেখা যায় মিস মামলাটি আরজীভুক্ত নহে বা মূল মামলার (Original suit) নহে। এই অজুহাতে বিজ্ঞ নিম্ন আদালত আরজী প্রত্যাখানের দরখাস্ত খারিজ করেন নাই। আইনতঃ মিস Violation মোকদ্দমা কোন আরজী বা Original suit গন্য না হওয়ায়, দেওয়ানী কার্যবিধির ৭ আদেশের ১১ (এ) (বি) (সি) (ডি) ধারা প্রযোজ্য নহে। উক্ত কারনে বিজ্ঞ নিম্ন আদালতরে বিগত ২৯-১০-০৮ তারিখর নামঞ্জুর আদেশ যুক্তিযুক্ত হওয়ায় এবং জ্জ নং বিবাদী রিভিশনকারী যেন-তেন প্রকার শিস Violation মামলা যাহা একটি Quaci-Criminal in nature এর মামলা গোড়ায় নষ্ট করার জন্য আনায়ন করেন। তৎ কারনে জ্জ নং বিবাদী রিভিশনকারী তার রিভিশন মোকদ্দমাটি সাফল্যজনক ভাবে প্রমানিত না করায়, প্রার্থীত প্রতিকার পেতে হকদার নহে।<br/> <br/>On going through the findings of the Revisional Court below, I do not find any reason to differ with the view taken by the Revisional Court below. I fully endorse the above views. <strong>The application under order 39, Rule 2(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure can never be termed as a plaint.   No application under order VII, Rule II CPC lies in violation Miscellaneous case under order 39, Rule </strong>2(3) <strong>of the Code of Civil Procedure.</strong><br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Harunur Rashid, the learned Advocate could not show any error of law or infirmity in the impugned judgments or findings of the courts below are either arbitrary or fanciful or findings of the Courts below are perverse being contrary to law and fact. The application under section under Order VII, Rule 11 read with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the Violation Misc. Case No. 11 of 2007 is found to have been rightly rejected. I, therefore, find no ground for interference.<br/> <br/>For the forgoing reasons, the revisional application is rejected summarily.<br/> <br/>Let this order be communicated to the Courts concerned at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Ruhul Quddus, J:</u></em></strong></span><br/> <br/>This appeal under section 196D of the Customs Act, 1969 at the instance of Bureau Veritas Bangladesh Ltd., a Pre-shipment Inspection Agent, has been preferred against judgment and order dated 08.07.2008 passed by the Customs, Excise and VAT Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka in an appeal being No. CEVT/Case/(Cus)-416/2003 dismissing the same and thereby affirming order No. 252 dated 01.04.2003 passed by the Commissioner of Customs, Chittagong.<br/> <br/>Facts giving rise to the appeal, in brief, are that the proforma-respondent M/S Dysin Chemical Ltd. imported some finishing agent for textile industries from Taiwan. The appel-lant, a pre-shipment inspection agent, after holding inspection issued clean report of findings (CRF) certificate being No. BDH 2002 12796 IC dated 14.10.2002 certifying the goods to have been fallen under H.S. Code No. 3809.91.00.<br/> <br/>On submission of bill of entry (being No.C 1442 dated 29.10.2002) for releasing the goods, the Customs authority raised objection regarding its H. S. Code taking the plea that the commercial description of the goods was ‘acrylic polymer in primary form’ classified actually under H. S. Code No.3906.90.00. Subsequently the Customs authority issued notice dated 12.01.2003 asking the appellant to show cause as to why action should not be taken against it for certifying wrong H. S. Code against the imported goods causing loss of revenue to the Government. The appellant by letter dated 26.01.2003 replied the notice asserting that the CRF certificate and the H. S. Code mentioned therein were correct. The said reply was accompanied by a chemical analysis report showing that the ingredients of the imported goods were of finishing agent for textile industries.<br/> <br/>On receipt of the reply and after hearing the parties, the Commissioner of Customs, Chittagong passd order No.252 dated 01.04.2003 imposing penalty of Taka 1,00,000/= (one lac) only to be paid by the pre-shipment inspection agent (herein appellant) purportedly under article 10 (2) (3) of the Pre-shipment Inspection Order, 1999. The Commissioner of Customs passed the order mainly on the reason of wrong quoting of H.S. Code against the imported goods.<br/> <br/>The appellant preferred an appeal being No. CEVT/Case/(Cus)- 416/2003 before the Customs, Excise and VAT Tribunal, Dhaka under section 196A of the Customs Act challe-nging the aforesaid order dated 01.04.2003. The Appellate Tribunal after hearing the parties dismissed the appeal and thereby affirmed the original order by its judgment and order dated 08.07.2008, which is impugned herein.<br/> <br/>Mr. M. A. Azim Khair, learned Advocate appearing for the appellant submits that the Customs authority without holding any chemical examination or laboratory test held that the imported goods in question was acrylic polymer and fell under H. S. Code No.3906.90.00, which was absolutely wrong. Although the Customs authority served a show cause notice, passed the impugned order without considering the reply dated 26.01.2003 made by the appellant and the chemical analyses report attached therewith. Moreover, the allegation that the commercial description of the imported goods was of acrylic polymer does not lend support from the First Schedule of the Customs Act as well as the relevant column of the CRF certificate.<br/> <br/>On the other hand Mr. Gautam Kumar Roy, learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the respondent submits that the Appellate Tribunal as well as the Commissioner of Customs in passing their respective orders considered the documents available on records. There is no illegality in the impugned orders which can be interfered with by this Court sitting in virtually a second appeal.<br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates and gone through the records. The goods in question have been described in clause 12, items 3 and 4 of the CRF certificate. For better appreciation, the relevant portion of the certificate relating to descriptions of the goods are quoted below:<br/> </div><table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="height:1223px; width:420px"><tbody><tr><td colspan="7" style="height: 16px; width: 420px;"><em>12.

Due to arrear of rents, a certificate case was initiated in respect of the <em>Ka </em>scheduled land and ultimately it was sold in auction to Bimala Bala Nath in an execution case on 11.5.1962. The sale was confirmed by issuing a <em>boynama </em>in her name and she went in possession thereof. Bimala Bala Nath had entered into an agreement for sale with the plaintiffs on 24.7.1973 and inducted them into possession thereof on receipt of earnest money. The <em>Kha </em>scheduled land was still under control and possession of its original owners Kalipada Nath and Sudhir Kumar Nath, who also entered into an agreement for sale with the plaintiffs and on receipt of earnest money, inducted them into possession thereof on 8th Sraban, 1380 B.S. Two sale deeds were accordingly executed on 7.3.1975 and 13.3.1975 and were registered on 15.3.1975 on payment of the balance consideration money. Since then the plaintiffs were in peaceful possession and enjoyment of the suit land by residing at the reconstructed house in <em>Ka </em>schedule land and performing rituality and worshiping in a temple at <em>Kha </em>schedule land. All on a sudden the vested property authority served them a notice on 6.9.1976 to surrender possession of the suit land claiming it to be a vested property, thus the cause of action for the suit.<br/><br/>The defendant-opposite parties contested the suit by filling a written statement denying the material facts of the plaint contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the S. A. recorded tenants Kalipada Nath and Sudhir Kumar Nath had left the country before 1965. Accordingly the land was treated initially as enemy property and thereafter vested and nonresident property. Bimala Bala Nath or Kalipada Nath and Sudhir Kumar Nath did not transfer any land to the plaintiffs and the sale deeds produced by them were forged. They had no lawful possession in the suit land and that the suit was not maintainable.<br/><br/>On the aforesaid pleadings the trial Court framed issues, namely, whether the suit was maintainable in its form; whether it was barred by limitation; whether the plaintiffs had any right, title and possession over the suit land; and whether they were entitled to get any relief as prayed for.<br/><br/>In order to prove their case the plaintiffs examined three witnesses including plaintiff No.1 Samir Kumar Nath as P.W.1 and two deed writers, namely, Bhabesh Banarjee (P.W.2) and Elahi Box (P.W.3), who scribed the agreements and sale deeds respectively. P.W.1 adduced in evidence two sale agreements as exhibits-1 and 1(a); two sale deeds as exhibits- 2 and 2(a); two S. A. khatians in names of the original owners Kalipada Nath and Sudhir Kumar Nath as exhibits-3, 3(a) and certified copy of <em>boynama </em>in their vendor’s (Bimala Bala Nath’s) name as exhibit-4.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Government-defendants examined only one witness Atiar Rahman, an Office Assistant of the office of vested property, Jessore as D.W.1, who did not adduce any documentary evidence. He admitted the plaintiffs’ possession in the suit land, but termed it illegal.<br/><br/>After conclusion of the trial, learned Assistant Judge dismissed the suit by judgment and decree dated 28.6.1989, against which the plaintiffs preferred Title Appeal No. 257 of 1989 in the Court of District Judge, Jessore. Ultimately the Subordinate Judge (Artha Rin), Jessore heard the appeal and dismissed the same by judgment and decree dated 14.10.1993. Being aggrieved the plaintiff-appellants moved in this Court with the present civil revision and obtained the Rule with an order of <em>status quo</em>. During pendency of the Rule, petitioners 1 and 6 died and their legal heirs were substituted.<br/><br/>Mr. Bivash Chandra Biswas, learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners submits that in a suit for perpetual injunction, possession is the paramount consideration. In the present case, the plaintiffs’ claim of title is backed by two registered sale deeds by which they have been able to prove their prima facie title to the suit land. Admittedly they were in possession of the suit land, but the Courts below without considering the basic legal requirements in a suit for perpetual injunction unnecessarily traveled into their title with adverse remark and thereby committed error of law resulting in an error in decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/><br/>In support of his contention Mr. Biswas refers to the case of Satish Chandra Barua Vs. Samir Kanti Barua and others, 19 BLD (HCD) 609 and Manindra Nath Sen Sarma Vs. Bangladesh, 1984 BLD (AD) 285.<br/>Mr. Goutam Kumar Roy, learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the opposite parties at the very outset submits that the present civil revision is related to a vested property and has therefore abated under section 13 of the অর্পিত সম্পত্তি প্রত্যার্পন আইন, ২০০১ (in brief ‘the Ain’). With reference to the written statement, he submits that when the defendants had denied the material fact relating to cause of action in their written statement, it was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to produce and prove the notice, which was allegedly served upon them claiming the suit land to be a vested property, but they hopelessly failed to do it, and therefore, no cause of action was proved. Learned Deputy Attorney General finally submits that even if the notice was served upon them, it was served by the vested property authority while performing public duties and therefore, injunction cannot be granted as it is barred by section 56 (d) of the Specific Relief Act.<br/><br/>In support of his contention learned Deputy Attorney General refers to the case of Barada Sundari Paul and others Vs. The Assistant Custodian, Enemy Property (Land and Buildings), Comilla and others, 15 BLD (AD) 95.<br/><br/>In reply, Mr. Biswas submits that service of notice upon the plaintiffs by the vested property authority having not been specifically denied, it cannot be said that the cause of action was not proved, especially when specific pleading was made and oral evidence was led by P.W.1 to that effect. In response to a query by the Court, Mr. Biswas apprises that the suit land has been enlisted in official gazette as a vested property, but fails to produce the gazette notification.<br/><br/>I have gone through the records, judgments of the Courts below and the decisions cited. In 19 BLD (HCD) 608 a suit for perpetual injunction was instituted on simple threat of eviction. Subsequently the defendant in his written statement raised conflicting claims of title and possession over the suit land. During the trial, ten witnesses were examined by the parties to prove their respective claim of possession over the suit land. The suit was decreed and the decree was upheld on appeal. The defendant-petitioner moved in the High Court Division with a civil revision. A single bench of the High Court Division sent the case on remand on setting aside the judgment and decree. In so doing, the High Court observed that the Courts below had erred in law in decreeing the suit for permanent injunction without discussing and considering any evidence of the witnesses to prove the factum of possession, and further observed that the Courts below had judged the case from a wrong angle placing unnecessary importance on the question of title.<br/><br/>The said case was between two individuals and at the time of alleged threatening for dispossession, no title was claimed. In the present case a Government-functionary claimed title of the Government as vested property and served a notice while performing his official duty.<br/><br/>In the case reported in 1984 BLD (AD) 285 the Appellate Division allowed an appeal restoring a decree of trial Court, by which perpetual injunction was granted in favour of plaintiff. In that case the plaintiff’s title was established in an earlier suit and this was the paramount consideration of the Appellate Division. But in the present case plaintiffs’ title was not decided. More so, both the Courts below incidentally examined the title of the plaintiffs and found it in the negative. Therefore, the cases cited are distinguishable and do not lend any support to the petitioners.<br/><br/>Section 13 of the<strong> অর্পিত সম্পত্তি প্রত্যার্পন আইন, ২০০১ </strong>provides abatement of suits or proceedings claiming title to any vested property or any proceedings for release of the same pending before the Custodian of Vested Property on the date of publishing the list of vested property in official gazette. The present case is a simple suit for perpetual injunction. Any relief regarding vested character of the suit land having not been sought for, it does not come within the scope of section 13 of the Ain and therefore, I am unable to accept the submission of learned Deputy Attorney General that the instant civil revision has already abated.<br/><br/>In 15 BLD (AD) 95 as cited by learned Deputy Attorney General, a suit for declaration of some landed property to be not of enemy character with further relief of perpetual injunction was dismissed mainly on the ground of defect of parties. The said judgment and decree of dismissal was upheld by all the Courts up to High Court Division. The Appellate Division by a majority judgment ultimately allowed the civil appeal and thereby decreed the suit.<br/><br/>The point of legal controversy is quite different in the present case and as such the case cited by the learned Deputy Attorney General does not help him in any manner.<br/><br/>In the present case, the trial Court discussed that the record of <em>Ka </em>schedule land was not mutated in the name of Bimala Bala Nath, and no rent receipts in names of the plaintiffs’ vendors or any municipal tax receipts in names of the plaintiffs were produced. It also referred to D.W.1 who admitted the plaintiffs’ possession in the suit land terming it to be illegal, but did not arrive at any definite findings on their possession of the suit land. The appellate Court concurred with the trial Court and found that the plaintiffs had failed to produce any writ of possession in the name of Bimala Bala Nath. From the sale agreement their induction into <em>Ka </em>schedule land was also not proved. Both the Courts below discussed mainly the evidence relating to title and concurrently found that the plaintiffs failed to prove their title in the suit land, and dismissed the suit and appeal.<br/><br/>It appears from the plaint that when the vested property authority served a notice upon the plaintiffs on 6.9.1976 claming the suit land to have vested in the Government, cause of action for the suit arose. The plaintiffs did not seek any relief against the notice or against the ‘vested character’ of the property as alleged in the notice. Even they did not produce the same to infer their possession in the suit land. Although P.W.1 gave oral evidence in support of the plaintiffs’ possession, his evidence was not corroborated by any other witness. In such a position, the D.W’s evidence in support of the plaintiffs’ physical possession is questio-nable and not fully trustworthy.<br/><br/>However, when the notice was served upon the plaintiffs claiming the suit land to be vested property, they ought to have instituted a properly framed suit for declaration of their title with a further declaration against its ‘vested character’ or against the notice as an ancillary relief. In absence of which the simple suit for perpetual injunction was not maintainable. This view finds support from Rafizuddin Ahmed Vs. Mongla Barman and others, 11 BLD (AD) 245. Under similar facts and circumstances M H Rahman, J while speaking on behalf of the Court held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>In a simple suit for permanent injunction with regard to a disputed landed property, the relief is available to a person who is in possession. The Court may enquire incidentally into the respective claims of the parties to the suit for determining whether the plaintiff has got a prima facie case, i.e., whether he is in possession of the disputed property and entitled to the specific relief of permanent injunction. If the dispute involves complicated questions of title, the plaintiff must establish his title by filing a regular suit for declaration of title. A simple suit for permanent injunction should not be allowed to be used as a testing device for ascertai-nment of title. In this case the plaintiff assails the presumption of the C.S. Khatian, a kind of exercise, the Court in a simple suit for permanent injunction should ordinarily avoid</em>.” (emphasis supplied).<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Under the facts and circumstances, I am of the view that the suit itself was not maintainable, and therefore, the Courts below in dismissing the suit and appeal did not cause any failure of justice. The plaintiffs may, however, institute a properly framed suit, if so advised and in that case the adverse observations regarding the plaintiffs’ title documents will not operate. If the property in question is enlisted as vested property, they are also at liberty to approach the Tribunal or District Committee under the<strong> অর্পিত সম্পত্তি প্রত্যার্পন আইন, ২০০১ </strong>for release of the same.<br/><br/>The Rule is thus discharged with above observations, however, without any order as to cost. The order of <em>status quo </em>granted earlier is vacated.<br/><br/>         Send down the lower Courts’ records.<br/><br/><strong>        Ed. </strong><br/><br/> </div></div></div>

He is of the view that there must be an application by an aggrieved person to set the judicial review machinery on the move. Such theme, has however, failed to attract the Appellate Division’s favour iterating that such a negative and pruning view can only be endorsed if the word, “application” is construed narrowly. . . .(91 and 92)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Public Purpose </strong><br/><strong>The so-called approval accorded by the Commerce Ministry for the transfer said part of acquired land to BGMEA, as intimated by its memo of 6<sup>th</sup> September 1998, as absolutely horrendous, least said, not only because the said approval or transfer was not signified by any recognised instrument, but primarily because, being acquired land, the same could not be transferred to a private body for the latter’s private purpose. The purported transfer to enable BGMEA to construct its own complex, went nowhere nearer the concept, “public purpose”. ...(126)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>Building Construction Act, 1952 (II of 1953)</strong><br/><strong>Section 3(B)(5)</strong><br/><strong>BGMEA has not acquired any title because there has been no transfer of title through a device recognised by any provision of the Transfer of Property (TP) Act, 1882 and the Registration Act, 1908. The purported allo-tment intimated through a couple of memo issued by the Ministry and EPB, was tant-amount to a totally vacuous moves. It was neither a sale nor even a lease. The second move initiated by EPB by executing a so-called unregistered </strong><strong>চুক্তি নামা</strong><strong> was also a hoax. There can not be a sale of real property without a registered deed as narrated. While ordinarily there can be a verbal contract under the Contract Act, 1872 a contract in respect to a realty must be reduced into writing and registered as that is what the TP Act and the Registration Acts surmon. No recognised transfer deed stood executed or registered even in January 2011 as is apparent from BGMEA’s letter dated 9<sup>th</sup> January 2011. In any event, as the land was acquired for public purpose and the EPB itself obtained the acquired property to hoist, “Twin Tower” for public purpose, it was out of EPB’s competence to transfer the same for the private purpose of an agglomerate.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Neither the BGMEA’s pleading nor those of any other party, depict any instrument of title in BGMEA’s favour. Although the building in dispute was erected well after C.S. survey, again, there is nothing whatsoever to show BGMEA’s title or even possession vide any post C.S. survey. These reflect perpetuation by BGMEA of a series of pernicious acts of inexonerable propor-tion, amounting to fraud and deceit. </strong><br/><br/><strong>It is abundantly clear that BGMEA, with the visible connivance of EPB, indulged upon a fraud of reprehensible diversity, to grab government’s property. Question is, how on earth could BGMEA apply for the approval of the building in 2003, when document submitted by it shows that even EPB did not acquire any interest on the land at that time and, that by no means, is the end of the harrowing episode. The building was structured on the land beyond that which was purportedly given to BGMEA, as is disclosed by the map and the docets in the DC’s office. By doing so BGMEA obtruded upon the entire wetland. </strong><br/><br/><strong>They have, raised a building on the government land, effectively frustrating the long cherished Hatirjheel Project. The very presence of the building shows that a conglomerate of financially affluent people can scorn and unravel our law with impunity in a nauseating manner. Such a view is simply repulsive to notion of justice. We cannot allow a class of privileged people to flout the law because they are rich.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Even the government is totally handicapped in this respect because it can not transfer this land to any individual or even to a conglomerate for the latter’s private purpose as the land was acquired for public purpose. </strong><br/><br/><strong>There is nothing in section 3(B)(5) of the Act to say that receipt of fine amounts to legalizing unapproved construction. What section 3(B)(5) says is that no dismantling order shall be made unless it is found that (a) such building .. . . has been constructed . . . in a manner which is contrary to the Master Plan or development plan .  . . . . (d) sanction if prayed for could not be granted. </strong><br/><br/><strong>It is beyond argument that the building has been constructed in a manner which is contrary to the Master Plan and develo-pment plan. The subject building is liable to be reduced to extinction also on the ground that it was built in breach of </strong><strong>জলাধার আইন</strong><strong>, and Act XXXVI of 2000, irrespective of whether payment of fine made the wrong, right. Even RAJUK can not allow someone to raise structures in breach of these laws. The Rule is hence made absolute, as it is so destined, coupled with the direction that the authorities will demolish the building within 90 days. . . .

The said Bench issued a Suo Motu Rule, requiring the respondents to show cause in terms as stated above.<br/> <br/>The Newspaper feature, referred to above, which was attributable for the issuance of the Rule under review, is reproduced below, verbatim in the interest of clarity;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>         “The government has no plans to immediately demolish the unauthorised BGMEA Building, obstructing the ongoing city beautification work surrounding the Hatirjheel-Begunbari lake, said the state minister for housing and public works.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The 15 storey building stands defying the law as a tall and odd Monumental structure to eclipse the main lake, at least partially, said citizens’ and environmental groups.<br/><br/>The state Minister, for Housing and public works, Abdul Mannan Khan, told New Age that he would wait and see whether or not the Bangladesh Garments Manufactures and Exporters Association leaders voluntarily demolish the building.<br/><br/>As it creates a chaotic situation, whenever the government demolishes a structure, we expect a change in the mindset of the BGMEA functionaries and at the same time we want the project work to proceed, he said.<br/><br/>If we see that the building is obstructing the project, we will fix the problem through consultations with the BGMEA leaders,’ he said.<br/><br/>Hopefully, they would realise the problem, he said.<br/><br/>The Tk. 1,480 crore project of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha, was planned long ago to restore and preserve as much as possible the remnants of the Hatirjheel and Begunbari lakes, with the Moghbazaar-Tejgaon section of the Tongi Diversion Road, dividing them.<br/><br/>The project envisages construction of circular roads around the two lakes, once part of a long canal, which had taken off and fell into rivers, passing by the city.<br/><br/>Environmentalist recalled many of the 78 canals that once criss-crossed through the historic Dhaka City, now only live in the memory of senior citizens as land grabbers virtually took them all for personal gains.<br/><br/>One can see the unmistakable impact of the grabbing, they said, whenever the city suffers water logging after rains.<br/><br/>The Hatirjheel-Begunbari project suffered setbacks due to irregularities as well as grabbers swallowing much of the lake areas.<br/><br/>BGMEA built its building without caring to take approval from Rajuk, the city development authority under the Ministry of housing and public works.<br/><br/>Rajuk chairman told New Age that it’s a matter of political decision whether or not the unauthorised BGMEA Building would be demolished.<br/><br/>Rajuk will demolish the “illegal” structure only after it gets the green signal from the government”, he said.<br/>The prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, inaugurated the construction of BGMEA in her first tenure in November 1998.<br/><br/>Subsequently, on its completion, the then prime minister Khaleda Zia inaugurated the building in October, 2006.<br/><br/>During the two years the military backed emergency caretaker government ran the country, Rajuk fined BGMEA a nominal penalty of taka 12.5 lakh for building the structure without obtaining its approval.<br/><br/>The law empowers and requires Rajuk to demolish all unauthorised structures.<br/><br/>Rajuk Chairman, however, said that payment of a fine does not mean BGMEA got an approval for its unauthorised building.<br/><br/>BGMEA vice president Saiful Islam Mohiuddin told New Age that the incumbent government can demolish the building only if it considered the lake to be more important than BGMEA.<br/><br/>He also said that Rajuk took fine for not being able to build a bridge on the lake, adjacent to the BGMEA Building, during that tenure of the emergency caretaker government.<br/><br/>Citizens’ groups and environmentalists have been demanding that the unauthorised building at a vantage point of the city be demolish without further delay.<br/><br/>They say that there was no scope whatsoever, to save the building, built on government land in gross violation of two laws, including the Environment Wetland Protection Act, 2000.<br/><br/>BGMEA, they said, built the building filling up a part of the lake.<br/><br/>Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan (DMDP) prohibited any change in the character of Begunbari, the remnant of a natural canal, and designated it as a flood flow zone of the city.<br/><br/>Rajuk must immediately demolish the unauthorised structure, said Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology Professor Mujibur Rahman, also the leader of the team which studied the feasibility of the Hatirjheel-Begunbari project.<br/><br/>After enjoying and enormous advantage from the government, BGMEA should respect public interest and demand, said, Dhaka University Teacher Muntasir Mamun, a campaigner against grabbing of water bodies.<br/>Allowing this unauthorised building to stand, he said, would mean that the law is not equally applied for all.<br/>It would, he said, obviously give birth to questions about the intentions of the government.<br/><br/>Rajuk must demolish buildings in the list of unauthorised structures it had prepared without any discrimination, said Abdullah Abu Sayeed, the founder of Biswa Shahitya Kendra.<br/><br/>“It stands, defying the law in the heart of the city’, he said.<br/><br/>He described the BGMEA Building as an unmistakable symbol of unauthorised construction to inspire others to violate the law.<br/><br/>University Grants Commission Chairman, Nazrul Islam, said in the best interest of the Hatirjheel Beautification Project, the BGMEA building should be demolished.<br/><br/>Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association executive director Syeda Rezwana Hasan said that the law required Rajuk to demolish the building without waiting for a political decision.<br/><br/>If law is subject to politics, justice can never be ensured, she commented.”<br/><br/>The allegations as figured in the reproduced Article, in the succinct form, divulges that Bangladesh Garments Manufac-turers and Exporters’ Association, BGMEA for short, erected a sky scrapper (henceforth the building), barren of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakhya’s (RAJUK) approval in the location which used to be a canal, named, Begun Bari Canal, in the olden days, through which water flew to rivers and thereby kept the part of the city free from water logging and impurities. The reproduced feature also suggests that the unauthorised erection of the building also stands as a major stumbling block in implementing ambitious Hatirjheel Project. It is claimed that RAJUK appears to be emasculated in purging the illegalities that has been perpetrated by BGMEA: it went no further than imposing a meager amount of fine.<br/><br/>Following the issuance of the Rule, BGMEA, which had been impleaded as the respondent No. 3, filed its pleading, stating inter alia, that the subject building is not liable to be demolished as the same was erected in compliance with all the dictates of law, inclusive of what the Building Construction Act 1952, stipulates. According to this respondent’s claim, an application was duly tabled before an Authorised Officer of RAJUK, seeking approval for its plan to erect a 15 storied building on 0.66 acres of land at 23/1 Panthapath Link Road at the Karwan Bazar Area of the city, which land is owned by the said respondent as being an allottee from the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), an offshoot of the Ministry of Commerce. An approved site plan of BGMEA for the construction of a multistoried building was issued under the signature of RAJUK’s secretary on 14<sup>th</sup> July 2003, pursuant to a decision taken in one of RAJUK’s general meetings.<br/><br/>The approval was, however, accorded subject to certain covenant.<br/><br/>BGMEA also successfully applied for clearances and authorisation from other concerned authorities.<br/><br/>By a communication dated 27<sup>th</sup> January 2004, RAJUK intimated BGMEA that the Building Construction Committee had accorded approval to the earlier’s plan and requested it to submit further documents and BGMEA obliged.<br/><br/>By another communication, dated 20<sup>th</sup> August 2006, RAJUK asked BGMEA for an undertaking to remove certain structures from such spaces which were meant to remain vacant as per the approved plan and to pay a sum of Tk. 12,50,000 as penalty for having commenced construction work before procuring approval.<br/>By a letter dated 29<sup>th</sup> August 2006, RAJUK informed BGMEA that the plan had been approved, yet, delivering the same would be delayed pending receipt of a dossier from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) on Hatirjheel Project. In the face of RAJUK’s indolence even after it received BUET’s dossier, BGMEA approached the earlier, seeking delivery of the approved plan, stating that it had already kept 2.41 kathas of land vacant as per the earlier’s dictate for the proposed lake.<br/><br/>By another memo dated 27<sup>th </sup>March 2007, RAJUK intimated BGMEA of its approval for the 2 level basement and 15 storied building and that the latter would be required to build an aesthetically spectacular bridge over the canal in front of the building and to pay a sum of Tk. 1250000 as penalty. BGMEA obliged and informed RAJUK that it had taken steps to construct the said bridge and had submitted plans to RAJUK and the Water and Sewage Authority (WASA) and repeated the request for the delivery of the approved plan.<br/><br/>BGMEA, through its said pleading, continued to say that the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB for short), upon approval of the Ministry of Commerce, allotted the subject land to BGMEA to enable it to construct its building.<br/><br/>BGMEA went on to say that RAJUK never issued any notice upon it alleging any breach of any provision of the Building Construction Act 1952 (henceforth the Act) or requiring BGMEA to remove its building or any part thereof. No other authority labeled any aspersion as to any violation either.<br/><br/>BGMEA subsequently filed yet another affidavit in opposition in supplementation to its original pleading, tabling such assertions which run as follows;<br/><br/>BGMEA was allotted .66 acres of land from several dags of Mouzas Boramoghbazar and Begunbari, pursuant to an agreement sealed between itself and the EPB, dated 7<sup>th </sup>May 2001. Clause 2 of the said covenant stipulates that in the event of any dispute on the title to the land, the responsibility shall lie on EPB.<br/><br/>BGMEA has in fact been vested with .63 acres of land from C.S. dags No. 208 and 209 and .03 acres from C.S dag No. 105 and the building has been constructed on .63 acres of land on dags No. 208 and 209, leaving 2.41 katha on the northern side vacant, which is contiguous to the land in CS dag No. 105, which is indeed Begunbari Canal. BGMEA has erected no structure on that land. As per RAJUK’s desire, BGMEA is to build a connecting bridge on this land.<br/><br/>Land allotted to BGMEA by EPB is part of the land which had been transferred by the Railway authorities to EPB. Initially, possession of 6.12 acres of land was conveyed by the Railway to EPB, but finally, by a registered Title deed, dated 17<sup>th </sup>December 2006, 5.55 acres of land were transferred for a consideration of Tkd. 43,56,86,274.00. The land allotted by EPB to BGMEA is thus, within the admeasurements of land purchased by EPB from Bangladesh Railways. BGMEA has fully paid the consideration due to EPB in installments. EPB requested BGMEA by a letter dated 26<sup>th </sup>April 2010 for the payment of the residual amount of Tk. 2,62,35,284.00 which remained outstanding, and that BGMEA had, by a pay order under cover of a letter dated 21<sup>st </sup>October 2010, had cleared the same and that BGMEA has, ever since, been pursuing for the execution of a registered deed of conveyance in its favour, the last such request being on January 2011.<br/><br/>As the Rule matured we invited a number of bodies, having genuine interest and concern on the matter, who are familiar with relevant facts and laws, to assist us as amicus curiae, Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers’ Association (BELA) being one of such bodies. BELA duly obliged by filing an affidavit, fully impregnated with invaluable facts and information, supported by documents annexed, which are recorded below in conspectus;<br/><br/>The erection of the building has been out and out illegal as the same has been done by filling up significant part of Begunbari Canal in breach of Wetland Protection Act (No. Act 36 of 2000) and the Environment Conservation Act 1995. The construction has been carried out barren of nod from the concerned authorities such as the respondents No. 1, the Department of Environment etc. No prior approval for filling in Begunbari Canal was taken, notwithstanding mandatory statutory requirement to that effect. The respondent No. 3 concealed the fact that the building was on Begunbari Canal when it submitted plan for the building.<br/><br/>“All of the statutory and semi statutory agencies, including those that purported to transfer the land to BGMEA, states BELA, “quite conveniently and designedly obliterated these facts.” The authorities concerned, in according clearance for the building, also played the same kind of gimmick. BELA obtained precious documents of extreme rarity by invoking Right to Information Act 2009 and enclosed them with its pleadings, which enhanced the treasure trove preserved in this file”. These instruments, states BELA through its pleadings, “reveal that the initial discussion on approval for the construction of a building by BGMEA led to the decision that out of the total of 40 kathas of land purportedly sold to the body by EPB, 5.23 kathas had to be excluded from the construction as the same would adversely impede implementation of Hatirjheel-Begun Bari Project as well as of Begun Bari Canal”. In a subsequent congregation, however, for some obscure and inexplicable reasons, unsupported by any rational attribution, the respondent no. 2 deviated from the earlier proposition and rescinded the embargo it previously imposed on 5.23 kathas of the BGMEA’s land. The said respondent, instead, emerged with a fresh proposition to protect 2.41 kathas of land to the north of BGMEA land. Those documents further depict that merely a land use permit was accorded to BGMEA for construction of the building and there never was any permission for the actual construction itself of the same, nor was the building plan ever approved as per the requirement of Section 3 of the Building Construction Act 1952 and the Rules framed thereunder in 1996. It was clearly stipulated in RAJUK’s letter dated 14<sup>th</sup> July 2003 that...<br/><br/>Although the Building Construction Committee, in its meeting dated 2<sup>nd</sup> January 2004, resolved to conditionally approve the plan submitted by BGMEA, no approval letter was, as a matter of fact, issued, because of BGMEA’s persistent failure to adhere to the conditions attached, and to halt the construction work it had commenced bare approval. BGMEA paid no heed whosoever either to the sanction of law or to RAJUK’s dictation, requiring the earlier to refrain from any construction work before obtaining approval. Minutes of RAJUK’s meeting dated 7<sup>th </sup>and 8<sup>th </sup>June and 2<sup>nd </sup>July 2006, divulge that BGMEA concluded construction of the 15 storied Building nude of any approval, in frenzied defiance of the laws of the land.<br/><br/>Over and above a decision to impose a penalty, RAJUK had also resolved to demolish such portion of the building which had been constructed in desolation of approval, by engaging the apposite provisions of the Building Construction Rules. RAJUK also required BGMEA to construct a bridge, for the purpose of paving an approach pathway in front of the Building to allow unhindered flow of the Sonargaon Lake, which included Begunbari Canal.<br/><br/>BGMEA haughtily discarded RAJUK’s instruction to provide an undertaking to demolish unauthorised part of the structure.<br/><br/>BGMEA’s high handed and, visibly arrogant, attitude reflects its abhorrent and weird resolve to project itself as being above law and demonstrate its ability to flout the law of the land with unfiltered impunity.<br/><br/>RAJUK has also exhibited its own apparent connivance with BGMEA’s filthy perversion. It served no notice on the latter requiring it to demolish unauthorised construction and had also <strong>travelled </strong>far beyond the sanction of law, irrationally by drawing a fence between that part of the building that was included in the submitted plan (not approved) and that portion which was not so included, notwithstanding that the building as a whole was constructed without approval.<br/><br/>The respondent no. 2, RAJUK, also filed its own, independent, pleading to put on the <strong>slade </strong>the following assertions; BGMEA building was erected in conspicuous violation of Section 3 of the Building Construction Act 1952 as well as in breach of “মহানগরী, বিভাগীয় শহর ও জেলা শহরের এলাকাসহ দেশের সকল পৌর এলাকার খেলার মাঠ, উন্মুক্ত স্থান, উদ্যান এবং প্রাকৃতিক জলাধার সংরক্ষনের জন্য প্রনীত আইন, ( Act XXX VI of 2000).<br/><br/>Notwithstanding BGMEA’s act of repulsive vilification in constructing the building, infecund of approval, no step, save imposition of a negligible penalty, has been taken to purge the violation: no step to demolish the building. BGMEA applied to RAJUK on 9<sup>th </sup>September 2002 for a clearance certificate for constructing the 15 storied building on an area of 0.66 acres on Dag nos. 208, 209 of Baro Magh Bazar Mouza. The Environment Directorate then channeled a communication to RAJUK, with a query as to whether or not the latter had consented for the use of the land on the basis of the application that had been filed to the aforementioned Directorate.<br/><br/>Land measuring 0.66 acres, out of 6.12, that was proposed to be leased to BGMEA was claimed to have been owned by EPB, which obtained nod from the Ministry of Commerce in September 1998 to convey it to BGMEA. EPB then executed a deed extending permission to BGMEA only to use the land, inserting a stipulation therein that it would be open to BGMEA to take necessary plan to construct a multi storied building to be passed by RAJUK. RAJUK initially objected to the use of 5.23 kathas as the same was linked with the proposed lake, but, then, eventually, agreed to accede to the proposition that 2.41 kathas could be given away by BGMEA to RAJUK for the balanced development of the proposed lake. It was, however, also emphasised that BGMEA would not acquire any title over the land by virtue of the said agreement.<br/><br/>BGMEA then commenced construction work without procuring RAJUK’s approval. As this factum came to RAJUK’s know, it imposed a penalty to the tune of Tk 12,50,000 and resolved to dismantle that portion of the Building for which approval was not asked for in its submitted plan. BGMEA eventually paid the penalty on 14<sup>th </sup>May 2007.<br/><br/>At the very inception of the hearing, what emerged to us to be the issue of much greater import was the question as to the title to the land, whereas the questions as to approval etc turned out to be of secondary introspection.<br/><br/>We did, therefore, direct the Deputy Commissioner (DC), Dhaka to depute an official, familiar with relevant information on the title to the postulated land, to appear before us with all the relevant documents and volumes. In compliance with that direction, one Khurshid Ahmed, a land surveyor at the DC’s office, turned up with the volumes and dockets retained in the district administration office and made the same available for our browsing and scanning. Mr. ABM Altaf Hussain, the learned Deputy Attorney General, read the texts in the <strong>docets </strong>over to us as part of his submission. None of the learned Advocates raised any dispute as to the authenticity of any of these <strong>docets</strong>.<br/><br/>Facts that emerged from these documents, are figured below in the original language. There is nothing in BGMEA affidavit to assert otherwise;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><u>সুমোটো রুল ১৯/২০১০</u></strong><br/><u>বিষয়-বি জি এম ই এ এর কথিত

Rukonuddin Mahmud, Aktar Imam, Anisul Huq, Fida M Kamal, Monsurul Huq Chowdhury, Manzil Murshed and Ms. Syeda Rizwana Hasan.<br/> <br/>Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud, the learned Senior Advocate, under instruction from the respondent No. 3, BGMEA, in his ice breaking part of the speech, picked up the question of this court’s competence to issue the Rule and proffered with his characterstick hyperbaric style, that no scope to issue suo motu order in the form of mandamus exists under Article 102 of the Constitution. There must be an application by an aggrieved person. He referred to Part 11 of the High Court Rules (Rule’s relating to Special Jurisdiction) to lend weight to his submission on this point.<br/><br/>On substantive matters, to refute the assertion that the building was pricked up in derogation of several statutory surmons, Mr. Mahmud posited that the land upon which the perpendicular stands, was not a wet land as the same was not so declared by the authorities in consonance with the জলাধার আইন।<br/><br/>On the accusation that the sky scrapper was elevated in violation of several statutory dictations, Mr. Mahmud expostulated that even if it is accepted for argument’s sake that the structure was erected barren of approval, that misfeasance was cured when RAJUK imposed fine and the same was duly paid. He cited Section 3(B) of the Act to substantiate his articulation on this point, insisting that Section 3(B)(5) is a condition precedent to carry out demolition. He tried to draw a line of distinction between the instant case on the one hand and RAJUK-V-Abdur Rouf Chowdhury (RANGS Building Case) and Jamuna Builders Ltd.-V-RAJUK (Jamuna Future Park case), on the other.<br/><br/>He however, kept pursuing that the construction proceeded with RAJUK’s nod. In his remonstration, the map was duly approved, though was not handed over. He also relied on <strong>Deminimus </strong>Rule. He said RAJUK asked BGMEA to construct a stunning bridge and the latter obliged. He went on to submit that the area over which the building is situate, does not spread over to Begunbari Camal.<br/><br/>He was quite momentous in arguing that the Court can not order demolition unless the regulatory body does so, because it is the satisfaction of that body, rather than that of the court, that is what the apposite statute contemplates. He also remained obstinate to the theme that there can be no demolition unless set rules are followed.<br/><br/>Mr. Mahmud concluded his submission outlining that the plot is indeed owned by BGMEA because it has bought the land from its previous owner for a consideration. He asked us to recognise BGMEA member’s insubstitutable contribution to our economy, not only by creating Juggernaut scale employment, but also being one of our major sources of foreign exchange earning, and tried to have us to perceive that an order derogatory to the body would be inconducive to national interest and that acquisition of land for BGMEA would, because of its status and role, satisfy “public purpose” criterion as envisaged by land acquisition statues.<br/><br/>Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Attorney General, with his characteristic rhetoric, came up rather dispassionately, concentrating primordially on the ownership aspect of the land. According to him, if BGMEA has no title over the land, it is immaterial whether the building was raised in breach of several legislations or not. That said however, he did not abandon the allegation that the building is liable to be scrapped also because it was erected in breach of relevant legislations.<br/><br/>On title, his strenuous assertion is that we need go no further than scanning the records retained in the office of the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka, to unveil the whole truth, on the proprietorship of the land, adding that these <strong>docets </strong>divulge beyond any qualm that the land was acquired for the Railway for specific purposes and, as such, when the residual part of the acquired land stood redundant, the same <strong>willy nilly </strong>reverted back to the district authority and hence, BGMEA never had any title over the property. It was, said Mr. Alam, out of EPB’s competence to transfer the property to an amalgam of private individuals for the latters’ private accrual.<br/><br/>On the question of construction beyond approval and in breach of various legislative schemes, the learned AG argued that since the structure was erected in blatant and bizarre violation of the laws and the Rules specified in the town planning and building construction as well as environment protection legislations, the same is certainly liable to be demolished without further ado, in any event.<br/><br/>Mr. A.B.M Altaf Hussain, the learned Deputy Attorney General plated, with a significant degree of force, that in so far as the building had been hoisted without sanction, there exists nothing to distinguish the instant case from those of Jamuna Future Park and RANGS Building. In substantiating his oration, the learned DAG tried to have us to swing to the conclusion that imposition of fine under Section 3(B) does not imply exoneration. “If that was the case”, submitted the learned DAG, “that would encourage unscrupulous affluent persons to make construction without approval and than try to have their yucky action legalised by paying fine.” That, according to Mr. Altaf Hussain, can not be the scheme of the legislation and would be tantamount to licensing wrongdoers. He however, put utmost emphasis on the title, insisting that if BGMEA is without title, as it definitely is, questions of approval becomes otiose, because an interloper can not erect its building on the land owned by the government. He read over to us the dossier Dhaka District administration prepared, as cited above, with reference to the records brought by its officers for our perusal.<br/>Mr. Aktar Imam, appearing to assist us, again with his symptomatic <strong>splendour, </strong>proffered that facts are fairly clear: the construction was in breach of Section 3 as there was no prior approval.<br/><br/>Document at Annexure D of BGMEA’s affidavit shows nothing more than an initial NOC -it has nothing to do with ownership.<br/><br/>He however, cited 43 DLR page 147 to say that there can be ex-post facto sanction and submitted that private interest may not always be sacrificed at the alter of public interest and that procedural safeguards must not be bartered. Private interests in his view, must also be protected. He asked us to be attentive to public interest, justice and equity in the round.<br/><br/>Mr. Anisul Hoque, appearing to assist us probono as an amicus, with his characterstick aura of articulation projected with distinctive audibility, BGMEA’s bareness of title.<br/><br/>He had it to say that the legislation pertaining to acquisition of land suffers from no ambiguity: it is established with <strong>unjettisonable </strong>probity that land belonging to a citizen can only be acquired if such an action is justifiable for public purposes. It is also well in line with authorities of high preponderance that if an acquired piece of land or, part thereof, is not needed for the purpose which necessitated acquisition, the same shall revert back to the acquiring authority and the requiring authority would have no role in the matter. This legal theme, according to Mr. Huq, entails that such part of the acquired land that was found to have been in excess, certainly vested in the district administration. He expanded his submission, saying that an unbroken chain of authorities have elaborated with meticulously defined precision what “public purpose” means for land acquisition. Relying on the <strong>propoundment </strong>expressed by Ispahai J in the case reported at page 272 of 9 DLR, Mr. Huq went on to submit that to seek sanctuary under the shed of public purpose, the purpose must be of benevolence to the whole community or to a considerable part thereof. He also cited quotation from Willoughby’s Constitutional Law, Vol-11.<br/><br/>He proceeded to illuminate his perspicacity stating that the land was purportedly vested in EPB for constructing World Trade Centre, whereas BGMEA constructed its own building for its own financial augmentation, which has no relevance to Word Trade Centre and again it did not pay the entire consideration amount and that handing over the land to BGMEA was papably illegal. BGMEA sold parts of the building to fatten its own purse. So, there was no public purpose element even in the microscopic degree.<br/><br/>Mr. Fida M. Kamal, appearing to assist us ex-<strong>gratia</strong>, who happened to have had represented the state in the RANGS Building case in his capacity as the Attorney General of the day, with the treasure trove of inestimable knowledge he gained during the progression of that case, commenced his submission, toeing his traditionally pellucid style, by unequivocally proclaiming that this case is indeed distinguishable from that of RANGS Building in that while RANGS raised its building on its own realty, BGMEA had done so on the land owned by the government, gaining wretched entry on it as an illegal intruder and hence BGMEA can not animate any submission at all and can certainly not rely even on those contentions which were advanced, abortively though, by RANGS. It would be ludicrous for a squat to engage any law that can be taken in aid by a person with title. He did then move forward to say that even if BGMEA was duly attired with title, its building would have been amenable to annihilation for the same reason RANG’s building was reduced to rubble, because, if a structure is erected in breach of provisions stipulated in the town planning and building construction legislations, or any other apposite statute, the same is liable to be ravaged, irrespective of whether fine has been imposed or not, in the same way a convict’s name does not wane from the record simply because he has paid the fine imposed.<br/><br/>Mr. Kamal also vocalised the theme that the building has been constructed on the plots which are not the same that were even purportedly conveyed to BGMEA. He was unequivocally inquisitive as to how BGMEA obtained the land it erected the building on. The map does not show that this land was conveyed to BGMEA – “it had grabbed this land stealthfully”, uttered Mr. Kamal. There was no plan for the land and the papers reveal irreconcilable degree of discrepancies even on the purportedly transferred land.<br/><br/>He lent enduring weight to the view that land acquired under the Land Acquisition Act 1894, suffers from the incapacitation as to transferability and as such, it could only be used for another “public purpose”, when excess land turned redundant for the original purpose, in the way Cypress doctrine applies.<br/><br/>Mr. Mansurul Haque Chowdhury submitted that RAJUK is mandatorily required to act in accordance with Section 12 of the Imarat Ain 1952 and hence demolition is irrestitible. In his vocabulary, if BGMEA is allowed to retains its illegal structure on the plea of its contribution to the national exchequer, and on the plea that enormous sums of money had been expended to construct it, and that the parts of the building had been sold to innocent buyers, the Rule of Law and constitutionally imposed Rule against discrimination would be rendered topsy turvy. In such an event it will not remain open to any court to order elimination of any illegal construction, because others will then engage Article 27 and 28 of the Constitution. He concluded submitting that it will herald an unpalatable and pathetic judicial retreat if this Court gives in to the desire of a mighty body.<br/><br/>Mr. Manzil Murshed argued that as the whole area was a Jaladhar, the Building is liable to be demolished under the Environment Protection Act 1995. Environment Pollution Control Ordinance 1977 also proscribes construction of building on Jaladhar. He drove on to say that even RAJUK is stripped of any authority to grant approval to make any construction on a Jaladhar. The amount RAJUK took was by way of compensation: that cannot be treated as legalising the building. No lake can be filled in. It has to be looked at in juxtaposition with Hatirjheel Project. This building is obstructing the progression of Hatirjheel Project wherefore only one part is being constructed. Breach of Jaladhar Ain is a congnisable offence. It would entail an ugly precedence if this building is allowed to stand erect because of the opulence of the people who erected it.<br/><br/>Ms. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, appearing for BELA, placed her copiously resourceful and lucidly analytical submission in her traditional charismatic manner, embracing all possible applicables areas of jurisprudence, starting with the question of title and then trailing her odyssey through the legislations that control town planning, building construction and environment protection. In her vignette, the building must be leveled to the ground as it ignominiously stands on the land owned by the state, despicably projecting its vulgar superciliousness. She, at the inception of her submission, expressed her dismay at the fact that despite incessant request, BGMEA kept mum in supplying the information BELA asked for, which compelled her organisation to procure documents by engaging provisions in right to Information Act, which have been enclosed with BELA’s pleading. She did then, submit comprehensive written submission, which are reproduced verbatim, herein under;<br/> <br/><strong>A.     LEGALITY OF HANDING OVER OF THE LAND TO BGMEA/OWNERSHIP OF BGMEA</strong><br/> </div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The laws on acquisition (Land Acquisition Act, 1948, Acquisition and Requisition of immovable Property Ordinance, 1982) require “public purpose” to be satisfied for all acquisition processes. Case laws have defined “public purpose” and held that acquisition in favour of private entities per se is not a public purpose (9 DLR (1957) page 272; 41 DLR (1989) page 326 and hence selling lands that were acquired for a definite public purpose to a private entity like BGMEA is untenable in the eye of law.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Where lands are not utilized for the purpose for which it was acquired, it has to go back to the original owner (3BLC page 18). This established principle of law rendered the purported transfer even to EPB void ab-initio, let alone BGMEA.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The land in question was acquired in favour of Railway vide LA case 16/59-60 under a project of excavation of soil for Railway Scheme. Possession was handed over to Railway on 18 January, 1960 which was notified in the Gazette dated 28 March, 1968. The total amount of acquired land was 58.58 falling under 6 different mouzas, namely Razar Bag, Shohor Khilgaon, Boro Mogh Bazar, Begunbari, Bagnoadda and Kawran (Enclosure-1).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">An inter-ministerial meeting, held on 10 December, 1997 decided to hand over 6.12 acres of this total 58.58 acres of land to the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) for building a World Trade Centre thereon. The land proposed to be handed over (through sale) to EPB fell under three different mouzas, namely Boro Mogh Bazar, Begunbari and Bagnoadda (Enclosure-2).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It was only on 20 December, 2006 that a Deed of Conveyance was purported to be executed between Bangladesh Railway and the EPB (page 14 of the supplementary affidavit of BGMEA) that recorded that only 5.555 acres of land instead of 6.12 acres could be handed over to EPB. This Deed shows that EPB indeed handed over possession of part of 5.555 acres of land to BGMEA on 19 December, 1999, i.e., six years prior to the execution of the Deed in its favour on 20 December, 2006 which is beyond the scope of law. Again, for the land, EPB was required to pay Taka 43, 56, 86, 274 to Railway in five installments. The last installment was paid by EPB on 15 May, 2011 (page 17 of the supplementary affidavit of BGMEA) whereas EPB executed the Sale Deed with BGMEA on 07 May, 2001 (page 54 of the affidavit in opposition of BGMEA).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Deed has not given EPB the right to transfer the land (page 18 of the supplementary affidavit of BGMEA).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">EPB has not yet got the land mutated in its own name. The same is true for BGMEA. It has not been able to produce any document of ownership/mutation.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is a mandatory requirement of law under section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908 that any Deed of Sale must be registered. Evidently, the Deed of Sale dated 07 May, 2001 in pursuance of which EPB purportedly “sold” the property in question to EPB was not registered. At the time of execution of the so-called Sale Deed, EPB was not the lawful owner of the property in question as it registered its own Sale Deed on 20 December, 2006. Since EPB was never the owner of the property at the material time, the question BGMEA becoming the owner does not arise at all. As such BGMEA is an unlawful encroacher a squatter to be precise, on the public property and is liable to be evicted under section 5 of the Government Property (Recovery of Possession) Ordinance, 1970.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Sale Deed signed between EPB and BGMEA on 7 May, 2001 clearly states (condition 1, page 54 of the affidavit in opposition of BGMEA) that BGMEA shall pay all the ten installments in five years failing which EPB may cancel the agreement. Records show that BGMEA completed the construction of the building in 2006 although the last payment was made by it only on 21 October, 2010 that again on the face of repeated reminders given by EPB (page 27 of the supplementary affidavit of BGMEA). EPB took no initiative to cancel the agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Further, although the agreement clearly prohibits (condition 5, page 54 of the affidavit in opposition of BGMEA) any transfer of the property prior to construction of the BGMEA Building, as per approved plan from RAJUK, it is evident that part of the unauthorized building has been transferred to at least two other entities (Enclosure-3). EPB has not proceeded against BGMEA against such breach.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>B.      DISCREPANCIES IN THE DESCRIPTION AND MEASUREMENT OF LAND </strong><br/><br/>Various documents adduced display serious anomalies in the description of lands that have purportedly been sold and handed over to BGMEA and the land on which the building has been structured;</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">While, as per the permission letter of the Ministry of Commerce dated 6 September, 1998 (page 49, Annexure I, Affidavit in Opposition of BGMEA), no land was earmarked to have be given to BGMEA from C.S. dag No. 203 and 209, the agreement purportedly signed between EPB and BGMEA shows that BGMEA was given 0.41 acres from CS dag No. 203, 208 and 209.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Again, although the amended certificate of authentication by EPB dated 28 March, 2004 (page 45 of the affidavit of BELA) states that land measuring 0.03 acres from C.S. dag No. 105 only was given to BGMEA for use as connecting road, the agreement instead, has included this land in the schedule of land to be sold to BGMEA. This corrected certificate of EPB clearly suggests that BGMEA was not allocated any land from dag Nos. 203, 105 and 1.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The application submitted by BGMEA (page 10 of the affidavit in opposition of BGMEA) to Rajuk for approval of its Building plan mentions C.S. dag Nos. 208 and 209 only and does not mention C.S. dag Nos. 203, 1 and 105 at all. While all the five dags together make up 0.66 acres on which BGMEA is claiming to have constructed its building, exclusion of dag Nos. 105 and 1 from the application render the size of the plot to 0.41 acres only. Hence Rajuk can, if it can at all, only approve the plan on 0.41 acres and not on 0.66 acres and that again on submission of proper document as to ownership, which BGMEA has, thus far not been able to produce.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">All subsequent correspondences, however, show that Rajuk decided to approve the plan on 0.66 acres although due to differing statements as to allocation and scattered location (page 33 of BELA affidavit) of the plots in question, the occupation of 0.66 acres of land by BGMEA on the five plots is impractical, impossible and not tenable in the eye of law. The claim by BGMEA that it has constructed the building on 0.66 acres of land falling within C.S. dag Nos. 208 and 209 must be rejected for the fact that it was only allocated 0.41 acres of land from C.S dag No. 208 and nothing was even purportedly sold to it from C.S. dag No. 209.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is due to these anomalies in the description of land that Rajuk could never hand over the plan, it conditionally approved for the BGMEA building, absence of title notwithstanding.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On-site visit, the DC office records show that the BGMEA building stands on C.S. dag No. 208, 1 and 2 (Enclosure-4) and not on C.S dag No. 208 and 209 as claimed by BGMEA in its application (page 10 of the affidavit in opposition of BGMEA).</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>C. LEGALITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION </strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">It is clear that although Rajuk, vide its letter dated 14 July, 2003 (page 35 of the BELA affidavit) gave site clearance to BGMEA for constructing a multi-storied building on plot Nos. 208 and 209, the same was subjected to approval of building plan under the Building Construction Rules, 1996. Similarly, although Rajuk decided to conditionally approve the building plan of BGMEA (page 43 of the BELA affidavit), the same was subjected to the submission of a statement as to mouja, C.S dag number and area of the land in question that BGMEA till date has not been able to submit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the absence of accurate description of the lands and proper documentation as to ownership, the plan that Rajuk decided to approve was never handed over to BGMEA. Defying Rajuk’s lawful directions (pages 47, 50, 59 (item 49.1 and 49.3), 64 of BELA affidavit), BGMEA proceeded with and completed the construction of the building without any approved plan which is a clear violation of Section 3 of the Building Construction Act, 1952.</li></ol><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The Deed of Conveyance describes the land handed over to EPB as “DOBA” (ditch). The CS record (Enclosure-5) shows that dag No. 208 and 209 where BGMEA is claiming to have its Building are recorded respectively as “nala” and “pond”, Annexure “K-1” (page 11) of the supplementary affidavit of BGMEA which shows that lands whereon the building has been constructed, are surrounded by wetlands and lakes. All these documents prove it beyond any shadow of doubt that the unauthorized building has indeed been constructed on wetlands and in clear violation of the provisions of Act No. 36 of 2000.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>D. LEGAL CONSEQUENCES </strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The unauthorized construction of the BGMEA building is liable to face the consequences laid down in section 3B for (a) it is contrary to the master plan (Enclosure-6), (b) it is causing undue inconvenience in the implementation of the project on Hatir Jheel Development, and (iii) due to the discrepancies in land description, lack of ownership of EPB/BGMEA and the legal bars against transfer of acquired property, sanction, it prayed for, could not be granted (section 5(d).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">As the building has been constructed by filling up part of a wetland and without obtaining prior approval of the Ministry of Public Works, it is liable to face the consequences laid down in section 8 of Act No. 36 of 2000.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Sale Deed dated 7 May, 2001 signed between EPB (without being the owner of the lands in question) and BGMEA (being a private entity) having purportedly been executed without lawful authority, makes no sense whatsoever in the vision of law and carries nihility.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">BGMEA, having acquired no ownership at all on the land in question, is an unlawful encroacher on the public property and is liable, not only to be evicted under section 5 of the Government Property (Recovery of Possession) Ordinance, 1970, but to be prosecuted and penalised for having sinfully and feloniously squatted on it for over a decade.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">For not preventing the unauthorized construction of the BGMEA building, the negligent officers of Rajuk should face dire consequences.”</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>As we moved to embark upon our job, after hearing submissions from all the learned Advocates and perusing Ms. Hassan’s written treatise, we reckoned that the questions that should be addressed to dispose of the Rule are whether (i) we are competent to issue an order in the form of mandamus suo motu (ii) BGMEA is fortified with any title over the land and if not, what consequence should ensue, (2) the building is liable to be dismantled in any event irrespective of who holds the title.<br/><br/>Before stepping on the ladder to explore the substantive questions, as in (ii) and (iii) above, however, we must determine whether it is open to us to issue a Rule, suo motu, involving an order in the form of mandamus.<br/><br/>Mr. Mahmudul Islam, the acclaimed author of Constitutional Law of Bangladesh, emerged as the pivotal advocate to insist that there exist no opportunity to issue suo motu rule under the scheme envisaged by Article 102 of the Constitution. He is of the view that the phrases, “on the application of any person aggrieved”, necessarily connote that there must be an application by an aggrieved person, to set the judicial review machinery on the move.<br/><br/>This theme, has, however, failed to attract the Appellate Division’s favour, and as such, we need move no further on this issue, save iterating that such a negative and pruning view can only be endorsed if the word, “application”, is construed narrowly. That takes us to explore the issue no(ii).<br/><br/>Documents adduced by BGMEA itself project that on 6<sup>th </sup>September 1998, a memo was issued by a Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Commerce, intimating that the government has approved allotment of 0.66 acre of land in favour of BGMEA to enable it to construct its own complex, from 6.12 acres of land, adjoining Hotel Sonargaon in Kawran Bazar area, which was allotted for the construction of “World Trade Centre.”<br/><br/>By a memo, dated 8<sup>th</sup> September 1998, EPB intimated BGMEA that pursuant to the Ministry of Commerce decision, dated 6<sup>th </sup>September 1998, it has been decided to allot 0.66 acre of land to BGMEA from 6.12 acres of World Trade Centre land in Kawran Bazar on condition that the price for the land, fixed at Tk. 5176470.50 as fixed by the Ministry of Commerce, shall be paid by BGMEA by 10 installments in 5 years and that if it becomes impossible on BGMEA’s part to construct its own building for any reason, it will not be open to BGMEA to transfer or sell the land to any person, institution or organisation. BGMEA was asked to pay the first installment to EPB. A map demarcating the land was enclosed. It was also stated that the land was conveyed to BGMEA free of encumbrances.<br/><br/>BGMEA also adduced a document captioned “চুক্তি নামা”, showing EPB as the first party and BGMEA as the second one. This so-called agreement recites that pursuant to the Ministry of Commerce decision, EPB has allotted the scheduled land to BGMEA with a view to sell it on 8<sup>th</sup> September 1998. It proceeded to state that BGMEA would pay Tk. 5176470.50 in 5 years by 10 installments, failing which EPB would be at liberty to rescind the agreement.<br/><br/>In the event of the emergence of any dispute on the title to the land, the responsibility shall fall on EPB, which shall remain obliged to refund to BGMEA the money the letter shall pay. BGMEA will not be free to sell the property before constructing its building with RAJUK’s approval. It was specified that the deed would be used solely for the purpose of obtaining RAJUK’s approval for the building plan.<br/><br/>The agreement was an unregistered one, and undated.<br/><br/>Another document adduced by BGMEA reveals another agreement, this time a registered one, concluded between Bangladesh Government on the one hand and EPB on the other, evidencing transfer of 5.555 acres of land by the government to EPB to enable the latter to construct a “World Trade Centre,” pursuant to a decision of the Ministry of Commerce. Reason for reducing the quantum of the land from 6.12 to 5.555, has been assigned.<br/><br/>It states that it was decided in 1995 that an area of land covering 6.12 acres in Boro Mogh Bazar, Begun Bari, and Bognoada Mouza, adjoining Hotel Sonargaon, would be sold directly by Bangladesh Railway to EPB and the government on principle, agreed to this proposition. Subsequently, because of the situation of the land, it was decided to transfer 5.555 acres in buyer’s favour. On 28.06.2006 a letter was addressed to EPB for the execution of a Saf Kabala. EPB paid Tk. 435686274.00 to the Railway.<br/><br/>Paradoxically, this agreement was concluded on 27<sup>th </sup>November 2006, and registered on 17<sup>th </sup>December, 2006.<br/><br/>Other documents put forward by BGMEA portray that there have been exchange of correspondences between EPB and BGMEA in the years 2010 and 2011, revealing that EPB has been asking for the consideration money and BGMEA, stating in January 2011, that it has paid the money and hence sale deed should be executed, evincing that even as of January 2011 no transfer deed was executed.<br/><br/>By a latter dated 9<sup>th</sup> January 2011, BGMEA intimated EPB that the earlier had already drafted a sale deed, and the same should, hence, be executed.<br/><br/>The documents cited above depict a plethora of absurdity: The government approved allotment of 0.66 acre of land to BGMEA, on 6<sup>th </sup>September 1998 and then, two days later EPB addressed a memo to BGMEA, intimating that pursuant to the Ministry of Commerce’s decision, it has allotted the said portion of land to BGEMA, from 6.12 acres, meant for World Trade Centre. This was followed by a so-called instrument, unregistered, which was not even dated, though date ascribed by the witnesses suggest that this so-called instrument was executed on 7<sup>th </sup>May 2001, which stipulates that BGMEA would pay a consideration in 10 installments over a period of 5 years.<br/><br/>Curiously enough EPB did not even own the land on that date because, as BGMEA produced document impart, the government transferred the land to EPB years later, i.e. in 2006.<br/><br/>The information that enjoy consensuality, unmask that the land concerned, were, until 1960, owned by the local people, who stepped on to the dominion over the land as the heirs or successors of the C.S. recorded people. In that year, land admeasuring 58.58 acres from Reynar/Rag, Khilgaon, Baro Moghbazar, Begunbari, Boagnodha, Kawran Bazar, were acquired for the then East Bengal Railway vide L/A case No. 16/59-60. The same were handed over to the Railway. Some 6.12 acres, part of which is the subject matter of our adjudication, formed part of that 58.58 acres, acquired from the people in the vicinity. There is no duality on this fact. It is also beyond altercation that part of the acquired land turned out to be unnecessary for the purpose for which the same were acquired.<br/><br/>Documents and averments further disclose that initially reluctant RAJUK, eventually granted it’s consent for the construction of a building on conditions that an area of 2.41 Kathas would be set apart for RAJUK. It was emphasised that the said agreement would not mean recognition of title. By a letter dated 26<sup>th</sup> April 2010, EPB asked BGMEA to pay the unpaid consideration amount to the sum of Tk. 26235284,00, and BGMEA paid the amount on 21<sup>st</sup> October 2010. No deed of conveyance has been registered, despite BGMEA’s request, the last of which was on 9<sup>th</sup> January 2011, as stated above.<br/><br/>So, what legal position on title are reflected from those admitted facts and documents, adduced by BGMEA itself?<br/><br/>To trace the answer, we have to dissect the provisions contained in the “Land Acquisition Ordinance” 1894 and in the “Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance” 1982, as well as in the Transfer of Property Act. But before scanning these provisions, any sane person would ask:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Who was EPB in 1998 to transfer the land it did, admittedly, not have ownership over?”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It is axiomatic that the land was acquired under the Ordinance of 1894. As the 1982 was the reigning one at the time of purported transfer to EPB/BGMEA, provisions of the latter Ordinance are also apposite.<br/>The 1894 Ordinance empowered the government to acquire land if public purpose necessitated such moves.<br/><br/>Unbroken chain of unimpeachable authorities, in interpreting provisions as to acquisition and requisition of land, inflexibly proclaim that if land or part of the same becomes unnecessary, post acquisition, the requiring body must return the same to the government which will then either use it for another “public purpose” or return it to its original owner.<br/><br/>In Shankar Gopal Chatterjee-V-Additional Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka, 41 DLR 326, this Division held that acquired land shall not be used for a purpose other than the one for which it was acquired.<br/><br/>In Salam-V-Government of Bangladesh 1BLC 53, it has been held that if any land remains unused for the purpose for which it was acquired, it will remain open to the government to decide as to whether the requiring body will be entitled to use it for any other public purpose or will return the same to its original owner.<br/><br/>In Naushad Ahmed Chowdhury-V-Ministry of land Administration and Land Reform, 3BLC 18, this court expressed, that in view of Section 17(2) and 41 of the Ordinance of 1982, unused acquired land should have been released in favour of the original owner as the inquiry officer found that the land had remained unused since 1962.<br/><br/>Indeed, Section 17 of the 1982 Ordinance explicitly so ordains.<br/><br/>The concept “public interest” underwent judicial scrutiny in a fairly good number of cases. As power to acquire immovable property override’s a citizen’s Constitutional right to own property, superior courts firmly maintain the proposition that the phrase “public purpose” must be strictly construed.<br/><br/>In the classic case of Jogesh Chandra Lodh-V-Province of East Pakistan, 9DLR, Ispahani and Khan JJ pronounced without prevarication that “public purpose” encompasses something that is of benevolence to the whole community or a substantial part thereof, amplifying that anything that furthers the general interest of the community as opposed to the particular interest of the individual, is to be regarded as a public purpose. Their lordships magnified their views stating that no reason of general public policy will suffice to validate an order of requisition unless the order is made for public purpose or in public interest and that verbal assertion that requisition is made for the development of jute industries through a certain private agency for the benefit of the public, was not enough.<br/><br/>Their Lordships were quite vigorous in asserting that existence of public purpose is the foundation of the power and is indeed sina qua non to acquire a property and that the government can not acquire private property for the private interest of some individual or individuals.<br/><br/>In Razab Ali-V-Province of East Pakistan 10 DLR 489, Amin Ahmed Chowdhury and Sattar JJ laid down their edict saying that the purpose must be for the general good of the people as opposed to the good of a particular individual or group of individuals. They went on to accentuate the theme with the following observation, “As between individuals, no necessity; however great, no exigency, however imminent, no improvement, however valuable, no refusal, however <strong><u>unneighbourly</u></strong>, no <strong><u>obstinancy</u></strong>, however extravagant, can compel or require any man to part with an inch of his estate.”<br/><br/>It has also been pointed out that there is no public purpose in any undertaking or venture in which the public is served indirectly and in a circuitous way and that every grocery in a country serves a public interest, but such groceries are not primarily and directly concerned with such purpose.<br/><br/>In Abdus Sabhan Sowdagar-V-Province of East Pakistan 14DLR 486, Murshed and Siddiqiky JJ insisted that the minimum consideration must be as to whether the efficient working of a public utility concern would be affected without its having another accommodation and secondly, it must also be considered whether or not such an accommodation can be available otherwise than by a compulsory order of acquisition.<br/><br/>They went on to underscore that the District Magistrate must be satisfied not only that there is a public purpose but also that the property is required for such a public purpose, iterating that the concepts, “requirement” and “public purpose”, are <strong><u>justiciable.</u></strong><br/><br/>They also stressed that public purpose can only be established if it is shown that the purpose will bestow benefits on the public directly, not incidentally and that if the purpose is, however, to benefit an individual or a group of individuals directly and the benefit to the people or to a section of it, is only prospective or incidental, the purpose is private.<br/><br/>In Mrs. Maleka Siraj -v- Bangladesh, WP No. 2713 of 2010 (unreported), this Division came out with the view that the purpose shall be for the community as a whole or a substantial part thereof, not for a class of people, however important that class may be.<br/><br/>In the backdrop of the decisions cited above, we find the so-called approval accorded by the Commerce Ministry for the transfer said part of acquired land to BGMEA, as intimated by its memo of 6<sup>th </sup>September 1998, as absolutely horrendous, least said, not only because the said approval or transfer was not signified by any recognised instrument, but primarily because, being acquired land, the same could not be transferred to a private body for the latter’s private purpose. The purported transfer to enable BGMEA to construct its own complex, went nowhere nearer the concept, “public purpose”.<br/><br/>Purported confirmation of transfer by EPB to BGMEA, as conveyed through its memo dated 8<sup>th</sup> September 1998, reflects even a worse scenario, because apart from the total embargo on the transferability of acquired land for private purpose, EPB was not even the owner of the land until November 2006. Documents portray that it was a purely commercially oriented move any way.<br/><br/>We are prepared to be swayed to the conclusion that vesting the residual part of the acquired property to EPB in 2006 was not devoid of the sanction of law because; (i) it is the government which decided to do so after the requiring body abandoned it, (ii) the purpose was capable of showering direct benefit on the people at large as a Twin Tower would have done, (iii) it was not meant to enrich an individual or a group, (iv) the transfer was vide a registered deed.<br/><br/>But, it will be grotesque to say that the purported transfer by EPB to BGMEA was blessed with any degree of legality. Such an avowal would be repugnant to the theme established by the high profile authorities, cited above.<br/><br/>The pertinent question any self righteous person would be inquisitive about is how the public at large or even a substantial section of it, could reap any benefit, even incidentally or circuitously, from an edifice that has been constructed for the visible economic well being of the members of BGMEA alone. What amelioration have people been deriving out of it, except that it is delineating itself as an obnoxious symbol of sheer disdainfulness of a group, endowed with fleshy economic muscle, deliriously, withering aspired seraphic image of Hatirjheel Project, a dreamy project that has been animated with huge amount of tax payers’ money? There can be no qualm whatsoever on the assertion that it is BGMEA members alone, who are the exclusive beneficiaries. As truth has it, BGMEA has, a fact that has not been rebutted, sold most part of the building to banks and other commercial entities and has, thereby, enabled its members to be aggrandised. It has been like a holocaust on civility.<br/><br/>BGMEA has not acquired any title also because there has been no transfer of title through a device recognised by any provision of the Transfer of Property (TP) Act, 1882 and the Registration Act, 1908. The purported allotment intimated through a couple of memo issued by the Ministry and EPB, was tantamount to a totally vacuous moves. It was neither a sale nor even a lease.<br/><br/>The second move initiated by EPB by executing a so-called unregistered Pzw³ bvgv was also a hoax. There can not be a sale of real property without a registered deed as narrated above. While ordinarily there can be a verbal contract under the Contract Act, 1872 a contract in respect to a realty must be reduced into writing and registered as that is what the TP Act and the Registration Acts surmon. No recognised transfer deed stood executed or registered even in January 2011 as is apparent from BGMEA’s letter dated 9<sup>th </sup>January 2011. In any event, as the land was acquired for public purpose and the EPB itself obtained the acquired property to hoist, “Twin Tower” for public purpose, it was out of EPB’s competence to transfer the same for the private purpose of an agglomerate.<br/><br/>It does, hence, go without saying that BGMEA does not, and did never have, at any point of time, any kind of title or interest over the land.<br/><br/>What can be asseverated without mortifying the truth is that, a scam of abysmal proportion had been perpetrated in respect to the land, which is certainly government property, in which uncanny plot, EPB and, of course, some depraved officials of RAJUK, also extended their debauched hands.<br/><br/>Apart from the said unregistered allotment instrument, which enjoys no recognition by any stature, there is nothing whatsoever to support BGMEA’s claimed title. Neither the BGMEA’s pleading nor those of any other party, depict any instrument of title in BGMEA’s favour. Although the building in dispute was erected well after C.S. survey, again, there is nothing whatsoever to show BGMEA’s title or even possession vide any post C.S. survey.<br/><br/>BGMEA, in its application to RAJUK on 11<sup>th </sup>January 2003 claimed title over the land, relying on the said stale documents, although curiously enough, by its own statement, EPB by a so-called contract, bereft of any legal status, only allowed it to use the land with liberty to construct a building thereon. We find this contract, if it can be described as a contract at all, to be rather elusive. The so-called allotment can not be drawn to any concept of transfer of realty known to any provision of the TP Act or any other statute.<br/><br/>RAJUKs pleading divulge that BGMEA applied for approval as early as in 2002 for a clearance certificate, when all the papers submitted even by BGMEA show that the land belonged to the government.<br/><br/>These reflect perpetuation by BGMEA of a series of pernicious acts of <strong>inexonerable </strong>proportion, amounting to fraud and deceit.<br/><br/>It is abundantly clear that BGMEA, with the visible connivance of EPB, indulged upon a fraud of reprehensible diversity, to grab government’s property. Question is, how on earth could BGMEA apply for the approval of the building in 2003, when document submitted by it shows that even EPB did not acquire any interest on the land at that time and, that by no means, is the end of the harrowing episode. The building was structured on the land beyond that which was purportedly given to BGMEA, as is disclosed by the map and the <strong>docets </strong>in the DC’s office. By doing so BGMEA obtruded upon the entire wetland.<br/><br/>It is also obvious from all the instruments that as soon as it became clear to BGMEA and EPB that the earlier’s land grabbing exercise has become exposed, they proceeded to create fraudulent documents years after BGMEA applied to RAJUK, claiming ownership over the land.<br/><br/>BGMEA’s action has not only been reproachful but is also felonious, to say the least.<br/><br/>M/s. Rokanuddin Mahmud and Akhtar Imam reminded us of the contribution members of BGMEA infuse into our exchequer.<br/><br/>We are not oblivious of this. But, can we, or for that purpose, can the state, allow them impunity or immunity from the law? We are unable to accede to such a proposition. The rule of law shall cry in wilderness if we allow impunity to a class of people because they make important contribution to our economy. Irrespective of whether they do so or not, they must remain amendable to the law of the land like any one else, and must not be allowed to act as a reprobate lot, or else the rule of jungle shall reign. Such squalid acts can not be endorsed.<br/><br/>BGMEA, we must iterate, acted in the most decadent, disdainful and imperious manner by pretending that its members’ stentorian economic muscle place them with supra legal status. They have, raised a building on the government land, effectively frustrating the long cherished Hatirjheel Project. The very presence of the building shows that a conglomerate of financially affluent people can scorn and unravel our law with impunity in a nauseating manner. Such a view is simply repulsive to notion of justice.<br/><br/>Most insalubriously, it had been built by displaying bizarre audacity to put an stumbling block on part of Hatirjheel Project, by impinging upon Begunbari Canal, culpably filling in the same, obnoxiously imperiling the expected pageantry of the Project.<br/><br/>The buildings stands their as a cancerous growth with the capability to dilate malevolency not only to Hatirjheel area, but to the city in its entirety. In our view, unless this malignant growth is evaporated forthwith, it will swamp the whole city.<br/><br/>If a body claims to be a major contributor to the country’s economy, its contributing aspect must pervade to all areas. It can not be licensed to indulge upon anarchy. It must behave in an orderly manner or else face the harsh rigour of law, to which every one is subject, irrespective of his stature or standing.<br/><br/>Garments workers, by keeping the garments industries rolling, also make tremendous contribution to our economy. Similar contributions are made by Bengali diaspora, stationed abroad, who inject loads of money to our treasury. Even the poor peasants yield crops to feed the whole nation, and thereby block exodus of foreign exchange, without whose bestowal, the entire populace, inclusive of the BGMEA members, will starve. So, the claimed dispensation by BGMEA on ground of their contribution is absolutely indecorous. We can not allow a class of privileged people to flout the law because they are rich: Lord Denning’s command must not be ignored;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Be you ever so high, the law is above you”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We must put on record that even the government is totally handicapped in this respect because it can not transfer this land to any individual or even to a conglomerate for the latter’s private purpose as the land was acquired for public purpose.<br/><br/>It is therefore, obvious that the Rule is destined to see the face of success on this count alone, and the building is fated to be scrapped and deflated to ground as it does guilefully stand on the government owned land.<br/><br/>Although our above finding makes embarkation on the second count unnecessary, we would, nevertheless, proceed to that aspect as well, to satisfy the interest of totality.<br/><br/>Question as to whether payment of fine imposed by RAJUK for unapproved construction, entitles the structure concerned to enjoy sanctification, came up in two widely publicised cases in the recent past.<br/><br/>In Jamuna Builders Ltd.-V-RAJUK (Jamuna Future Park Case), this Division’s decision to summarily reject Writ Petition No. 421 of 2010, stating that RAJUK is, notwithstanding provisions in section 3(B)(5) of Act, sufficiently fortified with the power to dismantle an unapproved construction, had received Appellate Divisions endorsement.<br/><br/>In RAJUK -V- A. Rouf Chowdhury 61 DLR (AD) 28, the so-called RANGS Building Case, the Appellate Division <strong>undistortedly </strong>vouched that a structure heightened to encroach upon the realm reserved for the Civil Aviation Authority, is liable to be scrambled.<br/><br/>There is nothing in section 3(B)(5) of the Act to say that receipt of fine amounts to legalizing unapproved construction.<br/><br/>What section 3(B)(5) says is that no dismantling order shall be made unless it is found that (a) such building . . . has been constructed . . .. . in a manner which is contrary to the Master Plan or development plan . . . . . . (d) sanction if prayed for could not be granted.<br/><br/>It is beyond argument that the building has been constructed in a manner which is contrary to the Master Plan and development plan.<br/><br/>The subject building is liable to be reduced to extinction also on the ground that it was built in breach of Rjvavi AvBb, and Act XXXVI of 2000, irrespective of whether payment of fine made the wrong, right. Even RAJUK can not allow someone to raise structures in breach of these laws.<br/><br/>In this respect we wholly endorse and adopt what Ms. Hasan has laid down in her written submission, quoted above in it’s entirety, and what Mr. Morshed verbally submitted.<br/><br/>The Rule is hence made absolute, as it is so destined, coupled with the direction that the authorities will demolish the building within 90 days.<br/><br/>.The fact that lots of money had been spent, can not be a ground to allow it to stay upright.<br/><br/>BGMEA must return money to those who bought flats in the building, as those transactions stand vitiated, within 12 months from the receipt of claims. The flat buyers, can however, not, in our view, claim interest, because, as we look at it, they are guilty of contributory negligence. They had actual or constructive knowledge about BGMEA’s bareness of title and the illegality as to the construction of the building.<br/><br/>         <strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
