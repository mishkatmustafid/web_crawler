Case No. 04 of 2006 arising out of Artha Rin Jari Case No.183 of 2003  should not be set-aside.<br/> <br/>The facts leading to the filing of this Revision, in brief, as follows:<br/>         The opposite party No.1, Rupali Bank Limited as plaintiff instituted a mortgage suit being Mortgage Suit No.67 of 1999 before the Artha Rin Adalat-1, Chittagong for realization of its loan of TK. Tk.82,33,209.90 along with interest. The suit was ultimately decreed in favour of the bank. The judgment debtors having failed to pay the decreetal amount  whereupon, the Bank filed Artha Rin Jari Case No. 183 of 2003 for execution of the said decree. Thereafter the decree holder bank in court process floated Tender on 18.10.2003 published in two daily news papers  namely, Daily Khabar and Daily Azadi for auction sale of the immovable mortgaged property mentioned in the schedule and the petitioner and two others participated in the auction sale of the said mortgaged property. Among the other participants one of them offered Tk. 80,000/- and other Tk.1,20,000/- in which the petitioner was selected as the highest bidder in the competitive auction sale on his offer Tk 4,00,000/- (4 Lac) and,  the Artha Rin Adalat on 18.10.2003 accepted the offer of the petitioner being the highest offer and   directed the petitioner to deposit the entire bid  amount and sale fees. The petitioner then deposited the rest of the bid amount and sale fee Tk. 4010. In this backdrop on 28.10.2003 the decree holder Bank filed an application under Order XXI, Rule 90 of the Civil Procedure Code for setting aside the auction sale. The Artha Rin Adalat upon hearing the parties rejected the appli-cation on 28.10.2003 and fixed the next  date on 19.11.2003 for confirmation of the auction sale and the Executing Court  after  considering all the circumstances and evidence on record passed an order on 19.11.2003 confirming the auction sale.<br/> <br/>In this background opposite party No.1, Rupali  Bank preferred an appeal before this Court  being First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 151 of 2004 against the order dated 19.11.2003 and ultimately, a Division Bench of this Court  disposed of the said  appeal  with the direction to the Artha Rin Adalat  to register the petition filed by the plaintiff bank under order XXI, Rule 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure as Miscellaneous Judicial Case and to dispose of the same after hearing both the sides within 60 days from the date of receipt of the order. The learned Artha Rin Adalat, Chittagong then in compliance of the order of this  Court registered the case as Miscellaneous Case No.4 of 2006, who after hearing both the parties by order dated 28.04.2010  allowed the Misc. Case and thereby set-aside   the auction sale of the mortgaged property.<br/> <br/>The unsuccessful  petitioner, thereupon, preferred an appeal being Miscellaneous Appeal No.28. of 2012 before the learned District Judge, Chittagong who by  his judgment and order dated 17.05.2012 dismissed the appeal and affirmed the order No.58 dated 28.04.2010 passed by the learned Judge, Artha Rin Adalat, Chittagong in Misc. Case No. 04 of 2006 and the instant Revision applic-ation is directed against that judgment.<br/> <br/>Mr. Moudud Ahmed, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner in the course of his argument upon placing the relevant materials on record including the order dated 19.11.2003 passed by  Artha Rin Adalat confirming the auction sale submits that both the Courts below erred in law in canceling the  auction sale dated 19.11.2003 without properly considering the facts of the case and the case made out by the petitioner and the same has occasioned failure of justice.  He next submits that the impugned judgments of both the   Courts below are perverse being contrary to law, evidence and materials on record inasmuch as  Order XXI, Rule 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure enables the Court  to interfere if fraud or any irregularity found in auction process but in this case there is nothing on record to suggest that any fraud or irregularity took place in auction process  and it is apparent from the record that the Artha Rin Adalat after exhausting all the legal formalities confirmed the auction sale by its order dated 19.11.2003 and as such  the  judgments of both the  Courts below are liable to be set-aside.  Mr. Moudud Ahmed further submits that  both the courts   below having failed to take into consideration that a great fraud has been committed by the judgment Debtor-Opposite party  Nos.3-6 in collaboration with the bank in obtaining a loan amounting to  Tk. 82,33,209.90/- by providing the only security of the schedule property for the aforesaid loan, the petitioner as a bonafide  auction purchaser has purchased the schedule property in the auction sale by offering the highest rate which is 7 (seven) times more than the mouza rate and thereby fell into an error of law resulting in an error in the impugned decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/>Drawing my attention  to the  list of  Mouza rate  under Hathazari Sub-registry office as evidenced by "Annexure-D" to the rvisisonal application Mr. Moudud Ahmed argues  that   at the time of the auction sale the Government market value of the lower land (Nal Jomi) at Mouza Mithachora under Hathazari upazila, District Chittagong was Tk. 3499/- per decimal and the petitioner has paid Tk. 25,000/- per decimal in total Tk. 4,00,000/- for the mortgaged    land, that is,   seven times more than the Mouza rate so, the plea as canvassed  by the opposite party No.1, Rupali Bank Limited in collusion with the judgment-debtors that  the auction price of the mortgaged property was shockingly low is untrue and without any legal basis. <br/> <br/>Mr. Moudud Ahmed  while elaborating his submission referred to the decision reported in 15 MLR(AD) 21 and submits that  the proposition of law is by now well settled that  execution proceedings ends with the completion of auction process in respect of the mortgaged property and once an auction sale is complete no relief is available against such auction sale  but the mortgagee may proceed against the mortgagor bank for any compensation if it is proved that there was illegality in the auction sale and  in this case it is apparent from the record that the Artha Executing Court   confirmed the auction sale by its order dated 19.11.2003 in accordance with law as there was no  allegation of fraud or irregularities in the auction sale process  but both the Courts below misconceived the facts of the case and the law  bearing on the subject and thereby wrongly set aside the auction sale confirmation order dated 19.11.2003.<br/> <br/>Mr. S. M. Harmuz Ahmed, the learned Advocate appearing for the opposite party No.1, on the other hand, by filing counter affidavit contested the Rule. He submits that both the Courts below were perfectly justified in setting-aside  auction sale inasmuch as actual price of the mortgaged property is far from Tk. 4,00,000/- and thereupon,  the loan defaulter, the proprietor of M/S N. G. Corporation,  Gobinda Chandra Sarker has signed and submitted an undertaking  on non-judicial stamp of Tk.150/- that if the loan is exempted, he is ready to pay a sum of Tk.40,00,000/- for the schedule property.  Finally, Mr. Harmuz Ahmed submits that the opposite party No.1, Rupali Bank Ltd, Andarkella Branch, Chittagong shall sustain irreparable loss and injury if the petitioner is allowed to purchase the mortgaged property only at Tk.4,00,000/- in the name of the highest bidding as the same is repugnant to the provision of section  33(2) Ga of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. The   judgment of both the Courts below are well founded in law and facts and  the same should not be disturbed.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Abul Kalam Patwary, the learned Advocate appearing for the opposite party Nos.2-5 ( judgment debtors) at the very outset adopting the submission of the learned Advocate for the opposite party No.1, Rupali Bank Ltd.  submits that the highest bid money amounting to  Tk. 4,00,000/=  is shockingly low from the actual price of the mortgaged property and opposite party Nos. 2-5  are ready to pay a sum of Tk.40,00,000/- for getting back their  mortgaged property.<br/> <br/>I have heard the learned Advocates of both the sides and perused the revisional application, judgments of two Courts below, counter affidavit dated 8.12.2012 filed by the opposite party No.1 and counter affidavit dated 10.01.2013 filed by the opposite party Nos.2-5 and other materials on record. Now, to appreciate the submissions of the learned Adv-ocates for the respective parties from a correct angle let me first look  whether Artha Rin Adalat committed any illegality in confirming auction sale by its order dated 19.11.2003.<br/> <br/>I have carefully examined the materials on record,  it appears that  the decree holder bank in Court process floated Tender on 18.10.2003 published in two Bengali news papers  namely, Daily Khabar and Daily Azadi for auction sale of the immovable mortgaged property as described in the schedule  under the provision of section 33(1) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 in which the petitioner and two others participated in depositing 25% of the bidding money with the quotation in favour of the Court  and among the other participants one of them offered Tk. 80,000/- and other Tk.1,20,000/- and the petitioner was selected as the highest bidder in the competitive auction sale on his offer Tk 4,00,000/ ( 4 Lac) . The  Artha Rin Adalat on  18.10.2003 accepted the offer of the petitioner being the highest offer and  directed the petitioner to deposit the rest of the  bid money  and sale fees. The petitioner then deposited the rest of the amount of Tk. 3,00,000/ and sale fee Tk. 4010 and then on 28.10.2003 the decree holder Bank filed an application under Order XXI, Rule 90 of the Civil Procedure Code for setting aside the sale on the ground that the bidding  amount  is  shockingly low which can not be considered at all a fair  price in view of the existing market price of the mortgaged property. <br/> <br/>The Artha Rin Adalat after hearing the parties by its order dated 28.10.2003 rejected the application and fixed the next date on 19.11.2003 for confirmation of the auction sale.  The Artha Rin Adalat after hearing the parties and on considering the materials on record and mouza rate under Hathazari Sub-registry office rejected the application by its order no. 18 dated 28.10.2003 on the finding that there was no illegality or irregularity in auction sale proceedings. It further appears from the Mouza rate   of  Mouza-Mithachhra under the Hathazari Sub-registry office, Chittagong (Annexure-D-1) that the value of low land was Tk.34,900/- per decimal and the petitioner offered Tk.25,000/- per decimal in total 4,00,000/- for the said land which is 7 (seven)  times more than the Mouza rate.<br/> <br/>On a query by me the learned Advocate for the opposite party-bank has found himself unable to refute the contention raised by Mr. Moudud Ahmed that the petitioner offered Tk.25,000/- per decimal in total 4,00,000/- for the  suit  land which is 7 (seven)  times more than the Mouza rate under Hathazari Sub-registry office and no  illegality or irregularity took place in the  auction sale proceedings. He, however, sought to argue that the courts below were perfectly justified in allowing the Misc. case and setting aside the auction sale. Therefore, I am constrained to hold that the learned judge of the Artha Executing Court on the facts of the case and on consideration of the legal position rightly   confirmed the auction sale after  rejecting  the application under Order XXI,  Rule 90 of the Civil Procedure Code for setting aside the auction sale filed by the decree holder bank.<br/> <br/>Now, let me look at the more important question whether the Courts  below were   justified in setting aside the auction sale of the mortgaged property on the finding that  the highest bidder  offered only an amount of TK. 4,00,000/- which is  very low than the existing market price of the valuable mortgaged property .<br/> <br/>To resolve this dispute, provisions of Order XXI, Rule 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure are required to be referred to for having a better view of the dispute in question. Order XXI, Rule 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure   reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>   “90—(1)  Where any immoveable property has been sold in execution of a decree, the decree-holder, or any person entitled to share in a rateable distribution of assets, or whose interests are affected by the sale, may apply to the Court to set aside the sale on the ground of a material irregularity or fraud in publishing or conducting it:</em><br/><em>   Provided that no sale shall be set aside on the ground of irregularity or fraud unless upon the facts proved the Court is satisfied that the applicant has sustained substantial injury by reason of such irregularity or fraud.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the above, it is clear that no sale shall be set aside on the ground of irregularity or fraud unless upon the facts proved the Court is satisfied that the applicant has sustained substantial injury by reason of such irregularity or fraud.<br/> <br/>As I have already noticed that  the decree holder bank filed an  application under Order XXI,  Rule 90 of the Civil Procedure Code for setting aside the auction sale and the learned Artha Rin Adalat-1, Chittagong  rejected the application on the ground that the auction purchaser is the highest bidder and he deposited the entire bidding  money and sale fees in time and the auction process has been conducted in presence of the decree holder bank and there was no allegation of fraud or irregularities in the auction sale process. Subsequently, the self same ground has been urged before the Artha Rin Adalat, Chittagong by the decree holder bank as was done before the Artha Executing Court  though the learned judge of the Artha Rin Adalat, Chittagong allowed the application of  the decree holder Bank filed under Order XXI, Rule 90 in Misc. Case No.4 of 2006 and set-aside the auction sale of the mortgage property on the findings that  the highest bidder  offered only an amount of TK. 4,00,000/- which is  very low than the existing market price of the valuable mortgaged property and the decree holder Rupali Bank raised objection against accepting such offer due to very low offer.<br/> <br/>In appeal, the Court of appeal below by the impugned judgment and order dated 17.05.2012 affirmed the said order of the  Artha Rin Adalat, Chittagong  on the finding that there is sufficient materials on record to come to the decision which has been arrived at by the  Court below.<br/> <br/>On a careful perusal of the entire order sheets of the Artha Executing Court, I find no allegation of fraud or irregularities in  the auction sale process of the mortgage property. The  Artha Rin Adalat, Chittagong on the facts of the case and on consideration of the legal position by its order dated  28.10.2003 rejected the application under Order XXI,  Rule 90 of the Civil Procedure Code for setting aside the auction sale filed by the decree holder bank. A few lines of the said order reads as follows :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>         “শুনিলাম। নথিসহ ডিক্রীদার প­ক্ষের দাখিলী দরখাস্ত দেখিলাম। দেখা যাই­তে­­ছ যে, বিগত ১৮/১০/০৩ ইং তারি­খ অত্র জারী মামলার তপশী­লের সম্পত্তি নিলাম বিক্রয়ের দিন ধার্য্য ছিল। উক্ত তারি­খ ৩ (তিন) জন দরদাতা দরপত্র দাখিল করিয়া নিলাম বিক্রয় অংশ গ্রহন ক­রে। তৎম­ধ্যে বাবুল চন্দ্র শীল কর্তৃক দাখিলী ৪,০০,০০০/- টাকার দরপত্র খানি স­র্বোচ্চ হওয়ায় ইহা গৃহীত হয়। বিধিম­ত স­র্বোচ্চ দরদাতা নির্ধারিত সম­­য়র ম­ধ্যে ড়তরন পনন  ও নিলা­মের সমুদয় মুল্য পরি­শোধ করিয়া­ছেন। ধার্য্য তারি­খে নিলাম বিক্রয় কার্যক্রম ডিক্রীদা­রের উপস্থিতিতে সম্পন্ন হইয়া­ছে। নিলাম বিক্রয় কার্যক্রম আইন মোতা­­বক পরিচালিত হওয়ায় উহা­তে কোন অনিয়ম অথবা প্রতারণার উদ্ভব হইয়া­ছে ম­র্মে প্রতীয়মান হয় না বিধায় ডিক্রীদা­রের অত্র দরখাস্ত বি­বেচনার যোগ্য ন­হে। কা­জেই ডিক্রীদা­রের অত্র দরখাস্ত না মঞ্জুর করা হই­ল আগামী ২১/১১/০৩ ইং তারি­খ নিলাম স্থায়ীকরণ (confirm) আ­দেশ প্রচা­রের জন্য দিন ধার্য্য করা হইল।<br/>This finding is one of fact  based on correct evaluation of the facts and materials on record.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is clear from  the above quoted finding of the  Artha Executing Court that there was  no  fraud or irregularities in the auction sale  process  and  the auction sale of the mortgaged property was held in accordance with law.  The Artha Executing Court after having exhausted all procedure under the Ain confirmed the auction sale by its order dated 19.11.2003.  I do not think therefore that both the courts below  made a correct approach to the simple problem. Besides, on top of that admittedly the petitioner offered Tk.25,000/- per decimal in total  Tk. 4,00,000/- for the  suit  land which is 7 (seven)  times more than the Mouza rate under Hathazari Sub-registry office, District Chittagong. Both the Courts below  without comparing the bidding price with the Mouza rate of the local sub-registry office came to an erroneous finding that  the highest bidder offered only an amount of Tk. 4,00,000/- which is very low than the existing market price of the valuable mortga-ged property  which resulted in the failure of justice.<br/> <br/>Thus evidently auction sale having taken place and sale having been confirmed by the Artha Rin Adalat after rejecting an application under Order XXI, rule 90 Code of Civil Procedure filed by the decree holder bank as there was no allegation of fraud or irregula-rities in the auction sale process.  Under such circumstances both the Courts below without existence of the legal requirements as laid down in Order XXI, rule 90 of the Code acted illegally in allowing the Misc. Case under the said  rule  for setting aside the auction sale and the same has occasioned failure of justice.<br/> <br/>In the case of Sonali Bank Vs. Artha Rin Adalat and others reported in 15 MLR(AD) 21, it has been held as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong><em>   “We have perused the writ petition as well as the order dated 02.01.2005 and 9.01.2005 passed in Mortgaged Execution Case No.8 of 1995 and the judgment and order passed in the writ petition and considered the submission made by the learned Advocate appearing for the leave petitioner. It appears that the leave petitioner bank is negligent in not informing the executing Court about the fact of restoration of the rule and stay dated 15.6.2006 and that the leave petitioner bank by filing an application on 25.6.2006 prayed for receiving the pay order submitted by the auction purchaser in Court and it appears from the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division that the leave petitioner bank has already encashed the pay order and thereby accepted the auction sale. In view of the provision of law to the effect that once an auction is complete no relief is available against such auction sale but the mortgagee may proceed against the mortgagor  bank for any compensation, if it is proved that there was illegality in the auction sale. In the instant case, it is not such case rather it appears that at the instant of the decree holder bank auction was held and ultimately the decree holder bank has withdrawn the money deposited by the auction purchaser. After the auction process is completed, proceeding with the execution case is redundant.”</em></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the above, I find a clear view of the law as it stands today that once an auction sale is complete no relief is available against such auction sale but the mortgagee may proceed against the mortgagor bank for any compensation, if it is proved that there was illegality in the auction sale.<br/> <br/>In this case I have already indicated that  the auction purchaser was  the highest bidder,  who deposited the entire bidding  money and sale fees in time as per order of the executing Court and the auction process has been conducted in presence of the decree holder bank and there was  no allegation of fraud or  irregularity or illegality in the auction sale process. Therefore, I am inclined to hold that both the courts below committed wrong  in holding that the highest bidder appellant offered only an amount of TK. 4,00,000/- which was very low than the existing market price of the valuable mortgaged property without comparing the bidding price with the Mouza rate of  the local sub-registry office and  without applying its judicial mind into the facts and circumstances of the case and law bearing on the subject and the same has resulted in an error in the impugned decision occasioning failure of justice. The contentions raised by the learned Advocates on behalf of the opposite parties for the aforesaid reasons are of no substance.<br/> <br/>Incidentally, it may be mentioned that the grievance of Mr. Moudud Ahmed to the effect that both the Courts below having failed to take into consideration that a great fraud has been committed by the judgment Debtor-Opposite Parties Nos.3-6 in collaboration with the Bank in obtaining a loan amount of Tk. 82,33,209.90/- by providing the only security of the schedule  property for the aforesaid loan in the facts and circumstance of the case   does not appear to be without any substance.<br/> <br/>In view of my discussions made in the foregoing paragraphs it is by now clear that the instant Rule must succeed. <br/> <br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute without any order as to costs. The impugned judgment and order dated 17.5.2012 passed by the learned District Judge, Chittagong in Misc. Appeal No.28 of 2012 and the  order No. 58 dated 28.4.2010 passed  by the  Artha Rin Adalat, Chittagong in Misc. Case No.04 of 2006 are set-aside and the order dated 19.11.2003 passed by the Artha Execution Court  in Artha Rin Jari Case No.183 of 2003 is restored.<br/> <br/>Let a copy of this judgment be communicated to the Courts concerned at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

From the materials on record both the Tribunal and the High Court Division concurrently found that the respondent No.1 violated the Rule by </strong><strong>misrepresenting himself as an Advocate before</strong><strong> the Assistant Settlement Officer and acted against interest of the complainant-appellant and accordingly he was found guilty of gross professional misconduct....(23)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Words and Phrases </strong><br/><strong>Misconduct</strong><br/><strong>The term 'misconduct' has not been defined </strong><strong>in the Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar</strong><strong> Council Order, 1972 or the Rules framed thereunder. According to Black's Law Dictionary 'misconduct' means "A dereliction of duty; unlawful or improper behaviour." Affirmative misconduct means an affirmative act of misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact. According to the Supreme Court of India the word 'misconduct' has no precise meaning, and its scope and ambit has to be construed with reference to the subject matter and context wherein the term occurs. Accordingly, it can be said that the misconduct of an Advocate may be defined as any conduct that in any way renders an Advocate unfit for the exercise of his profe-ssion, or is likely to hamper or embarrass the administration of justice for which disciplinary action may be initiated....(33 and 34)                                                                               </strong><br/> <br/><strong>Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and </strong><strong>Bar Council Order, 1972 ( P.O No. 46 of 1972)</strong><br/><strong>Articles 34(8) and 36(1)</strong><br/><strong>Admittedly, the instant appeal before this Division was preferred by the complainant-appellant being aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division in respect of modification of the order of sentence debarring the respondent No.1 from practicing in the legal profession permanently for life to a period of 5(five) years on the ground that it was not in conformity with the gravity of the offence committed by the respondent No.1.</strong><br/><strong>The Respondent No. 1 committed gross </strong><strong>Professional misconduct  of the highest decree</strong> <strong>which not only obstructed the administration</strong><strong> of  justice but  also eroded the reputation  of  the Legal Profession  in the opinion  of  the public  and that not  being enrolled  as an advocate and engaged on behalf of the appellant,  the respondent No. 1 represented  himself as an engaged Advocate on behalf of the appellant in objection  case before the Assistant Settlement Officer and that the respondent no.1 being an Advocate of the other side expressed his desire by his letters dated 17-05-1998 and 07-06-1998 to help the complainant-appellant in a wakf case out of the way and thus the respondent no.1 intended to represent conflicting interests and thereby committed gross professional  misconduct and  as such the sentence of debarring the respondent No. 1 from pursuing legal profession permanently for life is not at all harsh, rather, it is very much conformity with the offence committed by </strong><strong>him. The respondent No. 1 behavior was very</strong><strong> much unbecoming as a member of the noble profession and the Bangladesh Bar Council rightly took disciplinary proceedings against him......

Muzammel Hossain, CJ:</strong></span><br/><br/>This appeal by leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 20.03.2006 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in First Miscellaneous Appeal No.199 of 2005 dismissing the appeal with modification of sentence debarring the respondent No.1 from pursuing his legal profession permanently for life to a period of 5(five) years in any Court in Bangladesh.<br/><br/>The appellant as complainant instituted Complaint Case No.22 of 2001 (15 of 2001) against the respondent No.1 in the Bangladesh Bar Council which was subsequently transferred to Tribunal No.1 of the Bangladesh Bar Council for disposal.<br/><br/>The case of the complainant-appellant in brief is that his father was an Advocate and that he and his brothers have been in possession of the property of Ramnagar Mauza along with different properties by way of inheritance. Objection Case No.235 of 1997 was filed by the appellant and his brothers before the Assistant Settlement Officer, Dagonbhuiyan, Noakhali praying for correct-ion of recent survey map in respect of their inherited landed property. The objection case was fixed for hearing on 03.06.1997 but the appellant being unaware of the date of hearing was absent and could not take steps. The respondent No.1, the full sister's son of Imam Hossain and others, the opposite parties of objection case being gained over by them appeared in the said objection case representing himself as an Advocate on behalf of the complainant-appellant and prayed for dismissal of the said objection case on the ground that the complainant-appellant had relinquished their claim over the land and thereby got the said objection case dismissed by practicing fraud. Hence the respondent No.1 committed gross professional misconduct.<br/>The defence case is that the allegation of fraud is false, concocted and the same is the result of personal enmity. The respondent No.1 received his licence on 06.12.1998. The cause of action of this case arose prior to the receipt of his licence from the Bar Council. Therefore the complaint petition does not come under the purview of the Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Order, 1972 and the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to take cognizance against the complainant-appellant and to pass the impugned judgment and order.<br/><br/>In the complaint case complainant-appellant filed an application praying for calling for the records of objection case No.235 of 1997 in respect of the property of Mouza Ramnagar within Police Station Dagonbhuiyan, District-Feni from the office of Assistant Settlement Officer, Dagonbhuiyan. He also filed another application praying for amendment of the complaint case to the following effect:- "প্রকাশ থাকে যে, উক্ত এ্যাডভোকেট মোঃ আমীর হোসেন সম্পর্কে আমার ভাগিনা হয় অর্থাৎ আমার চাচাত বোনের ছেলে। পক্ষান্তরে এ্যাডভোকেট মোঃ আমীর হোসেন আমার আপত্তি কেসের বিবাদী ইমাম চৌধুরী ওরফে মনির ভাগিনা অর্থাৎ সৎ বোনের ছেলে। প্রতিপক্ষ জনাব মোঃ আমীর হোসেন এল.এল.বি পাস করার পর অত্র মামলার বাদী ইসরারুল হক চৌধুরীর নিকট গত ১৭-৫-১৯৯৮ইং তারিখে একটি পত্র লেখেন। উক্ত পত্রে তিনি অত্র মামলার বাদীর পক্ষে কাজ করার জন্য আগ্রহ প্রকাশ করেছেন এবং ইহাও চিঠিতে লিখিয়াছেন যে, আমি একজন নতুন উকিল এবং আমার প্রতি একটু সদয় দৃষ্টি রাখিবেন। তিনি ঐ চিঠিতে আরও উল্লেখ করিয়াছেন যে, আমি যদিও প্রকাশ্যে মনি মামার সাথে থাকিয়া কাজ করিব ইহাতে আপনি আমাকে ভুল বুঝিবেন না কেননা প্রকৃত পক্ষে আমি আপনার হয়ে গোপনে কাজ করিব। অতঃপর উক্ত মোঃ আমীর হোসেন আর একখানা পত্র বিগত ৭-৬-৯৮ ইং তারিখে অত্র মামলার বাদীর বরাবরে প্রেরণ করেন। উহাতে তিনি ওয়াকফ এস্টেটের মামলার ব্যপারেও অত্র মামলার বাদীর পক্ষে কাজ করিবার ইচ্ছা প্রকাশ করিয়াছেন এবং সবচেয়ে গুরুত্বপুর্ণ বিষয় এই যে, উক্ত চিঠিতে নিজেকে এ্যাডভোকেট হিসেবে প্রকাশ করিয়াছেন। উল্লেখিত দুইখানা চিঠি পাঠ করিলে যে কোন লোক বুঝিতে পারিবে তিনি একজন প্রতারক ব্যতীত কিছুই নন।"<br/><br/>The respondent No.1 did not file any written objection against the aforesaid applications. During hearing on 09.05.2002 he ad-mitted the statements made in the amendment petition that those two letters dated 17.05.1998 and 07.06.1998 were written by him. Thereafter, the Tribunal No.1 by its order dated 09.05.2002 allowed both the applications observing, inter-alia, that the O.P. submitted that he had no objection to the aforesaid prayers of the complainant as to the amendment and calling for the records. The amendment petition accordingly formed part of the original complaint. The records of objection Case No. 235 in respect of Mouza Ramnagar JL No.76 PS Dagonbhuiyan, District Feni was called for from the Office of Assistant Settlement Officer, Dagonbhuiyan, Feni for proper adjudication of the instant case.<br/><br/>The original case record of Objection Case No.235 of 1997 was sent to the Tribunal by a special messenger and the same was received by the Tribunal by its order dated 10.07.2003 for examination and verification of the original signature of the respondent No.1. Thereafter, the Tribunal examined and verified the original signature of respondent No.1 put on the original objection case record with that of the signature put by him on the written statement filed before the Tribunal. The Tribunal after close examination and verification found that the original signature dated 03.06.1997 of the respondent No.1 purportedly put on the objection case tallies with that of the signature of the respondent No.1 put on the written statement which was also not denied by the respondent No.1.<br/><br/>The respondent No.1 in his additional written statement reiterated the statements made by him in the written statement. In paragraph Nos.3 and 5 of the additional written statement it was stated that he simply subscribed his signature stating "দাবী নাই".<br/><br/>Both the parties were heard at length before the Tribunal. Finally, the Tribunal No.1 by its judgment and order dated 15.01.2004 was pleased to debar the respondent No.1 from pursuing his legal profession permanently for life in any court, chamber and or before any judicial or quasi-judicial authority in Bangla-desh and his name was struck off from the Roll of Advocates of the Bangladesh Bar Council and his sanad as an Advocate granted and issued by the Bangladesh Bar Council stood cancelled with immediate effect holding, inter-alia, that after close examination and verification it was found that the original signature dated 03.06.1997 of the respondent No.1 purportedly put on the objection case tallies with that of the signature of the respondent No.1 put on the written statement which was also not denied by the respondent No.1. The order dated 03.06.1997 passed by the Assistant Settlement Officer, Dagonbhuiyan in the objection case stated that the respondent No.1 made submissions and prayer for dismissal of the case on behalf of the complainant appellant. The Assistant Settlement Officer by his order dated 03.06.1997 dismissed the case with the following observation:- "বাদী পক্ষে জনাব আমীর হোসেন এ্যাডভোকেট উপস্থিত আছেন। বিবাদী পক্ষ অনুপস্থিত। বাদী পক্ষ দাবী প্রত্যাহার করাতে কেসটি খারিজ হয়।"<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order of the Tribunal No.1 the respondent No.1 filed review petition under Article 34(8) of the Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Order,1972 before the Tribunal No.1 stating, inter-alia, that after the disposal of the Objection Case No.235 of 1997 the complainant-appellant filed an application before the Director General, Land Records and Survey Department, Dhaka on 13.11.2000 making allegations against the respondent No.1. An enquiry was held by one Mahbub Mowla, Assistant Settlement Officer, Sudharam, who issued notices upon the parties including the respondent No.1 on 27.02.2001. The complainant-appellant in collusion with the said Mahbub Mawla put pressure upon the respondent No.1 and in various places the word "Adv" i.e. Advocate was written by showing that the respondent No.1 had already been enrolled as an Advocate in 2001. The respondent No.1 relying on the said suggestion had written in many places the word "Adv". For allegedly writing the word "Advocate" before becoming an Advocate and observation as to facts and findings of the Tribunal has seriously prejudiced the whole career of the respondent No.1. The finding of the Tribunal No.1 to the effect that without being an Advocate "got the case dismissed relinquishing the claim of the complainant over their property" is not at all correct or true. The respondent No.1 also challenged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and prayed for adducing fresh evidence after restoration of the original complaint case.<br/><br/>The complainant-appellant filed written objection denying all material allegations made in the review petition stating, inter-alia, that the review petition is not maintainable in law and the same is barred by limitation. The respondent No.1 failed to make out a case for review. The further case of the appellant is that no additional written statement was filed by the review petitioner against the statements made by way of amendment of complaint, rather, the respondent No.1 admitted at the time of hearing of the amendment petition on 09.05.2002 that those two letters dated 17.05.1998 and 07.06.1998 were written by him. The respondent No.1 represented conflicting interests. The Tribunal passed its judgment and order based on official record of the government and the Tribunal is empowered under the law to dispose of a case without any oral evidence and in the present case both the parties declined to adduce any oral evidence and as such the judgment and order of the Tribunal is in accordance with law and it is not liable to be set aside. The respondent No.1 committed gross professional misconduct and the judgment and order of the Tribunal was passed in accordance with law and the question of writing the word "Advocate" before becoming an Advocate and the observation that the facts and findings of the Tribunal has prejudiced the whole career of the respondent No.1 does not arise at all, rather the respondent No.1 deserved such punishment. The finding of the Tribunal is absolutely correct and legal. The respondent No.1 having not been engaged as an Advocate on behalf of the complainant-appellant represented himself as an Advocate of the complainant-appellant and appeared before the Assistant Settlement Officer and relinquished the right of the appellant in writing as a result of which the objection case was dismissed causing loss and damage to the appellant and as such he committed gross professional misconduct on 03.06.1997. Further, the respondent No.1 committed gross professional misconduct on 17.05.1998 and 07.06.1998 being an Advocate of other side he expressed his desire to help the appellant in a wakf case out of the way. The conduct of the respondent No.1 is highly immoral and as such he should not be allowed to continue his legal profession as an Advocate. The respondent No.1 was rightly and legally debarred from pursuing his legal profession permanently for life and consequently his sanad as an Advocate was cancelled. The immoral activities of the respondent No.1 on 03.06.1997, 17.05.1998 and 07.06.1998 clearly show that the respondent No.1 committed gross professional misconduct which attracts the provisions of the Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Order and Rules,1972 and the Canons of Professional Conduct and Etiquette and his subsequent enrolment on 06.12.1998 as an Advocate will not absolve him from the clutches of the provisions of law and as such the Tribunal has rightly debarred the respon-dent No.1 from pursuing his legal profession for life by their judgment and order dated 15.01.2004. In spite of the said judgment and order of the Tribunal the respondent No.1 did not stop his practice, rather, he was pursuing his legal profession in the different courts of Noakhali District  flouting the judgment and order of the Tribunal which will be evident from the letter under Reference No.53 dated 07.04.2004 issued by the Secretary, District Bar Association, Noakhali informing the Additional District Magistrate, Noakhali that the respondent No.1 along with others had been debarred from pursuing their legal profession for life but they disobeyed such order and continued their legal practice as before and the clients were deceived and cheated by the respondent No.1. The respondent No.1 disobeyed and flouted the judgment and order of the Tribunal which is tantamount to contempt of court and as such respondent No.1 is not entitled to get any relief whatsoever in the application for review.<br/><br/>After hearing both the parties Tribunal No.1 by its judgment and order dated 09.08.2005 rejected the review petition.<br/><br/>The respondent No.1 being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order of the Tribunal No.1 preferred an appeal being First Miscellaneous Appeal No.199 of 2005 before the High Court Division. Thereafter, the High Court Division by its judgment and order dated 20.03.2006 was pleased to dismiss the miscellaneous appeal with modification of the sentence debarring the respondent No.1 from pursuing his legal profession permanently for life to a period of 5(five) years.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order dated 20.03.2006 passed by the High Court Division in First Miscellaneous Appeal No.199 of 2005, the complainant-appellant preferred the instant appeal with the leave of this Court.<br/><br/>Leave was granted to consider the following submissions of the learned Advocate for the complainant-appellant:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align:justify">The Tribunal of the Bangladesh Bar Council after considering the whole matter came to the conclusion that the respondent No.1 committed gross misconduct inasmuch as the respondent No.1 styled, pretended and represented himself as an Advocate falsely long before his enrolment as an Advocate and without being engaged as an Advocate by the complainant-appellant, the respondent No.1 falsely represented in the objection case before the Assistant Settlement Officer and got the objection case dismissed relinquishing the claim of the complainant-appellant causing serious sufferings to the appellant as a result of which the respondent No.1 was legally debarred from pursuing his legal profession permanently which, on review, was maintained by the Tribunal No.1 inasmuch as there was no ground for review and even the High Court Division came to the finding that the impugned judgment and order passed in the complaint petition and that in the review are proper but illegally modified the quantum of sentence to a period of 5(five) years which is not permissible in an appeal from review and therefore, the judgment and order of the High Court Division is not sustainable in law.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The respondent No.1 being an Advocate of other side expressed his desire by letters dated 17.05.1998 and 07.06.1998 to help the complainant-appellant in wakf case out of the way and thus the respondent No.1 intended to represent conflicting interests and by the aforementioned two letters the respondent No.1 committed gross misconduct twice independent of the allegation of committing gross misconduct made in the original petition of complaint and as such the order of sentence debarring the respondent No.1 from pursuing legal profession permanently for life is not at all harsh and it is in conformity with the offence committed, rather, the respondent No.1 deserves such punishment and therefore, the judgment and order of the High Court Division is not sustainable in law.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The respondent No.1, inspite of the judgment and order of the Tribunal, although he failed to obtain any order of stay of the same, did not stop his practice, rather, he has been pursuing his legal profession in different courts of Noakhali District flouting the judgment and order of the Tribunal inasmuch as the Secretary, District Bar Association, Noakhali issued a letter under reference No.53 dated 07.04.2004 informing the Additional District Magistrate, Noakhali that the respondent No.1 along with others have been debarred from pursuing their legal profession for life but they disobeyed such order and continued their legal profession as before and the clients have been deceived and cheated by the respondent No.1 and  another similar letter dated 07.04.2004 of the Noakhali District Bar Association reveals that even after the filing of the application for review before the Tribunal, the respondent No.1 has been pursuing his legal profession and considering the matter as a whole, the respondent No.1 deserves the cancellation of his sanad as an Advocate debarring him from pursuing legal profession permanently for life, otherwise, the litigant public of Noakhali District will be deceived and cheated every now and then and therefore, the judgment and order of the High Court Division is not sustainable in law.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, the learned Advocate on behalf of the appellant reiterating the grounds taken in the leave granting order has submitted that the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division is not sustainable in law. Then he has submitted that the respondent No.1 committed gross misconduct, inasmuch as he styled, pretended and represented himself as an Advocate falsely long before his enrolment as an Advocate and without having been engaged as an Advocate by the appellant, the respondent No.1 falsely represented the appellant in the objection case on 03.06.1997 before the Assistant Settlement Officer and got the objection case dismissed relinquishing the claim of the appellant causing serious loss and damage to the appellant and the respondent No.1 being an Advocate of other side expressed his desire by letters dated 17.05.1998 and 07.06.1998 to help the appellant in waqf case out of the way representing conflicting interests and the respondent No.1 flouted the judgment and order of the Tribunal as he pursued his legal profession inspite of the judgment and order of the Tribunal debarring him from pursuing his legal profession as revealed from the letter dated 07.04.2004 issued by the Secretary, Noakhali District Bar Association notwi-thstanding that the High Court Division modified the quantum of sentence from debarring the respondent No.1 from pursuing his legal profession permanently, for life, to a period of 5(five) years amounting to a premium for such activities which he is not entitled to and therefore, the judgment of the High Court Division is not sustainable in law and as such the appeal is liable to be allowed.<br/> <br/>Mr. Azizul Huq, the learned Advocate appearing for the respondent No.1 has submitted that the Bar Council has no jurisdiction to bring the respondent No.1 within the purview of professional misconduct as the offence was alleged to have been committed by the respondent No.1 on 03.06.1997 when he was not enrolled as an Advocate and no licence was granted to him by the Bar Council and as such the Tribunal failed to consider that if any offence is at all committed by the respondent No.1 at the relevant time it was committed not as an Advocate but as a private person and as such the Tribunal wrongly rejected the review petition. The learned Advocate for the respondent No.1 has referred to the decision of the case of Bal Dev Sing Dhingra -Vs- Madan Lal Gupta AIR 1999 SC 902 wherein it was held that Section 35 empowers the Bar Council to exercise its disciplinary jurisdiction to punish practicing Advocates on the roll if they have committed professional or other misconduct by practicing fraud and Section 35 has nothing to do with misconduct of non-practicing Advocates who might have committed any such misconduct when his name on the roll of the said Bar Council remained suspended. Mr. Huq has also submitted that the appeal is liable to be dismissed because of the reference to the two letters dated 17.05.1998 and 07.06.1998 and the leave granting order also laid too much emphasis in that regard against the respondent No.1 inasmuch as those letters were not at all referred to in the Tribunal nor in the High Court Division, for the first time the appellant referred to those letters about which the respondent No.1 was not aware of it. The learned Advocate for the respondent No.1 has further submitted that because of the fact that the respondent No.1 never filed any vokalatnama on behalf of the appellant in objection Case No.235 of 1997 for correction of survey map, so as to show him that by practicing fraud he styled himself as an Advocate is wrong conception inasmuch as the respondent No.1 is the relation of both the complainant-appellant and the opposite party in the objection case. He has contended that the allegations levelled against the respondent No.1 that flouting the judgment and order of the Tribunal of the Bangladesh Bar Council, the respondent No.1 has been pursuing his legal profession is utterly false and fabricated statements and that such assertion was not made by the appellant neither before the High Court Division nor before the Tribunal. Mr. Huq has finally submitted that the High Court Division rightly found that the impugned order of sentence debarring the respondent No.1 from practicing his legal profession permanently for life is too harsh and not in conformity with the offence committed and as such the appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>We have heard the learned Counsel for both the parties, perused the Leave Granting Order, impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, Concise Statements submitted on behalf of both the parties and also other materials available on record.<br/> <br/>In this case complainant-appellant lodged a complaint petition before the Bangladesh Bar Council alleging misconduct of the respondent No.1 who was a member of the Noakhali District Bar Association and prayed for cancellation of his sanad. The complainant-appellant alleged that he and his brother had filed objection case No.235 of 1997 before the Assistant Settlement Officer, Dagonbhuiyan, Noakhali praying for correction of survey map in respect of their inherited property. As the complainant was not aware of the date of hearing fixed on 03.06.1997 he was absent and could not take any step on that date. The respondent No.1 being the full sister's son of one Imam Hossain Chowdhury who was the opposite party in the objection case appeared in the said objection case pretending to be the engaged Advocate of the complainant-appellant and prayed for dismissal of the said objection case on the ground that the complainant-appellant relinquished their claim over the disputed land and accordingly the objection case was dismissed and thus the respondent No.1 practicing fraud managed to have the objection case dismissed causing serious loss and damage to the complainant-appellant. It appears that hearing of the objection case took place before the Assistant Settlement Officer on 03.06.1997 and admittedly the respondent No.1 was enrolled as an Advocate on 06.12.1998. It has been argued on behalf of the respondent No.1 that since he received his sanad on 06.12.1998 he could not be prosecuted by the Bangladesh Bar Council for the alleged occurrence held on 03.06.1997. In view of the aforesaid submission the Bar Council-Tribunal having examined and verified the original signature of the respondent No.1 said to have been put on the objection case records as an Advocate with that of his signature put on the written statement filed before the Bar Council-Tribunal and the personal file of the respondent No.1 as an Advocate in respect of his enrollment with the Bangladesh Bar Council, the Tribunal found that the original signature of the respondent No.1 dated 03.06.1997 purportedly put on the objection case tallies with the signature of the respondent No.1 admittedly put on the written statement. It also appears that the Assistant Settlement Officer recorded the order dated 03.06.1997 to the following effect: "বাদী পক্ষে জনাব আমীর হোসেন এ্যাডভোকেট উপস্থিত আছেন। বিবাদী পক্ষ অনুপস্থিত। বাদী পক্ষ দাবী প্রত্যাহার করাতে কেসটি খারিজ হয়।"<br/><br/>The respondent No.1 in his additional written statement dated 18.09.2003 filed before the Tribunal stated that he simply subscribed his signature stating "দাবী নাই". The Tribunal also found that the complainant-appellant had neither engaged the respondent No.1 on his behalf as an Advocate by executing vokalatnama nor issued any authority to represent him in the case. Having perused the records of the objection case and other materials on record, the Tribunal rightly found that the respondent No.1 styled, pretended and misrepresented himself as an Advocate long before his enrolment as an Advocate with the Bangladesh Bar Council and without being engaged as an Advocate by the complainant-appellant, the respondent No.1 misrepresented himself as an engaged Advocate of the appellant in the objection case before the Assistant Settlement Officer and got the objection case dismissed causing serious loss and damage to the appellant. From the forgoing discussions we find that the respondent No.1 not being an Advocate falsely representing himself as an Advocate appeared before the Assistant Settlement Officer on 03.06.1997 long before his enrollment as an Advocate and by practicing fraud he represented the complainant-appellant not having been engaged as an Advocate before the Assistant Settlement Officer and got the case dismissed relinquishing the claim of the complainant-appellant over the property. This conduct of the respondent No.1 is highly immoral, reprehensible and beyond the dignity, ethics and morality and in that view of the matter the Tribunal rightly found that the respondent No.1 committed gross misconduct which is very much unbecoming of a member of the Bar. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 15.01.2004 passed by the Tribunal in the complaint case, the respondent No.1 filed a review petition before the Tribunal. Under Article 36(1) of the Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Order,1972 the respondent No.1 could have preferred an appeal to the High Court Division against the order dated 15.01.2004 passed by the Tribunal under Article 34 of the said Order. It will be profitable for us to quote the relevant provisions of Article 34 of the Order,1972 which read as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"34(1) In enquiries relating to conduct of Advocates, a Tribunal shall follow such procedure as may be prescribed.<br/>(2) ---------------- ------- -------<br/>(3) ----------- -------------- ----------------<br/>(4) On completion of the enquiry the Tribunal may either dismiss the complaint or, where reference to the Tribunal was made at the motion of the Bar Council, direct that the proceedings be filed; or it may make an order imposing any of the penalties referred to in clause (1) of Article 32."<br/>(5) Where the Tribunal makes an order for the suspension of an advocate from practice, it shall specify the period of suspension, and for that period the advocate shall be debarred from practicing in any court or before any authority or person in Bangladesh.<br/>(6) The Tribunal may make such order as to the costs of proceedings before it as it may deem fit; and where the Tribunal is of the opinion that a complaint made against an Advocate is false and vexatious, it may, in addition, and without prejudice to any other remedy available to the Advocates, impose deterrent costs not exceeding a sum of five hundred taka upon the complainant, which shall be paid to the Advocate as compensation.<br/>(7)  --------- ---------------- ------------------ ---------------- -------------<br/>(8) The Tribunal may of its own motion or on application made to it in this behalf, review any order passed under clause (4) or (6) and maintain, vary or rescind the same, as it thinks fit.<br/>(9) When any advocate is reprimanded or suspended under this Order, a record of the punishment shall be entered against his name in the roll and when an advocate is removed from practice his name shall forthwith be struck off the roll; and the certificate of any advocate so suspended or removed shall be recalled."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In this context it is pertinent to reproduce Article 36 of the Order of 1972 which reads as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"36(1) Any person aggrieved by an order of a Tribunal under Article 34 may, within ninety days from the date of the communication of the order to him, prefer an appeal to the High Court.<br/>(2) Every such appeal shall be heard by a Division Bench of the High Court which may pass such order thereon as it may deem fit and the order of the High Court shall be final."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>But without preferring any appeal the respondent No.1 preferred a review before the Tribunal against the judgment and order dated 15.01.2004 asserting the same grounds which were mooted before the Tribunal in the complaint case. Both the High Court Division and the Tribunal rightly found that the respondent No.1 preferred review on the self same grounds which were heard in the complaint case before the Tribunal. It is well established that a review is not intended to empower the Court for correcting a mistaken view of law, taken in the main judgment. In the case of Secretary, Ministry of Finance and others -Vs- Mr. Md. Masdar Hossain and others reported in 2001 BLD (AD) 126 this Division expounded the principle as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"A review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is reheard and corrected. A review lies where an error apparent on the face of the record exists. It is not a re-hearing of the main appeal. Review is not intended to empower the Court to correct a mistaken view of law, if any, taken in the main judgment. It is only a clerical mistake or mistake apparent on the face of the record that can be corrected by the leave but does not include the correction of any erroneous view of law taken by the Court. Since this Court in its judgment dated 2.12.1999 has considered the grounds of this appeal and since we find that there is no error apparent on the face of the record we do not find any reason to reconsider direction Nos.4 and 6. Even reconsideration of points wrongly or rightly considered in an appeal decided by this Division without any error apparent on the face of record is no ground for review of a judgment."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In view of the above decisions of this Division, the High Court Division rightly held that by preferring a review an erroneous decision can not be re-heard and corrected. A review lies where an error apparent on the face of the record exists. It is not the re-hearing of the main appeal. In a review a Court is not empowered to change the decision taken in the main judgment. It is only meant for correction of clerical error or mistake on the face of the record. Under Article 34(8) of the Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Order,1972 the Tribunal may of its own motion or on application made to it in this behalf, review any order passed under clause (4) or (6) and maintain, vary or rescind the said order. In the instant case there is no legal ground for review which was rightly found by the High Court Division and accordingly dismissed the appeal. Rule 6 of Chapter-IV of the Bangladesh Bar Council Canons of Professional Conduct and Etiquette provides that an Advocate shall not communicate with, or appear before a public officer, board, committee or body, in the professional capacity, without first disclosing that he is an Advocate representing interests that may be affected by the action of such officer, board, committee or body. From the materials on record both the Tribunal and the High Court Division concurrently found that the respondent No.1 violated the Rule by misrepresenting himself as an Advocate before the Assistant Settlement Officer and acted against interest of the complainant-appellant and accordingly he was found guilty of gross professional misconduct. In this context we may profitably refer to the decision of the case of Kazi Abdul Khaleque -Vs- Haji A.F. Rahman and others reported in 1983 BCR (AD) 397 wherein this Division dismissed the appeal of the concerned Advocate as gross misconduct was committed by him. In this case as reported in 1982 BCR (HCD) 240 one Kazi Abdul Khaleque was permanently removed from the Roll of Advocates of the Bar Council as an Advocate by the Tribunal on the ground that he had obtained an appointment of Legal Adviser-ship of Alijan Jute Mills falsely representing himself as an Advocate before his enrolment and also interpolated in the figures of actual retainer-ship fees and case fees.<br/> <br/>We are of the view that the principle enunciated in the decision reported in 1983 BCR (AD) 397 is very much applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case. It is truism that the respondent No.1 was not enrolled as an Advocate when the cause of action arose but fact remains that the respondent No.1 represented himself as an Advocate before the Assistant Settlement Officer in the objection case without having been enrolled as an Advocate and no power was filed on his behalf in the objection case before the Assistant Settlement Officer but in the relevant documents he wrote the word "Adv" and put his signature thereon. We have already noticed that the respondent No.1 made submission and prayed for dismissal of the objection case on behalf of the complainant-appellant before the Assistant Settlement Officer and in his additional written statement dated 18.09.2003 the respondent No.1 before the Tribunal admitted that he had simply subscribed his signature stating that he had no claim. The Tribunal also from the record found that the complainant-appellant did not at any point of time engaged the respondent No.1 as an Advocate on his behalf by executing vokalatnama or by any other authority. This shows that the respondent No.1 without having been engaged by the complainant-appellant in the objection case misrepresented him before the Assistant Settlement Officer pretending to be an Advocate and prayed for dismissal of the objection case. This conduct of the respondent No.1 is highly immoral, reprehensible and beyond the dignity, ethics and morality. In that view of the matter there is no hesitation in holding that the respondent No.1 committed gross professional misconduct which is unbecoming of a member of the noble profession of Advocates. The expression "professional misconduct" has not been defined in the Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Order,1972 (P.O. No.46 of 1972). However, the Bangladesh Bar Council under Article 44 (g) of the P.O. No.46 of 1972 adopted the Canons of Professional Conduct and Etiquette with the object of releasing ideal justice to all citizens, the equal protection of law and thereby secures to them the enjoyment of their lives, property and honour and an indispensable condition of such protection of the rights of citizens is the existence in society of a community of Advocates, men learned in the law and respected as models of integrity, imbued with the spirit of public service and dedicated to the task of upholding the rule of law and defending at all times, without fear or favour, the rights of citizens and in order effectively to discharge these high duties Advocates must conform to certain norms of correct conduct in their relations with members of the profession, their clients, the courts and the members of the public generally and accordingly the Bangladesh Bar Council has formulated such norms of correct conduct into a set of Canons of Professional Conduct and Etiquette. It is pertinent to quote the relevant provisions of Chapter-II of the Canons of Professional Conduct and Etiquette concerning conduct with regard to clients which read as under:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"1. An Advocate shall not acquire an interest adverse to a client in the property or interest involved in the case. <br/>2. An Advocate shall not accept employment adverse to a client or former client, relating to a matter in reference to which he has obtained confidential information by reason of or in the course of his employment by such client or former client provided that an Advocate, who has not been formally engaged by a person and accepted a retainer nor received any fees for such engagement is not precluded from accepting employment adverse to the interest of such a person.<br/>3. An Advocate shall not accept professional employment without first disclosing his relation, if any, with the adverse party, and his interest, if any, in the subject matter of such employment.<br/>4. An Advocate shall not represent conflicting interests."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Further in Chapter- IV under the head 'conduct with regard to the public generally' clause 6 provides that-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"6. An Advocate shall not communicate with, nor appear before, a public officer, board, committee or body, in his professional capacity, without first disclosing that he is an Advocate representing interests that may be affected by the action of such officer, board, committee or body."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is to be noted that in the case reported in 1983 BCR (AD) 397 this Division affirmed the decision of the Tribunal and the High Court Division debarring the Advocate for life from practicing in the profession.<br/> <br/>Supreme Court of India in a number of decisions reiterated that "misconduct" would cover any activity or conduct which his professional brethren of good repute and competency would reasonably regard as disgraceful or dishonourable. The scope of "misconduct" is not restricted by technical interpretations of rules of conduct. This has proven conclusively in the case of Bar Council of Maharashtra -Vs- M.V. Dabholkar etc., AIR 1976 SC 242. The relevant facts of the case are that Advocates positioning themselves at the entrance to the Magistrate's Courts and rushing towards potential litigants, often leading to an ugly scrimmage to snatch briefs and undercutting of fees. The Disciplinary Committee of the Maharashtra Bar Council found that such behaviour amounted to professional misconduct, but on appeal the Bar Council of India held that the conduct did not contravene Rule 36 of the Standards of Professional Conduct and Etiquette as the Rule required solicitation of work from a particular person with respect to a particular case and this case did not meet all the necessary criteria, and such method of solicitation could not amount to misconduct. This approach of the Bar council of India was heavily reprimanded by the Supreme Court of India holding that restrictive interpretation of the relevant rule by splitting up the text does not imply that the conduct of the Advocates was warranted or justified. The standard of conduct of Advocates flows from the broad cannons of ethics and high tone of behaviour. It was held that "professional ethics cannot be contained in a Bar Council Rule nor in traditional cant in the books but in new canons of conscience which will command the member of the calling of justice to obey rules or morality and utility.  <br/> <br/>The American Bar Association in the First Code of Legal Ethics in the USA reflects the view of the Lawyer's Special Rule on the Administration of Justice as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"A lawyer is and must ever be the high priest at the shrine of  justice".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Advocates in our country constitute a privileged class that enjoys the exclusive right to practice law. As an officer of the Court as well as agent of the client, the Advocate has to adhere to a standard of conduct which is befitting of his status and responsibility.<br/> <br/>In most jurisdictions, the members of the legal profession are conferred the status of privileged members of the community and occupies an exclusive domain with the privilege of pleading and acting on behalf of suitors being restricted only to enrolled Advocates and Attorneys. The role of Advocates as officers of the Court is to assist the Court in the administration of justice. Advocates collect materials relating to a case and thereby assist the Court in arriving at a correct judgment. Furthermore, being a responsible officer of the Court and an important adjunct of the administration of justice, the Advocate also owes a duty to the Court as well as the opposite side. Advocates, as members of the Bar and officers of the Court, have the responsibility of "keeping the stream of justice pure and unsullied" so also to enable it to administer justice fairly and to the satisfaction of all concerned. The primary duty of the Advocate is to inform the Court as to the law and facts of the case and to aid the Court to do justice by arriving at correct conclusion. Since the Court acts on the basis of what is presented by the Advocates, the Advocates are under the obligation to be absolutely fair to the Court. All statements should be accurate, and the Advocate is under a sacrosanct obligation to ensure that he does not, through any act or omission lead to the possibility of misrepresentation, or mislead the Court or obfuscate the case in any manner. What is imperative to be borne in mind is that the legal profession cannot be considered like any other profession, or trade or business. It is a noble profession, which is intended to serve the cause of "justice". There is a difference between the legal profession and other professions because of the fact that what Advocates do affects not only an individual but the administration of justice which is the foundation of the civilized society when there is a conflict between the most specific instructions of his client and his duty to the Court, the latter takes precedence. This is a dictate not from a code of law, but a higher code of honour, which, if disregarded, offends not only the rules of the profession, but strikes at the heart of the confidence of the public in the judicial system itself. If people lose confidence in the legal profession for the deviant behaviour  of some of its members, it is not only the profession which will suffer but also the administration of justice as a whole. It is well established that an Advocate is not only a professional but he is an officer of the Court and his obligations as an officer of the Court are paramount. The Supreme Court of India in the case of Bar Council of Maharashtra -Vs- M.V. Dabholkar etc., AIR 1976 SC 242 observed that an Advocate being an officer of the Court as a public servant plays a key role in the developmental and dispute-processing activities and above all "in the building up of a just society and constitutional order". An Advocate being a member of the society worthy of confidence of the community in him is required to act as a vehicle of social justice. <br/> <br/>In this case the appellant without preferring an appeal against the original judgment dated 15.01.2004 passed by the Bangladesh Bar Council-Tribunal, preferred a review against the same. The Bar Council-Tribunal by the judgment and order dated 09.08.2005 dismissed the review holding that a review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is re-heard and corrected and that review lies where an error apparent on the face of the record exists. The respondent No.1 being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order passed by the Tribunal in review preferred First Miscellaneous Appeal No.199 of 2005 before the High Court Division. It appears that the High Court Division dismissed the appeal holding that the Bar Council has all the authority to deal with the conduct of the respondent No.1 though he was not enrolled at the relevant time. But to have a licence as an Advocate respondent No.1's conduct is unbecoming of a member of the legal profession as he acted on behalf of the complainant-appellant without having received any power. The High Court Division while dismissing the appeal modified the order of sentence debarring the respondent No.1 from practicing in the legal profession permanently for life to a period of 5(five) years. In the instant case the respondent No.1 has not preferred any appeal against the judgment passed by the Tribunal debarring himself from practicing in the legal profession permanently for life but he preferred a review against the judgment and order passed by the Tribunal. So in the eye of law no appeal was filed against the judgment of the Tribunal in the complaint case.<br/> <br/>Before this Division the complainant-appellant preferred the instant appeal against the judgment and order dated 20.03.2006 passed by the High Court Division only in respect of modification of the sentence debarring the respondent No.1 from practicing in the legal profession permanently for life to a period of 5(five) years on the ground that the sentence is too harsh and not in conformity with the offence committed by the respondent No.1. Admittedly the High Court Division found that the judgment and orders passed by the Tribunal in the Complaint Case and in the Review are proper but modified the sentence on the ground that it was too harsh and not in conformity with the offence committed. From the foregoing discussions, we find that the respondent No.1 committed gross professional misconduct and that not being enrolled as an Advocate and engaged on behalf of the appellant, the respondent No.1 misrepresented himself as an engaged Advocate on behalf of the appellant in objection case before the Assistant Settlement Officer and that the respondent No.1 being an Advocate of the other side expressed his desire by his letters dated 17.05.1998 and 07.06.1998 to help the complainant-appellant in a wakf case out of the way and thus the respondent No.1 intended to represent conflicting interests and thereby committed gross professional misconduct and as such the sentence of debarring the respondent No.1 from pursuing legal profession permanently for life is not at all too harsh rather it is very much in conformity with the offence committed by him. An Advocate being an officer of the Court as well as an agent of the client has to adhere to a standard of conduct which is befitting of his status and responsibility.<br/><br/>Under the Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Order, 1972, the Bangladesh Bar Council can take disciplinary action against any Advocate who is found to be guilty of professional or other misconduct. The term 'misconduct' has not been defined in the Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Order,1972 or the Rules framed thereunder. According to Black's Law Dictionary 'misconduct' means "A dereliction of duty; unlawful or improper behaviour." Affirmative misconduct means an affirmative act of misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact.<br/><br/>According to the Supreme Court of India the word 'misconduct' has no precise meaning, and its scope and ambit has to be construed with reference to the subject matter and context wherein the term occurs. Accordingly, it can be said that the misconduct of an Advocate may be defined as any conduct that in any way renders an Advocate unfit for the exercise of his profession, or is likely to hamper or embarrass the administration of justice for which disciplinary action may be initiated.<br/><br/>In the case of <em><strong>Sambhu Ram Yadav -Vs- Hanuman Das Khatry</strong></em>, (2001) 6 SCC 1 a complaint was filed by the appellant against an Advocate to the Bar Council of Rajsthan, stating that while appearing in a suit as an Advocate, he wrote a letter to the client stating that the concerned judge, before whom the suit was pending would accept bribes, and asked to bribe and influence the judge to obtain a favourable order. The Disciplinary Committee of the Bar Council found the Advocate guilty of "misconduct" which made the Advocate "totally unfit to be a lawyer". The Supreme Court of India held that the legal profession is not a trade or business. Members belonging to the profession have a particular duty to uphold the integrity of the profession and not to indulge in corruption in order to ensure that justice is administered in accordance with law. Accordingly, it was held that the Advocate was guilty of misconduct of the highest degree as it not only obstructed the administration of justice but eroded the reputation of the profession in the opinion of the public.<br/><br/>The Supreme Court of India in the case of <em><strong>Noratanmal Chouraria -Vs- M.R. Murli and another</strong></em>, (2004) 5 SCC 689 examined the words "professional misconduct". In this case an Advocate appearing in person in the capacity of the respondent and not an Advocate in a case, assaulted and kicked the complainant and asked him to refrain from proceeding with the case. The Supreme Court of India held that an Advocate is obliged to observe the norms of behaviour expected of him, which make him worthy of the confidence of the community in him as an officer of the Court. Accordingly he was found guilty of misconduct even though he was not acting in the capacity of an Advocate. In view of the above mentioned decisions, we are of the view that broadly speaking misconduct envisages any instance of breach of discipline. It means improper behaviour, intentional wrongdoing or deliberate violation of a rule of standard of behaviour. The term "misconduct" is incapable of a precise definition. It may mean delinquency in its performance of duty and its effect on the discipline and the nature of duty. In other words it means improper and wrong behaviour which is willful in character. It may involve moral turpitude, but is not a mere error of judgment, carelessness or negligence in performance of duty.<br/><br/>From the judgment and order dated 15.01.2004 it appears that the Tribunal of the Bangladesh Bar Council having considered the materials on record found that the respondent No.1 had appeared before the Assistant Settlement Officer pretending to be an Advocate on 03.06.1997 long before his enrolment as an Advocate and by practicing fraud he had represented the complainant-appellant falsely not having been engaged as an Advocate before the Assistant Settlement Officer and got the case dismissed relinquishing the claim of the complainant-appellant over his property. This conduct of the respondent No.1 is highly immoral and the Tribunal rightly held that the respondent No.1 committed gross misconduct which is unbecoming of a member of the noble profession. Accordingly, the Tribunal debarred the respondent No.1 from pursuing his legal profession permanently for life and directed that his name be struck off from the Roll of Advocates of the Bangladesh Bar Council and his sanad as an Advocate issued by the Bar Council be cancelled with immediate effect. Thereafter, the Tribunal by the judgment and order dated 09.08.2005 rejected the review of the respondent No.1 and maintained its judgment and order dated 15.01.2004 in the complaint case. The High Court Division by the judgment and order dated 20.03.2006 dismissed the appeal preferred at the instance of the respondent No.1 with the finding that the judgments and orders passed in the complaint case and that of the review are proper but modified the sentence debarring the respondent No.1 from practicing in the legal profession permanently for life to a period of 5(five) years on the ground that the sentence inflicted upon the respondent No.1 was too harsh and not inconformity with the offence committed. Admittedly, the respondent No.1-Advocate has not preferred the instant appeal before this Division which means that the respondent No.1 has not challenged the finding of the High Court Division as to his guilt to the effect that both the judgments and orders passed in the complaint case and in the review are proper and there is no illegality in the findings of the High Court Division. Admittedly, the instant appeal before this Division was preferred by the complainant-appellant being aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division in respect of modification of the order of sentence debarring the respondent No.1 from practicing in the legal profession permanently for life to a period of 5(five) years on the ground that it was not in conformity with the gravity of the offence committed by the respondent No.1. The moot question before this Division is to decide whether the judgment and order of the High Court Division modifying the sentence to a lesser degree is correct or not.<br/><br/>From the above discussions and findings we are of the view that the respondent No.1 committed gross professional misconduct of the highest degree which not only obstructed the administration of justice but also eroded the reputation of the legal profession in the opinion of the public. A lawyer is obliged to observe the norms of behaviour expected of him, which make him worthy of confidence of the community in him as an officer of the Court. In the instant case inspite of the fact that the respondent No.1 was not enrolled as an Advocate with Bangladesh Bar Council when he had falsely represented himself to be an Advocate before the Assistant Settlement Officer in the Objection Case and without being engaged on behalf of the appellant represented him in the objection case as an Advocate, his behaviour was very much unbecoming as a member of the noble profession and the Bangladesh Bar Council rightly took disciplinary proceedings against him as stated above.<br/><br/>For the aforesaid reasons, we find merit in the appeal. Accordingly the appeal is allowed without any order as to costs. The judgment and order dated 20.03.2006 passed by the High Court Division in First Miscellaneous Appeal No.199 of 2005 so far as it relates to modification of the sentence debarring the respondent No.1 from pursuing his legal profession permanently for life to a period of 5 (five) years is set aside and that passed by the Tribunal in the complaint case is restored. <br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The NOC dated 05.02.2002 concerned broadcasting through both terrestrial and satellite system but in view of the promulgation of </strong><strong>বাংলাদেশ টেলিভিশনের জন্য টেরিস্ট্রিয়াল টেলিভিশন সম্প্রচার সুবিধা সংরক্ষণ অধ্যাদেশ, ২০০৬ (২০০৬ সনের ৩নং অধ্যাদেশ)</strong><strong> making provisions for exclusive use of terrestrial system by BTV only and not for any private TV Channel and also by the subsequent enactment of </strong><strong>বাংলাদেশ টেলিভিশনের জন্য টেরিস্ট্রিয়াল টেলিভিশন সম্প্রচার সুবিধা সংরক্ষণ আইন, ২০০৯ (২০০৯ সনের ৪৪নং আইন)</strong><strong> with the same provisions of law the NOC dated 05.02.2002 issued by the MOI had become and still is invalid and ineffective for being cancelled for broadcasting through terrestrial system and as such the said NOC cannot form the basis/ground of promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation on which the appellants are claiming entitlement to a licence for broadcasting. We have also noticed that according to Clause 2(6) of the </strong><strong>বেসরকারী মালিকানায় টেলিভিশন চ্যানেল স্থাপন ও পরিচালনা নীতি-১৯৯৮</strong><strong> hereinafter referred to as the Policy of 1998 a licence may be granted under the Policy of 1998 initially for 5(five) years at best meaning that </strong><strong>the NOC dated 05.02.2002 issued by the MOI had expired on 04.02.2007 and as such the said NOC cannot form the basis for grounds of promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation.

The conduct of the appellants in carrying out test transmission since 15.10.2009 and submitting report of the same to the BTRC vide letter dated 01.11.2009 are of no legal effect as a result of non-compliance with the terms and conditions of the Memo dated 20.11.2008 and as such the carrying out test transmission and submission of report by the appellants cannot form the basis for grounds of promissory estoppel or legitim-ate expectation. The appellant cannot invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel because of their non-compliance with the terms and conditions of the NOC dated 05.02.2002 and also the BTRC’s memos dated 20.11.2008 and 18.12.2008. In the premises, it may lead to an irresistible conclusion that the appellants having not acted upon the said representations, the principle of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked by them. Similarly, the question of legitimate expectation does not arise in view of the appellants failure to comply with the NOC dated 05.02.2002 and the BTRC’s memos dated 20.11.2008 and 18.12.2008 for not having obtained any of the said two licences from the MOPT. The MOPT having the exclusive right to grant licence under Section 4(1) of the Telegraph Act, 1885, the appellants cannot assert their entitlement to have lice-nce for broadcasting invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel from the BTRC, inasmuch as, the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be allowed to override the expressed provisions of the Telegraph Act, 1885 claiming entitlements to have licence for broadcasting from the BTRC. The ground of legitimate expectation is also contradictory to the provisions of Section 3(2) of the B.T. Act,2001 which is not applicable to any broadcasting or any radio broadcasting station or television broadcasting station or licensing of such station or any broadcasting apparatus or any apparatus for receiving any message or other information or a programme transmitted by way of broadcast or the business of such apparatus and as such the appellants cannot invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel or any legitimate expectation to override and invalidate the expressed provisions of Section 3(2) of the B.T. Act,2001.</strong></div><div style="text-align: right;"><strong>...(36 and 48)</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 104</strong><br/><strong>Telegraph Act (XIII of 1885)</strong><br/><strong>Section 4 (1)</strong><br/><strong>Wireless Telegraphy Act (XVII of 1933)</strong><br/><strong>Section 3</strong><br/><strong>Bangladesh Telecommunication Act (XVIII of 2001) </strong><br/><strong>Sections 3(2) and 55</strong><br/><strong>The appellant-company admittedly has neither exhausted the forum for disposal of the application dated 08.10.2009 by the MOI nor obtained requisite licences and NOC from the MOPT and the MOI respectively for broadcasting television before obtaining frequency and licence for establishing, operating or using radio apparatus for the purpose of radio communication from the BTRC under Section 55 of the B.T. Act, 2001. For the aforesaid reasons, there is no illegality in the impugned orders passed by the respondents to stop the test transmission of their TV Channel and the seizure of the appellants’ machineries and equipments installed in the television station under the seizure list. Since long time has elapsed the appellants failed to take proper steps in obtaining necessary licences and NOC from the concerned Ministries before obtaining frequency and licence for using broadcasting apparatus, there is no illegality in the actions taken by the respondents. Considering the huge amount of money invested by the appellant-company in importing machineries and equipments and installation of the same in the Television Station the subsequent seizure of the same for indefinite period seems to be too harsh and therefore, to ameliorate the situation, may be invoked Article 104 of the Constitution for doing complete justice in the present case.</strong></div><div style="text-align: right;"><strong>...(60)</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 104</strong><br/><strong>The expression 'complete justice' contained in Article 104 is of wide amplitude. Article 104 does not envisage any limitation regarding causes or the circumstances in which power is to be exercised. The exercise of such power is left completely to the discretion of this Division. The power of passing any order or decree in the interest of justice has been conferred upon this Division under Article 104. The powers of this Division under Article 104 are inherent and are complementary to those powers which are specifically conferred on this Division by various statutes. The power granted under Article 104 of the Constitution is an important constitutional power granted to this Division to protect the citizens. While exercising its inherent power under Article 104 this Division can not override the statutory provisions. It has been stated that for doing complete justice the Court can even ignore the statutory provisions regulating the matter in dispute but normally the Court cannot.</strong><br/><strong>There was no illegality in the cancellation of allocation of frequency and seizure of the machineries and equipments to stop the unauthorised broadcasting. The appellant-company said to have invested huge amount of money and employed three thousand employees and it has asserted that it will be seriously prejudiced if the seized machineries and equipments be kept for indefinite period and not properly maintained in good condition. As this Division held that "complete justice may be justice tempered with mercy", in the facts and circumstances of the case, This Division invokes the extra ordinary powers under Article 104 of the Constitution to do complete justice to the appellant-company for releasing the machineries and equipments seized from the appellant-company by the respondents. In view of the observations and findings made hereinabove, the appeal is allowed-in-part in doing complete justice, the respondents are hereby directed to release the machineries and equipments seized from the appellant-company’s TV stations as per seizure list dated 19.11.2009 and to dispose of the appellants’ application dated 08.10.2009 in accordance with law within 1(one) month from the date of receipt of a copy of the judgment.</strong></div><div style="text-align: right;"><strong>...(63, 65, 66, 68 and 70)</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><em>BTRC Vs.

The writ petitioner No.2 is the Managing Director of the Company.<br/> <br/>The writ petitioners-appellants denied that on 08.10.2009 they applied for re-issuance of a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the respondent No.1 for broadcasting activities and while the said application was under consider-ation the appellant-company unlawfully com-menced test broadcasting. They sought for a direction upon the respondent No.3 to issue a formal licence to the appellant-company pursuant to NOC being Memo No. বিটিআরসি/ এসএম/৩-২৪/০২ পার্ট-১/০৮/২৯-২৯৪৫ dated 20.11.2008 issued by the respondent No.3. The appellants stated that they received the impugned Memo dated 19.11.2009 issued by the respondent No.2 through fax; that the NOC dated 05.02.2002 accorded by the respondent No.1 was given for an indefinite period of time; that there was no violation of any law on the part of the appellants for carrying out the test transmission; that the action of respondent Nos.1 and 2 are absolutely malafide, arbitrary and capricious; that the respondent Nos.3 and 4 issued the impugned Memos dated 19.11.2009 simply relying on the Memo of the respondent No.2 without application of mind; that the respondent No.2 issued the impugned Memo in violation of Section 46 of Bangladesh Telecommunication Act,2001 (BT Act,2001) which requires issuance of show cause notice.<br/> <br/>The appellant-company in due course of its business in order to obtain a licence for allocation of frequency in UHF band V Channel No.40-50 9 Frequency 622-702 MHz vide letter dated 23.11.2001 submitted a proposal to the respondent No.1 for setting up a privately owned terrestrial and satellite television channel. The respondent No.1 on receipt of the said proposal issued a NOC vide Memo dated 05.02.2002 (Annexure-B) to the appellant-company for opening countrywide terrestrial and satellite television broadcast in the UHF band under their own management. In the said NOC dated 05.02.2002 a condition was set out to the effect that it will be cancelled if the company violates or deviates from any condition set out therein. The appellant-company vide letter dated 13.02.2002 applied to the BTRC for allocation of licence for frequency in the UHF Band but it deliberately avoided to accord the licence as required. In such a situation, the appellants, finding no other alternative, filed Writ Petition No.7999 of 2002 before the High Court Division praying for a direction upon the BTRC to allocate them frequency. A Division Bench of the High Court Division by the judgment and order dated 25.08.2003 and 26.08.2003 made the Rule absolute directing the BTRC to dispose of the pending application filed by the appellants praying for allocation of frequency and grant of licence within 30(thirty) days of passing of the said judgment. The said judgment was upheld by the Appellate Division by the judgment and order dated 25.10.2003 in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.1253 of 2003 and 1356 of 2003 directing the BTRC to dispose of the applications preferred by the appellants expeditiously. But the BTRC did not dispose of the said applications submitted by the appellants and consequently, the appellants had prayed for drawing up a contempt proceeding against the Chairman of the BTRC. In order to avoid contempt proceeding the BTRC vide order dated 10.03.2004 (Annexure-D) allocated frequency to the company along with a demand notice setting out the rate respectively for satellite system and terrestrial system to be paid by the appellant-company within 15 days of the receipt of the said demand notice. The appellant-company immediately paid licence fees for satellite system but the fees for terrestrial system having required some clarifications, the appellants requested to clear certain points as to the rate of calculation. The respondent Nos.1 and 2 after the expiry of 15 days issued a Memo dated 22.03.2004 (Annexure-E) directing the appellants to refrain from setting up any broadcasting station and operating all kinds of broadcasting activities. Subsequently, the respondent-BTRC vide Memo dated 08.04.2004 (Annexure-E1) cancelled the licence for frequency dated 10.03.2004 on the ground that the appellants had failed to pay money as per the demand note within the stipulated period.<br/> <br/>Thereafter the appellants challenged the aforesaid Memos dated 22.03.2004 and 08.04.2004 issued by the respondent Nos.1 and 3 respectively by filing Writ Petition No.4600 of 2004. A Division Bench of the High Court Division by the judgment and order dated 16.05.2005 made the Rule absolute declaring that the aforesaid memos were issued without lawful authority. Thereafter both the Government and the BTRC preferred Leave Petition Nos.767 of 2005 and 993 of 2005 respectively before this Division against the judgment and order dated 16.05.2005 passed by the High Court Division and these leave petitions were dismissed on 30.04.2008.<br/> <br/>The appellants stated that the tenure of the said NOC dated 05.02.2002 is of indefinite period unless any condition set out therein is violated. The appellant-company has already completed all preparations and went on test transmission. In fact the appellant-company did not apply for any fresh NOC. In any event such application, if any, for fresh NOC is redundant and superfluous, as the earlier NOC being restored by the Apex Court of the country and the tenure of the said NOC having been determined in the said judgment dated 16.05.2005 for indefinite period, is still subsisting. Pursuant to the judgments passed by both the Divisions of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh the memo dated 05.02.2002 acco-rding NOC by respondent No.1 for frequency and memo dated 10.03.2004 issued by the BTRC allocating frequency and permission for import of machineries and equipments were restored and the same are subsisting till date. The BTRC vide memo dated 20.11.2008 (Annexure-H) extended the period of the allocation of frequency. The BTRC thereafter vide memo dated 18.12.2008 (Annexure-H1) accorded its NOC for import of DSNG Machi-neries. The appellants imported all machineries and other equipments on payment of duties and taxes as assessed and installed the same in the TV station.<br/> <br/>The appellants further stated that it incurred costs of about one hundred crore Taka for installation of the TV station. The appellant-company has employed about three thousand employees in various levels all over the country. The appellant-company following all the provisions of law of the land and various NOCs issued by the Government and the BTRC as well carried out test-transmission since 15.10.2009. The appellant-company vide its letter dated 15.11.2009 reminded the BTRC that the full report of the test transmission of the appellant-company was submitted to the BTRC on 01.11.2009 vide Memo JTV / BTRC / 09 / 2009 / dated 01.11.2009. Therefore, the BTRC-respondent No.3 was well aware about the test transmission of the appellant-company from 01.11.2009 onwards. In the said letter dated 01.11.2009 the appellant-company req-uested the BTRC for according its formal permission allowing the appellant-company to inaugurate the regular broadcasting / transmit-ssion. The appellant-company vide letter dated 15.11.2009 also requested the BTRC to accord licence for frequency and for purchasing equipments and machineries as per clause (Q) of the NOC dated 20.11.2008. When the appellant-company was expecting that licence for frequency and for purchasing equipments would be allocated by the BTRC, to its utter shock and surprise received a fax dated 19.11.2009 issued by the respondent No.2 alleging that the appellant-company submitted an application on 08.10.2009 for re-issuance of NOC (পুনঃঅনাপত্তি) but it commenced test broadcasting pending consideration of the said application which is not lawful. Upon such allegation, the respondent No.2 issued a memo dated 19.11.2009 directing the appellants to cancel the broadcasting activities immediately. The said fax was followed by another impugned memo dated 19.11.2009 issued by the respondent No.4 cancelling the allocated frequency and the approval for using earth station and SNG / DSNG equipments pursuant to the memo dated 19.11.2009 issued by the respondent No.2. The respondent No.4 on 19.11.2009 at 10:30 p.m. seized all equipments as set out in the seizure list from the office of Television Station of the appellant-company.<br/><br/>The writ respondent No.1 alone and the respondent Nos.3 and 4 jointly contested the Rule by filing two separate Affidavits-in-Opposition in identical terms denying the material allegations made in the petition stating, interalia, that the writ petition in its present form is not maintainable as it raises disputed questions of facts hence, the Rule is liable to be discharged; that the respondents did not violate the fundamental rights as envisaged in Articles 27, 31, 40 and 42 of the Constitution; that the Memo No. তম/টিভি-২/ ১সি-১৫ / ২০০৯ / ৮৪৯ dated 19<sup>th</sup> November,2009 was issued complying with the procedure laid down in Section 55 of the B.T. Act, 2001; that the NOC তম/টিচ-৩/১০(৪)/ ৯৯ (অংশ-১) / ৬৩, dated 05.02.2002 was issued by the respondent No.3 regarding broadcasting through both terrestrial and satellite system; that subsequently the বাংলাদেশ টেলিভিশনের জন্য টেরেস্ট্রিয়াল টেলিভিশন সম্প্রচার সুবিধা সংরক্ষণ অধ্যাদেশ, ২০০৬ (২০০৬ সনের ৩ নং অধ্যাদেশ) was promulgated making provisions for exclusive use of terrestrial system by the BTV only and not by any private TV Channel; that thereafter বাংলাদেশ টেলিভিশনের জন্য টেরিষ্ট্রিয়াল টেলিভিশন সম্প্রচার সুবিধা সংরক্ষণ আইন, ২০০৯ (২০০৯ সনের ৪৪ নং আইন) was enacted; that the learned Counsel for the appellant-company at the hearing in the Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.767 and 993 of 2005 submitted that they had abandoned their claim for terrestrial system; that after the judgment passed in the Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.767 and 993 of 2005 the appellants applied to the respondent No.1 for re-issuance of a fresh NOC for broadcasting through satellite system vide memo No. জেটিভি-এন.ও.সি./তম০৩/ ১৫০৯১৬ dated 08.10.2009; that the application for fresh NOC has not yet been disposed of by the respondent No.1; that the appellants did not state that the application for fresh NOC was false or the signature therein was a forged one but before disposal of the application for fresh NOC, the appellant-company commenced test transmission whereupon, the respondent No.1 issued the impugned letter dated 19.11.2009 (Annexure-A) to the appellant No.2 endorsing a copy thereof to the respondent No.3 stating that the very test transmission was unlawful and therefore broadcasting by the appellant-company should be stopped; that a request was also made through the same letter to the BTRC-respondent No.3 to cancel the frequency allocated to the appellant-company; that the BTRC-respondent No.3 in its 13<sup>th</sup> Special Meeting on 19.11.2009 took a special resolution for cancellation of the frequency allocated to the appellant-company; that accordingly, the frequency was cancelled and some equipments were seized and General Diary (GD) No.1450 dated 20.11.2009 was lodged with the Badda Police Station and those equipments were kept under the police custody.<br/> <br/>The respondents further stated that the respondent Nos.3 and 4 cancelled the frequency in accordance with the provisions of Section 55(3) of the B.T. Act,2001. The procedures laid down in Section 46 of the B.T. Act,2001 is not applicable to frequency related issues because the said Section is applicable to cancellation of any licence issued under Chapter V of the B.T. Act,2001. The issues of allocation, suspension and cancellation etc of frequency are exclusively the subject matter of Chapter VIII of the B.T. Act, 2001 and governed by the provisions of Section 55 of the B.T. Act, 2001 and accordingly, frequency is allocated, suspended or cancelled under the provisions of Section 55 of the B.T. Act, 2001. A broadcasting permission from the respon-dent No.1 is a precondition to get allocation of frequency from the BTRC and this condition is not fulfilled by the appellants under the new circumstances. The BTRC came to know that a new circumstance had arisen for the applic-ation of fresh NOC which is yet to be disposed of. Section 3(2) of the B.T. Act,2001 does not apply to any broadcasting and as such broad-casting does not come within the purview of the B.T. Act, 2001 which applies to allocation of frequency for radio station or television station or broadcasting apparatus or control of the allocated frequency as well as to the use of a telecommunication apparatus in combination with broadcasting apparatus or use of telecommunication apparatus for the purpose of broadcasting. The respondent No.3-BTRC can allocate frequency to a TV Chanel which has already got the permission from the MOI for broadcasting. The BTRC acted independently in cancelling the frequency. It is to be noted that under Chapter V pursuant to Section 36 licences are issued for Telecom-munication System etc. and under Chapter VIII pursuant to Section 55 of the B.T. Act,2001 licences are issued for establishing, operating or using radio apparatus or using radio frequency etc. Under Chapter V, the telecom-munication service provider licences may be issued, amended, renewed, suspended, cancel-led or otherwise dealt with. On the other hand, licences or allocation of frequency may be issued amended, renewed, suspended, cancel-led or otherwise dealt with by or under the provisions of Chapter VIII. For example, requirement for licence for a telecommunic-ation system or telecommunication service or internal service is dealt with in Section 35(1) of the B.T. Act, 2001. Suspension and cancellation of a telecommunication service provider licence is dealt with in Section 46 of the B.T. Act, 2001 whereas suspension and cancellation of a licence or allocation of frequency is dealt with in Section 55(3) of the B.T. Act, 2001. As such the fields of application and operation of Sections 46 and 55 are completely different and no overlapping of one to the other is possible under any circumstance whatsoever. Section 46 of the B.T. Act, 2001 is not applicable to any document which is not a licence under the Act,2001. The BTRC has not yet issued any licence to the appellants but issued two NOCs and frequency allocation letters subject to fulfillment of certain conditions stated therein (Annexures-D &amp; H respectively). After fulfillment of all legal requirements i.e. all terms and conditions of the frequency allocation letter by the appellants, the BTRC would finally issue a licence to operate radio communication equipment to the concerned Channel. This licence is not a subject or object of Section 46 rather is exclusively governed by Section 55 of the B.T. Act,2001. The respondent No.1 (MOI) by their letter dated 22.03.2004 (Annexure-E) cancelled the permission / NOC / Licence for broadcasting as the appellant-company failed to commence operation within the stipulated time i.e. within one year as stated in the memo dated 05.02.2002 issued by the MOI. The appellants were not running regular transmission, rather they were running test transmission on which no income depends. Test transmission occurs merely for checking and examining the equipments and systems before providing services through regular transmission and not for any commercial purpose. The BTRC cancelled frequency in accordance with the provisions of Section 55(3) of the B.T. Act, 2001 as the appellants have neither any licence under Section 55(1) of the Act nor any permission or licence for broadcasting from the MOI. The BTRC rightly cancelled the frequency and the question of dictation of the Ministry does not arise. The grounds taken in the writ petition are misconceived and untenable and as such the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/>The appellants filed Affidavit-in-Reply against the Affidavit-in-Opposition filed by the respondent No.3 stating, interalia, that there was no disputed question of facts to be decided in the writ petition; that Section 55 of the B.T. Act,2001 does not empower the answering respondents to issue the impugned memo (Annexure-A1) inasmuch as the whole action of answering respondents is malice-in-law; that no fresh NOC was required by the appellants from MOI after the ordinance of 2006 was promulgated; that the appellants received NOC dated 05.02.2002 without any time limit and the same have been merged in Memo dated 20.11.2008 issued by the respondent No.3 and during subsistence of the same the impugned memos dated 19.11.2009 (Annexure-A, A1 and A2) can not be issued; that admittedly, the appellants are legally entitled to have licence as appears from condition ‘ka’ of the said memo dated 20.11.2008 and as such the respondents are legally bound to comply with their promise to give licence and the respondents shall be estopped by the principle of promissory estoppel from refusing to issue licence or to stop transmissions and broad-casting and cancelling frequency allocation and use of earth station and SNG/DSNG equipments and machineries and seizure of equipments as appears from Annexures-A, A1 and A2 to the writ petition on extraneous and unwarranted grounds beyond the scope of the said permission; that the Telegraph Act,1885 and the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933 and other laws have been overridden by Sections 4 and 5 of the B.T. Act,2001 and notwithstan-ding any contrary provisions of any other law, the provisions of the B.T. Act,2001 shall have effect.<br/> <br/>The High Court Division by the judgment and order dated 20.05.2010 disposed of the Rule with the direction that the respondents shall dispose of the appellants' application dated 08.10.2009 within one month from the date of receipt of a copy of the judgment.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division the writ petitioners-appellants prefe-rred the instant Civil Appeal by leave of this Court. Leave was granted to consider the following grounds:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align:justify">Whether the petitioner is entitled in law on the ground of promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation to a licence for broadcasting programmes having (1) obtained the NOC from the MOI by Memo No. তম/টিচ-৩/১০(৪) / ৯৯ (অংশ-১)/৬৩, dated 05.02.2002; (2) obtained the allocation of frequency from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regu-latory Authority (BTRC) by Memo No. বিটিআরসি/এস,এম,/৩-২৪/০২ পার্ট-১/০৮/ ২৯-২৯৪৫ dated 20.11.2008; (3) compl-ied with the terms thereof by importing machineries and equipments; (4) received permission for the import of machinery from BTRC by Memo No. বিটিআরসি/এস,এম,/ ৩-২৪/০২ পার্ট-১ / ২০০৮/ ৭৯-৩৩৯৪ dated 18.12.2008; (5) comple-ted the test transmission for a period exceeding one year; and (6) submitted the test transmission report.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Whether the licence required for the broadcasting television programmes is required by law to be granted under Section 35 and / or Section 55 of the Bangladesh Telecommunication Act, 2001 or whether the provisions relating to licences under the Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933 are also applicable.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Whether the direction by the MOI in its Memo No. তম/টিভি-২/১সি-১৫/ ২০০৯/ ৮৪৯, dated 19.11.2009 to stop the test transmission of the petitioners’ television channel and to the BTRC to cancel the allocation of frequency and the cancellation of the frequency allocated to the petitioners by BTRC’s Memo No. বিটিআরসি / এস,এম, / ৩-২৪ / ০২ পার্ট-১/২০০৮/২৫৭-২০৬১ dated 19.11.2009 and the seizure of the machinery and equipment of the petitioners as evidenced by the seizure list also dated 19.11.2009 are each equal and valid.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Ajmalul Hossain, the learned Counsel appearing for the appellants having placed before us the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and other materials on record submits that the High Court Division committed error of law in not taking into consideration that the appellants have complied with the condition ‘ka’ of Memo dated 20.11.2008 and as such the appellants are legally entitled to have a licence and the respondents are legally bound to comply with their promise to issue a licence and that the respondents are estopped by the principle of promissory estoppel from refusing to issue licence or to stop transmissions and broadcasting and cancelling frequency allocation, and use of earth station and SNG / DSNG equipments and machineries and seizure of equipments on an extraneous and unwarranted ground are beyond the scope of the said permission. He then submits that the High Court Division erred in law in failing to consider the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division in writ petition No.4600 of 2004 making the Rule absolute which was affirmed by the Appellate Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.767 and 993 of 2005 wherein it was observed that the operation of NOC dated 05.02.2002 (Annexure-B) would continue to be valid till issuance of a formal licence. Mr. Hossain then submits that the High Court Division failed to consider that as per terms “chha” of the NOC dated 20.11.2008 for use of satellite link frequency, the appellants should have obtained licence for frequency and radio equipments after installation of equipments, commencing broadcasting and submission of test report to the BTRC. He then submits that as per provisions of Sections 4 and 5 of B.T. Act,2001, the Telegraph Act,1885, the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933 and any other laws promulgated shall have effect subject to the provisions of the Act of 2001 and that the writ respondent No.3 has been vested with absolute authority to give effect to the earlier order. He finally submits that the direction by the MOI in its Memo dated 19.11.2009 to stop the test transmission of the appellants’ television channel and to the BTRC to cancel the allocation of frequency and the cancellation of the frequency allocation to the appellants by the BTRC’s Memo dated 19.11.2009 and the seizure of the machineries and equipments of the appellants as evidenced by the seizure list also dated 19.11.2009 have been made without lawful authority.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Attorney General appearing for the respondent No.1 submits that in order to commence television broadcasting the appellant-company requires four licences namely; (I) licence for establishing, maintaining or working a telegraph under Section 4(1) of the Telegraph Act,1885, (II) licence for possessing wireless telegraphy apparatus to be granted by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MOPT) under Section 3 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933, (III) licence / NOC to be granted by the MOI for the Ministry’s own convenience for performance of its functions of supervision, monitoring and controlling the contents of broadcasting properly and effectively under the Rules of Business and (IV) licence to be granted by the BTRC for establishing, operating or using radio apparatus for the purpose of radio communication and additionally, the appellant-company also requires frequency to be allocated by the BTRC under Section 55(1) of the B.T. Act,2001. The learned Attorney General submits that admittedly the appellant-company has failed to obtain these licences from the concerned authorities and hence the said NOC dated 05.02.2002 issued by the MOI has not yet become legally operative because the said NOC contained a clear condition being condition No.9, stipulating that the Policy of 1998 will be applicable to the said NOC and given that as per clauses 2(1) and 2(4)(kha) of the Policy of 1998 an intending television operator is required to obtain two licences from the MOPT and that for not having obtained these two licences from the said Ministry (MOPT) the appellants have failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the NOC dated 05.02.2002. He then submits that in view of the promulgation of বাংলাদেশ টেলিভিশনের জন্য টেরিস্ট্রিয়াল টেলিভিশন সম্প্রচার সুবিধা সংরক্ষণ অধ্যাদেশ,২০০৬ (২০০৬ সনের ৩নং অধ্যাদেশ) making provisions for exclusive use of terrestrial system by BTV only and not by any private TV Channel and the subsequent enactment of বাংলাদেশ টেলিভিশনের জন্য টেরিস্ট্রিয়াল টেলিভিশন সম্প্রচার সুবিধা সংরক্ষণ আইন,২০০৯ (২০০৯ সনের ৪৪নং আইন) containing the aforesaid provisions and because of the change in scenario the NOC dated 05.02.2002 issued by the MOI had become invalid and ineffective. The learned Attorney General asserts that the appellants have failed to comply with the terms and conditions stipulated in the memos dated 20.11.2008 and 18.12.2008 of the respondent No.3-BTRC and hence the memos of the BTRC are not legally operative since the appellant-company failed to obtain the aforesaid two licences from the MOPT and as such the conduct of the appellants in carrying out test transmission since 15<sup>th</sup> October,2009 and submitting report of the same to the BTRC vide letter dated 01.11.2009 and any other act said to have been done by the appellants in accordance with condition (Q) of the said memo of BTRC dated 20.11.2008 are of no legal effect. In reply to the appellants’ submission that the appellant-company is entitled in law on the doctrine of promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation to have a licence issued by the BTRC for broadcasting programmes, the learned Attorney General opposing the same submits that this doctrine is not applicable in this case. The learned Attorney General finally submits that the appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>We have heard the submissions advanced on behalf of the respective parties, perused leave granting order, concise statements filed on behalf of both the parties, impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and meticulously examined the relevant laws, documents and other connected papers on record.<br/> <br/>The appellants’ case in brief is that upon an application dated 23.11.2001 filed by them the Government of Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Information, respondent No.1 granted a NOC vide memo dated 05.02.2002 (Annexure-B) for commencing and operating terrestrial and satellite television in the UHF Band under their own management and in the said NOC it has been stipulated that the respondent would cancel the NOC if the appellants violate or deviate from any conditions set out therein. Thereafter, the appellants vide letter dated 13.02.2002 applied to the BTRC for grant of licence and allocation of frequency in the UHF Band but the BTRC did not accord any licence. In the compelling circumstances the appellants filed Writ Petition No.7999 of 2002 wherein a Division Bench of the High Court Division made the Rule absolute directing the BTRC to dispose of the pending applications filed by the appellants praying for allocation of frequency and grant of licence within 30 days from the date of passing of the judgment and order which was upheld by this Division in it's judgment and order dated 25.10.2003 in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.1253 of 2003 and 1256 of 2003. On failure of the BTRC to comply with the directions of the High Court Division as well as this Division in disposing of the applications, the appellants were constrained to file a Contempt Petition against the Chairman, BTRC who with a view to avoid contempt proceedings by the memo dated 10.03.2004 (Annexure-D) allocated frequency with a demand note setting out the rate for satellite system and terrestrial system respect-ively to be paid by the appellant-company within 15 days from the date of receipt of the demand note. The appellants paid licence fees for satellite system but they did not pay the fees for terrestrial system which according to them required some clarifications from the BTRC on certain points as to the rate of calculation. Without giving any clarification the BTRC deliberately let the 15 days period expire whereupon the respondent Nos.1 and 2 after the expiry of 15 days issued a memo dated 22.03.2004 directing the appellants to refrain from setting up any broadcasting station and operating all kinds of broadcasting activities which led the BTRC to issue memo dated 08.04.2004 cancelling the licence for frequency dated 10.03.2004 on the ground of default. The appellants thereafter filed Writ Petition No.4600 of 2004 challenging the memos dated 22.03.2004 and 08.04.2004 by the respondent Nos.1 and 3. A Division Bench of the High Court Division by the judgment and order dated 16.05.2005 made the Rule absolute whereupon the MOI and the BTRC separately moved this Division unsuccessfully in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.767 of 2005 and 993 of 2005 respectively wherein this Division by the judgment and order dated 30.04.2008 dismissed both the leave petitions. Having faced with this situation the BTRC vide memo dated 20.11.2008 (Annexure-H) extended the period of allocated frequency and vide memo dated 18.12.2008 accorded its NOC for importation of DSNG Machinery. Accordingly, the appellants claimed that the imported machineries were installed in the TV station and about three thousand employees were employed in various levels all over the country. <br/> <br/>The sum and substance of the appellants’ contention is that the High Court Division erred in law in not taking into consideration that the appellants have complied with the condition 'ka' of the Memo dated 20.11.2008 and as such they are entitled to have licence and the respondents are legally bound to comply with their promise to issue licence and they are estopped by the principle of promissory estoppel from refusing to issue licence or to stop transmission and broadcasting and cancelling frequency allocation and use of earth station and SNG / DSNG equipments and machineries and seizure of equipments on extraneous and unwarranted grounds beyond the scope of the said permission granted earlier. The appellants also submit that in view of the judgment passed by this Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.767 and 993 of 2005 arising out of Writ Petition No.4600 of 2004, the operation of NOC dated05.02.2002 would continue to be valid till issuance of formal licence. The appellants’ contention is that the High Court Division also failed to consider that as per term ‘chha’ of the permission for use of satellite link frequency dated 20.11.2008 the licence for frequency and radio equipments should be obtained after installation of equipments and on submitting test report after commencing broadcasting. Accordingly, the appellants contend that in view of their compliance with the terms and conditions of the Memo dated 20.11.2008 they are entitled to get a licence, inasmuch as, the memo dated 20.11.2008 is nothing but a NOC and as such, the High Court Division committed error of law in not giving direction upon the writ respondent No.3 to grant formal licence; that the BTRC extended the period of allocation of frequency and they accorded it's NOC for importation of DSNG machinery and pursuant thereto the appellants imported machineries and installed them in the TV Station and as per clause "chha'' of the NOC they submitted test report after commencing broadcasting. The appellants’ further contention is that as per provisions of Sections 4 and 5 of the B.T. Act, 2001, all existing laws including the Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933 shall have effect subject to the provisions of the B.T. Act of 2001 and the writ respondent No.3-BTRC has been vested with absolute power and authority to grant licence required for broadcasting TV programme. The final submission advanced on behalf of the appellants is that the direction by the MOI in its Memo dated 19.11.2009 to stop the test transmission of the appellants’ television channel and to the BTRC to cancel the allocation of frequency and BTRC's order dated 19.11.2009 in respect of the cancellation of the frequency allocation to the appellants and seizure of the machineries and equipments of the appellants as evident from the seizure list dated 19.11.2009 are without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/> <br/>The sum and substance of the respo-ndents' submissions are that in order to comm-ence television broadcasting the appellant-company requires four licences / NOC namely; (i) licence to be granted by the MOPT for esta-blishing, maintaining or working a telegraph, (ii) licence to be granted by the MOPT for possessing wireless telegraphy apparatus, (iii) licence / NOC to be granted by the MOI for the Ministry’s own convenience in performing its functions of supervising, monitoring and controlling the contents of broadcasting properly and effectively and (iv) licence to be granted by the BTRC for establishing, operating or using radio apparatus for the purpose of radio communication. Furthermore, the appellant-company also requires frequency to be allocated by the BTRC under Section 55(1) of the B.T. Act,2001. The contention of the respondents is that the appellants not having obtained two licences from the MOPT they failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the NOC dated 05.02.2002 and as such the NOC dated 05.02.2002 issued by the MOI has not yet become legally operative. The further submission of the respondents is that the appellants are not legally entitled to invoke the principle of promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation to have a licence issued by the BTRC since these grounds are misconceived.<br/> <br/>On perusal of the materials on record it appears that upon an application dated 23.11.2001 filed by the appellants, the MOI (respondent No.1) granted NOC vide memo dated 05.02.2002 for commencing and operating terrestrial and satellite system in UHF Band and thereafter the appellants vide their letter dated 13.02.2002 applied to the BTRC for licence for frequency in UHF Band but the BTRC did not dispose of the appellants’ application whereupon they filed Writ Petition No.7999 of 2002 in which the Rule was made absolute by the judgment and order dated 26.08.2003 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division directing the BTRC to dispose of the pending applications filed by the appellants praying for allocation of frequency and grant of licence within 30 days from the date of passing of the judgment and order. The said judgment and order was challenged before this Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.1253 of 2003 and 1256 of 2003 which were disposed of by the judgment and order dated 25.10.2003 passed by this Division with a direction to dispose of the petition for allocation of frequency as per rules / law as early as possible with an observation that the BTRC should consider that prior to allocation of frequency, licences are required for the purpose from the competent authority. As the BTRC failed to comply with the directions of the High Court Division as well as this Division in disposing of the application, the appellants were compelled to file a contempt petition against the Chairman, BTRC who with a view to avoid contempt proceedings by the memo dated 10.03.2004 (Annexure-D) allocated frequency with a demand note setting out the rate for satellite system and terrestrial system respect-ively to be paid by the appellant-company within 15 days from the date of receipt of the demand note. The BTRC in a compelling situ-ation allocated frequency before the grant of licence by the competent authority which is not in conformity with the aforesaid observations of this Division and the provisions of clause 2(5) of the "বেসরকারী মালিকানায় টেলিভিশন চ্যানেল স্থাপন ও পরিচালনা নীতি ১৯৯৮". It appears that admittedly appellants paid licence fees for satellite system but did not pay the fees for terrestrial system as a result of which respondent No.1 vide memo dated 22.03.2004 (Annexure-E) directed the appellants to refrain from setting up any broadcasting station and operating all kinds of broadcasting activities and consequently, the BTRC vide memo dated 08.04.2004 (Annexure-E1) cancelled the grant of frequency dated 10.03.2004 on the ground of default in payment of money as per demand note within the stipulated period. Being aggrie-ved by the aforesaid order of cancel-ation the appellants preferred Writ Petition No.4600 of 2004 challenging the memos dated 22.03.2004 and 08.04.2004 issued by the respondent No.1 and a Division Bench of the High Court Division vide judgment and order dated 16.05.2005 made the Rule absolute. Both the government and the BTRC unsuccessfully moved this Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.767 of 2005 and 993 of 2005 respectively wherein this Division by the judgment and order dated 30.04.2008 dismissed both the leave petitions with the observation that neither the memo dated 05.02.2002 (Annexure-B) nor the memo dated 10.03.2004 (Annexure-D) is a licence. The former is a NOC issued by the MOI and the latter is a temporary allocation of frequency and permission to import equipments and machineries by the BTRC and thereby this Division maintained the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division with different observations on merit. It also appears from both the judgment and order dated 16.05.2005 passed in Writ Petition No.4600 of 2004 by the High Court Division and the judgment and order dated 30.04.2008 passed by this Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.767 of 2005 and 993 of 2005 that in Writ Petition No.4600 of 2004 an incorrect statement was made to the effect that Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.1253 of 2003 and 1256 of 2003 which had arisen out of Writ Petition No.7999 of 2002 were dismissed but in fact by the judgment and order dated 25.10.2003 both of these leave petitions were disposed of with observation as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“......that prior to allocation of frequency, licence is required for the purpose from the competent authority ...........<br/>In the circumstances, we are of the view that the BTRC is to dispose of the petition of the respondents pending before it as to allocation of frequency as per rules / law as early as possible.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>To our utter surprise upon such distorted presentation of the judgment of the Apex Court the appellants having obtained Rule and interim order of stay in Writ Petition No.4600 of 2004 finally got the Rule made absolute. In view of the judgment and order dated 30.04.2008 passed by the this Division, the BTRC vide memo dated 20.11.2008 extended the period of allocated frequency and vide memo dated 18.12.2008 accorded its NOC for import of DSNG machinery. It has been asserted that the appellants having imported all machineries and equipments installed them in the TV station and employed about three thousand employees. Thus the appellants having commenced test transmission on 15.10.2009 submitted test transmission report vide memo dated 01.11.2009 and by memo dated 15.11.2009 requested the BTRC for granting formal permission to commence the regular television broadcasting.<br/> <br/>Under Section 4 of the Telegraph Act,1885 the Government shall have exclusive privilege of establishing, maintaining and working telegraphs. The Rules of Business, 1996 framed by the President under Article 55(6) of the Constitution for allocation and transaction of business of the Government clearly allocates all functions in relation to telegraph to the MOPT. Both the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Department and the Bangladesh Post Office are the attached departments with the MOPT. The word “telegraph” as defined in Section 3(1) of the Telegraph Act,1885 means “an electric, galv-anic or magnetic telegraph, and includes appl-iances and apparatus for making, transmitting or receiving telegraphic, telephonic or other communications by means of electricity, galvanism or magnetism”. According to Section 2(1) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933 “wireless commun-ication” means the making, transmitting or receiving of telegraphic, telephonic or other communications by means of electricity or magnetism without the use of wires or other continuous electrical conductors between the transmitting and the receiving apparatus. Under Section 2(2) of the Act of 1933 “wireless telegraphy apparatus” means any apparatus, appliance, instrument or material used or capable of use in wireless communication, and includes any article determined by rule made under section 10 to be wireless telegraphy apparatus. On the other hand, according to Section 2(30) of the B.T. Act,2001 “broadcasting” means “transmission of any message, information, signal, sound, image or intellectual expression by radio wave, satellite, cable or optical fibre connection for the purp-ose of receipt by the public, but transmission of anything by Internet connection shall not be deemed to be a broadcasting”. In order to commence television broadcasting as per the relevant provisions of the Telegraph Act,1885, the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933, as well as that of the policy of 1998 the appellant-company requires two licences- one for establishing, maintaining or working any telegraph under Section 4(1) of the Telegraph Act,1885 and the other for possessing wireless telegraphy apparatus under Section 3 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933. In the case of BTRC –Vs- ETV reported in 58 DLR(AD) 82 this Division held that any broadcasting is done through broadcasting station or television broadcasting station or broadcasting apparatus by means of establishing, maintaining or working of telegraph. Section 4(2) of the Telegraph Act, 1885 envisages that the Government may by notification in the official gazette delegate to the Director General, Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Department all or any of its power to grant licence on such conditions and in consideration of such payments as it thinks fit to any person to establish, maintain or work a telegraph within any part of Bangladesh. Under Section 5(1) of the W.T. Act,1933 the Director-General, Bangladesh Post Office, or an officer authorized by him in this behalf shall be the authority competent to issue licenses to possess wireless telegraphy apparatus under this Act. Further, it is to be noted that the Rules of Business,1996 also allocate businesses to the MOI which consists of publicity policy-both internal and external supervising, monitoring and controlling the contents of broadcasting. In view of the businesses allocated and transacted to the MOI under the Rules of business it may in performing its functions properly and effectively issue licence or NOC for the said purposes.<br/> <br/>We have already noticed that in order to commence television broadcasting an intending television operator is required to obtain a licence to establish, maintain or work a telegraph and a licence to possess wireless telegraphy apparatus under Section 4(1) of the Telegraph Act,1885 and Section 3 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933 respectively from the MOPT. In condition No.9 of the NOC dated 05.02.2002 it has been stipulated that “বেসরকারী মালিকানায় লটলিভিশন চ্যানেল স্থাপন ও পরিচালনা নীতি১৯৯৮ প্রযোজ্য / অনুসৃত হবে।” (hereinafter referred to as “the Policy of 1998”) is applicable and that Clause 2(1) and Clause 2(4)(kha) of the Policy of 1998 have incorporated the relevant laws and procedures in respect of commencement of television broadcasting as envisaged in Section 4(1) of the Act of 1885 and Section 5 of the Act of 1933 to the effect that an intending television operator is required to obtain the said two licences from the MOPT. But the appellant-company has failed to obtain any of the said two licences from the MOPT and therefore by not having obtained these two licences from the MOPT, the appellant-company has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the NOC dated 05.02.2002 and also the provisions of the Act of 1885 and the Act of 1933. It also appears that the NOC dated 05.02.2002 was issued in respect of broadcasting through both terrestrial and satellite system. But in view of the promulgation of the “বাংলাদেশ টেলিভিশনের জন্য টেরিস্ট্রিয়াল টেলিভিশন সম্প্রচার সুবিধা সংরক্ষণ অধ্যাদেশ,২০০৬ (২০০৬ সনের ৩নং অধ্যাদেশ) making provisions for exclusive use of terrestrial system by BTV only and not by any private TV Channel and also subsequent enactment of “বাংলাদেশ টেলিভিশনের জন্য টেরেস্ট্রিয়াল টেলিভিশন সম্প্রচার সুবিধা সংরক্ষণ আইন,২০০৯ (২০০৯ সনের ৪৪ নং আইন) with the same provisions of the aforesaid Ordinance, it can be safely construed that the NOC dated 05.02.2002 has become ineffective. Having referred to Clause 2(6) of the Policy of 1998 which provides that a licence may be granted initially for 5(five) years, the respondents asserted that the said NOC dated 05.02.2002 issued by the MOI had expired on 04.02.2007. In that view of the matter it can be safely construed that NOC dated 05.02.2002 issued by the MOI has not yet become legally operative. The High Court Division by the judgment and order dated 16.05.2005 passed in Writ Petition No.4600 of 2004 observed that there is nothing in the said policy which empowers the Ministry to cancel and / or withdraw the NOC / licence if one fails to go into operation within one year of the NOC or to say that after one year validity of such NOC / licence shall expire. But this observation does not reflect the correct position of the matter in issue. From the materials on record it appears that following the judgment and order dated 30.04.2008 passed by this Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.767 of 2005 and 993 of 2005 dismissing the petitions which arose out of Writ Petition No.4600 of 2004 containing incorrect statements to the effect that Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.1253 of 2003 and 1256 of 2003 were dismissed though these were disposed of with observations that the BTRC vide Memo dated 20.11.2008 temporarily allocated frequency for satellite link and gave permission for importation and establishing earth station in favour of the appellant-company. Thereafter the BTRC vide memo dated 18.12.2008 (Annexure-H1) accorded its NOC for importation of one DSNG machinery subject to certain conditions of which Condition No.2 stipulated that “তরঙ্গ বরাদ্দপত্রঃ বিটিআরসি / এসএম / ৩-২৪/০২ পার্ট-১ / ২০০৮ / ২৯-২৯৪৫, তাং ২০-১১-২০০৮ খ্রীঃ এর সকল শর্ত প্রযোজ্য।”. It is to be noted that the Condition (R) of the memo dated 20.11.2008 of the BTRC stipulated to the effect that “তথ্য মন্ত্রণালয় কর্তৃক প্রদত্ত সম্প্রচারের অনাপত্তি পত্র এবং বেসরকারী মালিকানায় টেলিভিশন চ্যানেল স্থাপন ও পরিচালনা নীতি-১৯৯৮ অনুসরণ করে কার্যক্রম পরিচালনা করতে হবে।” In view of above discussions and findings we have no hesitation in holding that the appellant-company has failed to comply with the requirements of the Policy of 1998 and also the terms and conditions of the aforesaid memos and as such there is no merit in the contention of the appellants that they had complied with all the terms and conditions stipulated in the aforesaid memos of the BTRC. <br/> <br/>In the judgment passed in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.1253 of 2003 and 1256 of 2003 this Division held that it is within the power of the BTRC to allocate frequency to the appellant-company and that prior to allocation of frequency, licence is required for the purpose from the competent authority and accordingly this Division observed:- “In our opinion this point is to be considered by the BTRC and the BTRC being a statutory authority having exclusive jurisdictions for the purpose of allocation of frequency is at liberty to dispose of the application of the appellant seeking allocation of frequency as per rules”. Further in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.767 of 2005 and 993 of 2005 arising out of the judgment and order dated 16.05.2005 passed in Writ Petition No.4600 of 2004 this Division observed: “We find that neither Annexure-B nor J(1) [BTRC’s memo dated 10.03.2004] as discussed above is a licence. One is temporary allocation of frequency and permission to import equipments and machinery by BTRC and the other is NOC by the MOI”. But in 58 DLR (AD) 82 this Division held that the appellant should have first applied for licence or no objection for broadcasting to the Ministry of Information and after obtaining the same they could approach the BTRC for allocation of frequency and licence for establishing telecommunication system etc. From the above discussions, we are of the view that the memo dated 05.02.2002 is not a licence but a NOC and that prior to allocation of frequency by the BTRC, the appellant-company is required to obtain two licences and one NOC from the concerned Ministries and as such the BTRC’s memos dated 20.11.2008 and 18.12.2008 respectively have not become legally operative.<br/> <br/>In the instant case the appellants relied on the doctrine of promissory estoppel to get a broadcasting licence. The doctrine of promissory estoppel is an equitable conception. By this doctrine, if a person makes to another a clear and unambiguous representation of a fact intending that other to act on it, if the representation transpires to be untrue, and if the other does act upon it to his detriment, the representor is prevented or estopped from denying its truth. This doctrine has been enunciated by Denning,J as his Lordship then was in the case of Central London Property Trust Limited -Vs- High Trees House Limited (1947) KB 130. The precise status of the doctrine was a subject matter of much speculation but Lord Hailsham, L.C. in the case of Woodhouse A.C. Israel Cocoa Ltd. -Vs- Nigerian Produce Marketing Co. Ltd. 1972 A.C. 741 at page 758 observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"I desire to add that the time may soon come when the whole sequence of cases based on promissory estoppel since the war, beginning with <strong><em>Central London Property Trust Ltd. -Vs- High Trees House Ltd.</em></strong> [1947], K.B. 130, may need to be reviewed and reduced to a coherent body of doctrine by the courts. I do not mean to say that any are to be regarded with suspicion. But as is common with an expanding doctrine they do raise problems of coherent exposition which have never been systematically explored."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The next question is whether the doctrine of promissory estoppel operates only by way of defence not as a cause of action. Denning,L.J. in a subsequent case before the Court of Appeal restated the position as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"The principles stated in the High Trees case ........does not create new causes of actions where none existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting upon his strict legal rights, when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them, having regard to the dealing which have taken place between the parties.................... "</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>However, the doctrine of promissory estoppel has been invoked by this Division in a number of cases. The case of Collector of Customs, Custom House, Chittagong and others -Vs- A. Hannan reported in 42 DLR (AD) 167 is worth mentioning. In this case in order to meet scarcity of sugar in the country the Government decided to import sugar under Wage Earners' Scheme and waived certain formalities. The Government issued notifica-tion reducing the existing customs duty and sales tax on the importation of sugar on fulfillment of certain conditions. The respon-dent availed this opportunity for importing sugar at the concessional rate of duty and sales tax fulfilling the conditions but before the arrival of the cargo and submission of the bill of entry the concessional rate was withdrawn by the Government. The Collector of Customs took the view that the respondent was not entitled to concessional rate of customs duty and taxes because the bill of entry was delivered to the Customs Authority after the withdrawal of the concessional rate. This Division held that the respondent importer acting upon the solemn promise made by the appellant incurred huge expenditure and if the appellant is not held to its promise, the respondent would be put in a very disadva-ntageous position and therefore the doctrine of promissory estoppel can also be invoked in this case. Accordingly, it has been held that the importer having acted upon the assurance given, the Government can not retrace its steps and ask for duty at the rate mentioned in the subsequent notification. This is clearly a case of well settled doctrine of promissory estoppel. This Division having considered a number of decisions of it’s own as well as those of the apex courts of the sub-continent decided the case. However this Division in the case of Secretary, Ministry of Industries, Nationalised Industries Division -Vs Saleh Ahmed &amp; another and Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation -Vs- Saleh Ahmed &amp; others reported in 1981 BLD (AD) 91 applied the doctrine of promissory estoppel having binding effect on the representee with the following observation:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"In the instant case the Government took the decision on agreement to release the Mill in question. Lack of power on the part of the Government so to do is not the plea; rather a belated plea was taken that the decision had been revised by the Government although no such case was made out. Hence applying the principle of promissory estoppel the least that can be said is that the appellants cannot be allowed to act inconsistently and the decision to release the Mill remains binding on them."  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked for the first time before this Division in an appeal without taking a ground on it before the High Court Division or the Appellate Division in Leave Petition. In the case of Grihayan Limited -Vs- Government of Bangladesh and others reported in 47 DLR (AD) 12 this Division held that the doctrine of promissory estoppel is not applicable in the case because neither in the writ petition nor in the leave petition this point was ever mooted. Neither in the writ petition nor in the leave petition the appellant had taken any ground questioning the authority of the Government to pass the impugned orders on the basis of lack of jurisdiction or on the principle of promissory estoppel.<br/> <br/>The position of law is well settled that the Government may be estopped from refusing any representation made by it on the basis of which any person has acted to his detriment. There is no estoppel against statute or there is no application of estoppel to prevent the performance of any constitutional or statutory duty. We have already observed that the promissory estoppel is an equitable doctrine which has been eloquently pronounced by the Supreme Court of India in the case of <em><strong>M/S. Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. -Vs- State of Uttar Pradesh and others</strong></em> AIR 1979 SC 621 at page 644 as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"But it is necessary to point out that since the doctrine of promissory estoppel is an equitable doctrine, it must yield when the equity so requires. If it can be shown by the Government that having regard to the facts as they have subsequently transpired, it would be inequitable to hold the Government to the promise made by it, the Court would not raise an equity in favour of the promisee and enforce the promise against the Government. The doctrine of promissory estoppel would be displaced in such a case because, on the facts, equity would not require that the Government should be held bound by the promise made by it. When the Government is able to show that in view of the facts which have transpired since the making of the promise, public interest would be prejudiced if the Government were required to carry out the promise, the Court would have to balance the public interest in the Government carrying out a promise made to a citizen which has induced the citizen to act upon it and alter his position and the public interest likely to suffer if the promise were required to be carried out by the Government and determine which way the equity lies."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked against public interest or any statute. The public interest prevails over promissory estoppel. In the case of <em><strong>U.P. Power Corporation Ltd &amp; Anr –Vs- Sant Steels &amp; Alloys (P) Ltd &amp; Ors</strong></em> AIR 2008 SC 693 the Supreme Court of India having considered various decisions observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“17. In this background, in view of various decisions noticed above, it will appear that the Court’s approach in the matter of invoking the principle of promissory estoppel depends on the facts of each case. But the general principle that emerges is that once a representation has been made by one party and the other party acts on that representation and makes investment and thereafter the other party resiles, such act cannot stated to be fair and reasonable. When the State Government makes a representation and invites the entrepreneurs by showing various benefits for encouraging to make investment by way of industrial development of the backward areas or the hill areas, and thereafter the entrepreneurs on the representations so made bona fidely make investment and thereafter if the State Government resiles from such benefits, then it certainly is an act of unfairness and arbitrariness. Consider-ation of public interest and the fact that there cannot be any estoppel against a Statute are exceptions.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of <em><strong>State of Rajasthan and another –Vs- Mahaveer Oil Industries and others</strong></em> (1999) 4 SCC 357 at page 365 paragraph 14 Supreme Court of India observed thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Public interest requires that the State be held bound by the promise held out by it in such a situation. But this does not preclude the State from withdrawing the benefit prospectively even during the period of the Scheme, if public interest so requires. Even in a case where a party has acted on the promise, if there is any supervening public interest which requires that the benefit be withdrawn or the Scheme be modified, that supervening public interest would prevail over any promissory estoppel.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Moreover, the Supreme Court of India in the case of Sales Tax Officer and another –Vs- Shree Durga Oil Mills and another  (1998) 1 SCC 572 held that any IPR (Industrial Policy Resolution) can be changed if there is an overriding public interest involved. In this case, it was stated on behalf of the State that various notifications granting sales tax exemptions to the dealers resulted in severe resource crunch. On reconsideration of the financial position, it was decided to limit the scope of the earlier exemption notifications issued under Section 6 of the Orissa Sales Tax Act. Because of this new perception of the economic scenario of the State, the scope of the earlier notifications had to be restricted. They were first abrogated altogether on 20.05.1977. Thereafter, it was decided to grant exemption at a limited scale.<br/> <br/>The doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked to carry out a representation which is contrary to law or in the abstract. The doctrine must yield when the equity so demands. In the case of <em><strong>Kasinka Trading and another -Vs- Union of India and another</strong></em> (1995) 1 SCC 274 at page 283 paragraph 12 the Supreme Court of India expounded the doctrine as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The doctrine of promissory estoppel is applicable against the Government also particularly where it is necessary to prevent fraud or manifest injustice. The doctrine, however, cannot be pressed into aid to compel the Government or the public authority to carry out a representation or promise which is contrary to law or which was outside the authority or power of the officer of the Government or of the public authority to make. There is preponderance of judicial opinion that to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel clear, sound and positive foundation must be laid in the petition itself by the party invoking the doctrine and that bald expressions, without any supporting material, to the effect that the doctrine is attracted because the party invoking the doctrine has altered its position relying on the assurance of the Government would not be sufficient to press into aid the doctrine. In our opinion, the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked in the abstract and the courts are bound to consider all aspects including the results sought to be achieved and the public good at large, because while considering the applicability of the doctrine, the courts have to do equity and the fundamental principles of equity must for ever be present to the mind of the court, while considering the applicability of the doctrine. The doctrine must yield when the equity so demands if it can be shown having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case that it would be inequitable to hold the Government or the public authority to its promise, assurance or representation."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of <em><strong>Amrit Banaspati Co. Ltd. and another -Vs- State of Punjab and another</strong></em> AIR 1992 SC 1075 the Supreme Court of India observed that promissory estoppel being extension of principle of equity, the basic purpose of which is to promote justice founded on fairness and relieve a promisee of any injustice perpetrated due to promisor's going back on its promise, is incapable of being enforced in a court of law if the promise which furnishes the cause of action or the agreement, express or implied giving rise to binding contract is statutorily prohibited or is against public policy.<br/> <br/>This Division in the case of <em><strong>Chairman, Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha -Vs- A. Rouf Chowdhury and others</strong></em> reported in 61 DLR (AD) 28 quoted with approval the decision of the case of Dr. Ashok Kumar Maheshwari -Vs- State of U.P. reported in AIR 1998 SC 966 wherein it was observed that promissory estoppel cannot be invoked for enforcement of a promise or declaration which is contrary to law or outside the authority or power of the Government or person making that promise. Accordingly this Court held that the argument of promissory estoppel fails for the reason that the sanction was given in violation or in contravention of any law and as such the impugned sanction is not a permission in the eye of law and could not operate as promissory estoppel. Further the Supreme Court of India in <em><strong>Union Territory, Chandigarh Admn -Vs- Managing Society Goswami</strong></em>, DGSCE reported in AIR 1996 SC 1759 held that a contract in violation of the mandatory provisions of law can only be read and enforced in terms of the law and in no other way. The question of equitable estoppel does not arise in this case because there can be no estoppel against statute. <br/> <br/>In view of the above discussions and findings on the decisions of the Apex Courts of the Sub-continent we are very much in respectful agreement with the following principles enunciated in respect of the <em><strong>Doctrine of legitimate expectation</strong></em>:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(1) The doctrine of promissory estoppel being an equitable conception it must yield when equity so requires. If a person who has acted to his detriment relying on the representation made by the representor which transpired to be untrue, the representor is prevented or estopped from denying the truth.<br/>(2) This principle does not create new causes of action where none existed.<br/>(3) The doctrine of promissory estoppel prevents a party from insisting upon his legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them.<br/>(4) Where the representee having acted upon the solemn promise made by the representor incurred huge expenditure and thereby acted to his detriment, the doctrine of promissory estoppel would come in aid of the representee when a representor being the Government or statutory body took a decision to the contrary.<br/>(5) Where a Government or public authority having lack of power agrees to do an act the other party relying on that agreement acted to his detriment yet he would not be able to plead the doctrine of promissory estoppel. Moreover, in the absence of lack of power or statutory prohibition the Government or the statutory body can not be allowed to act inconsistently to it's promise when the other party having relied upon it acted to his detriment and accordingly the doctrine of promissory estoppel will be applicable in that case.<br/>(6) Having considered the facts as they have transpired it would be inequitable to hold the Government to the promise made by it, the Court would not apply the principles of promissory estoppel in favour of the promisee and enforce the promise against the Government when it can be shown that public interest would be prejudiced if the Government were required to carry out the promise made to a citizen the Court would have to balance the public interest in the Government carrying out it's promise made to a citizen who relying upon it changed his position and acted to his detriment and the public interest likely to suffer if the promise were required to be carried out by the Government and determine which way the equity lies.<br/>(7) Excepting the consideration of public interest and estoppel against the statute the doctrine of promissory estoppel would be applicable against the Government or a statutory body who makes a representation and the representee relying on such a representation acted to its detriment.<br/>(8) Even in a case where a party having relied on the promise acted to its detriment if there is any supervening public interest which requires that the benefit be withdrawn or the scheme be modified, that supervening public interest would prevail over any promissory estoppel, inasmuch as, public interest must override any case of private loss or gain.   </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the instant case the NOC dated 05.02.2002 issued by the MOI is not legally operative for the reasons that an intending television operator in order to commence television broadcasting is required to obtain a licence to establish, maintain or work a telegraph and a licence to possess wireless telegraphy apparatus under Section 4(1) of the Telegraph Act,1885 and Section 3 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933 respectively from the MOPT and that the appellant-company has failed to obtain these two licences from the MOPT and as such the NOC dated 05.02.2002 issued by the MOI cannot form the basis of grounds of promissory estoppel based on which the appellants are claiming entitlement to a licence for broadcasting. The NOC dated 05.02.2002 concerned broadcasting through both terrestrial and satellite system but in view of the promulgation of বাংলাদেশ টেলিভিশনের জন্য টেরিস্ট্রিয়াল টেলিভিশন সম্প্রচার সুবিধা সংরক্ষণ অধ্যাদেশ, ২০০৬ (২০০৬ সনের ৩নং অধ্যাদেশ) making provisions for exclusive use of terrestrial system by BTV only and not for any private TV Channel and also by the subsequent enactment of বাংলাদেশ টেলিভিশনের জন্য টেরিস্ট্রিয়াল টেলিভিশন সম্প্রচার সুবিধা সংরক্ষণ আইন,২০০৯ (২০০৯ সনের ৪৪নং আইন) with the same provisions of law the NOC dated 05.02.2002 issued by the MOI had become and still is invalid and ineffective for being cancelled for broadcasting through terrestrial system and as such the said NOC cannot form the basis / ground of promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation on which the appellants are claiming entitlement to a licence for broadcasting. We have also noticed that according to Clause 2(6) of the বেসরকারী মালিকানায় টেলিভিশন চ্যানেল স্থাপন ও পরিচালনা নীতি-১৯৯৮ hereinafter referred to as the Policy of 1998 a licence may be granted under the Policy of 1998 initially for 5(five) years at best meaning that the NOC dated 05.02.2002 issued by the MOI had expired on 04.02.2007 and as such the said NOC cannot form the basis for grounds of promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation. Having gone through the Memos dated 20.11.2008 and 18.12.2008 issued by the BTRC, we are of the view that these are not legally operative as a result of the appellant-company for not having complied with the terms and conditions of the NOC and for not having obtained a licence to establish, maintain or work a telegraph under Section 4(1) of the Telegraph Act,1885 and a licence to possess wireless telegraphy apparatus under Section 3 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933 respectively from the MOPT and that condition No.9 of the NOC stipulated that the Policy of 1998 will be applicable to the NOC and given that as per Clause 2(1) and Clause 2(4)(kha) of the Policy of 1998 an intending television operator is required to obtain two licences from the MOPT. In this context it is pertinent to quote Clause 2(1) of the বেসরকারী মালিকানায় টেলিভিশন চ্যানেল স্থাপন ও পরিচালনা নীতি-১৯৯৮ which reads as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"২। সম্প্রচার সংক্রামত্ম আইনগত ও বিধিবদ্ধ ক্রিয়াকলাপঃ-<br/>        (১) ১৮৮৫ সনের টেলিগ্রাফ ও বেতার আইনের ৪(১) ধারা অনুযায়ী Within Bangladesh, the Government shall have the exclusive privilege of establishing, maintaining and working telegraphs:<br/>        Provided that the Government may grant a license, on such conditions and in consider-ation of such payments as it thinks fit, to any person to establish, maintain or work a telegraph within any part of Bangladesh."<br/>        Further, Clause 2(4)(kha) of the Policy of 1998 runs as under:<br/>"২। সম্প্রচার সংক্রামত্ম আইনগত ও বিধিবদ্ধ ক্রিয়াকলাপঃ-<br/>      ৪(খ) ১৯৩৩ সালের আইনের ৫ ধারা অনুযায়ী The Director General, Bangladesh Post Office or an officer authorised by him in this behalf shall be the authority competent to issue licences to possess wireless           telegraphy apparatus under this Act, and may issue licences in such manner, on such conditions and subject to such payments as many be prescribed." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the facts and circumstances of the case the appellant company was required to obtain allocation of frequency for radio station or television station or broadcasting apparatus or telecommunication apparatus or telecommun-ication apparatus in combination of broadca-sting apparatus. The appellant-company having not fulfilled the precondition by obtaining the aforesaid licences from the MOPT the Memos dated 20.11.2008 and 18.12.2008 issued by the BTRC cannot form the basis of grounds of promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation.<br/> <br/>The protection of legitimate expectation is at the root of the constitutional principle of the rule of law, which requires regularity, predictability and certainty in government's dealings with the public. In the case of Council of Civil Service Unions and others -Vs- Minister for the Civil Service (1984) 3 All ER 935 House of Lords observed that for a legitimate expectation to arise, the decision of the administrative authority must affect such person either- (a) by altering rights or obligations of that person which are enforceable by or against him in private law or (b) by depriving him of some benefit or advantage which he has in the past been permitted by the decision maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until some rational ground for withdrawing it has been commu-nicated to him and he has been given an opportunity to comment thereon or he has received assurance from the decision-maker that they will not be withdrawn without first giving him an opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they should be withdrawn.<br/> <br/>The Supreme Court of India while explaining the nature and scope of the doctrine of legitimate expectation in the case of <em><strong>Food Corporation of India -Vs- M/s Kamdhenu Cattle Feed Industries</strong></em> (1993) 1 SCC 71 at page 76, paragraph 8 observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"The mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen, in such a situation, may not by itself be a distinct enforceable right, but failure to consider and give due weight to it may render the decision arbitrary, and this is how the requirement of due consideration of a legitimate expectation forms part of the principle of non-arbitrariness, a necessary concomitant of the rule of law. Every legitimate expectation is a relevant factor requiring due consideration in a fair decision-making process. Whether the expectation of the claimant is reasonable or legitimate in the context is a question of fact in each case. Whenever the question arises, it is to be determined not according to the claimant's perception but in larger public interest wherein other more important considerations may outweigh what would otherwise have been the legitimate expection of the claimant. A bona fide decision of the public authority reached in this manner would satisfy the requirement of non-arbitrariness and withstand judicial scrutiny. The doctrine of legitimate expectation gets assimilated in the rule of law and operates in our legal system in this manner and to this extent."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of <em><strong>Punjab Communications Ltd. -Vs- Union of India and others</strong></em> (1999) 4 SCC 727 the Supreme Court of India held that a change in policy can defeat a substantive legitimate expectation if it can be justified on "Wednesbury" reasonableness. The decision maker has the choice in the balancing of the pros and cons relevant to the change in policy. Therefore, the choice of the policy is for the decision maker and not for the Court. The legitimate substantive expectation merely permits the Court to find out if the change in policy which is the cause for defeating the legitimate expectation is irrational or perverse or one which no reasonable person could have made.<br/> <br/>The Court would interfere with the decision taken by the authority when the same was found to be arbitrary or gross abuse of power or violation of natural justice. In the case of <em><strong>Sethi Auto Service Station and another -Vs- Delhi Development Authority and others</strong></em> 2009 (1) SCC 180 D.K. Jain,J. observed thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"32. ......... A case for applicability of the doctrine of legitimate expectation, now accepted in the subjective sense as part of our legal jurisprudence, arises when an administrative body by reason of a representation or by past practice or conduct aroused an expectation which it would be within its powers to fulfill unless some overriding public interest comes in the way. However, a person who bases his claim on the doctrine of legitimate expectation, in the first instance, has to satisfy that he has relied on the said representation and the denial of that expectation has worked to his detriment. The Court could interfere only if the decision taken by the authority was found to be arbitrary, unreasonable or in gross abuse of power or in violation of principles of natural justice and not taken in public interest. But a claim based on mere legitimate expectation without anything more cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke these principles."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Court having considered the facts and circumstances of the case further observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"39. We are convinced that apart from the fact that there is no challenge to the new policy, which seems to have been conceived in public interest in the light of the changed economic scenario and liberalized regime of permitting private companies to set up petrol outlets, the decision of DDA in declining to allot land for resitement of petrol pumps, a matter of largesse, cannot be held to be arbitrary or unreasonable warranting interference. Moreover, with the change in policy, any direction in favour of the appellants in this regard would militate against the new policy of 2003. In our opinion, therefore, the principle of legitimate expectation has no application to the facts at hand."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>This Division in the case of <em><strong>SSA Bangladesh Limited -Vs- Engineer Mahmud-Ul-Islam and others</strong></em> reported in 24 BLD (AD) 92 held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"60. The principle of legitimate expect-ation as enunciated in Schmidt -Vs- Secretary of State of Home Affairs reported in (1969) 1 Ch.140 imposed upon the Government or the concerned Authorities a duty to act fairly and reasonably in dealing with the rights and / or interest of the people and in case of any breach thereof the Court should act upon in striking down any order in exercise of judicial review of executive action and in case of any unreasonableness or inertness or [even] latches in its part for which some or part of which benefit is lost causing prejudice to the people at large, the Court may direct the concerned to exercise its functions fairly, reasonably and in accordance with law and established principles.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">61. Thus the legitimacy of an action / expectation can be inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of law or customs or established practice or procedure in regular or natural sequence, otherwise, it would betray the [expectation] of the public and exercising its function fairly, reasonably and in accordance with law and principles."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of the <em><strong>Chairman, Textile Mills Corporation -Vs- Nasir Ahmed Chowdhury and others</strong></em> reported in 22 BLD (AD) 199 this Division quoted with approval the following passages:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>        "24. A passage in Administrative law (Eighth Edition) by David Foulkes reads thus:<br/>‘The right to a hearing, or to be consulted, or generally to put one's case, may also arise out of the action of the authority itself. This action may take one of two, or both forms: a promise (or a statement or undertaking) or a regular procedure. Both the promise and the procedure are capable of giving rise to what is called a legitimate expectation, that is, an expectation of the kind which the courts will enforce. The analogy with estoppel will be apparent. Existence of a regular practice which could reasonably be expected to continue.’<br/><br/>25. In the said book upon referring to NG's case (1983) 2 All 386= (1983) 2 AC 629) illustration has been given as to enforceable legitimate expectation can arise from a statement or undertaking and then upon referring to the ratio of the case of Council of Civil Service Unions (1985) AC 374, (1984) 3 All ER 935) has observed therein legitimate expectation arose not out of a promise, but out of the existence of a regular practice which could reasonably be expected to continue."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Having considered the decisions referred to and the passages quoted in the judgment from the book referred to this Division in the case reported in 22 BLD (AD) 199 at page 220 paragraph 50 observed as under:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"The doctrine of legitimate expectation comes to arise in the background of the principle that a public authority to bound by its undertaking as to procedure it will follow provided they do not conflict with its duty (1983) 2 AC 629; if the public policy was to be changed the applicant should be given 'full and serious consideration whether there is some overriding public interest' justifying the new departure (1984) 1 WLR 1337; 'a public authority has a duty to act with fairness and consistency in its dealing with the public and that if it makes inconsistent decisions unfairly or unjustly it misuse its power; existence of a regular practice which could reasonably be accepted to continue (1985) AC 374." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of <em><strong>Syed SM Hasan -Vs- Bangladesh and another</strong></em> reported in 60 DLR (AD) 76 at page 81 paragraph 31 this Court observed-<br/>"The concept reasonable expectation has imposed a duty on the public authority to act fairly by taking into consideration all relevant factors relating to the expectation as the denial of it would amount to denial of the right guaranteed or secured and would lead to arbitrary, unfair or discriminatory treatment."<br/> <br/>In view of the above decisions we approve the following principles enunciated by the Apex Courts of the Sub-continent in respect of the Doctrine of legitimate expectation:-</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The doctrine of legitimate expectation may arise where the decision of administrative authority affect a person either by altering rights or obligations of that person which are enforceable by or against him in private law or by depriving him of some benefit which he has in the past been permitted by the decision maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until some rational ground for withdrawing it has been communicated to him and he has been given an opportunity to comment thereon.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Even legitimate expectation is a relevant factor requiring due consideration in a fair decision-making process.

The Court must not usurp the discretion of the public authority.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Further, we find force in the submission of the learned Attorney General in reply to the appellant’s contention that the NOC dated 05.02.2002 issued by the MOI is not legally operative and it can not form the basis for grounds of invoking promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation on the basis of which appellants are claiming entitlement to a licence for broadcasting. According to Clause 2(6) of the Policy of 1998 the NOC dated 05.02.2002 having expired on 04.02.2007 cannot form the basis for grounds of promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation based on which the appellants are claiming entitlement to a licence for broadcasting. We are also of the view that the conduct of the appellants in carrying out test transmission since 15.10.2009 and submitting report of the same to the BTRC vide letter dated 01.11.2009 are of no legal effect as a result of non-compliance with the terms and conditions of the Memo dated 20.11.2008 and as such the carrying out test transmission and submission of report by the appellants cannot form the basis for grounds of promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation. In view of above discussions, we are constrained to hold that the appellant cannot invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel because of their non-compliance with the terms and conditions of the NOC dated 05.02.2002 and also the BTRC’s memos dated 20.11.2008 and 18.12.2008. In the premises, it may lead to an irresistible conclusion that the appellants having not acted upon the said representations, the principle of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked by them. Similarly, the question of legitimate expectation does not arise in view of the appellants failure to comply with the NOC dated 05.02.2002 and the BTRC’s memos dated 20.11.2008 and 18.12.2008 for not having obtained any of the said two licences from the MOPT. Furthermore, we are also of the view that the MOPT having the exclusive right to grant licence under Section 4(1) of the Telegraph Act,1885, the appellants cannot assert their entitlement to have licence for broadcasting invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel from the BTRC, inasmuch as, the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be allowed to override the expressed provisions of the Telegraph Act,1885 claiming entitlements to have licence for broadcasting from the BTRC. The ground of legitimate expectation is also contradictory to the provisions of Section 3(2) of the B.T. Act,2001 which is not applicable to any broadcasting or any radio broadcasting station or television broadcasting station or licensing of such station or any broadcasting apparatus or any apparatus for receiving any message or other information or a programme transmitted by way of broadcast or the business of such apparatus and as such the appellants cannot invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel or any legitimate expectation to override and invalidate the expressed provisions of Section 3(2) of the B.T. Act,2001.<br/> <br/>In the case of Bangladesh Tele-communication Regulatory Commission –Vs- Ekushey Television Ltd. reported in 58 DLR (AD) 82 this Division has meticulously considered the preambles of the Telegraph Act,1885, the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933 and the B.T. Act,2001 to decide as to whether the B.T. Act of 2001 has any overriding effect over all other legislations in the field vis-a-vis the applicability of the old legislation in respect of the granting of licence for broadcasting as contemplated in Section 3(2) of the B.T. Act,2001. In this context in the aforesaid reported decision this Division while interpreting the preambles of the these Acts examined Section 4 of the Telegraph Act,1885 which provides for issuance of a licence for the purpose of broadcasting its programmes and Section 5 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933 which provides for regulating the possession of wireless telegraphy apparatus and also the provision of Section 3(2) of the B.T. Act,2001. In doing so this Division set aside the findings of the High Court Division to the effect that the B.T. Act of 2001 is applicable in respect of all the matters mentioned in Section 3 of the B.T. Act and the BTRC is the sole and exclusive authority to grant such licence necessary for the purpose in the manner as prescribed in the B.T. Act and no licence from the MOI would be necessary for the matters mentioned in Section 3 of the B.T. Act of 2001.<br/> <br/>From a careful reading of B.T. Act,2001, it can be safely construed that the B.T. Act of 2001 has been enacted to cope with the technological advancement and development arising out of deficiencies in the existing laws namely, Telegraph Act,1885 and the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933. To cope with the existing difficult situations and to meet with the needs of the technological advancement the B.T. Act,2001 has been enacted to provide for establishment of an independent Commission for the purpose of development and efficient regulation of telecommunication systems and telecommunication services and for the transfer of powers and functions of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunication to the Commission and matters ancillary thereto. Having considered the preambles and the substantive provisions of the aforesaid three Acts this Division in the case reported in 58 DLR (AD) 82 at paragraph 37 observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“From a comparative study of the aforesaid terms provided in different legislations it appears that the three Acts distinctly and separately detailed about the gradual developments that have taken place through the passage of time in the field of telegraph, wireless communication and telecommunication systems and services.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>We are of the view that Section 3 of the B.T. Act,2001 contains both inclusion clause and exclusion clause inasmuch as the inclusion clause in the proviso to Sub-Section (2) of Section 3 reads as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“provided that this Act shall apply to the following: (i) allocation of frequency for such radio station or television station or broadcasting apparatus, or control of the allocated frequency; (ii) use of a telecommunication apparatus in combination with broadcasting apparatus or use of telecommunication apparatus for the purpose of broadcasting.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears that the proviso to Section 3(2) specifically includes the applicability of the Act for allocation of frequency for such radio station or television station or broadcasting apparatus or control of the allocated frequency, use of a telecommunication apparatus in combination with broadcasting apparatus or use of telecommunication apparatus for the purpose of broadcasting.<br/> <br/>We know that broadcasting has been defined in Section 2 of the B.T. Act,2001 meaning “transmission of any message, information, signal, sound, image or intellectual expression by media wave, satellite, cable or optical fibre connection for the purpose of receipt by the public, but transmission of anything by internet connection shall not be deemed to be a broadcasting”.<br/> <br/>From the discussions made hereinabove it appears that Section 3(2) provides that the B.T. Act of 2001 is not applicable to any broadcasting, a radio broadcasting station, or a television broadcasting station, or licensing of such station, or broadcasting apparatus, or an apparatus for receiving any message etc. This view of ours has been fortified by the decision of this Division in the ETV case [58 DLR (AD) 82 at page 91 paragraph 53]. In this case this Division having elaborately considered the provisions of Telegraph Act,1885, the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933 and the B.T. Act,2001 held that the Wireless Telegraphy Act authorizes the Director-General, Bangladesh Post Office or an Officer authorised by him to issue licence only to possess wireless telegraphy apparatus on such conditions and subject to such payments as may be prescribed and hence nothing to do with the object mentioned in Section 3(2) of the B.T. Act,2001. Section 4 of the Telegraph Act,1885 provides for exclusive privilege of establish-ing, maintaining and working telegraphs by the Government, who shall grant a licence to any person on such conditions and in consideration of such payments to establish, maintain or work a telegraph within any part of Bangla-desh and that the Government is authorised by rules made under the Act to permit, subject to such restrictions and conditions as it thinks fit, the establishment, maintenance and working of wireless telegraphs on ships within Bangladesh territorial waters and on aircraft within or above Bangladesh or Bangladesh territorial waters and of telegraphs other than wireless telegraphs within any part of Bangladesh. It is to be noted that a licence is to be obtained for exercise of the privilege of establishing, maintaining and working telegraph on certain terms and conditions from the Government under the provisions of Telegraph Act,1885 and that the provisions of B.T. Act,2001 have also expressly and specifically excluded the application of the said Act in respect of any broadcasting or a radio broadcasting station or a television broadcasting station or licensing of such station, broadcasting apparatus or an apparatus for receiving any message or other information or a programme transmitted by way of broadcast or the business of such apparatus. Moreover, the provisions of the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933 regulate the possession of wireless telegraphy apparatus.<br/> <br/>In order to find out the object and the scheme of the B.T. Act of 2001 we having examined the provisions of Sections 4, 5, 6, 29, 30, 31, 35, 36 and 51 of the B.T. Act of 2001 in respect of functions of the Ministry (MOPT) and power of the Government respectively vis-a-vis the powers and functions of the Commis-sion (BTRC) for the purpose of development and efficient regulation of telecommunication system services in Bangladesh and matters ancillary thereto formed the opinion that the B.T. Act,2001 shall apply to the allocation of frequency of such media station or television station or broadcasting apparatus or control of allocated frequency, use of a telecommu-nication apparatus in combination with broadcasting apparatus or use of telecommu-nication apparatus for the purpose of broadcasting. Having elaborately examined the different provisions of the relevant laws this Division in ETV case at paragraph 79 observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Thus, from the above, it is apparently clear that Bangladesh Telecommuni-cation Act,2001 has not been made applicable to any ‘broadcasting’, a radio broadcasting station or a television broadcasting station or licensing of such station, broadcasting apparatus or an apparatus for receiving any message or other information or a programme transmitted by way of broadcast or the business of such apparatus, which job have been preserved to the Govt. of Bangladesh under the provisions of Telegraph Act,1885 to provide for the issuance of licence or no-objection for the purposes inasmuch as the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933 regulates the possession of Wireless Telegraphy apparatus in Bangladesh empowering the Director General, Bangladesh Post Office or an officer authorised by him to issue licences for the purpose.” Admittedly the appellants did not pray for issuance of licence either under the Act of 1885 or the Act of 1933. Mr. Ajmalul Hossain, learned Advocate straneously argued that no such licences are now required for operating a television channel in Bangladesh and therefore, the appellants did not apply for issuance of such licences. When his attention is drawn to the above observations of this Division, the learned Advocate relented and submitted that due to inadvertent mistake the appellants did not apply for such licences.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In view of the aforesaid discussions and findings we have no hesitation in holding that Bangladesh Telegraph Act,1885, Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933 and B.T. Act,2001 have been enacted for separate, distinct and specified purposes as detailed above and each Act has its own object, characteristics and specified field of operation as has been spelt out in the respective preambles and the contents. In the decision reported in 58 DLR (AD) 82 this Division held that the writ-petitioner-appellant should have applied for licence or NOC for Broadcasting to the MOI and after obtaining the same then could approach the BTRC for allocation of frequency and other ancillary matters detailed above. The question of permission for importation of apparatus and issuance of licence for allocation of frequency are within the power and jurisdiction of the BTRC under the provisions of B.T. Act,2001. Thus, BTRC is obliged under the law, on an appropriate application for licence, etc, to issue the same under the B.T. Act,2001.<br/> <br/>In the instant case before us admittedly the appellant-company applied to the MOI on 08.10.2009 for re-issuance of fresh NOC. But the said application has not yet been disposed of. Rather the appellants are claiming entitlement to licence for broadcasting from the BTRC without having obtained the requisite licences issued by the MOPT under the Telegraph Act,1885 and the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1933 and fresh NOC by the MOI against their application dated 08.10.2009. But as per Section 55 of the B.T. Act,2001, the appellant-company needs frequency to be allocated by the BTRC and a licence from the BTRC for establishing, operating or using radio apparatus for the purpose of radio communication and such licence is not a licence concerning broadcasting apparatus but is separate and different from the licences to be granted by the MOPT and the NOC from the MOI for the purpose of broadcasting.<br/> <br/>In the instant case without having obtained requisite licence and the NOC from the concerned Ministries, the appellant-company shall not be allocated frequency or issued licence for the establishment, operation and use of radio apparatus for the purpose of radio communication as it has failed to obtain requisite licences and NOC issued by the concerned Ministries and as the formalities in issuing licence for radio apparatus and allocation of frequency stipulated in Section 56(8) and (9) of the B.T. Act,2001 are yet to be complied with.<br/> <br/>However, it has been asserted that the appellant-company has invested huge amount of money for installation of the TV station and employed three thousand employees and also went on test transmission and that subsequently the impugned orders dated 19.11.2009 (Annexure-A series) were issued to stop the test transmission of the Jamuna Television Channel and to cancell the allocated satellite frequency and using of earth station and SNG / DSNG machineries and that the equipments and machineries of the appellant-company were seized by the respondent Nos.3 and 4 under the seizure list dated 19.11.2009 (Annexure-A-2).<br/> <br/>We find that the appellant-company admittedly has neither exhausted the forum for disposal of the application dated 08.10.2009 by the MOI nor obtained requisite licences and NOC from the MOPT and the MOI respectively for broadcasting television before obtaining frequency and licence for establishing, operating or using radio apparatus for the purpose of radio communication from the BTRC under Section 55 of the B.T. Act,2001. For the aforesaid reasons we do not find any illegality in the aforesaid orders passed by the respondents as contained in Annexures-A and A1 to stop the test transmi-ssion of their TV Channel and the seizure of the appellants’ machineries and equipments installed in the television station under the seizure list (Annexure-A2). Since long time has elapsed the appellants failed to take proper steps in obtaining necessary licences and NOC from the concerned Ministries before obtaining frequency and licence for using broadcasting apparatus, there is no illegality in the actions taken by the respondents. Considering the huge amount of money invested by the appellant-company in importing machineries and equipments and installation of the same in the Television Station the subsequent seizure of the same for indefinite period seems to be too harsh and therefore, to ameliorate the situation, we may invoke Article 104 of the Constitution for doing complete justice in the present case.<br/> <br/>Under Article 104 of the Constitution in the exercise of its jurisdiction this Division is entitled to issue such directions, orders, decrees or writs as may be necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it. It confers very wide powers on this Division to do complete justice in a matter pending before it. In the case of Khandker Jillul Bari -Vs- The State 2009 BLT (AD) 28 this Division held that it's exclusive power under Article 104 the Constitution applies as special and extraordinary jurisdiction to avoid miscarriage of justice by establishing complete justice and that this extraordinary power has been given to it and not to the High Court Division. The object of this Article is to enable this Division to give such directions or pass such orders as necessary to do complete justice. This inherent power has been conferred upon this Division to do the right and to undo the wrong and to act ex-debito justicia to do the real and substantial justice for which they exists. The conferment of power is under special circumstances and for special reasons. Article 104 gives a power to this Division where it has jurisdiction but it does not confer a new jurisdiction. In the case of Raziul Hasan -Vs- Bodiuzzaman Khan and others 16 BLD (AD) (1996) 253 this Division held that when it is found that a gross injustice has been done to the appellant for no fault or laches of his own and a valuable right accrued to him is being lost and no other remedy is available to him for redress of his grievance, this Division found it to be a fit case to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 104 of the Constitution for doing complete justice.<br/> <br/>This is an extra ordinary power conferred by the Constitution upon this Division. The term “complete justice” cannot be defined; any attempt to define it would defeat the very purpose of such power. The word complete justice has no definite meaning. In the case of National Board of Revenue, Dhaka -Vs- Nasrin Banu and 5 others 1996 48 DLR (AD) 171 at page 178 paragraph 26 this Division observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"The words "complete justice" do not yield precise definition. Cases vary, situations vary and the scale and parameter of complete justice also vary. Sometimes it may be justice according to law, sometimes it may be justice according to fairness, equity and good conscience, sometimes it may be in the nature of arbitration, sometimes it may be justice tempered with mercy, sometimes it may be pure commonsense, sometimes it may be the inference of an ordinary reasonable man and so on.  ------------- ----------- ---------- --------------.  "          </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The expression 'complete justice' contained in Article 104 is of wide amplitude. Article 104 does not envisage any limitation regarding causes or the circumstances in which power is to be exercised. The exercise of such power is left completely to the discretion of this Division. The power of passing any order or decree in the interest of justice has been conferred upon this Division under Article 104. The powers of this Division under Article 104 are inherent and are complementary to those powers which are specifically conferred on this Division by various statutes.   <br/> <br/>The inherent power under Article 104 cannot be invoked when alternative remedy is available. The phrase 'complete justice' as per Article 142 of the Indian Constitution was expressed by the Supreme Court of India in S. Nagaraj -Vs- State of Karnataka reported in (1993) Suppl. (4) SCC 595 in the following words:<br/> <br/>"The phrase 'complete justice' engrafted in Article 142(1) is the word of width couched with elasticity to meet myriad situations created by human ingenuity or cause or result of operation of statute law  or law declared under Articles 32, 136 and 141 of the Constitution and cannot be cribbed or cabined within any limitations or phraseology."  <br/> <br/>We are of the view that the power granted under Article 104 of the Constitution is an important constitutional power granted to this Division to protect the citizens. While exercising its inherent power under Article 104 this Division can not override the statutory provisions. In the case of Laxmidas Morarji (dead) by L.Rs. -Vs- Behrose Darab Madan reported in (2009) 10 SCC 425 at page 433 paragraph 25 the Supreme Court of India observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">" ....... The power under Article 142 of the Constitution is a constitutional power and hence not restricted by statutory enactments, the Supreme Court would not pass any order under Article 142 of the Constitution which would amount to supplanting substantive law applicable or ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with the subject, at the same time these constitutional powers cannot in any way, be controlled by any statutory provisions. However, it is to be made clear that this power cannot be used to supplant the law applicable to the case. This means that acting under Article 142 the Supreme Court cannot pass an order or grant relief which is totaly inconsistent or goes against the substantive or statutory enactments pertaining to the case. The power is to be used sparingly in cases which cannot be effectively and appropriately tackled by the existing provisions of law or when the existing provisions of law cannot bring about complete justice between the parties."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It has been stated that for doing complete justice the Court can even ignore the statutory provisions regulating the matter in dispute but normally the Court cannot. In the case of the Delhi Judicial Service Association -Vs- State of Gujarat reported in (1991) 4 SCC 406 at page 463, para.51 the Supreme Court of India observed as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"No enactment made by Central or State legislature can limit or restrict the power of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution, though while exercising power under Article 142 of the Constitution, the Court must take into consideration the statutory provisions regulating the matter in dispute."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In view of the provisions of Section 20 (1) of the Telegraph Act,1885 which provides for punishment with imprisonment which extend to 3 years with fine for establishing, maintaining or working Telegraph without licence and Section 6 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act which provides that whoever possesses any wireless telegraphy apparatus without licence he shall be punished with fine and also confiscation of the apparatus in respect of which an offence has been committed and Section 35(2) of the B.T. Act,2001 which provides for punishment with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to a fine not exceeding taka ten lac or both for operating telegraphy system in Bangladesh or outside Bangladesh by telecommunication service without licence and Section 55(7) of B.T. Act,2001 which provides for punishment with sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to fine not exceeding taka 10 lac or both for installing operating or using any radio apparatus without licence, the respondents rightly issued the memos dated 19.11.2009 (Annexure-A series).<br/> <br/>There is no illegality in the finding of the High Court Division to the effect that the appellant-company is not entitled to broadcast or transmit any telecommunication without any licence and NOC granted under the relevant provisions of law as stated above and that there are punitive measures for such violation of law. The High Court Division rightly found that the MOI being in-charge of managing and controlling the contents of broadcasting or transmitting issued the order dated 19.11.2009 whereby some machineries and equipments were seized under a seizure list dated 19.11.2009.  We find that the MOI rightly discharged its’ statutory duty by requesting the appellants to stop illegal broadcasting and in furtherance thereof the Ministry referred the matter to the Commission (BTRC) who in carrying out its statutory duties and obligations as envisaged in Section 30 (2) (d) (o) and Section 34 (b) and (c) of the B.T. Act,2001 rightly cancelled the allocation of frequency. In order to effectuate total stoppage of the illegal broadcasting the BTRC rightly seized machineries and equipments under a seizure list dated 19.11.2009. In the facts and circumstances of the case we are of the view that there is no illegality in issuing the memos dated 19.11.2009 and seizing the machineries and equipments. It has been asserted that the appellant-company invested huge amount of money for installation of the TV station and employed three thousand employees and also went on test transmission and installed machineries and equipments. But because of failure of the appellant-company to obtain necessary licences and NOC from the concerned Ministries and authorities, the respondents by the orders dated 19.11.2009 rightly cancelled the allocation of satellite frequency and use of earth station and SNG / DSNG machineries and equipments and seized those machineries and equipments. The appellant-company said to have obtained allocation of frequency and permission for importing machineries and equipments and invested huge amount of money in importing those machineries and equipments and installed the same in it's premises. But it has already been noticed that the appellant-company did not obtain the requisite licences and NOC from concerned Ministries as a result of which the respondent authority cancelled the allocation of frequency and use of earth station and SNG / DSNG machineries and equipments and seized those machineries and equipments under a seizure list dated 19.11.2009. There was no illegality in the cancellation of allocation of frequency and seizure of the machineries and equipments to stop the unauthorised broadcasting. The appellant-company said to have invested huge amount of money and employed three thousand employees and it has asserted that it will be seriously prejudiced if the seized machineries and equipments be kept for indefinite period and not properly maintained in good condition. As this Division held that "complete justice may be justice tempered with mercy", in the facts and circumstances of the case, we do hereby invoke the extra ordinary powers under Article 104 of the Constitution to do complete justice to the appellant-company for releasing the machineries and equipments seized from the appellant-company by the respondents.<br/> <br/>However, considering the anxiety of the appellants as to the present condition of the machineries and equipments seized by the respondents and to facilitate them for making best use of the same after obtaining requisite licences and NOC from the concerned Ministries and authorities in accordance with law, we therefore, invoke Article 104 of the Constitution to do complete justice by directing the respondents to release the machineries and equipments seized from the appellants’ TV station as per seizure list dated 19.11.2009 (Annexure-A2) for proper mainten-ance, safety and keeping in good condition of the same.<br/> <br/>In the light of the above findings and discussions we do not find any illegality in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division in disposing the Rule with the direction. There is no illegality in the order dated 19.11.2009 to stop test transmission of the appellant-company's Television Channel cancelling the allocated satellite frequency and using of earth station, SNA and DSNA machineries and equipments and seizing the machineries and equipments under the seizure list dated 19.11.2009.  However, in view of the observations and findings made hereinabove, the appeal is allowed-in-part in doing complete justice, the respondents are hereby directed to release the machineries and equipments seized from the appellant-company’s TV stations as per seizure list dated 19.11.2009 (Annexure-A2) and to dispose of the appellants’ application dated 08.10.2009 in accordance with law within 1(one) month from the date of receipt of a copy of the judgment.<br/> <br/>However, at this stage the appellants are not entitled to broadcast or transmit any telecommunication without having obtained requisite licences and NOC in accordance with law from the concerned Ministries and authorities.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, respondent No.3 vide Memo No.1228-Bichar-7/2N-170/78(Angsha-1) dated 14.11.2002 approved the appointment of the respondent No.4-appellant as the Nikah Registrar on temporary basis for No.12, Rangasree Union. But on the same day the respondent No.3 by the Memo No.1229-Bichar-7/2N-170/78 (Angsha-1) dated 14.11.2002 revoked the licence of Nikah Registrar of the writ petitioner-respondent No.1 for the area of No.12, Rangasree Union without giving him any reasonable opportunity to show cause. Being aggrieved, the writ petitioner-respondent No.1 moved the High Court Division and obtained Rule nisi upon the writ-respondent No.4-appellant and an ad-interim order allowing the writ petitioner-respondent No.1 to continue his function as Nikah Registrar. A Division Bench of the High Court Division after hearing both the parties by the judgment and order dated 01.11.2003 made the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, the appellant preferred the instant Civil Appeal by leave before this Court. Leave was granted to consider the following grounds:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“I.  Whether the High Court Division has committed an error of law in concluding that the writ petitioner’s licence had been cancelled without giving him any opportunity to show cause, inasmuch as the writ petitioner was asked by the Assistant Director, Local Government to appear before him twice, but the writ petitioner deliberately abstained from appearing before the Assistant Director.<br/>II.   Whether the High Court Division has committed an error of law in coming to the conclusion that the show cause notice served upon the writ petitioner had become irrelevant because of long gap between the time of service of notice and the act of cancellation, but the said Division failed to consider that the licence could not be cancelled earlier because of an order of stay granted by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.2805 of 1996.<br/>III. Whether the High Court Division has committed an error of law in holding that the writ petitioner is entitled to a prior show cause notice before cancellation of his temporary licence which is contrary to various decisions of the Appellate Division in which it has been consistently held that to cancel the licence of a temporary Nikah Registrar no show cause notice is required to be issued.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Mr. Abdur Razzaq, the learned Senior Advocate for the writ respondent No.4-appellant submits that the writ petitioner-respondent No.1 is not a permanent resident of No.12, Rangasree Union and that he has been appointed as Nikah Registrar by producing an identity card which was procured by practicing fraud upon the relevant authorities. He contends that the respondent No.1 was appointed on a purely temporary basis and that his appointment was to remain valid until the Ministry received the enquiry report. He submits that two notices dated 04.09.1997 and 14.09.1997 were issued upon the respondent No.1 and that he failed to answer to those show cause notices and thus it is not illegal in revoking the licence of the respondent No.1. He then submits that the High Court Division committed an error of law in holding that the writ petitioner-respondent No.1 is entitled to get a prior show cause notice before cancellation of his temporary licence which is contrary to various decisions of the Appellate Division. The learned Advocate for the appellant finally submits that the High Court Division committed error of law in concluding that the show cause notice served upon the respondent No.1 had become irrelevant because of a long lapse of time between the time of service of show cause notice and the act of cancellation of the licence and failed to consider that it was not possible to cancel the licence earlier because of an order of stay granted by the High Court Division and as such the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division is not sustainable in law and the same is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshid Alam Khan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the writ petitioner-respondent No.1 submits that the revocation of licence of the respondent No.1 as Nikah Registrar of No.12, Rangasree Union without serving notice to show case was violation of the provision of Section 11 of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act and as such the High Court Division has committed no wrong in making the Rule absolute. He submits that two show cause notices dated 04.09.1997 and 14.09.1997 respectively were issued upon the respondent No.1 asking him to attend before the Enquiry Committee headed by the District Nikah Registrar and that the licence of the respondent No.1 was however cancelled almost five years subsequently and without assigning any reason of the cancellation of the licence and as such the order of revocation without any reason by a non-speaking order is liable to be declared to have been made without lawful authority. Mr. Khan further submits that a person is temporarily appointed as a Nikah Registrar to enable the District Registrar to complete the formalities required under Rule 5 of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Rules,1975 and that a temporary appointed Nikah Registrar can have a legitimate expectation to continue in that post until a permanent Nikah Registrar is appointed and that a temporary Nikah Registrar cannot be replaced by another temporary Nikah Registrar without any specific allegation or without any show cause notice and as such the High Court Division rightly made the Rule absolute with observa-tion. He finally submits that respondent No.1 was given a temporary licence on 18.01.1995 as per Rule 5A(1) of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Rules, 1975 as amended by SRO 10-Law / 2001 dated 14.01.2001 and that he will be deemed to be a permanent Nikah Registrar and entitled to be given a permanent licence and in that view of the matter the licence of the respondent No.1 cannot be cancelled without giving him a prior hearing or show cause notice as provided by Section 11 of the said Act and Rule 8(2) of the aforesaid Rules and as such there is no illegality in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and as such no interference is called for by this Division and the appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>We have heard the learned Advocate for both the parties and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division, concise statements submitted on behalf of the parties and also other materials available on record.<br/> <br/>It appears that the respondent No.1 was appointed as temporary Nikah Registrar on 18.01.1995 and he served more than six years as Nikah Registrar and there was no allegation against him and before the cancellation of licence no show cause notice was served upon the respondent No.1. It has been well established that no action should be taken against a person without giving him any opportunity of being heard. In the case of University of Dhaka –Vs- Jakir Hossain reported in 16 DLR (SC) 722 it was held that no action should be taken against a person without giving him any opportunity of being heard. According to Section 11 of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act, 1975 no order for cancellation and suspension of a licence shall be made unless the Nikah Registrar has been given a reasonable opportu-nity of showing cause why that order should not be made. It appears that the High Court Division rightly found that the writ petitioner was initially given temporary licence on 18.01.1995 as per Rule 5A(1) of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Rules,1975. Under Section 11 read with Rule 8(2) of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Rules, 1975 notice is required to be served upon the Nikah Registrar before cancellation of licence and it is also a fundamental principle of natural justice that no action shall be taken against any person without giving him any opportunity of being heard. In view of the above discussions and finding we are of the view that the High Court Division rightly found that since the respondent No.1 was initially given tempo-rary licence on 18.01.1995 he will be entitled to have a licence of a Nikah Registrar on regular basis from the Government after satisfactory performance as Nikah Registrar at least for three years having requisite qualifications specified in Rule 8 of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Rules, 1975. We have also noticed that the High Court Division has rightly observed that if there is any allegation against the writ petitioner-respondent No.1 then the respondent Nos.2 to 4 are at liberty to hold an enquiry into the matter after giving the respondent No.1 a notice to show cause and thereafter take steps as per law and if necessary cancell his licence pursuant to Section 11 of the aforesaid Act and or Rule 5A(2) of the aforesaid Rules. But in the instant case no such step was taken by the Government while cancelling of the licence of the respondent No.1. Accordingly, we do not find any illegality in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division. In view of the above findings and observations, we do not find any merit in this Appeal.<br/> <br/>In the result, the appeal is dismissed with cost of Tk.500/-. The impugned judgment and order dated 01.11.2003 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.7505 of 2002 is hereby affirmed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Abul Kalam Md. Shafi Ullah @ Tarik, 2. Md. Tariqul Islam and 3. Md. Tareque Aziz in Special Tribunal Case No. 54 of 2006 under section 4(b)/6 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908. Whilst the first two named persons were convicted under section 4(b)/6 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 (hereinafter referred to the Act) and sentenced thereunder to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 15 years, Tareque Aziz, the appellant before us, was convicted under section 6 of the Act and sentenced thereunder to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years.<br/><br/>However, the instant appeal has been preferred by Tareque Aziz only against the order of conviction and sentence passed by the Special Tribunal No. 4, Rajshahi.<br/><br/>Mr. Mohammad Nazrul Islam, the learned Advocate appears on behalf of the appellant Tareque Aziz, while Mr. Tapash Kumar Biswas, DAG with Mrs. Rahima Khatun, AAG and Mr. Abdur Rokib, AAG appear for the State.<br/><br/>Mr. Nazrul Islam has placed the paper book before us. At the very outset, the learned Advocate submits that the allegation levelled against the appellant does not constitute an offence so as to bring the same within the ambit and scope of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908. The learned Advocate further submits that the allegation against the appellant relates to recovery of certain books and cassette which has been termed as “জেহাদী” by the prosecution, but there is no evidence to that effect. Mr. Islam has argued with considerable force and substance that the evidence that has been adduced by the prosecution with regard to the allegation against the appellant indicates otherwise.<br/><br/>Referring to the order dated 12.02.2006 whereby charge was framed by the learned Judge of the Tribunal, Mr. Islam submits that a reading of the same clearly indicates that the trial against the present appellant was vitiated from its very outset. Elaborating his submission, Mr. Islam submits that charge was framed against the three accused persons under section 4(b)/6 of the Act, although the specific charge against the present appellant related only to possession of “জেহাদী” books and cassettes. Therefore, according to Mr. Islam, by no stretch of imagination can the appellant be said to have committed any offence which would render him liable to be charged under section 4 of the Act. Mr. Islam contends that the appellant was convicted only under section 6 of the Act, which goes to show that the framing of charge as against this appellant was improper, which had vitiated the trial.<br/><br/>Referring to the deposition of PW 16, Md. Sirajul Islam, Sub-Inspector of Godagari Thana, Rajshahi,Mr. Islam submits that this witness, who was the Investigating Officer (briefly I/O) of the case, had categorically deposed that the books and cassettes in question were received by him from the Thana and the said publication was not declared to be illegal or prohibited at any point of time. PW 16 had further stated that “the books and cassettes were not explosive substances”. Putting considerable emphasis on the deposition of PW 16, Mr. Islam submits that it is palpably clear that the prosecution had failed to prove the allegations that were brought against this appellant. <br/><br/>Mr. Islam next contends that even if it is accepted, but not conceded, that the books and cassettes in question were recovered from this appellant, yet, there is no evidence within the four corners of the prosecution case to indicate that they were “জেহাদী” in nature, as was claimed by the prosecution. Mr. Islam further submits that in the impugned judgment itself, there is no discussion by the learned Judge of the Tribunal with regard to any finding that the said cassettes and books were “জেহাদী” in nature.<br/><br/>Mr. Islam has also argued on a legal point which relates to the imposition of the conviction and sentence under section 6 of the Act. Elaborating his submission, Mr. Islam submits that section 6 of the Act provides for punishment of an abettor i.e., a person who aids or abates in the commission of any offence under the Act by providing or supplying money or materials in any manner whatsoever. Mr. Islam contends that in order to bring the offence within the ambit and scope of section 6 of the Act, it was incumbent upon the prosecution to establish that the books and cassettes, which was alleged to have been recovered from the appellant, were not only “জেহাদী” in nature, but in fact, had aided or abetted in the commission of any offence with which the other two persons namely, Abul Kalam Md. Shafi Ullah @ Tarik and Md. Tariqul Ialsm were charged and subsequently convicted.<br/><br/>Lastly, Mr. Islam submits that in view of the utter failure of the prosecution to bring home the charge against the appellant as well as the failure of the learned Judge to interpret and apply the law correctly, the order of conviction and sentence, so far as it relates to appellant Tareque Aziz, is liable to be set aside. Mr. Islam concludes his submission with a note of lamentation that an innocent person of 21 years had been put behind bars and forced to suffer incarceration for over five years without any justifiable reason.  <br/>Mr. Tapash Kumar Biswas, the learned Deputy Attorney General submits that the present appellant is a member of the outlawed JMB and his complicity in the offence has been established by recovery of the books and cassettes from his possession. The learned Deputy Attorney General further submits that such recovery was made upon discloser made by the appellant himself and therefore, the trial Court was justified in convicting the appellant under section 6 of the Act and therefore, no interference is called for and the instant appeal is liable to be dismissed. However, the learned DAG was unable to show that the prosecution had adduced any evidence to establish that the books and cassettes were “জেহাদী” in nature or that there was any finding to that effect by the learned Judge of the Special Tribunal.<br/><br/>It is perhaps pertinent to refer to the relevant provision of law at the very outset of the discussion.<br/> <br/>Section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 reads as under :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>“4. Punishment for attempt to cause explosion or for making or keeping explosive with intent to endanger life or property – </strong>Any person who [unlawfully or maliciously]-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">(a)     does any act with intent to cause by an explosive substance, or conspires to cause by an explosive substance, an explosion in [Bangladesh] of a nature likely to endanger life or to cause serious [injury to person or property]; or</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">(b)     makes or has in his possession or under his control any explosive substance with intent by means thereof to endanger life, or cause serious [injury to person or property] in [Bangladesh], or to enable any other person by means thereof to endanger life or cause serious [injury to person or property] in [Bangladesh];</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">shall, whether any explosion does or does not take place and whether any injury to person or property has been actually caused or not, be punished with [imprisonment for  a term with may extend to twenty years, and shall not be less than three years] to which fine may be added.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Section 6 of the Act reads as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“6. Punishment of abettors- Any person who by the supply of or solicitation for money, the providing of premises, the supply of materials, or in any manner whatsoever, procures, counsels, aids, abets, or is accessory to, the commission of any offence under this Act shall be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From a plain reading of section 6 of the Act, it is apparent that any person, who aids, abets or assists in the commission of an offence under the Act by providing money, premises or materials shall be liable to be punished under the Act. The use of the words “in any manner whatsoever” provides a very wide ambit and scope for the application of this particular section. However, in order to secure a conviction under this section, it has to be established that the person was an “abettor”.<br/> <br/>In the instant appeal before us, the appellant was charged with possessing “জেহাদী” books and cassettes. It was, therefore, imperative for the prosecution to establish, through evidence, that the books and cassettes were not only “জেহাদী” in nature, but the appellant had abetted the other two co-accused, who were charged and convicted under section 4(b) the Act, with the books and cassettes in question.<br/> <br/>Let us now refer to the deposition of PW 16, the Investigating Officer of the case. During the course of his cross-examination made on behalf of the appellant, PW 16 stated and we quote :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“আমার কাছে মামলা আসার ১০ দিন আগে থেকে সে জেল হাজতে ছিল। আমি বই ও ক্যাসেট থানা থেকে পাই ২৯-১২-০৫ তারিখ বই যে পাইয়াছি তা নিষিদ্ধ ঘোষিত নহে তথা ক্যাসেট ও নিষিদ্ধ নহে। তারিক আজিজ বিষয়ে প্রথমে মামলা হয় নাই। <u>বই ও ক্যাসেট বিস্ফোরক âব্য নহে</u>।” (Emphasis added.)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the deposition of the I/O quoted above, it is palpably clear that the books and cassettes, which were alleged to have been recovered from the appellant, were not explosive substances. It further appears that PW 16 stated categorically that neither the books nor the cassettes, that were recovered from the appellant, were “নিষিদ্ধ”.<br/> <br/>Merely because certain books and cassettes were recovered from a person alleged to be a member of JMB, it does not imply that such books and cassettes would be “জেহাদী” in nature. The impugned judgment is conspicuous by the absence of even any attempt, let alone any finding, to determine the true contents and nature of the books and cassettes in question so as to arrive at a conclusion that they were “জেহাদী” in nature. In the absence of any such finding, the learned Judge of the Tribunal clearly erred in holding that the books and cassettes were “জেহাদী” in nature and based on such erroneous finding, proceed to convict the appellant under section 6 of the Act and sentence him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 (ten) years.<br/> <br/>It is imperative for a Judge to administer and dispense justice in accordance with law and only in accordance with law. A Judge should neither be prosecution friendly nor should he be hostile to the prosecution. He must discharge his duties dispassionately without succumbing to official pressure or even public opinion. A Judge must not be swayed by the wave of public opinion. He must dispense justice not only on the basis of the materials which are before him, but also in accordance with the relevant provisions of law.<br/> <br/>Sadly, in the instant case, both are lacking. There is neither any evidence within the four corners of the prosecution case to indicate that the books and cassettes, which were alleged to have been recovered from the appellant, were “জেহাদী” in nature nor is there any element to connect the appellant with the charge of abetment for the purpose of securing his conviction under section 6 of the Act.<br/> <br/>It is not only unfortunate but regrettable too that without substantial and cogent evidence, the prosecution had implicated the appellant in the instant case. It is equally, if not more regrettable, that despite the absence of any cogent and reliable evidence to connect the appellant with the offence in question, the learned judge of the Tribunal, upon misreading of evidence and misinterpretation of law and last, but not least, through total non-application of mind, had sentenced the appellant to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years, out of which he has already served more than half the term.<br/> <br/>We are constrained to observe that the learned Judge not only failed to evaluate the evidence on record, but also neglected to take note of the positive deposition made by the I/O of the case with regard to the books and cassettes in question. We are equally constrained to observe that the learned Judge failed to comprehend the ambit and scope of section 6 of the Act, which resulted in the imposition of a grossly unjust sentence on a 21 year old person.<br/> <br/>We have taken note of the fact that till date, the appellant has never enjoyed the privilege of bail and has been in custody for a period of over five years now. <br/> <br/>Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and having considered the relevant provisions of law, we are inclined to hold that the learned Judge of the trial Court passed the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence, so far as it relates to appellant Md. Tareque Aziz, without any material evidence on record.<br/> <br/>In that view of the matter, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence, so far as it relates to appellant Md. Tareque Aziz, warrants interference from the Court and the same is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed.   <br/> <br/>The judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 29.03.2007, so far as it relates to the appellant Md. Tareque Aziz, son of Md. Omor Ali Mollah, passed by the learned Judge of the Special Tribunal No. 4, Rajshahi in Special Tribunal Case No. 54 of 2006, arising out of Godagari Police Station Case No. 17 dated 18.12.2005, corresponding to G.R. No. 361 of 2005 under section 6 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 is hereby set aside.<br/> <br/>Let the appellant Md. Tareque Aziz, son of Md. Omor Ali Mollah, be set at liberty forthwith, if not wanted in connection with any other case.<br/> <br/>Before parting with the appeal, we would like to caution the concerned Judge, Mr. Abu Saleh Sheikh Mohammad Zahirul Haque, to be more diligent and judicious in the discharge of his duty.<br/> <br/>Let a copy of the judgment be retained in the dossier of the concerned Judge.<br/> <br/>Let a copy of the judgment be sent to the Director General, Judicial Administration Training Institute (JATI), Dhaka and the Registrar, Supreme Court of Bangladesh for necessary information. <br/> <br/>The office is directed to communicate the order and send down the lower Court records at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Therefore, the acquisition of 550 acres of land by MMDL is violative of the provisions of Act, 1950, P.O.98 of 1972 and Ordinance X of 1984. The MMDL’s case does not attract any of the said categories and admittedly it did not seek for relaxation to purchase lands in excess of 100 standard bighas for housing purposes from the Revenue Officer.</strong><br/><br/><strong>The purchasers could not claim any right on the plea of bona fide purchase since their vendor could not acquire lands exceeding the retainable ceiling provided in Act, 1950, P.O.98 of 1997, and Ordinance X of 1984, they could not acquire any better right than their vendor. The fundamental rights of the third party purchasers cannot override the fundamental rights of the overwhelming number of residents of the metropolis under Articles 31 and 32 of the Constitution. Further, no person can claim protection of law, and of right to life and personal liberty in violation of law. </strong><strong>Per Surendra Kumar Sinha, J. ...(91 and 93)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>Once the Master Plan has been published, no one in the area can use the lands contrary to its provisions. In using or attempting to use the lands which MMDL has acquired by way of purchase within the SFF Zone as residential purposes, they are clearly violating, firstly, the provisions of Act, 1950 and P.O. 98 of 1972, and secondly, the provisions of Act, 1953 and the Master Plan, and are acting contrary to law.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Rule of law requires that the concerned authorities are under obligation to see that no one violates the law in implementing any project in a restricted area. The Revenue Officer and the Chairman, RAJUK cannot, therefore, permit any person or company or firm to use any land without complying the due requirement of laws. The public authorities should enforce the laws strictly so that the pollution or other environmental harm should not cause injury to human beings. MMDL has utterly violated the laws and has been implementing the housing project. The protection of the environment is not only the duty of the citizen but it is also the obligation of the state and its organs including the Courts. Therefore, MMDL is under an obligation to pay damages for mitigating the hardship of the third-party purchasers if they do not want to take back their monies paid to them in view of the fact that they have illegally acquired, advertised and sold plots suppressing material facts from them violating the laws. </strong><strong>Per Surendra Kumar Sinha, J. ...(99 and 100)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Town Improvement Act (XIII of 1953)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 73, 74 and 75</strong><br/><strong>The High Court Division, in the premises, erred in law in holding that the said Urban and structure plans are relaxed ones having scope to be changed and that the said documents have been prepared and taken finally under sections 73 and 74 of Act, 1953. It failed to consider that once a Master Plan comes into force it becomes unlawful for any person to use lands for any purposes other than that laid down in the Master plan unless he has been authorised to do so under section 75. Any derogatory use of lands in Bilamalia and Baliarpur Moujas identified in the Master Plan shall need prior approval of RAJUK. </strong><strong>Per Surendra Kumar Sinha, J. ...(103)</strong><br/> <br/><strong><em>ETV Ltd.

Therefore, Madhu-moti Model Town is an unauthorized project and Metro Makers has been continuing with their activities in violation of section 75 of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 and the DMDP prepared under the Act. Per Syed Mahmud Hossain, J. ...(145)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>বেসরকারি আবাসিক প্রকল্পের ভূমি উন্নয়ন বিধিমালা, ২০০৪</strong><br/><strong>বিধি ৪(২)(১)</strong><br/><strong>There is no scope for establishment of a Model Town within sub-flood flow zone violating the DMDP prepared under the Town Improvement Act. Even the Rules of 2004 do not approve of establishing a Model Town changing the very nature of sub-flood flow zone. Establishment of a model town within sub-flood flow zone involves raising huge quantity of land in that zone resulting in its depletion. Consequently, the adjoining area of the sub-flood flow zone, namely, main Dhaka City will be inundated by water logging and the natural environmental balance will be in jeopardy. <em>Per Syed Mahmud Hossain, J.</em> ...(146-147)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Bangladesh Land Holding (Limitation) Order (P.O.

These restrictions apply equally to a family or to a body. The irresistible conclusion to be reached is that Metro was holding lands much in excess of the ceiling fixed by P.O. No.98 of 1972 and the excess land stands forfeited to the Government under article 12 of P.O.No.98 of 1972 much to the detriment of the project of Metro Makers. </strong><br/> <br/><strong>Though the third party purchasers may not be treated as <em>bona fide</em>, yet it is a fact that they have been roped in by Metro Makers by misrepresentation that permission for the development work had been obtained from RAJUK and justice demands that they should be compensated.

I agree with the reasoning and findings given by Syed Mahmud Hossain, J.<br/> <br/><span style="font-size:16px"><strong><u>Surendra Kumar Sinha, J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>These appeals and civil petition involve public importance on the environment and human rights, protection and preservation of environment, and the construction of certain provisions of the tenancy laws applicable in the country, the Town Improvement Act, 1953, the Paribesh Sangrakhyan Ain, 1995 and Jaladhar Sangrakhyan Ain, 2000 and as the disposal of these matters would have impact on the implementation of various housing projects by individuals and private companies, I would like to express my opinion on the questions separately.<br/> <br/>Short facts relevant for determination of the points in these matters are that Bangladesh Environment Lawyers’ Assoc-iation (BELA) filed Writ Petition No.4604 of 2004 out of which Civil Appeal No.256 of 2009 stating inter alia that the environment of Dhaka city is being continuously endangered and threatened by various unplanned and illegal activities originating both from private and public sectors causing irreparable harm to human beings. In 1997 RAJUK prepared a fresh Master Plan known as Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan (DMDP) for the Dhaka city and its surrounding area, which was published in Gazette Notification on 3<sup>rd</sup> August, 1997 identifying few areas of flood plains, rivers, water bodies, Sub- Flood Flow Zone (SFFZ) etc. to protect the safety, health and welfare of the common people from negative environmental impact and to protect and preserve natural drainage system to ensure their constitunal and proper functioning. Any interference with the same as earmarked in the said Master Plan will have devastating environmental effect for which the Master Plan in clear terms prohibited residential, comm.-ercial and industrial developments in those zones, including raising the level of land plain through earth filling in Flood Flow/Sub- Flood Flow Zones. The said Master Plan in categorizing the land use pattern for the city, identified 19 Spatial Planning Zone (SPZ) out of which 17 comprising area between Savar and Dhansona in the west and present Dhaka established area at the east which is low lying area across Torag river and its canals and is designated as Flood Flow/Sub- Flood Flow Zone area within which Ameen Bazar area under Savar Police station has fallen as part of Sub- Flood Flow Zone. The DMDP has identified that there have been many private development schemes approved by RAJUK specially in the Ameen Bazar area on the south of Dhaka-Aricha Road which will have considerable negative impact on environment and DMDP recommends that all such development permits issued by RAJUK for the development of housing within this area should be withdrawn and that no new ones be allowed. Moreover, conditions and restrictions have been imposed in DMDP and also by section 5 of Ain of the 2000 prohibiting change of nature of any land that has been earmarked as natural reservoir including Flood-Flow zone.<br/><br/>Despite clear prohibition, Metro Makers and Developers Limited (MMDL), appellant in Civil Appeal Nos.255 and 256 of 2009, a private limited company has undertaken a development project near Ameen Bazar within mouzas Bilamalia and Baliarpur which are situated within SPZ 17(3)(SPZ173) and earmarked as Sub- Flood Flow Zone and has started filling earth in the substantial part of the zone with an object to implement an unauthorized non-permitted satellite township under the name “Modhumati Model Town” (MMT) and also started through regular media advertisement offering to sell housing plots in the said projects. RAJUK did not prevent the said development project of the MMT although it has categorically rejected its prayer by its letter dated 29<sup>th</sup> July, 2003 to approve the project on the ground that the said project is situated within the Sub- Flood Flow Zone. RAJUK also warned it to refrain from illegal earth filling in the said project site. Thereafter BELA undertook field survey and investigation and found that MMDL has been continuing with its illegal activities of earth filling in the project area and also found that the writ respondents have taken no step to stop such illegal activities.<br/> <br/>MMDL also filed writ petition No.5103 of 2003 against RAJUK and others claiming that its project area comprised of 360 acres of land consisting of 2526 residential plots of different sizes with various public utilities and facilities which have been purchased by it from different land owners in those mouzas with a view to develop the area into a satellite town. They conducted a survey through the Institute of Water and Flood Management and Bureau of Research Testing and Consultation which reported that the project does not lie in the flood flow zone. MMDL purchased lands which are ‘chala and bhiti’ nature and they are above the flood plain and do not come under the purview of Ain, 2000. There is no play ground or open ground or natural water reservoir owned by the Government within the project area and the said project would cause no hindrance to flood flow of any kind. MMT has obtained licence and permit to execute its project and has prepared a project plan and also sold most of the plots to the buyers, the appellants in Civil Appeal No. 254 of 2009. The project of MMDL has not fallen within the main Flood-Flow Zone and RAJUK arbitrarily started obstruction against the development work at the instance of interested quarters which is illegal and unauthorized.  <br/> <br/>The High Court Division while allowing the petition of BELA in part observed that in the first Master Plan Savar Upazila was not included; that the operative area of RAJUK is extended to Savar under a separate Master Plan since 28<sup>th</sup> December, 1996 and therefore, question of derogatory use of Master Plan earmarked area does not require permission from RAJUK; that MMT being an ongoing project when Savar Master Plan (SMP) came into effect, it was incumbent upon it to obtain permission under the provisions of SMP if the area is being used in derogation to the purposes earmarked in the Master Plan, that part of those two Mouzas has been shown as housing, the development of MMT for converting it to a housing was compatible to SMP; that no permission for such housing is necessary; that in view of the provisions containing condit-ional use of lands in Sub- Flood Flow Zone, such as, dwelling, single/multi family, MMT is entitled to continue with its housing project on procuring necessary approval from RAJUK; that the development of lands in Sub- Flood Flow Zone is not barred; that only permission that will be required if the structures are built on land raised above the flood water level; that MMT is entitled to apply for plan review application as contained in paragraph 2.5.3 of the Interim Planning Rules; that MMT is an unauthorized project as it has been continuing its project in violation of section 75 of Act, 1953.<br/> <br/>The High Court Division further observed that the purchasers from MMT are bona fide purchasers with aim to build structures for housing which could not be dislodged on the ground that the lands have been earmarked in DMDP as Sub-Flood-Flow area; that MMT  is implementing its project in Mouzas Bilamalia and Baliarpur which is an unauthorized project; that RAJUK legally obstructed MMT in the development of the housing project; that RAJUK is required to protect Sub-Flood-Flow Zone area near Ameen Bazar from any further earth filling; that it is not required to direct RAJUK to restore the  original position of the lands to the extent of taking step under section 8(2) of Ain, 2000 and that MMT having nearly been completed the project by arranging money from financial institutions, it is necessary for keeping an avenue open for it to procure necessary permission from the relevant authorities in accordance with section 75 of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 and section 6 of Ain of 2000 for housing development project.<br/> <br/>It is against these contradictory observations BELA preferred Civil Appeal No.253 of 2009 and MMDL and the purchasers from MMDL preferred the other three appeals against allowing BELA’s writ petition in part. Before embarking on exploration of the points raised at the Bar, I would like to discuss laws which are relevant for the disposal of the points agitated at the time of the leave granting order.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>The State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The aim and object of promulgating this Act is mainly in liquidation of rent receiving interests of land lords. The main principle on which this statute was promulgated from a socialist point of view, and egalitarian outlook. Section 3(1) empowers the Government to acquire all rent-receivers’ rent-receiving inter-ests by notifications. Rent-receiver has been defined in section 2(23) of the Act, i.e. the rent-receiving interest of (i) proprietor, (ii) tenure-holder, (iii) raiyats, (iv) an under-raiyat, (v) a non-agricultural tenant, whose land has been let out  but does not include a person in respect of such of his lands, as has been let out together with any building standing thereon and necessary adjuncts thereto, otherwise than in perpetuity and landlords in respect of service tenures. When the Gazette notifications were passed acquiring the rent receiving interests, lands held in khas possession by ex-rent receivers, cultivating raiyats, cultivating under-raiyats and non-agricultural tenants in excess of the retainable area of 375 standard bighas or an area determined by calculating at the rate of 10 standard bighas for each member of his family whichever is greater all non retainable lands vest in the Government. It includes any land or building in a hat or bazaar; any fishery other than a tank dug solely by process of excavation; any land consisting of a forest; and any land actually in use for a ferry.<br/> <br/>The following are the lands which cannot be acquired under the Act:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(<em>1) Rent-receiving interests in respect of non-agricultural lands with building standing thereon together with necessary adjuncts held under a lease not being a lease in perpetuity; the town property however extensive be the area which a landlord may possess;</em><br/><br/><em>(2) portion in hats and bazars which do not fall within the definition of hat or bazar and having structure and held under lease, khas lands to the extent of 375 standard bighas or an area determined by calculating at the rate of 10 standard bighas for each member of the family, whichever is greater.</em><br/><br/><em>(3) Khas lands in excess of the above limit may be retained in following cases;</em><br/><em>(i) where a rent-receiver, cultivating raiyat or cultivating under-raiyat or a group of them has or have undertaken large scale farming by use of power driven mecha-nical appliance or have undertaken large scale dairy farming, certificates from the prescribed Revenue Authority as to such actual undertaking will be necessary</em>.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It should be noted that a large scale farming minus power driven mechanical appliances will not attract the provision of the above exception clause. Farming has not been defined-it can be extended to agricultural, horticultural or any mode of farming.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(ii) Lands held for the purpose of cultivation and production of tea or coffee or for the cultivation of rubber, whatever be the area, if certified by the prescribed Revenue Authority. If there is cultivation of tea or coffee without manufacture of tea or coffee, the sub-section will not apply. A company holding land for the cultivation of sugarcane for the purpose of manufacture of sugar by that company, if certified by the prescribed Revenue Officer. (s.20 (4A)).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It may be noted that the word “company” has been used in case of sugarcane while in case of tea, coffee and rubber the words used are “<em>where a person or persons holding land for the purpose of cultivation and manufacture of tea, coffee or rubber</em>”.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(4) Land covered by buildings or structures and necessary adjuncts thereto in case of any large scale industry with such other lands used for growing raw materials thereof. [Section 20(5)(i)(b)].<br/><br/>(5) Land held under Waqf or Debuttar, when the incomes from such property are wholly applied to religious or charitable purposes (Section 20(5)(i)(c) and (ii)).   </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On and from the date of publication of notification under sub-section (1) of section 3 the consequences that ensue from the date of publication are enumerated in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (dd), (e), (f), (ff), (g) and (h) under sub-section (4) of Section 3. Clause (a) states that all interest of rent receivers in the estates, taluks, tenures, holdings or tenancies shall vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances. The elimination of this sort of interests in relation to land in khas possession was felt necessary to avoid all controversy and place all people holding lands on an equal footing. Proviso to clause (a) says “nothing in this clause shall apply to any building within the homestead of rent-receiver concerned” and the relevant words in clause (a) of section 20(2) are identical with clause (a) of rule 29A of the State Acquisition Rules. Provisions embodied in clauses (b), (c), (d) and (dd) of section 3(4) deal with the realization of such revenue, rent and cesses with interest as were in arrear and also the outstanding dues under Bengal Embankment Act.<br/> <br/>Clause (e) of section 3(4) says that tenants holding lands directly under rent-receivers with effect from the date on which the notification under section 3(1) has been served shall become tenants directly under the Government and shall pay rent at the existing rate to the Government. Clause (f) speaks of rent-receivers themselves who shall be liable to pay rent to the Government with regard to lands not acquired by the Government under section 3(2). Clause (ff) provides that where final publication of record-of-rights under section 19(3) or determination of rent under section 53 was yet to be made or, in other words, pending the same, the tenants referred to in proviso in clause (e) and in clause (ff) shall pay rent to the Government at the rates shown in the preliminary record of rights.<br/> <br/>Proviso to clause (ff) speaks about tenant’s liability to pay higher rent or their entitlement to get adjusted if enhanced or determined under sections 19(3) or (5) or 53 of the Act. Clause (g) says that arrear rents shall be recoverable under the Public Demand Recovery Act, 1913 and clause (h) provides that a tenure or a part of it coming directly under the Government shall be deemed to be a tenure as defined in section 1 of the Bengal Land Revenue Sales Act, 1968.<br/> <br/>Section 20 of the Act deals with khas land which a rent-receiver is entitled to retain in his khas possession after acquisition of rent receiving interest under Chapter-V of the Act. Sub-section (2) puts the maximum limit of the area of khas lands retainable by rent-receiver in his possession as well as the class of lands which he is entitled to retain under two clauses namely, clauses (a) and (b) have been reduced to 100 standard bighas by the Bangladesh Land Holding (Limitation) Order, 1972 (P.O. 98 of 1972). Clause (a) deals with lands comprised in the homestead of the rent-receiver with necessary adjuncts and clause (b) with lands which are outside homestead area and can be utilized for agricultural and horticultural purposes. It has 3 sub-clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) which read as follows:         <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(i) lands used for agricultural or horticultural purposes including tanks,<br/>(ii) lands which are cultivable or which are capable of cultivation on reclamation, and<br/>(iii) vacant non-agricultural lands.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Sub-section (2a) of section 20 is a sort of rider to sub-section (2) which says that the lands mentioned in sub-clauses (i),(ii),(iii),(iv) shall remain outside the retainable area, that is, outside the area which a rent-receiver may keep for himself under sub-section (2). Sub-section (3) is concerned with allotment of lands when the question of choice of a rent-receiver becomes relevant but where no such right of choice is exercised, retainable area shall be decided by the Revenue Officer. Sub-sections (4), (4A) and (5) make provisions for exclusion of certain classes of lands held in khas from being acquired by the Government, even though the total area held in these cases exceeded the maximum retainable limit under sub-section (2) such as: (a) lands held for large scale farming through use of machineries or for large-scale dairy farming; (b) lands held for cultivation and manufacture of tea or coffee or rubber; (c) land held for cultivation of sugarcane for the purpose of manufacturing sugar.<br/> <br/>In all cases referred to above certificates from the Revenue Officer about genuineness of the undertaking will be necessary in order to obtain the benefits provided in sub-sections (4) and (4A) to a rent-receiver or a group of them on a co-operative basis or otherwise for large-scale dairy farming. “Revenue Officer” within the meaning of the Act includes “<em>any officer whom the Government may appoint to discharge all or any of the functions of a Revenue Officer under the Act or any rules made thereunder (section 2(24))</em>”. Sub-section (5) relaxed certain lands held by certain classes of rent-receivers allowing them to retain lands in their khas and sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) of section 20 will not be applicable to them and are excluded from acquisition by the Government. Conditions set in order to ascribe to them the declared privileges are ‘so much of the lands as are exclusively dedicated and income from which is applied to religious and charitable purposes without reservation of any benefit to any individual’. They are included in clause-(I) of sub-clause (c), such as, lands held under Debuttar, Waqf, Waqf-Al-Aulad or any other trust, as is exclusively dedicated and the income from which is exclusively applied to religious or charitable purposes. Sub-section (6) laid down that lands on which hats or bazar are held or which consists of forest or fisheries or ferries shall not be retainable on the ground that they are Debuttar, Waqf, Waqf-Al-Aulad.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>The Bangladesh Land Holding (Limitation) Order, 1972</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>By Presidents Order No.98 of 1972, total quantity of land which may be held by a family in Bangladesh under the proviso to clause (b) of sub-section (2) of section 20 of the Act has been reduced to 100 standard bighas and all lands in excess of that quantity shall be surrendered to the Government; and no family shall be entitled to acquire any land by purchase, inheritance, hiba or otherwise which added to the land already held by it exceeds 100 standard bighas in aggregate. The limitation imposed by clause (a) has been relaxed in case of lands held under Debuttar, Waqf or any other religious or charitable trust under certain conditions. The Government reserves the right to relax the limitation imposed by Article 3 of P.O.98 of 1972 in cases of: (a) a co-operative society of farmers where the members thereof surrendered their ownership in the lands unconditionally to the society; (b) lands used for cultivation of tea, rubber or coffee; (c) an industrial concern holding land for the production of raw materials for manufacture of commodities in its own factories; (d) any other case where such relaxation is considered necessary in the public interest.<br/> <br/>It is provided in Article 3 of P.O.98 of 1972 that no family shall be entitled to retain any land held by it in excess of 100 standard bighas in the aggregate and all lands held by it in excess of that quantity shall be surrendered to the Government and no family shall be entitled to acquire any land by purchase, inheritance, gift, hiba or otherwise which added to the land already held by it exceeds 100 standard bighas in the aggregate. By Ordinance No.III of 1982, articles 2 and 3 of P.O.98 of 1972 were amended. In the def-inition clause in Article 2, ‘body’ was defined as <em>“body of individuals whether incurporated or not, and includes any company, firm, society, association, organization or authority, by whatever name called”.</em> In Article 3 after the word ‘family’ the words “or body” were added.

Sub-section (2) provides that the Master Plan shall include such maps and such descriptive matter as may be necessary to illustrate the proposals aforesaid with such degree of particularity as may be appropriate between different parts of the area and any such plan may, in particular, define the sites of proposed roads, public and other buildings and works, or fields, residential etc. Section 74 provides for publication of the Master Plan by notification which shall be conclusive evidence that the Master Plan has been duly made and approved and, thereafter, it will be unlawful for any person to use any land for any purpose other than that laid down in the Master Plan.<br/> <br/>The Katripakhya has power to amend or alter any specific provision of the Master Plan by publication in official Gazette. In exercise of power under sub-section (2) of section 73 the Ministry of Housing and Works published notification on 3<sup>rd</sup> April, 1997 declaring the area under the Master Plan rescinding the existing Master Plan. The said Ministry thereupon by Gazette dated 3<sup>rd</sup> August, 1997 notified for suggestions and objections, if there be any, by an aggrieved person against the said Master Plan within time specified therein. Thereafter, the Ministry by Gazette dated 8<sup>th</sup> March, 2006 published the Dhaka Structure Plan (DSP) (Vol-I, 1995-2015) of Master Plan (Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan) and Urban Area Plan (Vol-II, 1995-2015). The period of implementation of the said plans was extended till 31<sup>st</sup> July, 2007. RAJUK thereafter by Gazette dated 28<sup>th</sup> December, 1996 (finalized the Master Plan for Savar area) pointing out that after the publication of the notification any development or construction work would be made with prior permission of the authority.<br/> <br/>The first point urged by Mr. Azmalul Hossain appearing on behalf of MMDL is that the High Court Division fell in an error in holding that MMT is an unauthorized project, inasmuch as, there was no bar for undertaking housing project till 2004. In elaborating his submission the learned counsel argued that MMDL undertook MMT project in 1990 when there was no law regulating the conduct of companies dealing with housing projects. In the original Master Plan prepared for Dhaka City under sections 73 and 74 of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 it did not include the land in which the project is included. It is further argued, the original Dhaka Master Plan (DMP) did not regulate the conduct and activities of housing projects and the provisions of Town Improvement Act and the original DMP require that land within the areas should not be used for purpose other than that specified in the original Master Plan. It is further argued, the concepts of SPZ and Flood-Flow zones were totally unknown under the original Master Plan. Learned counsel further argued that in the SMP the use of the project lands has been included for housing and ancillary purposes. MMDL, it is argued, was encouraged by the SMP and commenced purchasing lands for the project. It is further argued that between 1990 and 1997, MMDL purchased lands for its project and raised the level of the lands with earth filling to bring the ground level above the flood level which was entirely legal till 1997 and it is only by Gazette notification dated 4<sup>th</sup> August, 1997, the DMDP was notified which does not deal with or regulate housing projects generally - it does not require any authorization from any authority for carrying on the business of MMDL. It is further argued that the DMDP regulates the use of the land within its area and therefore, the project remains lawful even after DMDP came into existence.<br/> <br/>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) together with the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and other international agencies extended co-operation to cope with the urban transition through grants and technical assistance for implementing the project “Preparation of Structure Plan, Master Plan and Detailed Area Plans for Dhaka”. The main objective of the project is the preparation of multi-sectoral development plans, comprising Structure Plan, Master Plan and Detailed Area Plans (DAP) which form a framework of development planning, preparation of sectoral Master Plan and feasibility studies for metropolitan infrastructure elements lacking development policies and investment programmes and with this goal in mind the project was planned to be implemented in phases.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Dhaka Structure Plan (1995-2015)(Vol-1)</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In Dhaka, the projects work programme focused on four main components;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>Component 2A: planning;<br/>Component 2B: Drainage (including flood control);<br/>Component 2C: Computerized Data and Mapping covering both Dhaka and Chittagong;<br/>Component 2D: National Consultancy Surveys</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>The Structural Plan</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Paragraph 1.2.1 provides Structure Plan. DMDP Structure Plan provides a long-term strategy for 20 years to 2015 for the development of the greater Dhaka sub-region. Paragraph 1.2.2 contains “The Urban Area Plan (UAP)”. The DMDP Urban Area Plan (UAP) provides an interim mid-term strategy for the 10 years and covers for the development of urban areas within Metro Dhaka management area. The geographic boundaries comprising the UAP are the areas within the proposed Flood Action Plan (FAP) components 8A and 8B as well as the Tongi-Gazipur and Savar-Dhamsona areas. The DMDP UAP has several parts consisting of an Explanatory Report, Resource Maps, Interim Management Report, Interim Planning Rules, Urban Area Plan Map, and a Multi-Sectoral Investment programme.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Explanatory Report- explains the basis for the UAP and describes the salient features for each of the 26 SPZ;<br/>Resource Maps-record, existing infrastru-cture locations, along with public and private sector development commitments;<br/>Interim Management Report- describes basis and approach taken toward urban land use management;<br/>Interim Planning Rules- state in a legal format the rules for urban land use management within the Urban Area Plan;<br/>Urban Area Plan Map- designates various land use management zones;<br/>Multi Sectoral Investment Programme- integrates and prioritizes urban develop-ment investments over the next 3-5 years.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Detailed Area Plans (DAP)</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Paragraph 1.2.3 contains “DAP”. The DMDP DAP provide more detailed planning proposals for specific sub-areas of Dhaka. However, they do not initially cover the entire Dhaka Structure Plan area. While all sub-areas will eventually require a DAP, only priority areas will be dealt with initially. They may include the area of one or more SPZ, or parts of several SPZs, depending on circumstances. Until a DMP is prepared for a sub-area, however, land use management functions will be exercised through the policies, guidelines, and rules found in the Structure Plan and Urban Area Plan.<br/> <br/>The DMDP structure plan proposes that the major new urban areas likely to be developed during the planned period by 2015 will be amongst Savar-Dhamsona as well. Paragraph 1.3.6 contains, “The Dhaka Master Plan’ (DMP) submitted in 1959, covering the then Dhaka Improvement Trust (DIT) area covering roughly 220 square miles, with a population slightly exceeding 1 milion. Mirpur-Tongi (1978) population was estimated to be 900,000. DMP provided for major expansion areas at Mirpur, Tongi and Gulshan /Badda and proposed large scale reclamation at Keraniganj, Postogola and part of the DND Triangle. It was estimated that these areas would accommodate a population increase of 250,000 between 1958 and 1978.<br/> <br/>Paragraph 2.2.1 contains, ‘Physical Conditions’ in which it is said, physically Dhaka’s dominant feature is the small proportion of land which is permanently flood free, as brought home by the floods of 1987 and 1989. Virtually all flood-free land close to Dhaka has already been developed. Dhaka’s past growth and present urban configuration have been shaped by the city’s relative susceptibility to flooding. A major issue is the extent to which Dhaka, both in its existing urban form and in its future development, can be kept flood-free and free from water-logging as a result of urban encroachment in natural depressions, waterways and khals. A major problem will be how to safeguard the land areas needed for flood control structures to permit such flood protection, and the retention ponds and Dhaka’s natural drainage system.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Flood Protected Development Area.</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Paragraph 3.3.1 contains Flood Protected Development Areas. By the year 2005, towards the end of the Medium-term DMDP Structure Plan period, the main elements of the flood mitigation works under FAP-8B, the priority project areas under FAP-8A, and the DND Triangle and Dhaka South-East, were compl-eted. Although protected from outside flooding the priority project areas will still require storm-water drainage facilities, designed to optimize the use of natural depressions and khals, to make them habitable. For this reason they will require major public sector commitment and involvement to ensure the comprehensive treatment of this critical aspect of development, including the enforcement of rigorous development control policies to prevent urban encroachment of proposed retention ponds, natural depressions and khals and formal approval of all land filling. The continuation of policies recommended under the ILDI approach will also be necessary. <br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Dispersed Flood-Free Development Areas</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Paragraph 3.3.2 contains Dispersed Flood-Free Development Areas. With most growth having been focused on Dhaka’s main urbanized area and directed towards new priority project areas within the areas protected by FAP 8A and 8B during the DMDP Structure Plan period to 2015, there may be a case for reviewing options, prior to the end of the planned period, to divert some of Dhaka’s future growth to more dispersed locations which have the advantage of relatively flood-free land.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Spatial and Environmental Sectors</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Paragraph 4.2 contains, ‘Rural and Spatial Area policies’- it says, the policies pertaining to these non-urban areas relate to function and development treatment.

(Either a proposed land use is not in line with the Structure Plan priority proposals, or the specific restrictions on the land use do not allow for the development). It also indicates where development conditions should be imposed (more specific conditions for the planned and formal development and more general targets and guidance for the spontaneous and informal growing areas). The interim nature of the UAP is stressed; as it will gradually be replaced by the DAP when they are completed. These will then become the development management documents for the respective areas they cover.<br/> <br/>In paragraph 1.3.1 under the heading ‘The  Flood Flow Zone’ (FFZ), it is said FFZ were determined by FAP 8A studies, and lie largely outside the present urban area. The Lands Study recommended that development in low lying flood plain areas be restricted, since it could obstruct natural flood flow. Such restriction would cause a rise in water level and changes in flood direction; affecting the entire metropolitan area. In the Main  Flood Flow Zone, now mostly agricultural land, urban development should be prohibited. Only development having no adverse hydraulic effects should be permitted. Such development includes:</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align:justify">agriculture:</li><li style="text-align:justify">open space for recreation:</li><li style="text-align:justify">ferry terminals:</li><li style="text-align:justify">brickyards:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The Sub- Flood Flow Zone is less affected by flood flow.

Paragraph 5.2 contains ‘Sub-Flood Flow Zone’ and in paragraph 5.2.2 under the heading ‘Purpose and Intent’ it is stated, the purpose of the Sub Flood Flow Zone is to generally define areas either temporarily or seasonally flooded (flood lands). The intent is to protect the health, safety and welfare of the general public; to reduce negative environmental impacts within natural waterways; and to protect and preserve natural drainage systems to ensure their proper and continued functioning.

Once a Master Plan is prepared showing land use and it goes through process in sub-section (2) to (5) of section 73 and is approved by the Government and it is made public under section 74(1), it becomes “the” Master Plan for Dhaka and all land use is to be carried out under its provision. Learned counsel emphasized that if use of land contrary to the Master Plan is to be made, permission is required from the RAJUK and the legislative intent is clear, that is, permission is required for any derogatory use of land. It is further contended that where the Master Plan allows residential use or for housing and ancillary use, no permission is required for that purpose and if some one wishes to use land designated for housing for industrial use, permission will be required under section 75. This is, according to him, not the situation with the MHP. Mr. Hossain submits that under SMP the use of the land within MMT project is also consistent with the land use in Master Plan. It is not the legislative intention that in respect of some area extended by delegated legislation, the provisions for permission should go beyond the parent law and permission will be required for all development in Savar even when it is consistent with the Master Plan. It is finally contended that the MMT project land under DMDP falls within Sub- Flood Flow Zone in which certain types of development of certain conditions are allowed and therefore, there is no need for permission under section 75 for derogatory use since none is completed in the MMT project.<br/> <br/>The DMDP was prepared in 1958. It is admitted by the parties that Bilamalia and Baliarpur mouzas under Savar police station having been included in DMDP and on and from the date of the jurisdiction of RAJUK was extended to those mouzas by notification dated 28<sup>th</sup> December, 1996 any development in the areas in those two mouzas permission of RAJUK was necessary. Mr. Mahmudul Islam contended that the expression ‘any’ has wide range of limit which varies in different context and it can mean ‘some’ or ‘all’. In this connection learned Counsel has referred the meaning of the word ‘any’ in Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases, Seventh Edition, Vol-I, page-141 as under;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Any” is a word which excludes limitation or qualification (per Fry L.J.Duck V. Bates.12 Q.B.D. 79): “as wide as possible” (per Chitty J., Beckett V. Sutton. 51 L.J. Ch. 433). A remarkable instance of this wide generality is furnished in Re Farquhar (4 Notes of Fee. Cases, 651, 652, cited W Ms. Exs.), wherein the words “any soldier”, etc. (Wills Act 1837 (c.26), s. 11), were construed as including minors, so that soldiers and seamen, within that section, can make nuncupative wills though under age. So, a power in a lease, enabling the lessor to resume “possession of any portion of the premises demised”, enables him to resume all (Liddy V. Kennedy), L.R.5 H.L. 134). So, a notice of an extraordinary meeting (Companies Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845 (c.16), s. 70 – see Companies Act, 1948 (e. 38), Seh.

In this connection Mr. Mahmudul Islam contended that had the legislature intended to take away the power to rescind as conferred by the General Clauses Act, the legislature was required to use clear language which is missing in section 74(2). It is settled law that jurisdiction expressly conferred by a statute cannot be extinguished by application from any expression used in a subsequent statute, much less by an enabling provision in a latter statute. Even if it is assumed that the Master Plan of 1997 is ultra vires section 74(2), it does not allow MMDL to proceed with development work without permission of RAJUK in view of section 75 of the Act.<br/> <br/>After coming into the force of Jaladhar Ain, 2000 on 5<sup>th</sup> February, 2001, the permission of the Government is also necessary for conversion of the agricultural lands of those two mouzas to housing plots. RAJUK prepared DMDP with inclusion of Savar area by Gazette Notification dated 3<sup>rd</sup> August, 1997. The third part of DMDP has not yet been prepared and this historical aspect showed that Savar was put under Master Plan by notification dated 28<sup>th</sup> December, 1996 describing mouzas Bilamalia and Baliarpur as agricultrual land and not for utilizing housing and ancilliary purposes. In the meantime, the Jaladhar Ain came into force prohibiting change of any land and permission of the Government became necessary for conversion of agricultural lands. The object of the said ain is protection of ‘Prakritik Jaladhar’ mainly for the purpose of proper drainage of flood and rain water.<br/> <br/>The High Court Division held that on and from the date of publication of Gazette under SMP, it was incumbent upon the MMDL to obtain permission from RAJUK if the area was to be used in derogation to the purposes earmarked in the Master Plan. The High Court Division then observed, since the part of mouzas Bilamalia and Baliarpur have been designated as housing ancillary use and partly urban service and agricultural land, the development of Modhumati area conver-ting it to housing project was compatible to the Master Plan and thus permission under section 75 of the Act, 1953 was not neces-sary. This observation is self contradictory. Section 73 of Act 1953 authorizes RAJUK to prepare a Master Plan for the area within its jurisdiction indicating the manner in which it proposes that lands should be used. Once the Master Plan comes into force it becomes unlawful for any person to use any land for any purposes other than that laid down in the Master Plan unless he has been authorised to do so under section 75 of the Act. Any derogatory use of lands identified in the Master Plan shall need prior approval as per provisions of Acts, 1953 and 2000. More so, after publication of the notification under section 74(1) of Act, 1953 the UAP and Structure Plan of DMDP have been brought under Master Plan.<br/> <br/>Next line of Mr. Azmalul Hossain’s argument is that under the বেসরকারী আবাসিক প্রকল্পের ভূমি উন্নয়ন বিধিমালা, 2008, MMDL was registered with RAJUK as an existing project and, therefore, MMT project was recognized as being lawful from its inception as an existing private housing project and has been given legal sanction by the prevalent law. Rule 4(1) of Rules 2004 provided that the project must be within the areas of Master Plan and land must be recommended as being suitable for development. It is further contended that under the SMP the Modhumati project could be used for housing and ancillary purposes and the DMDP, does not deal with housing projects generally and as such it does not require any authorization from any authority for carrying on housing project. It is also contended that if any project gets registration that project is an ongoing project within the area of the Master Plan and that its land is recommended as being suitable for development. In this connection learned Counsel has referred to annexure-X-1 to the writ petition. In elaborating his submission, Mr. Hossain argued that the words used in the Gazette notification dated 27<sup>th</sup> February, 1997 that এই বিজ্ঞপ্তি প্রকাশের পর হইতে এই মাষ্টার প্লানের অন্তর্ভূক্ত এলাকার যে কোন ধরনের উন্নয়ন ও নির্মান কাজ এই মাষ্টার প্লান অনুসারে এবং যথাযথ কর্তৃপক্ষের অনুমোদনত্র্রমে সম্পূর্ণ করিতে হইবে।” does not in any way require permission where the development is inconsistent with the Savar Master Plan.<br/> <br/>I find inconsistency in the submission of learned Counsel. On the one hand, it is contended on behalf of MMDL by enclosing annexures-X-1 and X-2, that as per MMDL’s prayer, the RAJUK accorded permission and on the other hand, the learned counsel submitted that no such permission is necessary. There is no dispute that the projects are included within RAJUK’s jurisdiction. Section 3 of Act 1952 provides restriction for construction of building and other develop-ment works and as soon as MMDL has undertaken a housing project, unless it develops the area, how it will implement the project is not clear to me. True, it will not make permanent residential buildings but MMDL develops the area by filling earth for making it suitable for constructing buildings and for such development works also prior permission under Act of 1952 and Act of 1953 is necessary. How then would MMDL be able to sell plots to the purchasers which require prior permission for construction?<br/> <br/>As regards the registration of the MMT with RAJUK, annexure-X-1, which is a letter issued by Zakir Hossain of RAJUK to Mr. Shawkat Ali Khan, Chief Town Planner DMDP, RAJUK Project Management and Co-ordination Cell. In this letter there is an alleged permission at its bottom under the heading অনুলিপি which read thus:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“এ, এফ, এম জাহাঙ্গীর, পরিচালক, মেট্রোমেকার্স এন্ড ডেভেলপারস লিঃ  ইহা তাদের পত্র নং-মেট্রো/আঃপ্রঃ/রাজউক তারিখ ১৫/১১/৯৪ এর প্রেক্ষিতে প্রস্তাবিত আমিন বাজারস্থ ঢাকা আরিচা সড়কের দক্ষিণ পাশের বালিমারিয়া মৌজার জে, এল নং-৭৪১ এর একটি আধুনিক ও পরিকল্পিত আবাসিক প্রকল্প বাস্তবায়নের জন্য তাহাদের কোম্পানী কর্তৃক ক্রয়কৃত সম্পত্তিতে ভূমি উন্নয়ন করার অনুমতি দেওয়া গেল। ইহা মোট্রো মেকার এন্ড ডেভেলপারস লিমিটেড কর্তৃক দাখিতকৃত প্রকল্পটির বাস্তবায়নের জন্য (development permit) হিসাবে গণ্য হইবে।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>BELA filed a supplementary affidavit against the said alleged permission stating that MMDL created it by resorting to forgery. Under such circumstances, the High Court Division called for the record of RAJUK for ascertaining the genuineness of this endors-ement and ascertained that though a copy of the letter was kept with the file, there was no such permission. The High Court Division thereupon came to a definite finding that “<em>This copy contains the signature of the issuer Mr. Zakir Hossain, Town Planner (Director), just after the finish of the main contents of the letter but Annexure-X-1 contained the same signature at the bottom of the alleged paragraph and as such it can be safely said that the issuer of the letter dated 29.7.1995 superfluously included this portion in Annexure-X-1 for the reason best known to him. Therefore, we hold that the allegation of forgery on the part of Modhumati in inclusion of that part in Annexure-X-1, has no basis”.</em><br/> <br/>It is to be noted that the recipient of the letter in question was Mr. Md. Shawkat Ali Khan, Chief Planner and not MMDL. In the subject matter of the said letter it was mentioned “ষ্ট্রাকচার প্লান, মাষ্টার প্লান, ও ডিটেইল এরিয়া প্ল্যান প্রনয়ন সাভার এলাকায় গৃহীত সরকারী ও বেসরকারী উল্লেখযোগ্য ও প্রতিশ্র্রতি প্রকল্প সমূহ অন্তভূক্তি পদ বিবেচনা প্রসঙ্গে।”, which does not relate to according development permission to MMDL. It was relating to inclusion of Government and private projects in the Structure Plan, Master Plan and Design Area plan in Savar Area. Therefore, it is apparent that there is no nexus between the subject matter and the alleged permission accorded at the bottom of the letter. There was no reason for issuing a copy to MMDL in the context of the matter. If the letter was intended as a ‘Development permit’, RAJUK was required to write it directly to MMDL and not to Mr. Md. Shawkat Ali Khan. MMDL used this letter to their benefit by holding out that they had been granted permission by RAJUK, which tends to suggest that the forged additional paragraph was included at the behest of MMDL.<br/> <br/>On our query to Mr. Azmalul Hossain, whether a third party is legally entitled to a copy of any official correspondence made by a public servant to any another officer which does not relate to him. Mr. Hossain found it difficult to meet our query and left the matter for our decision on proper construction of the letter. It is totally curious to note that the Town Planner, RAJUK wrote a letter to the Chief Town Planner, RAJUK relating to inclusion of projects in the compiled planning. Further-more, if such permission was granted by RAJUK as claimed by MMDL, there was no reason on the part of MMDL for seeking permission by writing letters on 26<sup>th</sup> October, 2001 and 18<sup>th</sup> July, 2002 respectively as appeared at pages 618 and 620 of paper book-II. RAJUK by memo dated 10<sup>th</sup> March, 2002 and 29<sup>th</sup> July, 200, pages 624 and 625 of paper book-II refused the prayers.<br/> <br/>There is no gainsaying that MMDL inserted the permission at the bottom of the letter, annexure X-1, by resorting to forgery in collusion with Zakir Hossain with mala fide motive to secure a judgment from the High Court Division showing that its project was approved by RAJUK and for this forgery, the authorities of MMDL and the persons responsible for insertion of this permission in annexure-X-1 are required to be prosecuted in accordance with section 195(c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/>Section 75 of Act 1953, clearly provides for permission for use of land contrary to Master Plan. The submission that the project has been earmarked as housing and ancillary use and, therefore, no such permission is necessary under section 75 has no basis at all in view of the fact that in the deeds there are clear recitals that the lands in question are low lying areas and identified in the new Master Plan as Sub- Flood Flow Zone and included in  SPZ17<sup>3</sup> which is evident from the map opposite to page 32 Vol-I of the Master Plan and page 28 of the appendix at the end of Vol-II of the new Master Plan.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mahmudul Islam contended that MMDL failed to produce any evidence showing that it started developing the lands purchased in the two mouzas since 1990 - the documents annexed to the writ petition of MMDL showed that it first advertised to sell plots on 25<sup>th</sup> June, 2001 and started selling the plots from 21<sup>st</sup> November, 2001 to 30<sup>th</sup> June, 2005, within which period it sold only 491 plots. It is contended that the lists did not disclose whether the sold plots were developed plots and from the registered deeds enclosed with paper book No.IV at pages 988 to 1025 showed that the dates of execution of these kabalas had been kept blank and on reading of these kabalas showed that from March, 2002 onwards proposed plots were sought to be sold and the lands sold were described as “boro nal land”. It is further contended that if developed plots were being sold, the lands sold would not have been described as “boro nal land”.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mahmudual Islam next contended that the question “post facto” permission would not suffice as the new Master Plan does not at all contemplate establishment of modern housing project so, the question of giving permission to set up MMT does not arise in the Sub- Flood Flow Zone. Mr. Islam conceded that in part-3, Vol-II of the new Master Plan, the category of development subject to permission includes dwelling house, but according to him, the main focus of the new Master Plan and also of Jaladhar Ain is preservation of drainage of rain and flood water. Bilamalia and Baliapur mouzas have been identified as part of SPZ 17<sup>3.</sup> In this connection Mr. Islam has relied upon paragraph 5.22, Part-3, Vol.II of Urban Area plan which reads as under:<br/> <br/>“<em>Purpose and Intents”. The purpose of Sub Flood Zone (SFZ) is to generally define areas either temp-orally or seasonally flooded (flood lands). The intention is to project the health, safety and welfare of the general people; to <u>reduce negative environmental impacts within natural waterways; and to protect and preserve natural drainage system</u> to ensure their proper and continued functioning</em>”. (emphasis added) The policy relating to Sub-Flood zone as stated at page 53, Vol-I of new Master Plan shows that the development must be compatible with rural nature, that is to say, the development should not be undertaken for housing scheme of the project of MMT and such development must not be such as to disturb natural flood flow. Where the development of land by filling earth for housing scheme over an extensive area is made this would surely disturb flood flow. Thus the Master Plan does not contemplate the housing project which the scheme of MMT has undertaken.<br/> <br/>Admittedly Modhumati is developing the area by filing earth with an intention to raise the land above flood water level. As such, the same is not compatible with the policy adopted in DMDP. In this connection the High Court Division held that Modhumati is entitled to ‘apply for plan review application as enunciated in Article 2.5.3 of the Interim Planning Rules formulated in part 3 of Vol-II of DMDP and also under section 75 of the Town Improvement Act, 1953’. Here the High Court Division made omnishambles, inasmuch as, the High Court Division failed to consider the purpose of earmarking Sub- Flood Flow Zone area which is also designated as Flood Prone Areas (FPA). The purpose of the area is to protect the health, safety and welfare of the general public. In the map of Dhaka structure plan, Vol-I, in between pages 32 and 33, Bilamalia and Baliarpur mouzas have been identified as part of SPZ 173 which is earmarked as the Flood Flow Zone area as will be evident from appendices at page 22 of DMDP, Vol-II wherein it was stated against SPZ171/172/173 that ‘New subdivision to create Savar Pourashava, Dhamrai/ Dhamsona and the flood zone area....’<br/> <br/>Further, the new Master Plan clearly shows that development must be compatible with rural in nature. Such development must not be such as to disturb flood flow. Over and above, the High Court Division totally ignored Jaladhar Ain, 2000. The object of Jaladhar Ain is to protect প্রাকৃতিক জলাধার mainly for the purpose of proper drainage of flood and rain water in the Dhaka city, and under this Ain conversion of প্রাকৃতিক জলাধার to undertake a housing project cannot be allowed as that would not be consistent with the purpose of the Ain. Bilamalia and Baliapur mouzas are ‘প্রাকৃতিক জলাধার’ as they are included in the Gazette of new Master Plan as Flood Flow Zones. So, assuming that this Master Plan is void in view of section 75, these two mouzas fall within the inclusive definition of ‘প্রাকৃতিক জলাধার’; hence the project cannot be implemented being violative of Jaladhar Ain, 2000 as they are low lands earmarked for retaining rain water. The registration of MMDL’s project with RAJUK will not improve the case, in that, the rules of 2004 do not confer any right to establish a housing project violating the mandatory provisions of law and secondly, these rules will not prevail over the parent law.<br/> <br/>It is contended on behalf of the appellants in Civil Appeal No.254 of 2009 that they are bona fide purchasers for value and exercised due diligence when purchasing the plots from MMT and thus their interest cannot be denied. Accordingly, it is contended that the High Court Division has rightly held that their interest should not be interfered with. It was also contended that they being purchasers, their right is guaranteed under Article 42 of the Constitution. Mr. Azmalul Hossain, added that MMDL has a contractual and legal obligation to provide the infrastructure facilities as promised to the third party purchasers such as roads, bridges, culvert, water channels, open spaces, recreation areas and other facilities on the common land of MMDL. They being purchasers for value without notice to any illegality or wrong doing, it would be expecting too much from laymen that they should have known the law, and the private property right of purchasers should not be taken away by a decision of this Division where a substantial number of them are not even involved in this dispute. Article 102 cannot be used to take away fundamental rights to be treated in accordance with law under Article 31 and the right to property under Article 42. These are express rights which can be protected under Article 102. <br/> <br/>MMDL advertised for sale of plots firstly on 25<sup>th</sup> June, 2001 and long before that date Savar plan and then the new Master Plan came into operation restricting use of lands in the mouzas in question and the Jaladhar Ain, 2000 also came into operation from 5<sup>th</sup> February, 2001. Every person is presumed to know the legal position because of the notification. The purchasers were required to enquire in the office of RAJUK whether houses can be built in the land in question and whether RAJUK has permitted the proposed land use. They did not make any such inquiry rather relied upon the permission annexure-X-1, which is apparently a forged one. The concept of bona fide purchasers for value without notice is applicable only in respect of transfer of immovable property and specific performance of contract for transfer of immovable property and not in respect of use of immovable property. It is contended by Mr. Mahmudul Islam that it is needless to say that the concept of bona fide purchasers for value without notice is an equitable principle which can not override the bar placed by the statutory provision. In this connection learned Counsel has relied upon the cases of ETV Ltd. V. Dr. Chowdhury Mahmud Hasan, 54 DLR(AD)130 and Sharif Nurul Ambia Vs. Dhaka City Corporation, 58 DLR(AD) 253.<br/> <br/>In the ETV case, this Division observed <em>“the third party rights exist(s) and fall with Ekushy Television since their interest merged with that of ETV. The substantive legal principle in this regard is that every person is subject to the ordinary law within the jurisdiction”.</em> In Sharif Nurrul Ambia, the Government gave to the Dhaka City Corporation certain plots for construction of car park as earmarked in the Master Plan but the City Corporation constructed shops on the said plots and allotted the shops to the shop keepers taking salami. This Division in the attending circumstances refused to recognize the alleged right of the “bona fide” allottees and ordered stoppage of construction and demolition of existing structure. The statements of law argued on the question of bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any restriction is based on sound principle of law and I find no reason to depart from them. In view of the above, I find merit in the contention of Mr. Mahmudul Islam that these purchasers cannot acquire any better right in view of the statutory barrier to make development in areas earmarked as SPZ17<sup>3.</sup><br/> <br/>The High Court Division failed to notice that if the original owners cannot use the land in question contrary to the bar created by the legislature or its delegate, the purchasers, bona fide or otherwise, cannot claim a better right than that of the original owner. These purchasers have acquired limited right to the lands by virtue of purchase from MMDL. All these purchasers cannot claim any right, inasmuch as, their vendor MMDL purchased lands in excess of the ceiling fixed by P.O.98 of 1972. The purchasers cannot claim right overriding any bar or prohibition imposed by law, inasmuch as, in Article 42 there is a rider clause, i.e. subject to any law to the contrary. Mr. Islam argued that protection of the environment and ecology have been recognized as components of right to life guaranteed by Articles 31 and 32 of the Constitution. In this connection learned Counsel has relied upon the cases of Dr. Mohiuddin Faruk V. Bangladesh, 49 DLR (AD)1 and Sharif Nurul Ambia V. Dhaka City Corporation, 58 DLR(AD)253.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong><u>Environment and Human Rights</u></strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Environment protection encompasses not only pollution but also sustainable developm-ent and conservation of natural resources and the eco-system. Environmental degradation can be either localized such as the depletion of the nation’s wetland, forest resources, open spaces or global, such as destruction of the ozone layer. There are various laws and rules for protection and preservation of environment, but the prote-ction and preservation of the environment is still a passing issue of the day despite such laws. The main cause for environmental degradation is lack of effective enforcement of the various laws. As in this case, the functionaries did not take legal actions against MMDL despite finding that they were developing lands for housing project and the High Court Division had interfered in the matter on the application of BELA which has been working in the regulatory field of environment and ecology. It is noticeable that there is lack of proper, effective and timely enforcement of the laws prevailing in the country on the subject matter. It is also noticeable that in all cases the High Court Division has come forward and pronounced a number of judgments and issued various directions with the objective of securing the protection and preservation of environment and eco-system.<br/> <br/>The environmental problems of the day damage our natural environment and life on earth. Protection and preservation of the environment has been integral to the culture and religious ethos of most human communities. The international community has increased its awareness on the relationship between environmental degradation and human rights abuses. The international community has assumed the commitment to observe the realization of human rights and protection of environment. Thus there is no gainsaying that the protection of the environment and internationalized-human rights are presented as universal and protection of the environment appears as everyone’s responsibility. Human rights and environmental law have traditionally been envisaged as two distinct independent spheres of rights. Now-a-days, the peoples perception is aroused to the notion that the cause of protection of the environment can be promoted by setting it in the framework of human rights, which has by now been established as a matter of international law and practice.<br/> <br/>To avail the benefits of environmental law and human rights one must give protection to environmental law that would help ensure the well-being of future generations as well as the survival of those who depend immediately upon natural resources for their livelihood. Secondly, the protection of human rights is an effective means to achieving the ends of conservation and environmental protection. The focus is on the existing human rights. There exists a raging debate on whether one should recognize an actual and independent right to a satisfactory environment as a legally enforceable right. This would obviously shift the emphasis on to the environment and away from the human rights. Thirdly, in the Stoc-kholm Conference in 1972, it was argued by the delegates that international environmental law has developed to such extent that even the domestic environments of states have been internationalized. Environmental law has in many parts of the world, be it at the international or domestic level, suffered from the problem of standing. Because of this barrier, it is often difficult for individuals or groups to challenge infringements of environ-mental law, treaties or directives, as the case may be.<br/> <br/>The right to a healthy environment is now to be found in a number of regional human rights instruments around the globe. Article 11 of the Additional Protocol to the Inter-American Convention of Human Rights (1994) popularly known as the San Salvador Protocol,  states; (1) everyone shall have the right to live in a healthy environment and to have access to basic public services; (2) the state parties shall promote the protection, preservation and impr-ovement of the environment. The convention of the Rights of the Child, 1989, article 24(2)(c) requires state parties in the matter of combating disease and malnutrition to take into consideration, “the damage and risks of envi-ronmental pollution”. The African Charter on Human and People’s Rights 1981 proclaims in Article 24(1) a right to “a general satisfactory environment favourable to their development”. In the final report on Prevention of Discrim-ination and Protection of Minorities listed amongst other including: (a) the right to freedom from pollution, environmental degrad-ation and activities which threaten life, health or livelihood; (b) protection and preservation of the air, soil, water, flora and fauna; (c) healthy food and water; a safe and healthy working environment.<br/> <br/>In the Stockholm Declaration, 1972 as mentioned above, it was declared <em>“Man has the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life, in an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well being, and he bears a solemn respon-sibility to protect and improve the environment for present and future generations”.</em> In the United Nations General Assembly, resolution No.45/94 recalled the language of Stockholm, stating that all individuals are entitled to live in an environment adequate for their health and well-being. All global and regional human rights bodies have accepted the link between environmental degradation and internatio-nally-guaranteed human rights. The European Convention on Human Rights has also been invoked in environmental matters. In Europe, most of the victims invoke either the right to information or the right to privacy guaranteed under the Convention. Under the said Conve-ntion and Protocol, it has been recognized that pollution or other environmental harm can result in a breach of one is right to privacy and family life.<br/> <br/>In Argentina, its Constitution recognizes since 1994 the right to a healthy and suitable environment. In Columbia, the right to the environment was incorporated in 1991. Our Constitution though does not explicitly provide for the right to healthy environment, Article 31 states that every citizen has the right to protection from “action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation, or property”, unless these are taken in accordance with law. Mr. Islam submitted that ‘action detrimental to the life’ also encompasses any action which is detrimental to healthy life. There are different subordinate laws on the subject, such as, the Removal of Wrecks and Obstructions in Inland Navigable Water-Ways Rules, 1973, The Bangladesh Wild Life (preservation) Order, 1973, The Bidi Manufacture (Prohibition) Ordinance, 1975, Bangladesh Paribesh Sangra-khyan Ain, 1995, Paribesh Sangrakhyan Bidhi-mala, 1997 and The Jaladhar Sangrakhyan Ain, 2000 etc.<br/> <br/>In Dr. M. Farooque, B.B.Roy Chowdhury, J. observed ‘<em>Although we do not have any provision like Article 48A of the Indian Constitution for protection and improvement of environment, Articles 31 and 32 of our Constitution protect right to life as a fundamental right. It encompasses within its ambit, the protection and preservation of environment, ecological balance free from pollution of air and water, sanitation without which life can hardly be enjoyed. Any act or omission contrary thereto will be violative of the said right to life</em>.’ In M.S. Shehla Zia V. WAPDA, PLD 1994 SC 69, Supreme Court of Pakistan held that Article 9 includes “<em>all such amenities and facilities which a person born in a free country is entitled to enjoy with dignity, legally and constitutionally</em>”. In that case the petitioner questioned whether, under Article 9 of the Constitution, citizens were entitled to protection of law from being exposed to hazards of electro-magnetic field or any other such hazards which may occur due to installation and construction of any grid station, any factory, power station or such like installations. The Supreme Court noted that under the Constitution, Article 14 provides that the dignity of man and subject to law, the privacy of homes shall be inviolable. The fundamental right to preserve and protect the dignity of man and right to life are guaranteed under Article 9. It is said, <em>“if both are read together, question will arise whether a person can be said to have dignity of man if his right to life is below bare necessity life without proper food, clot-hing, shelter, education, health care, clean atmosphere and unpolluted environment”.</em>            <br/> <br/>The Supreme Court of India in relation to the meaning given to the Right to Life under Article 21 of the Constitution argued that the right to life has been used in a diversified manner. It includes, the right to survive as a species, quality of life, the right to live with dignity and the right to livel-ihood. In rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra V. State of U.P. (1985) 3 SCC 614, the Supreme Court dealt with issues relating to environment and ecological balance. The concept of the right to life used in Article 21 was expanded further in Francis Coralie Mullin V. Union Territory of Delhi, AIR 1981 SC 746. In Charan Lal Sahu V. Union of India, AIR 1990 SC 273 &amp; 1480, and in Subash Kumar V. State of Bihar, AIR 1991 SC 420, the Supreme Court observed that “<em>right to life guaranteed by article 21 includes the right of enjoyment of pollution-free water and air for full enjoyment of life</em>”. The Supreme Court has used the right to life as a basis for emphasizing the need to take drastic steps to combat air and water pollution and it has directed the closure or relocation of industries and ordered that evacuated land be used for the needs of the community. The Court has taken a serious view of unscientific and uncontrolled quarrying and mining and issued orders for the maintenance of ecology around coastal areas, shifting of hazardous and heavy industries and in restraining tanneries from discharging effluents.<br/> <br/>On the concept of “sustainable and environmentally sound development” in which the “Earth Summit”, meeting in Rio in 1992 endeavoured to focus by defining an ambitious programme of action, Agenda 21, clarified by a Declaration of 27 principles solemnly adopted on that occasion. The General Assembly held in 1990 on the Declaration on International Economic Co-operation clearly recognized that “Economic development must be environme-ntally sound and sustainable”. The concept of sustainable development contains as has been argued by different activists on three basic components or principles, first, among these is the precautionary principle, whereby the state must anticipate, prevent and attack the cause of environmental degradation. The Rio Declaration affirms the principle by stating that wherever “there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation<em>”. </em><br/> <br/>The Brundtland Commission defined sus-tainable development as development which was formally known as the World Commission of Environment and Development (WCED). The Commission’s report defines sustainable development as <em>“development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs”.</em> The principle envisages, firstly, that each generation should be required to conserve the diversity of the natural and cultural resource base, so that it does not unduly restrict the options available to future generations in solving their problems and satisfying their own values, and should also be entitled to diversify comparable to that enjoyed by previous generations. This principle is called ‘<em>conservation and options”. Secondly, generation should be required to maintain the quality of the planet so that it is passed on in no worse condition than that in which it was received, and should also be entitled to planetary quality comparable to that enjoyed by previous generations. Thirdly, each generation should provide its members with equitable rights of access to the legacy of past generations and should conserve this access for future generations. This is principle of ‘conservation of access”.</em><br/> <br/>The Supreme Court of India in a later case in M.C. Mehta V. Kamal Nath and others, (1997) 1 SCC 388 added that <em>“it would </em><em>be equally appropriate in controversies involving air pollution, the dissemination of pesticides, the location of rights of ways for utilities, and strip mining of wetland filling on private lands in a state where governm-ental permits are required”. </em>The facts of that case are that Kamal Nath’s family has direct links with a private company, Span Motels Private Limited, which owns a resort-Span Resorts-for tourists in Kullu-Manali Valley. The problem is with another ambitious venture floated by the same company-Span Club. The club represents Kamal Nath’s dream of having a house on the bank of the Beas in the shadow of the snow-capped Zanskar Range. The club was built after encroaching upon 27.12 bighas of land, including substantial forest land, in 1990. The heavy earth-mover has been used to block the flow of the river just 500 metres upstream. The bulldozers are creating a new channel to divert the river to at least one kilometre downstream. The tractor-trolleys move earth and boulders to shore up the embankment surrounding Span Resorts for laying a lawn. According to the Span Resorts management, the entire reclaiming operation should be over by March 31 and is likely to cost over a crore of rupees. Last September, these caused floods in the Beas and property estimated to worth Rs. 105 crores was destroyed. Once they succeed in diverting the river, the Span management plans to go in for landscaping the reclaimed land. The District Administration pleads helples-sness. Rivers and forest land, officials point out, are not under their jurisdiction.<br/> <br/>The Supreme Court observed “<em>The notion that the public has a right to expect certain lands and natural areas to retain their natural characteristic is finding its way into the law of the land. The need to protect the environment and ecology has been summed up by David B. Hunter (University of Michigan) in an article titled an ecolo-gical perspective on property: A call for judicial protection of the public’s interest in environmentally critical resources published in Harvard Environmental Law Review</em>, Vol.12 1988, P.311 is in the following words:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>          “Another major ecological tenet is that the world is finite. The earth can support only so many people and only so much human activity before limits are reached. This lesson was driven home by the oil crisis of the 1970s as well as by the pesticide scare of the 1960s. The current deterior-ation of the ozone layer is another vivid example of the complex, unpr-edictable and potentially catastro-phic effects posed by our disregard of the environmental limits to econo-mic growth. The absolute finiteness of the environment, leads to the unquestionable result that human activities will at some point be constrained.’</em><br/><br/>        “<em>Human activity finds in the natural world its external limits. In short, the environment imposes constraints on our freedom; these constraints are not the product of value choices but of the scientific imperative of the environme-nt’s limitations. Reliance on improving technology can delay temporarily, but not forever, the inevitable constraints. There is a limit to the capacity of the environment to service ... growth, both in providing raw materials and in assimilating by-product wastes due to consumption. The largesse of technol-ogy can only postpone or disguise the inevitable</em>”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Professor Barbara Ward has written of this ecological imperative in particularly vivid language:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“We can forget moral imperatives. But today the morals of respect and care and modesty come to us in a form we cannot evade. We cannot cheat on DNA. We cannot get round photosynthesis. We cannot say I am not going to give a damn about phytoplankton. All these tiny mechanisms provide the preconditions of our planetary life. To say we do not care is to say in the most literal sense that ‘we choose death”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>There is a commonly-recognized link between laws and social values, but to ecologists a balance between laws and values is not alone sufficient to ensure a stable relationship between humans and their environment. Laws and values must also contend with the constraints imposed by the outside environment. Unfortunately, current legal doctrine rarely accounts for such constraints, and thus environmental stability is threatened. Historically, we have changed the environment to fit our conceptions of property. We have fenced, filled and paved. The environment has proven malleable and to a large extent still is. But there is a limit to this malleability, and certain types of ecologically important resources-for example, wetlands and riparian forests-can no longer be destroyed without enormous long-term effects on environmental and, therefore, social stability. To ecologists, the need for preserving sensitive resources does not reflect value choices but rather is the necessary result of objective observations of the laws of nature.<br/> <br/>Ecologists view the environmental sciences as providing us with certain laws of nature. These laws, just like our own laws, restrict our freedom of conduct and choice. Unlike our laws, the laws of nature cannot be changed by legislative fiat; they are imposed on us by the natural world. An understanding of the laws of nature must therefore inform all of our social institutions. The ancient Roman Empire developed a legal theory known as the ‘Doctrine of the Public Trust”. It was founded on the ideas that certain common properties such as rivers, seashore, forests and the air were held by Government in trusteeship for the free and unimpeded use of the general public. Our contemporary concern about “the environment” bear a very close conceptual relationship to this legal doctrine. Under the Roman law these resources were either owned by no one <em>(res nullious)</em> or by every one in common <em>(res communious)</em>.<br/> <br/>The Public Trust Doctrine primarily rests on the principle that certain resources like air, sea, waters and the forests have such a great importance to the people as a whole that it would be wholly unjustified to make them a subject of private ownership. The said resources being a gift of nature, they should be made freely available to everyone irrespective of the status in life. The doctrine enjoins upon the Government to protect the resources for the enjoyment of the general public rather than to permit their use for private ownership or commercial purposes.<br/> <br/>The majority judgments adopted ecological concepts to determine which lands can be considered tide lands. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development was of the view that one of the fundamental prerequisites for the achievement of sustainable development was broad public participation in decision making. Furthermore, the Conference recog-nized, in the specific context of environment, “<em>the need for new forms</em><em> of participation</em>” and “<em>the need of individuals, groups and organizations to participate in environmental impact assessment procedures and to know about the participation in (pertinent) decisions</em>”. The Conference impli-citly linked the notion of real participation in the right of access to information by nothing that “Individuals, groups and organizations sho-uld have access to information relevant to environment and development held by national authorities, including information on products and activities that have or are likely to have a significant impact on the environment, and information on environmental protection measures”. The link between participation and information can also be found in Principle 10 of the Declaration of Rio.<br/> <br/>It is now settled that right to life includes right to protection and improvement of environment and ecology and there is specific law in that regard restricting use of nal lands in the areas in question which operate as reservoir of flood and rain water. If these lands are filled up it will create serious problem in draining out the water resulting from flood and rain and the affected people would compel the authorities through judicial review to take steps to preserve and protect health, environment and ecology in the Dhaka Metropolitan area.<br/> <br/>Now turning to the question of bar of P.O.98 of 1972, Mr. Azmalul Hossain contended that there is clear distinction in P.O.98 of 1972 as amended between the consequences that follows in the case of a transfer of land and excess of the 100 standard bighas limit to a family and to a ‘body’. In case of a ‘family’, it is contended, the transfer is void in view of Article 5A and in case of a ‘body’, the transfer is valid but the excess land will be forfeited to the Government as per Article 12 and the burden of proving this assertion is upon BELA.    <br/> <br/>In the concise statement, MMDL has clearly stated in paragraph 9 that it purchased lands measuring 169.91 bighas for the project summary the lake area as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>For cannel/lake 1, D1 is equal to 50.75 bigha<br/>Cannel/lake to, due to equal to 48.44 bigha<br/>Cannel/lake 3, D3 is equal to 24.89 bigha<br/>Cannel/late 4, D4 is <u>equal to 45.83 bigha.</u></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 160px;"><strong>Totally 169.91 bighas</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In paragraph 9(V), it clearly stated that it purchased <em>“about 550 acres of land by several deeds from the owners of the land in mouzas </em><em>Bilamalia and Baliarpur</em><em> which is right next to the main Savar Highway for the purpose of implementation of housing project and got the area survey (sic) and investigated …..”. </em>Therefore, the submission that the burden lies upon BELA to prove that MMDL purchased excess land itself is self-contradictory. There is a relaxation of the celling of land in Article 4 of P.O.98 of 1972 imposed by Article 3 in the following cases namely;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(a) a co-operative society of farmers where the members thereof surrendered their ownership in the lands uncondit-ionally to the society and cultivate the lands themselves;<br/>(b) lands used for cultivation of the rubber or coffee orchards;<br/>(c) an industrial concern holding land for the production of raw materials for manufacture of commodities in its own factories;<br/>(d) any other case where such relaxation is considered necessary in the public interest.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Further in Ordinance No.X of 1984 the total quantity of agricultural land which may held by a family has been reduced to 60(sixty) standard bighas. Therefore, the acquisition of 550 acres of land by MMDL is violative of the provisions of Act, 1950, P.O.98 of 1972 and Ordinance X of 1984. The MMDL’s case does not attract any of the said categories and admittedly it did not seek for relaxation to purchase lands in excess of 100 standard bighas for housing purposes from the Revenue Officer. When this bar of acquisition was drawn to the attention of Mr. Azmalul Hossain, learned counsel finds it difficult to meet the query made to him as regards MMDL’s locus standi to acquire lands exceeding the ceiling and selling them to the third party-purchasers, and replied   that he would make submission after a thorough examination of P.O.98 of 1972, but he concluded his submission without meeting the query.      <br/> <br/>The findings of the High Court Division are apparently self-contradictory. On the one hand it observed “<em>the project of Modhumati Model Town is unauthorized project as it has been continued in violation of section 75 of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 and the DMDP prepared thereunder the Act. Since Modhumati has been conti-nuing with their unauthorized development work the obstruction made by RAJUK against such unauthorized develop-ment of Sub- Flood Flow Zone was quite lawful and as such Modhumati is not entitled to relief as prayed for in Writ Petition No.5103 of 2003” and in the other breath, it has observed, since Modhumati has undertaken such project it is entitled to such use of their purchased land provided that they observe the legal requirement as enunciated in the interim planning rules. Admittedly Modhu-mati is developing the area by filling earth with an intention to raise the land above design flood water level as such the same is compatible to the policy in DMDP</em>’, on the other hand, it held ‘<em>Modhumati Purchased 1500 bighas Nal, Chala and Bhita lands and admittedly raised beyond flood level by filling earth before they sell it to 3500 buyers including added respondent Nos.8-52 thereby meaning that the added respondents purchased for value raised land from a developer who developed their purchased land owned vast land of 1500 bighas through earth filling, not over night but through years together, making all sort of advertisement in all possible media without any hindrance or objection from any quarter. This appears to have made the added respondents bona fide purchasers for value without notice to any mischievous act on the part of the developer as to the development permit allegedly to have been issued by RAJUK through its chief Town Planner</em>.’<br/> <br/>As regards bona fide purchasers, I found earlier that the purchasers could not claim any right on the plea of bona fide purchase since their vendor could not acquire lands exceeding the retainable ceiling provided in Act, 1950, P.O.98 of 1997, and Ordinance X of 1984, they could not acquire any better right than their vendor. The fundamental rights of the third party purchasers cannot override the fundam-ental rights of the overwhelming number of residents of the metropolis under Articles 31 and 32 of the Constitution. Further, no person can claim protection of law, and of right to life and personal liberty in violation of law. Both Articles 31 and 32 protect those rights and liberty if he does not violate the law. Equal protection embraces the entire realm of state action, it would extend not only when a person is discriminated against in the matter of exercise of his rights or in the matter of imposing liabilities upon him, but also in the matter of granting privileges. The principle of equality does not mean that every law must have universal application for all persons who are not by nature, attainment or circumstances in the same position, as the varying needs of different classes of persons often require separate treatment. If a law deals equally with members of a well-defined class, it is not obnoxious and it is not open to the charge of denial of equal protection on the ground that it has no application to other persons. Right of the State to charge its policy in respect of the retainable lands from time to time under the changing circumstances can not be questioned. The High Court Division has ignored this aspect of the matter.<br/> <br/>As regards bona fide purchasers the findings of the High Court Division that “<em>when the citizen is bona fide purchaser for value without notice, the bona fide purchaser for value of the plots of Modhumati Model Town since purchased land raised above design flood water level with an aim to build structure for housing either single, multif-amily or minimal, their accrued interest in the said land can not be dislodged on the ground that </em><em>Bilamalia and Baliarpur</em><em> have been earmarked in DMDP Urban Area Plan (1995-2005) as Sub-Flood Flow Zone when actual classifycation of zonal lands has not yet been commenced under the detailed area plan of DMDP and they already published structure and urban plan is a relaxed one having option to change the same as per reservent</em>” are based on misconception of law. What’s more, the High Court Division made out a third case that the purchasers raised the land above the flood water level which is not at all the case of MMDL. Its specific claim is that it has raised the land for the purpose of selling plots to different purchasers above the flood water level.<br/> <br/>Now the question is what will be the fate of MMT and those of the third party-purchasers. It has been found that the project was undertaken violating the provisions of Town Improvement Act, Bangladesh Paribesh Sangrakhyan Ain, Jaladhar Sangrakhyan Ain, P.O.98 of 1972 and hosts of other prevailing laws of the land. The concept of law contains within it the element of command and the requirement of obedience. The ownership right either by inheritance or purchase of the lands of MMDL has been curtailed by statutory provisions. No person or company can acquire lands more than 100 standard bighas. In a rad-ically altered country land-lordism as formerly existed became a misfit and an anachronism. Before the abolition of Zamindary system the majority of the members of the Land Revenue Commission, Bengal, had expressed the view that whatever may have been the justification for the permanent settlement in 1793, it was no longer suited to the condition of the present time and that the Zamaindary system had developed so many defects that it had ceased to serve any national interest. They had accord-ingly recommended that the actual cultivators should be brought into direct relation with the Government by the acquisition of all rent-receiving interest in lands so that Government as the sole landlord may be in a much better position than any individual private landlord to initiate development measures with a view to improve the conditions of the tillers of the soil and also to ensure the maximum exploitation of the land and water resources of the country.<br/> <br/>The commission felt it necessary that the existing tenancy laws should be suitably amended to provide the following:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>a) after the acquisition of rent receiving interests, there should be only one class of tenants under the Government and all such tenants should have occupancy rights and have option to commute the rents of their holdings and become free peasants; </em><br/><em>b) all lands in the khas possession of rent receivers and others in excess of certain limit should be acquired by the Government with a view to distribute them among tenants with uneconomic holdings, borgaders and landless agri-cultural labourers;</em><br/><em>c) transfer of lands except to bona fide cultivators owning lands less than prescribed maximum quantity should be prohibited to prevent accumulation of too much lands under one family as well as to prevent transfer of lands to non-agriculturists;</em><br/><em>d) sub-letting of lands by tenants except under certain special circumst-ances should be absolutely interdicted; </em><br/><em>e) a rational system should be provided to regulate enhancement and reduction of rents of tenants;</em><br/><em>f) Provisions should be made for amalgamation and consolidation of holdings with a view to facilitate the introduction of co-operative farming and mechanised cultivation;</em><br/><em>g) So long as the borga system remains, provisions should be made for protection of borgaders against arbitrary eviction from their borga lands; </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The object and purpose for which the feudal system was abolished about 50 years ago from this soil is being reintroduced by a group of persons and companies by acquiring lands from poor cultivators by means of allurement, coercion, threat, intimidation and other means, much higher ceiling than the law permits to acquire by way of purchase openly on tip of the nose of the Government by using their muscle and money power in the name of housing projects. The Government knowing well that these projects are illegal and unauthorised is keeping a blind eye to all those housing projects. There is a wrong notion that RAJUK is the authority which can authorise a housing project under the Act of 1953 and MMDL has proceeded with its project accordingly.<br/> <br/>It should be remembered that no person or firm or company can acquire by way of purchase or otherwise any land which exceeds the ceiling and therefore, before the permission is sought for from RAJUK, the said person or firm or company is required to obtain permission from the Revenue Officer if the Project exceeds 100 standard bighas. Putting lands in excess of the required ceiling to residential use would be clearly contrary to the restrictions which the MMDL has undertaken the development plan without prior approval. The common law rights of the owners must give in to the statutory restrictions. The common law use and enjoyment of the ownership rights should, therefore, be subject to the requirements of the statutory law prevailing in the country.<br/> <br/>These laws require conducting the elaborate survey of the civil needs of the citizens and feasibility and practicability of the various land uses and the prospective growth of the city before demarcating the land for different purposes. According to the Master Plan, the development plans should define various Zones into which the area sought to be developed may be divided and should also indicate the manner in which the land in each Zone is proposed to be used. The dominant intention of the aforesaid statutory provisions is to plan for the present and future development of the whole area under the plan by restricting and regulating the use of ownership rights of the owners under the common law. Those owners can no longer enjoy their unrestricted right available to them to use their lands as they desire. Once a development plan has been prepared and approved in accordance with law, the owners of the area concerned can only use their lands in accordance with and in conformity with the provisions of the development plan. Once the Master Plan has been published, no one in the area can use the lands contrary to its provisions. In using or attempting to use the lands which MMDL has acquired by way of purchase within the SFF Zone as residential purposes, they are clearly violating, firstly, the provisions of Act, 1950 and P.O. 98 of 1972, and secondly, the provisions of Act, 1953 and the Master Plan, and are acting contrary to law.<br/><br/>Rule of law requires that the concerned authorities are under obligation to see that no one violates the law in implementing any project in a restricted area. The Revenue Officer and the Chairman, RAJUK cannot, therefore, permit any person or company or firm to use any land without complying the due requirement of laws. The public authorities should enforce the laws strictly so that the pollution or other environmental harm should not cause injury to human beings. MMDL has utterly violated the laws and has been implementing the housing project. The protection of the environment is not only the duty of the citizen but it is also the obligation of the state and its organs including the Courts. Therefore, MMDL is under an obligation to pay damages for mitigating the hardship of the third-party purchasers if they do not want to take back their monies paid to them in view of the fact that they have illegally acquired, advertised and sold plots suppressing material facts from them violating the laws.<br/><br/>In Manju Bhatia V. New Dellhi Municipal council (1997) 6 SCC 370, a real estate developer after obtaining request sanction built 8 floors as per guidelines which permitted 150 FAR with height restriction of 80 feet. After construction the flats were delivered to the purchasers and the appellant was one of them. At a later stage it was found that the builder constructed the building in violation of the regulation. Consequently the flats of the top four floors were demolished. The demolition came under challenge by way of writ petition in the High Court. The High Court dismissed the petition against which they preferred appeal in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court observed that <em>“in the tort liability arising out of contract, equity steps in and tort takes over and imposes liability upon the defendant for un-quantified damages for the breach of the duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. Equity steps in and relieves the hardships of the plaintiff in a common law action for damages and enjoins upon the defendant to make good the damages suffered by the plaintiff on account of the negligence in the case of the duties or breach of the obligation undertaken or failure to truthfully inform the warranty of title and other allied circumstances. In this case, it is found that four floors were unauthorizedly constructed and came to be demolished by the New Delhi Municipal Council. It does not appear that the owners of the flats were informed of the defective or illegal construction and they were not given notice of caveat emptor. Resultantly, they are put to loss of lakhs of rupees they have invested and given as value of the flats to the builder-respondent”.</em> The Supreme Court Upon consideration of the totality of the facts directed the builder to pay 60 lacs including the amount paid by the allotees as damages with further direction to pay 21% interest per annum on the said amount from the expiry of 6 months.<br/><br/>In Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra V. State of UP, (1985) 2 SCC 431, a mining of lime quarries was ordered to be closed on the ground that mining therein would cause adverse impact of mining operation and the direction was made. The question is after closing of the mining quarry, the lessees of lime stone quarries would be thrown out of business in which they directly invested large sums of money and expended considerable time and effort. The Supreme Court though noticed that it would undoubtedly cause hardship to them, but at the same time, it was of the opinion that <em>‘it is a price that has to be paid for protecting and safeguarding the right of the people to live in healthy environment with minimal disturbance of ecological balance and without avoidable hazard to them and to their cattle, homes and agricultural land and undue affection of air, water and environment. However, in order to mitigate their hardship, we would direct the Government of India and the State of Uttar Pradesh that whenever any other area in the State of Uttar Pradesh is thrown open for grant of lime stone or dolomite quarrying, the lessees who are displaced as a result of this order shall be afforded priority in grant of lease of such area and intimation that such area is available for grant of lease shall be given to the lessees who are displaced so that they can apply for grant of lease of such area and on the basis of such application, priority may be given to them subject, of course, to their otherwise being found fit and eligible”</em>.<br/><br/>On consideration of the submissions and on perusal of the materials, I find inconsistent opinions of the High Court Division as to the correct legal position of the MMDL’s housing project. The UAP and structure plan of DMDP were notified and brought into effect by Gazette notification dated 3<sup>rd</sup> August, 1997 as the Master Plan of the City prepared by RAJUK and approved by the Government and such publication is conclusive evidence in view of section 74(1) of Act 1953; that the Master Plan has been duly approved. The High Court Division, in the premises, erred in law in holding that the said Urban and structure plans are relaxed ones having scope to be changed and that the said documents have been prepared and taken finally under sections 73 and 74 of Act, 1953. It failed to consider that once a Master Plan comes into force it becomes unlawful for any person to use lands for any purposes other than that laid down in the Master plan unless he has been authorised to do so under section 75. Any derogatory use of lands in Bilamalia and Baliarpur Moujas identified in the Master Plan shall need prior approval of RAJUK.<br/> <br/>From the above conspectus, the summary of my conclusion is as

above observations and directions, I agree with the operating part of the judgment of my learned brother.<br/><br/><strong><u>Nazmun Ara Sultana,J.:</u></strong> I have gone through the judgments proposed to be delivered by my brothers, Surendra Kumar Sinha, J. and Syed Mahmud Hossain, J. I agree with the reasoning and findings given by Syed Mahmud Hossain, J.<br/><br/><strong><u>Syed Mahmud Hossain</u></strong><strong><u>,J:</u></strong> Civil Appeal Nos.256, 253, 254 and 255 of 2009 have been heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment as they do involve common questions of laws and facts.<br/><br/>These appeals, by leave, arise out of the judgment and order dated 27.07.2005 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.4604 of 2004 making the Rule absolute in part and discharging the Rule issued in Writ Petition No.5103 of 2003.<br/> <br/>The factual matrix involved in these appeals as it is placed before this Division, in short, is that the appellant, Bangladesh Envi-ronment Lawyers’ Association, in short BELA, is a registered society under The Societies Registration Act, 1860 having registration No.1457 (12) dated 18.02.1992 and has been acting in the regulatory field of environment and ecology with adequate experts who have undertaken, in the last few years, policy regarding examination of legal issues relating to environment and undertook awareness programme and training in making the people conscious of their legal rights and duties. Through its various efforts, BELA has been developed into an independent legal institution with widespread respect and recognition as a dedicated, <em>bona fide</em>, sincere and public-spirited organization. It has also undertaken a large number of public interest litigations wherein the beneficiaries have been the common people of the country and their surrounding environment that affects people’s material and spiritual well being. <br/> <br/>It is further stated in its Writ Petition that, respondent No.4, Rajdhani Unnayan Katripakhya (RAJUK), has been created under the Town Improvement Act,1953 as amended by Act XXIX of 1987, which has been authorized and entrusted with the responsibilities, amongst others, to  prepare and adopt a Master Plan for Dhaka City, earmarking layout plan, allot plots, approve building construction, recreation and other civic facilities and infrastructures plan for Dhaka City along with legal responsibilities to various uses of land within and around Dhaka City. It is further stated that environment of Dhaka City is being continuously endangered and threatened by various unplanned and illegal activities originating from both private and public sectors causing environmental depredation in clear derogation of the policy of land use and minimum environmental standard.<br/> <br/>The appellant BELA further stated that RAJUK in 1997 prepared a fresh Master Plan known as Dhaka Metropolitan Master Plan, in short, DMDP, for the Dhaka City and around, which was published in the Gazette notification on 03.08.1997 identifying a few areas as flood plains, rivers, water bodies, sub-flood flow zone, etc to protect the safety, health and welfare of the common people from negative environmental impacts and to protect and preserve natural drainage system to endure their continual and proper functioning. Any interference with those areas as earmarked in the said Master Plan, will have devastating environmental effect for which the Master Plan in clear terms prohibited land development in those zones for residential, commercial and industrial developments, including raising the level of plain land through earth filling in flood flow/sub-flood flow zones. The said Master Plan in categorizing the land use pattern for the City, identified 19 special planning zones (in short SPZ) out of which SPZ 17 comprising the area between Savar-Dhansona in the West and present Dhaka area in the East which is low-lying area across Turag river and its khals and is designated as flood flow/sub-flood flow zone area within which Amin Bazar area under Savar Police Station has fallen as part of sub-flood flow zone. The DMDP has identified that there have been many private development schemes, approved by RAJUK, specially in the Amin Bazar area on the South of Dhaka Aricha Road will have considerable negative impact on environment and DMDP recommends that all such development permits issued by RAJUK for the development of housing within this area should be withdrawn and that no new one be allowed. Moreover, conditions and restrictions have been imposed in DMDP and also by section 5 of   জলাধার সংরক্ষণ আইন, ২০০০, prohibiting  change of nature of any land that has been earmarked as natural reservoir inclu-ding flood flow zones. In addition to such restri-ctions, Section 7 of Environment Conservation Act, 1995 (Act I of 1995) also imposed restriction of land use in derogation to conservation of environment.<br/> <br/>The specific case of the appellant, BELA, is that, despite aforesaid clear prohibition and other legal limitation, Metro Makers and Developers Limited, a private limited company has undertaken a development project near Amin Bazar within Mouzas ‘Bilamalia’ and ‘Bailarpur’ which squarely is situated within SPZ 17 (3) and earmarked as sub-flood flow zone. Metro Makers has started filling earth in the substantial part of the zone with the object to implement an unauthorized non-permitted satellite township with housing purpose under the name and style ‘Modhumoti Model Town’ and also started, through regular media advertisement, offering to sell housing plots in the said project. BELA further stated that the available documents suggest that RAJUK did not prevent the said development project of Metro Makers. RAJUK has rejected the prayer of Metro Makers through its letter vide Memo No. RAJUK/NA : PA/6-161 (aa-2<sup>nd</sup>) 105 dated 29.07.2003 to approve the project on the ground that the said project is situated within the sub-flood flow zone along with an earlier warning directing Metro Makers to refrain from illegal earth filling in the said project side. Thereafter, BELA  undertook field survey and investigation and found that Metro Makers had been continuing with their illegal activities of earth filling in the project land and also found that none of respondent Nos.1-6 took any step which they are mandated by law to do, against such illegal activities of Metro Makers. Being aggrieved with such inaction on the part of respondent Nos.1-6, the petitioner, BELA, served a legal notice, demanding justice, upon respondent Nos.1-7 on 27.12.2003 requesting the respondents to immediately stop earth filling within the said sub-flood flow zone and to take appropriate measure to restore the original position of the area. BELA received a reply from Metro Makers wherein it has been mentioned that earth-filling in the said zone had been continuing on the basis of an order of stay passed in Writ Petition No.5103 of 2003 preferred by Metro Makers as the petitioner before the High Court Division against respondent No.4. But by a reply sent by respondent No.4, it was intimated to BELA  that the order of stay passed in Writ Petition No.5103 of 2003 had been stayed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1573 of 2003. Accordingly, it appears to BELA that despite such order of stay by the Appellate Division, Metro Makers had been regularly publishing media advertise-ments for sale of plots which respondent Nos.1-6 failed to stop and to take legal steps against Metro Makers (respo-ndent No.7). Thus BELA as the petitioner, preferred this writ petition and obtained Rule Nisi against respondent Nos.1-6. Later 45 plot purchasers of the project on their own initiative were added as respondent Nos.8-52. <br/> <br/>Earlier to filing of Writ Petition No.4604 of 2004, Mr. A. F. M. Jahangir as Managing Director of Metro Makers and Developers as the writ-petitioner filed Writ Petition No.5103 of 2003 on 09.08.2003 impleading originally Chairman, Rajdhani Unnayan Katripakhya (RAJUK) as respondent No.1, Rajdhani Unnayan Katripakhya Unnayan Katripakhya (RAJUK) as respondent No.2, Executive Engineer, Dhaka South, RAJUK as respondent No.3 and obtained a Rule Nisi against them asking to show cause as to why the obstruction in the development of the project area of the Modhumoti Model Town in Mouza Bilamalia, JL No.741 and Bailarpur JL No.742 within Police Station-Savar under District-Dhaka in the name of flood flow zone, should not be declared to have been made without lawful authority and to be of no legal effect. Along with the issuance of the Rule, the Metro Makers also obtained an interim order staying all further activities of respondent Nos.1-3 relating to obstruction to its project for a period of 3 (three) months. Subsequently as many as 15 persons alleged to have purchased plots in Modhumoti Model Town have been added as respondent Nos.4-18 on their own initiative.<br/> <br/>Metro Makers in the said writ petition, stated inter alia, that M/S. Metro Makers and Developers Limited is a registered private limited company (in short Metro Makers) registered under the Companies Act,1913 and engaged in Real Estate Development business specially in making new township for the purpose of facilitating housing to the less favoured citizens of Bangladesh. In course of their business, they have undertaken making township for housing purpose within mouzas, Bilamalia and Bailarpur, under Upazila Savar in the District of Dhaka, three kilometer west of Amin Bazar, adjacent to Dhaka-Aricha highway. The project area comprised 350 acres of land consisting of 2526 residential plots of different sizes with various public utility and facility purchased by Metro Makers from different land owners in those two mouzas with a view to developing the area into a Satellite Township. In an investigation, at the initiatives of Metro Makers regarding flood vulnerability of the area, survey was conducted on the said area by the Institute of Water and Flood Management, BUET and also by the Bureau of Research Testing and Consultation which reported in their study report that the proposed project did not lie in the flood flow zone. The lands purchased by the Metro Makers, are mainly ‘chala’ and ‘bhiti’ lands and as such the lands of the project are above the flood plain and do not come under the purview of Jaladhar Ain,2000. Moreover, there has been no play ground, open ground and natural water reservoir owned by Government within the project premises nor did the project land cause any hindrance to flood flow of any kind. Metro Makers also stated that they have obtained all sorts of licence and permit to prosecute their lawful business and have prepared a project plan and have sold most of the plots to the buyers. Further case of the Metro Makers in Writ Petition No.5103 of 2003 is that the Metro Makers came to know from a notice published in “<strong>The Daily Janakantho”,</strong> dated 23.07.2002 that RAJUK warned public at large that Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan (DMDP) has been approved by the Government and has been published in official gazette on 04.07.1997 wherein main flood flow zone has been shown specially banning the same from earth- filling for the purpose of housing. The Mouzas, ‘Bilamalia’ JL. No.741 and ‘Bailarpur’ JL. No.742, have not been mentioned in the said notice issued by RAJUK on 23.07.2002.<br/> <br/>The main grievance of the Metro Makers in Writ Petition No.5103 of 2003 is that although the Modhumoti Model Town Project has not fallen within the main flood flow zone, RAJUK most arbitrarily and without lawful authority started illegal obstruction against the development work of the Metro Makers in Modhumoti Project on the plea of Jaladhar Ain, 2000. Moreover, RAJUK lodged a criminal case being Savar Police Case No.37, against the Metro Makers and that RAJUK has been obstructing the project of the Metro Makers at the behest of their competitor and other politically  interested quarter inimical to the Metro Makers. <br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by such illegal and mala fide action of the RAJUK, the Metro Makers preferred Writ Petition No.5103 of 2003 and obtained the Rule Nisi.<br/> <br/>The writ respondent Metro Makers contested the Rule issued in Writ Petition No.4604 of 2004 by filing affidavit-in-opposition denying all the material statements made in the writ petition. The case of the Metro Makers, in short, is that BELA, the writ-petitioner has no <em>locus standi</em> to file the instant writ petition as the RAJUK is already involved in a legal proceeding with Metro Makers in Writ Petition No.5130 of 2003 arising out of the same set of facts. The instant writ petition involves highly disputed questions of facts which cannot be decided in a writ petition. The affidavit in the writ petition was sworn in by one Syeda Rezwana Hasan by giving her false identity as a member of the Executive Committee of BELA, as would be revealed from the list of members of the Executive Committee of BELA supplied from the office of the Registrar of the Joint Stock Companies dated 25.11.2004. The writ petition is evidently barred by the principle of ‘alternative remedy’ as is provided by section 8 of the Ain, 2000 wherein the remedy for the grievance of the writ petitioner lies. Metro Maker’s  project is a legal one with the aim to help the country to solve its housing problems to a limited extent. The project area of Metro Makers is not at all in a Sub-Flood Flow or Flood Flow Zone near Aminbazar and the allegation of BELA is imaginary and speculative. Rather in the Master Plan SPZ 17 Savar area is described at page No.76 of DMDP volume II as, “Savar is a largely Flood Free Zone connected with Dhaka by Dhaka Aricha Road.” Metro Makers started the project in the area of the Flood Free Zone of SPZ 17 with due permission from the RAJUK wherein substantial part of the said project was completed long ago. By this time nearly 3500 buyers by dint of bainanama deeds from different classes of the society have invested their hard earned money in this project, out of these plots (3500), 300 plots have already been sold to different buyers by executing registered sale deeds. They are the third party buyers being <em>bona fide </em>purchasers for value; most of whom are middle class people and have invested their hard earned savings and are already in possession thereof. Furthermore, the ongoing Develo-pment Project was duly approved by the RAJUK after close scrutiny of paper and the disputed area is a Flood Free Zone both in fact and in law (as per gazetted Master Plan for Savar area). Metro Makers started the project with a proper and valid Development Permit bearing No. ivRDK/ btct /6Ð161/643Ð¯’vt ZvwiLt 29/07/95 Bs from the RAJUK upon an application dated 15.11.1994 for starting housing project. The RAJUK has already issued Development Permit in favour of the appellant without canceling or rescinding the permit of Metro Makers and as such they are estopped from hindering the development work. Being aggrieved by two letters and hindrance by RAJUK at the behest of rival interested quarter Metro Makers already filed another Writ Petition No.5103 of 2003 as stated before. The Development Permit of Metro Makers stands valid and the subsequent letters by the RAJUK issued without any facts or basis whatsoever, tailored by interested quarters are matters of no relevance to the project. Metro Makers initiated the said Housing Project with the prior permit of RAJUK.     <br/>The affidavits-in-opposition of added respondent Nos.8-52 (hereinafter referred to as third party purchasers) are based almost on the same statements of law and facts as relied on by the Metro Makers and include the followings :</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align:justify">The DMDP VOl.II gazetted on 04.08.1997 at page 75.76 depicted the land of the Modhumoti Model Town located in the Flood Free Zone,i.e. the SPZ 17.1.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The Savar Area Master Plan gazetted on 27.02.1997 and page 76of the Dhaka Metropolitan Master Plan clearly depicted the area of the housing project, namely, “Modhumoti Model Town” as Housing and Ancillary Zone and Flood Free Zone respectively.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The writ petition is evidently barred by the principles of alternative remedy.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The two letters dated 10.03.2002 and 29.07.2003 were issued from the office of the RAJUK as mala fide move at the behest of the rival business quarter of Metro Makers and RAJUK issued those two letters ignoring the provisions laid down in Savar Master Plan.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Before purchasing plots from Metro Makers, the purchasers confirmed that Metro Makers started the project with a proper and valid Development Permit being No. ivRDK/btct/ 6Ð161/ 643Ð¯’vt ZvwiLt 29/07/95 Bs from the RAJUK at least seven years before the issuance of the letters dated 10.03.2002 and 27.07.2003.</li><li style="text-align:justify">3500 low income families purchased land for building their houses in the housing project of Metro Makers.</li><li style="text-align:justify">These purchasers are <em>bona fide</em> purchasers for value.        </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The learned Judges of the High Court Division upon hearing parties by judgment and order dated 27.07.2005 made the Rule absolute in part in Writ Petition No.4604 of 2004 and discharged the Rule issued in Writ Petition No.5103 of 2003.<br/> <br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order dated 27.07.2005 passed by the High Court Division, BELA as leave petitioner filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1085 of 2006 and obtained leave on 19.03.2009 resulting in Civil Appeal No.253 of 2009. Metro Makers filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.958 of 2006 against the judgment and order passed in Writ Petition No.4604 of 2004 and obtained leave on 19.03.2009 resulting in Civil Appeal No.256 of 2009. Metro Makers also filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.957 of 2006 against the judgment and order passed in Writ Petition No.5103 of 2003 and obtained leave resulting in Civil Appeal No.255 of 2006. Forty-four third party purchasers filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1080 of 2006 against the judgment and order passed in Writ Petition No.4604 of 2004 and obtained leave resulting in Civil Appeal No.254 of 2009. <br/> <br/>Mr. Ajmalul Hussain, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. referring to section 74(2) of the Town Improvement Act,1953 submitted that the expression “any specific provision of the existing Master Plan” limits the extent of amendment or alteration of the Master Plan which, accordingly, cannot be totally replaced in exercise of the power conferred by section 74(2) of that Act and as such, the new Master Plan replacing the old Master Plan is unauthorized and void so that limitation on land use imposed by the new Master Plan is not enforceable. He has further argued that Metro Makers started developing the land in question in the 1990s which is before publication of the bar to land use in respect of the wetlands in question. Referring to Memo dated 29.07.1995 (Annexure-X-1), he has submitted that Metro Makers developed the wetlands after obtaining permission of the RAJUK on 29.07.1995. Alternatively, he has argued that there is no requirement of “prior permission” and Metro Makers may obtain post facto approval. Lending support to the third party purchasers, he has submitted that they are <em>bona fide</em> purchasers who are entitled to protect their interest in the wetlands.<br/> <br/>Mr. Rafique-ul-Huq, Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud and Mr. Abdul Matin Khasru, learned Senior Advocates appearing on behalf of the third party purchasers of the wetlands in question, pressed in aid the concept of <em>bona fide</em> purchasers for value without notice as regard limitations on the land use and also sought to enforce the fundamental right under Article 42 of the Constitution and submitted that Metro Makers misrepresented to the purchasers that the project was authorized by RAJUK according to Annexure-X-1 and in any event the purchasers are entitled to protect their investment.      <br/> <br/>On the other hand, Mr. Mahmudul Islam, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the BELA has submitted that the expression “any” appearing in section 74 of the Town Improvement Act is a multi-faceted word and carries different meaning in different contexts and in the context of section 74, it means all and the new Master Plan is intra-vires. He has further submitted that the High Court Division was wrong in not holding that the memo dated 29.07.1995 (Annexure-X-1) is a forgery inasmuch as even an author of a document in terms of section 464 of the Penal Code may be guilty of forgery if he alters the documents in material part after it has been made or executed. He has further submitted that the wetlands of Bilamalia and Bailarpur are Sub-flood Flow Zones which cannot be filled up for housing and that too without permission of RAJUK and that these lands are also Prakritik Jaladhar within the meaning of Act 36 of 2000 and its character as Prakritik Jaladhar cannot be changed without permission of the Government sought through RAJUK and Metro Makers violated the provision of section 5 of Act 36 of 2000. He then has submitted that keeping these wetlands is critical for protection of the environment of Dhaka City and RAJUK should be compelled to take appropriate action against Metro Makers. As regards, the claim of third parties being <em>bona fide</em> purchasers for value without notice, he  has argued that the concept of <em>bona fide</em> transferees has no application outside realm of contract and cannot be applied to overcome any statutory bar; ignorance of law is no excuse and at any rate, the third party purchasers are not, on the facts and the circumstances of the case, <em>bona fide</em> purchasers for value without notice of the bar. He has further argued that the third parties cannot claim fundamental right to hold properties to defy any statutory provision and in any event they cannot seek to enforce their alleged right to the property in derogation of the right to life free from depredation to the millions of residents of Dhaka City. He has finally submitted that direction should be given for restoration of the wetlands in question and direction may be given to Metro Makers to compensate the third party purchasers.<br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates, the impugned judgm-ent, the leave granting order and the papers annexed to the paper-book.<br/> <br/>To begin with, it is necessary to go through grounds on which leave was granted.<br/> <br/>In Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal Nos.957 and 958 of 2006 filed by Metro Makers and Developers Ltd., leave was granted on the following grounds:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"> <br/><strong>“(1) </strong>The learned Judges of the High Court Division while deciding the question of discrimination by RAJUK in not approving the layout plan of the petitioner on the alleged ground that the project area is within the flood flow Zone under the Master Plan of Savar area failed to consider the admitted broad facts that although RAJUK allowed the other developer, namely, East West Property Ltd. to convert its project’s area into Housing and Ancillary Zone though the same was within the Flood Flow Zone and also the action of BELA in singling out the petitioner’s project as being implemented in violation of the so-called provisions of the Town Impro-vement Act,1953 as well as Jaladhar Ain,2000 vis-a-vis the provisions of Articles 27 and 30 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangla-desh in its proper perspective with reference to the attending facts and circumstances of the case as stated in the affidavit-in-opposition and the supplementary affidavits filed by this petitioner, the learned Judges of the High Court Division also treated the question of discrimination in a causal manner though was very pertinent and thus fell an error in passing the impugned judgment and order and, as such, the same needs interference by this Court.<br/><br/><strong>(2).</strong> In view of the own finding of the learned Judges of he High Court Division to the effect that the permission vide Annexure-X(1) issued under the signature of Mr. Zakir Hossain, the town planner of RAJUK was not a forged document and the consistent case of respondent No.7 (petitioner) being that it started its Housing Project under the name and style, ‘Modhumoti Mode Town’ in 1990 and the further fact that there are other developers in the area who have been allowed to deviate to establish their own Housing Project particularly the East West Property Limited and respondent No.7 was approaching RAJUK again and again with the reasonable expectation that it being a statutory organization would not behave discriminately in approving its lay out plan to develop the project and by the time Writ Petition was filed the respondent invested more than taka 200 crores, but the learned Judges of the High Court Division failed to consider these apparent factual aspects and of the case vis-a-vis the concept of reasonable expectation and thus erred in law in ignoring a public document (Annexure-X-1) issued by a public functionary in his official capacity and which document and had not been revoked or rescinded and decided in a disputed question of fact in passing the impugned judgment and order and, as such, the same is liable to be interfered with.<br/><br/><strong>(3).</strong> The question as raised by the writ-petitioner as to whether respondent No.7 was filing the land for its project Modhumoti in violation of Section 8 (2) of Jaladhar Ain, 2000 and the Town Improv-ement Act,1953 very much involved the disputed question of facts as respondent No.7 categorically asserted that the land involved in the Housing Project, namely, Modhumoti Model Town at Mouza Bilamalia and Boliarpur is not within the Flood Flow Zone and for that matter it filed two conclusive reports given by two very renowned and prestigious organiz-ation, namely, BRTC of BUET and SPARSO, it no more remained only a question of interpre-tation of law as has been found by the learned Judges of the High Court Division to the effect ;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>“We do not find substance in the argument of Mr. Rokuddin Mahmud and Mr. Ajmalul Hossain, Q.C, as to the non maintainability of Writ Petition No.4604 of 2004 in as much as the Writ Petition No.4604 of 2004 does not involve any disputed question of facts since the pertinent question to be decided whether any violation of provision of different laws have occurred in admitted filling earth within the zone earmarked in the DMDP as SPL-17 which is classified as Sub-flood Zone in the DMDP.”</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>(4).</strong> Admittedly the Town Improve-ment Act, 1953 as well as Jaladhar Ain, 2000 have provided provisions for taking into task the offender of such law and RAJUK having taking steps under the said laws the writ petitioner had not cause of action to bring the writ petition for the reliefs as prayed for in the name of so-called public interest litigation; in this regard the learned Judges of the High Court Division wrongly relied upon the case of Khandakar Mahbu-buddin Ahmed Vs. State reported in 49 DLR (AD) 132 and thus fell into an error to hold that the criminal case lodged under Section 8 of Jaladhar Ain, 2000 cannot be treated as efficacious remedy against grant of mandamus and thereby finding the writ petition maintainable.<br/><br/><strong>(5).</strong> The learned Judges of the High Court Division misread and miscons-trued the provisions of sections 73 and 74 of the Town Improvement Act,1953 vis-a-vis the notification dated 3<sup>rd</sup> April,1997 and 3<sup>rd</sup> August,1997 in considering the point raised on behalf of the respondent-petitioner that the DMDP did not reach it finality thus it could not be said the petitioner’s project is actually in the Sub-Flood Flow Zone and the same is being implemented in violation of the provisions of section 75 of the said Act and Jaladhar Ain, 2000 and thus erred in law in holding that the project in question is being implemented illegally in the Flood Flow Zone and, as such, the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/><strong>(6)</strong> The questions involved in this Writ Petition are of great public importance and the same needs to be settled down finally by this Court by way of giving leave from the impugned judgment and order”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1080 of 2006 filed by Anser Uddin Ahmed and others (third party purchasers), leave was granted on the following grounds:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>“(1).</strong> From the Writ Petition itself and also from the affidavit filed by RAJUK it is apparent that section 75 of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 as amended up to date permits deviation of the use of the land as specified in the Master Plan subject to approval by the RAJUK and in fact in the case of East West Property Development (Pvt.) Ltd., another developer such deviation has been allowed by RAJUK clearly shows that so-called environmental hazard as alleged to be created by respondent No.8 (in this leave-petition) compa-ny’s project is not an unimpeachable one, therefore, there cannot be any public interest litigation for violation of any such deviation allegedly made by the respondent No.8 company and, as such, the writ petitioner had neither any cause of action nor any locus standi to file the writ petition as a public interest litigation, the High Court Division erred in law in entertaining the writ petition and then making the Rule absolute in part declaring the Housing Project of the respondent No.8 company to have been implemented un authorizedly, the impugned judgment and order is liable to be interfered with.<br/><br/><strong>(2).</strong> The learned Judges of the High Court Division while deciding the question of discrimination by RAJUK in not approving the layout plan of the respondent company on the alleged ground that the project area is within the Flood Flow Zone under the Master Plan of Savar area failed to consider the admitted broad facts that although RAJUK allowed the other developer, namely, East West Property Develo-pment (Pvt.) Ltd. to convert its project’s area into Housing an Ancillary Zone though the same was within the flood flow zone and also the action of BELA in singling out the instant housing project as being implemented in violation of the so-called provisions of the Town Improve-ment Act,1953 as well as Jaladhar Ain, 2000 vis-a-vis the provisions of Articles 27 and 30 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh in its proper perspective with reference to the attending facts and circumstances of the case as stated in the affidavit-in-opposition and the supplementary affidavits filed by the respondent company as well as added respondents, the learned Judges of the High Court Division also treated the question of discrimination in a casual manner though was very pertinent and thus fell into an error in passing the impugned judgment and order and, as such, the same needs interference by this Division.<br/><br/><strong>(3).</strong> That save and except the legal bar as imposed by Section 75 of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 and the warning notice as published by RAJUK in the daily news papers on 23.07.2002 the writ petitioner failed to produce or file a single scrap of paper to show that the project in question of respondent No.8 company created any environm-ental hazard for Dhaka City or the area under Savar Police Station as earmarked in the Dhaka Metropolitan Master Plan (DMDP-1995-2015), or any one from the area, that is, Mouza Bilamalia and Boliarpur made any complaint to any authority, whereas, the respondent No.8 company submitted two study reports one from BRTC of BUET and the other from SPARSO which clearly substantiated its claim that the project in question shall not in any way obstruct the flood flow in the area in question, therefore, would not create no health hazard, thus no public interest was involved to bring the writ petition by the writ petitioner BELA, but unfortunately the learned Judges of the High Court Division failed to consider those two reports in coming to the findings that the petitioner’s project shall create envir-onmental hazard and such non consideration has occasioned failure of justice in passing impugned judgment and order.<br/><br/><strong>(4).</strong> In the Writ Petition the writ petitioner totally failed to show that because of the project in question a bulk section of people or a comm-unity of people suffered and were being affected, whereas, admittedly more than 3534 persons including the present added respondent petitioners who already purchased the plots from the project in question clearly from a bulk group of people or class of people who shall be deprived to have their place of shelter in case the project of respondent No.8 company is abandoned or cancelled thus public interest is definitely in favour of respondent No.8’s project, namely, Modhumoti Model Town as well as its plot purchasers and not in favour of the writ petitioner but unfortun-ately the learned Judges of the High Court Division were moved by the so-called catchy concept of protection of environmental hazard in the project area and thus erred in law in entertaining the writ petition and then deciding the same against respondent company and its housing project and, as such, the impugned judgment and order calls for interference by this Division.”    </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1085 of 2006 filed by Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers’ Association (BELA), leave was granted on the following grounds:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>“(1).</strong> The High Court Division erred in holding that the added respondents are bona fide third party purchasers for value and their interest need to be protected.<br/><br/><strong>(2).</strong> The learned Judges of the High Court Division failed to appreciate that the said project of respondent No.1 was being implemented in violation of the mandatory legal provisions of the Town Improvement Act,1953 and has been undertaken by respondent No.1 disregarding and abandoning the Master Plan prepared by respondent No.50 under the Town Improvement Act,1953.<br/><br/><strong>(3).</strong> That the High Court Division failed to appreciate that the continu-ation of the illegal and unauthorized implementation of the project in the name of “Modhumoti Model Town” by respondent No.1 defying all the lawful instructions and directions of respon-dent No.50 have resulted in conseque-nces detrimental to the legal and constitutional rights of the petitioner and the city dwellers thus violating the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 31 and 32 of the Constitution.<br/><br/><strong>(4).</strong> The High Court Division failed to appreciate that the said project of respondent No.1 was being implem-ented in violation of the provisions of Act No.36 of 2000 and that the same had no authorization of respondent No.47.<br/><br/><strong>(5).</strong> That the decision of the learned High Court Division in favour of the rights of the purchasers will have the effect of shielding the illegal and fraudulent activities of respondent No.1 and thus negate the constitutional and legal sanctions and undermine rule of law and public interest.”<br/>The questions to be resolved in these appeals will be considered <em>seriatim</em>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>Whether the housing project, namely ‘Modhumoti Model Town’ within Sub-Flood Flow Zone of DMDP is permissible ?</strong> Dhaka Improvement Trust Act, 1953 (in short, the Act) came into effect on 15.05.1953. Erstwhile Dhaka Improvement Trust (in short, DIT) was formed under the provision of section 4 of the Town Improvement Act, 1953. Under section 73 of the Act, DIT was empowered to prepare master plan for Dhaka and the first master plan for Dhaka was prepared in August, 1958. On 01.02.1979, this master plan was reappraised without any change or amendment. On 30.04.1987, by a gazette notification, Town Improvement Act, 1953 has been amended and the Board of Trustees of the DIT has been substituted by Rajdhani Unnayan Katripakhya. On 01.09.1987, Savar Upazilla has been brought within the operational area of RAJUK. On 28.12.1996, the Government published in the official gazette a separate master plan for Savar area (Annexure-X-3 to the affidavit-in-opposition filed by Metro Makers and Developers Limited in Writ Petition No.4604 of 2004).

After publication of this master plan of Savar area, at the behest of the Government, RAJUK prepared Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan with the inclusion of Savar and its parts I and II have been notified in the gazette on 03.08.1997. The third part of DMDP has not yet been prepared and step has only been taken for preparation thereof. The chronological facts transpired that the first Dhaka Master Plan prepared in August,1958 was effective in 1990 under which Savar was included on 01.09.1987. Metro Makers and Developers Limited was incorporated on 28.05.1990 and according to it, the project ‘Modhumoti Model Town’ commenced on and from 28.06.1990. On 28.12.1986 separate Savar Master Plan (annexure-X-3) came into effect and the same provided for obtaining from RAJUK in the following terms :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“এই বিজ্ঞপ্তি প্রকাশের পর হইতে এই মাষ্টার প্ল্যানের অন্তর্ভূক্ত এলাকায় যে কোন ধরনের উন্নয়ন ও নির্মান কাজ এই মাষ্টার প্ল্যান অনুসারে এবং যথাযথ কর্তৃপক্ষের অনুমোদন ক্রমে সম্পন্ন করিতে হইবে।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>When the Savar Master Plan came into effect it was incumbent upon the Metro Makers and Developers Limited to obtain permission under the provision of Savar Master Plan if the area is being used in derogation of the purpose earmarked in the master plan.<br/> <br/>In this connection, it is necessary to quote section 75 of the Act as under :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“75.(1) If any person desires to use any land for any purpose other than that laid down in the Master Plan approved under sub-section (5) of section 73, he may apply in writing to the Chairman for permission so to do.<br/>(2) If the Chairman refuses permission to any person, such person may, within sixty days of the Chairman’s refusal, appeal to the Katripakhya against such refusal.<br/>(3) The decision of the Katripakhya on any appeal under sub-section (2) shall be final. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Admittedly, Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. did not obtain any permission from RAJUK under the provision of Savar Master Plan but relying upon Annexure-X-1 dated 29.07.1995 appended to the affidavit-in-opposition filed by Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. in Writ Petition No.4604 of 2004 described the same as development permit. What is remarkable is that nothing was stated about the develo-pment permit in Writ Petition No.5103 of 2003. Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. claimed that the said development permit was issued in pursuance of their application submitted to RAJUK on 15.11.1994 (Annexure-X-II to Writ Petition No.4604 of 2009).

Pursuant to this prayer, RAJUK under the signature of Town Planner (Director) sent a letter dated 29.07.1995 addressed to the Project Coordinator of DMDP requesting him to include ‘Modhumoti Project in the DMDP. What is surprising is that the lower portion of Annexure-X-1 contained a paragraph alleged to have accorded a development permit to ‘Modhumoti Model Town’ in the following language:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">অনুলিপিঃ<br/>এ, এফ, এম, জাহাঙ্গীর, পরিচালক, মেট্রো মেকার্স এন্ড ডেভেলপারস লিঃ, ইহা তাদের পত্র নং-মেট্রো/আঃ/প্রঃ/ রাজউক তারিখ ১৫/১১/১৯৯৪ ইং এর প্রেক্ষিতে প্রস্তাবিত আমিন বাজারস্থ ঢাকা আরিচা সড়কের দক্ষিন পাশের্বর বিলামালিয়া মৌজার জে, এল নং-৭৪১-এ একটি আধুনিক ও পরিকল্পিত আবাসিক প্রকল্প বাস্তবায়নের জন্য তাহাদের কোম্পানী কর্তৃক এুয়কৃত সম্পওিতে ভূমি উন্নয়ন করার অনুমুতি দেয়া গেল। ইহা মেট্রো মেকার্স এন্ড ডেভেলপারস লিঃ কর্তৃক দাখিলকৃত প্রকল্পটির বাস্তবায়নের জন্য “Development permit” হিসাবে গন্য হবে।<br/><br/>         স্বাক্ষর অস্পষ্ট<br/>        (জাকির হোসেন)<br/>নগর পরিকল্পনাবিদ (পরিচালক)<br/>রাজধানী উন্নয়ন কর্তৃপক্ষ, ঢাকা।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>By filing a supplementary affidavit, BELA alleged that this portion of Annexure-X-1 was an act of forgery on the part of ‘Modhumoti Model Town’. The impugned judgment shows that the High Court Division called for the records of RAJUK for the purpose of ascertaining the genuineness of Annexure-X-1. Having gone though the file, the High Court Division found that a copy of Annexure-X-1 was retained in the file but that did not contain the paragraph alleged to have indicated according of development permit. The copy kept in the record contained the signature of Jakir Hossain, Town Planner (Director) just after furnishing of the main contents of the letter. Therefore, the High Court Division came to a finding that the issuer of the letter included this portion in Annexure-X-1. The High Court Division, however, surprisingly held that the allegation of forgery on the part of ‘Modhumoti Model Town’ in the inclusion of that part in Annexure-X-1 had no basis.<br/> <br/>This finding as to the forgery by Metro Makers and Developers is erroneous. Admit-tedly, Savar has been included within the operational area of RAJUK on 01.09.1987 and within the knowledge of Metro Makers which had the knowledge of ongoing prep-aration of DMDP. Therefore, Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. made an application to RAJUK on 15.11.1994 (Annexure-X-2) for inclusion of its ‘Modhumoti Model Town’ within DMDP. Subsequently, Annexure-X-1 dated 29.07.1995 alleged to have been issued and sent by Zakir Hossain, Town Planner (Director) to Shawkat Ali Khan, Chief Town Planer/LPO contained at its bottom the so-called development permit. This is a glaring act of forgery because the copy preserved in the original file did not contain the portion of development permit. Admittedly, Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. is the beneficiary of the so-called development permit. It has even dared to use such a forged letter before the highest Court of the country to suit its purpose. Therefore, it cannot escape from the legal consequences for using such forged letter as evidence before the Court. In addition to above, section 75 of the Town Improvement Act deals with permission and provides that the Chairman, RAJUK is empowered to accord such permission and on his refusal the Katripakhya may accord such permission on appeal. Given such provision, it appears that exercise of according permission under section 75 is initially entrusted with the Chairman of RAJUK and then with the Katripakhya in appeal and without specific delegation of such function, no officer of RAJUK is empowered to exercise such function. The High Court Division observed that Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. failed to satisfy about such lawful delegation by the Chairman, RAJUK and that Annedure-X-1 alleged to have accorded development permit by Town Planner (Director) of  RAJUK was not a permit at all in the eye of law.<br/> <br/>Mr. Ajmalul Hussain, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the appellant Metro Makers and Developers Ltd., submits that section 74(2) of the Town Improvement Act,1953 permits permitted amendment or alteration of any specific provision of the existing Master Plan and not the substitution or repeal of the then existing Master Plan by the notification dated 03.08.1997 which is ultra vires under section 74(2) of the Town Improvement Act. He further submits that the Legislature in its wisdom has put the definite article ‘the’ before the Master Plan and as such, it could not be substituted by a new Master Plan.<br/> <br/>The expression “any” has wide range of meaning which varies in different contexts and it can mean ‘some’ or ‘all’. In this connection, reliance may be made on <strong>Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases 7<sup>th</sup> Edition, volume 1,</strong> <strong>page-141</strong> and <strong>Black’s Dictionary, 6<sup>th</sup> Edition, page-94</strong>. What is important to note here is that section 74(2) of the Town Improvement Act is an enabling provision regarding amendment or alteration and it does not take away the power of a statutory authority to rescind any delegated legislation including notification conferred by section 21 of the General Clauses Act,1897. Had the Legislature intended to take away the power to rescind conferred by the General Clauses Act, the Legislature was required to use a clear language which is missing in section 74(2) of the Town Improvement Act. Jurisdiction expressly conferred by a statute cannot be extinguished by implication from any expression used in a subsequent statute, much less by an enabling provision in a later statute. The use of expression ‘specific’ does not make any differences as a matter of law.<br/> <br/>Even if the Master Plan of 1997 is held ultra vires under section 74(2) of the Town Improvement Act, it does not allow the Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. to proceed with the development works without permission of RAJUK/Government because with the demise of new Master Plan, the notification dated 28.12.1996 requiring permission of RAJUK would  surface as an existing provision having the force of law. After coming into force of Rjvavi AvBb, 2000 on 05.02.2001 permission of the Gover-nment is also necessary for conversion of lands of ‘Bilamalia’ and ‘Bailampur’ to housing plots of a township.<br/> <br/>DMDP part-I and II have been prepared and taken its finality under the mandate of section 73 of the Town Improvement Act,1953 and also under the procedure formulated in section 74 of the Act. Both the provisions are quoted below :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“73.(1) As soon as may be after the provisions of Act comes into force, the Katripakhya shall prepare a Master Plan for the area within its jurisdiction indicating the manner in which it proposes that land should be used (whether by carrying out thereon of development or otherwise) and the stages by which any such development should be carried out.<br/>(2) The Master Plan shall include such maps and such descriptive matter as may be necessary to illustrate the proposals aforesaid with such degree of particularity as may be appropriate, between different parts of the area, and any such plan may, in particular, define the sites of proposed roads, public and other open buildings and works, or fields, parks, play grounds and other open spaces or allocate areas of land for use for agricultural, residential, industrial or other purposes of any class specified in the Master Plan.<br/>(3) The Government shall, within one month from the receipt of the Master Plan from the Katripakhya, publish the same in the Official Gazette.<br/>(4) Any person objecting to the plan or part thereof shall file objection with the Government within sixty days from the date of the publication of the plan.<br/>(5) The Government after considering the objections that may be filed, shall approve the Master Plan within four months from the date of publication either with or without modification.”<br/><br/>“74.(1) When the Government approves the Master Plan submitted under section 73, it shall announce the fact by notification and the publication of such notification shall be conclusive evidence that the Master Plan has been duly made and approved, and thereafter it shall be unlawful for any person to use any land for any purposes other than that laid down in the Master Plan, unless he has been permitted to do so under section 75.<br/>(2) The Katripakhya may, from time to time, with the approval of the Government and the Government may at any time amend or alter any specific provision of the Master Plan. Any such amendment or alteration shall be published in the Official Gazette.<br/>(3) All future developments and construction, both public and private, shall be in conformity with the Master Plan or with the amendment thereof.<br/>(4) The Master Plan, or an amendment thereof, shall neither before nor after it has been approved, be questioned in any legal proceedings whatsoever and shall become operative on the day it is approved by the Gover-nment and published in the Official Gazette.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Within the Master Plan, Flood Flow Zone has been divided into two parts and different control mechanism for land use has been prescribed for each of them and proposed control as follows :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>“Main Flood Flow Zone </strong><br/>Land development for residential, commercial and industrial development, including raising the level of land, via land filling, will be strictly prohibited.<br/>Permitted uses, provided that they cause no adverse hydraulic effect will be:<br/>*agriculture;<br/>*dry season recreation facilities;<br/>* ferry terminal; and<br/>*excavation of mineral deposits, including dry season brick works.<br/>Causeways for roads or railways will be permitted, subject to detailed geolo-gical surveys being undertaken and on condition that they are built with culverts sufficient to allow for unimpeded flood flow.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears from the above, that in the main flood flow zone, land development for residential and others via land filling is strictly prohibited.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Land use control mechanism in Sub-Flood Flow Zone</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>DMDP Structure Plan provides the following in relation to sub-flood flow Zone:<br/> <br/><u><strong>Sub-Flood Flow Zone</strong></u><br/>Development compatible with the rural nature of these mainly rice growing areas, will be permitted on condition that the:<br/>*    structures are built on stilts, or on land raised above design flood water level;<br/>*    alignment for structures and raised land to be designed so as not to disturb flood flow.<br/>Implementing Agency: RAJUK, BWDB.<br/> <br/><strong>NB</strong> : Ideally a Dhaka Metropolitan River Conservancy Board, linked closely to BWDB, would be established to execute such controls and enforcement procedures within the flood plains of the metro region.” (Ref: DMDP. Vol.1, Page-53).   <br/> <br/>From the foregoing discussion, it transp-ired that development within Sub-Flood Flow Zone is not barred and that structure may be built on stilts or on land raised above design flood flow water or alignment of structure and raised land is to be designed so as not to disturb flood flow provided that all development must be compatible with the rural nature of the rice growing areas. After final gazette notification of DMDP dated 03.08.1997 Metro Makers and Developers Ltd. was required to apply for such permission but failed to do so and continued with the development work which became unauth-orized under the provision of DMDP and section 74 of the Town Improvement Act,1953. Therefore, Madhumoti Model Town is an unauthorized project and Metro Makers has been continuing with their activities in violation of section 75 of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 and the DMDP prepared under the Act.<br/> <br/>It is contended that the Madhumoti Project of Metro Makers was lawful prior to its registration and remains so after registration according to the provision of Rule 4(2)(1)of the বেসরকারী আবাসিক প্রকল্পের ভূমি উন্নয়ন বিধিমালা ২০০৪। Admittedly, Madhumoti Model Town falls within sub-flood flow zones of the DMDP which was prepared according to the provision of section 73 of Town Improvement Act. Establishment of a Model Town within sub-flood flow zone goes against the spirit of such zone and as such is not at all permissible. Neither RAJUK nor the Government has  the authority to give permission to change the very nature of sub-flood flow zone. Metro Makers has been trying to take advantage of বেসরকারী আবাসিক প্রকল্পের ভূমি উন্নয়ন বিধিমালা, ২০০৪ on the plea that if any project gets registration, such registration shows acceptance by RAJUK that project is an ongoing project within the area of the Master Plan and that its land is recommended as being suitable for development. The Rules of 2004 do not have overriding effect over the parent law under which the Rules were prepared. There is no scope for establishment of a Model Town within sub-flood flow zone violating the DMDP prepared under the Town Improvement Act. Even the Rules of 2004 do not approve of establishing a Model Town changing the very nature of sub-flood flow zone. In this connection, it is pertinent to quote clauses <strong>‘</strong>চ<strong>"</strong> and  <strong>‘</strong>জ<strong>"</strong> of Rule 6 and under :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(চ) প্রকল্প এলাকায় কোন খাল, বিল, নদী, নালা বা অন্য কোন জলাশয় থাকিলে উহার পানি প্রবাহে বিঘ্ন সৃষ্টি না করিয়া প্রবাহিত পানি যাহাতে প্রকল্পের শেষ প্রান্ত হইয়া ক্ষেত্রমত খাল, বিল, নদী, নালা বা জলাধার পর্যন্ত প্রবাহিত হইতে পারে, উহা নিশ্চিতকরন ;<br/>(জ) প্রকল্প বাস্তবায়নের সময় পাশববর্তী এলাকায় যাহাতে কোন ধরনের জলাবদ্ধতা সৃষ্টি বা পরিবেশের ভারসাম্য নষ্ট হয় উহা নিশ্চিতকরণ;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Establishment of a model town within sub-flood flow zone involves raising huge quantity of land in that zone resulting in its depletion. Consequently, the adjoining area of the sub-flood flow zone, namely, main Dhaka City will be inundated by water logging and the natural environmental balance will be in jeopardy.<br/> <br/><strong>Whether permission of RAJUK to undertake development work was necessary and whether Metro obtained the permission ?</strong> The two mouzas, namely, Bilamalia and Boliarpur, where Metro Makers wants to establish Madhumoti Model Town have been identified in the new Master Plan as sub-Flood Flow Zone included in a Special Plan Zone 17(3)(SPZ 173). With reference to the provision of 5.2.3 at page 16 of Part 3 of vol.2 of the new Master Plan, it is contended on behalf of Metro Makers  that development of the land for housing in the two relevant mouzas is permissible with the permission of RAJUK and Metro Makers having started the development work after incorporation in 1990 and before the requirement of permission was introduced RAJUK should legitimately accord that permission and, in fact, Metro Makers obtained that permission.<br/> <br/>Metro Makers could not produce any evidence to substantiate that it started developing the lands purchased in the two mouzas in question since 1990. On the contrary, the documents annexed reveal that on 20.05.2001, Metro Makers first advertised for sale of plots and started selling plots on and from 21.11.2001 and alleged to have sold 491 plots up to 30.06.2005. The lists do not disclose whether the plots were develo-ped plots. Nevertheless, several registered deeds of sale have been produced which can be seen at pages 988 to 1052 of paper-book No.IV. Curiously enough, the dates of execution of these deeds of sale have been kept blank, but registration coupons indicate the date of registration. A reading of these deeds of sale shows that from March,2002 onwards “proposed plots” were sought to be sold and the lands sold were “Boro Nal lands”. If developed plots were being sold, the lands so sold would not be described as “Boro Nal lands” and the lands sold would definitely carry the plot number of the developed plots. It is contended that the new Master Plan does not require ‘prior permission’ so that the permis-sion may be obtained at a later stage. The new Master Plan does not all contemplate establishment of a modern housing project like Madhumati Model Town in the Sub-Flood Flow Zone so that the question of giving permission to set up Madhumati Model Town does not arise at all. There is no gainsaying the fact that in the new Master Plan the category of development subject to permission includes dwelling house. What is important to note here is that a document has to be read as a whole to understand its true purport. The main focus of the new Master Plan and of Jaladhar Ain is preservation of drainage of rain and flood water in the Dhaka Mahanagary. Bilamalia and Boliarpur have been identified as part of SPZ 17³ as is evident from the map opposite to page 32 of volume 1 of the new Master Plan and page XXVIII of the Appendix at the end of vol.2 of the new Master Plan. The provision of 5.2.2 at page of part 3 of volume 2 reads as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>“Purpose and intent</strong>: The purpose of the Sub Flood Zone is to generally define areas either temporally or seasonally flooded (flood lands). The intention is to protect the health, safety and welfare of the general people; <u>to reduce negative environmental impacts within natural waterways; and to protect and preserve natural drainage system</u> to ensure their proper and continued functioning.” (emphasis added).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>Whether Madhumati contravenes Jaladhar Ain, 2000 (Act 36 of 200)?</strong> The object of Jaladhar Ain, 2000 is protection of “Prakritik Jaladhar” mainly for the purpose of proper drainage of flood and rain water in Dhaka City. Conversion of “Prakritik Jaladhar” into a housing project is not permissible. The definition of “Prakritik Jaladhar” has been given in clause-<strong>‘</strong><strong>PÕ</strong> of section 2 of the Ain as under : <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(চ) প্রাকৃতিক জলাধারচ অর্থ নদী, খাল,বিল, দীঘি, ঝর্ণা বা জলাশয় হিসাবে মাষ্টার প্লানে চিহ্নিত বা সরকার, স্থানীয় সরকার বা কোন সংস্থা কর্তৃক, <u>সরকারী গেজেটে প্রজ্ঞাপন দ্বারা, বন্যা প্রবাহ এলাকা হিসাবে ঘোষিত কোন জায়গা এবং সলল পানি এবং বৃষ্টির পানি ধারণ করে এমন কোন ভূমি ও ইহার অন্তর্ভূক্ত হইবে;</u> (emphasis supplied)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Having gone through the definition, it appears that Prakritik Jaladhar includes, amongst others, flood flow zone declared by the Government in the gazette notification. Flood flow zone has been categorized into (I) main flood flow zone, (II) sub-flood flow zone. It is contended on behalf of Metro Makers that the definition of Prakritik Jaladhar does not attract sub-flood flow zone. This contention does not stand to reason because flood flow zone is divided into main flood flow zone and sub-flood flow zone. In the definition of “প্রাকৃতিক জলাধার”, the Legislature was very careful in choosing the words, eb¨v cªevn GjvKv and not placing the word ‘প্রধান’ before the words, বন্যা প্রবাহ এলাকা । Therefore, Prakitik Jaladhar shall mean and include not only main flood flow zone but also sub-flood flow zone. Bilamalia and Boliarpur are Prakritik Jaladhar as they are declared in the gazette of new Master Plan as Sub-Flood Flow Zone. Even if the Master Plan is adjudged void, Bilamalia and Boliarpur answer inclusive definition of Prakritik Jaladhar Ain as they are low lands retaining rain water.<br/> <br/>It is contended on behalf of Metro Makers that conversion of zones is also permissible under the Jaladhar Ain,2000. Though conversion of land is permissible, it does not authorize the authority to change the nature and character of the Sub-Flood Flow Zone for establishment of model housing, namely, Madhumati Model Town.<br/> <br/><strong>What would be the position of the third party purchasers who claim to be <em>bona fide</em> purchasers</strong> ? At the very outset, it is important to mention that the third party purchasers are not at all <em>bona fide</em> purchasers without notice. On 25.06.2001, Metro Makers first advertised for sale and the purchasers started purchasing from 21.11.2001. Long before that day, Savar plan and then the new Master Plan came into place restricting land use in the mouzas of Bilamalia and Boliarpur and the Jaladhar Ain,2000 came into operation on and from 05.02.2001. It is needless to mention that every man is presumed to know the legal position. Nothing is <em>bona fide</em> which is not done with due diligence. According to the gazette notification, they were required to make queries to the office of RAJUK whether houses could be built in the lands in question and whether RAJUK had permitted the proposed land use. But third party purchasers did not make any such query. Their stand is that they relied upon the document, Annexure-X(1) which is an act of forgery. The two parts of the said document are incongruous, even then they did not make any inquiry about genuineness of the said document. Therefore, they cannot claim that they are <em>bona fide</em> purchasers without notice of the bar in respect of use of the lands in question and they are not entitled to get what they received from the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>The concept of bona fide purchasers for value without notice is applicable only in respect of transfer of immoveable property and specific performance of contract for transfer of immoveable property and not in respect of use of immoveable property and it is an equitable principle which cannot override the bar placed by any statutory provision. In this connection, it is pertinent to quote the proviso to section 27A of the Specific Relief Act as under :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Provided that nothing in this section shall affect the right of transferee for consideration who has no notice of contract or the part performance thereof.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Similar proviso has also been appended to section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act. Having gone through section 27A of the Specific Relief Act and section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, in general, and the similar proviso appended to both the sections, in particular, it appears that the concept of bona fide purchasers for value without notice cannot be availed of to circumvent the statutory provisions of Town Improvement Act and Jaladhar Ain, 2000.<br/> <br/>In the case of <strong><em>ETV Ltd. Vs. Dr. Chowdhury Mahmood Hasan, 54 DLR (AD)130</em></strong>, it was argued that if the terristerial channel of ETV is closed down for no fault of the foreign companies, they will suffer heavy loss to which this Division answered stating as under :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The third party rights exist and fall with the Ekushey Television, since their interests are merged with that of ETV. The substantive legal principle in this regard is that every person is subject to the ordinary law within the jurisdiction. Therefore, all persons within the jurisdiction of Bangladesh are within Bangladesh rule of law. The foreign investors in ETV are no exception to this principle.”           </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of <strong><em>Sharif Nurul Ambia vs. Dhaka City Corporation, 58 DLD (AD)253</em></strong>, the Government gave to Dhaka City Corporation certain plot for construction of car park earmarked in the Master Plan but the City Corporation constructed shops in the said plot and allotted those shops to shopkeepers taking huge salami. This Division in the attending circumstances refused to recognize the alleged right of <em>bona fide</em> allottees and ordered stoppage of construction and demolition of the existing structure. This Court further held as under :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Accordingly, the construction of multistoried shopping complex by the respondent Nos.1 and 5 in the place reserved as public Car Parking Centre in the Master Plan cannot be allowed despite the stand taken by them that shops have been allocated to 341 persons on acceptance of portion of salami/rent from them by the respondent No.5.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">In the result, the appeal is allowed without any order as to costs. The judgment and order dated 06.02.2000 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.937 of 1995 is hereby set aside. It is declared that the construction of ‘Udayan Market’ undert-aken by the respondent Nos.1 and 5 in the public Car Park Centre as earmarked in the Master Plan (Annexure-B) of respondent No.2 has been undertaken unlawfully, surreptitiously, for collateral purposes, against public interest and without any lawful authority and in violation of the condition of transfer /handing over of the land in question from the respondent No.4 to the respondent No.1. Appropriate action should also be taken by the respondent Nos.1 and 2 to comply the order of this Court within 60 days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. The respondent Nos.1 and 5 are directed to stop construction of the multi-storied building and to demolish the structure, if any, already constructed.” </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>An original owner cannot use the lands of two mouzas, namely, Bilamalia and Boliarpur, contrary to the bar created by the Legislature and his successors and purcha-sers, <em>bona fide </em>or otherwise can not claim a better right than the original owner had.<br/> <br/>Majority of the third party purchasers have not acquired any title to the lands of two mouzas on the basis of their purchase from Metro Makers simply because the purchase of these lands by Metro Makers in excess of the ceiling fixed by P.O.No.98 of 1972 stood forfeited under article 12 of that Order.<br/> <br/>Metro Makers in its written argument submitted before this Division admitted that it is true that those relevant laws are there and that it would be too much to expect from laymen that they should have known the laws. Needless to say, ignorance of law is no excuse. Now they cannot escape the conseq-uences of breach of different provisions of Town Improvement Act and the Jaladhar Ain,2000. <br/> <br/><strong>Whether the fundamental right claimed by the third party purchasers is protected under article 42 of the Constitution</strong> ? The third party purchasers tried to avail of the benefit of article 42 of the Constitution. Let us have a glimpse over sub-article (1) of article 42 of the Consti-tution as under :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“42(1). Subject to any restrictions imposed by law, every citizen shall have the right to acquire, hold, transfer or otherwise dispose of property, and no property shall be compulsory acquired, nationalised or requisitioned save by authority of law.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Article 42 guarantees, subject to any law to the contrary, the right to acquire, hold and transfer any property. Thus this right cannot be claimed overriding any bar or prohibition imposed by law. Therefore, the purchasers cannot claim any right to a land which has come under the mischief of P.O.No.98 of 1972. Equally some of the purchasers who are not adversely affected by the provision of article 12 of P.O.1972 cannot claim any right to purchase the land overriding the restriction imposed by new Master Plan and the Jaladhar Ain. On the other hand, protection of the environment and ecology has been recognized as a component of right to life guaranteed by articles 31 and 32 of the Constitution. In the case <strong><em>Dr. Mohiuddin Faroque Vs. Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Irrigation, Water Resources and Flood Control and others (1997) 49 DLR (AD)01</em>, </strong>it has been held as under :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“It is said that any ecological disaster is an economic disaster. Environment and ecology are now matters of universal concern. The World Commission on Environment and Development in its landmark report, ‘Our Common Future’, made it clear that the environment, natural resources and life support systems of our planet have continued to deteriorate, while global risks like those of climate change and ozone depletion have become more immediate and acute. Yet all the enviro-nmental deterioration and risks we have experienced to date have occurred at levels of population and human activity that are much less than they will be in the period ahead. And the underlying conditions that have produced this dilemma remain as dominant driving forces that are shaping our future and threatening our survival (from Statement by the Secy-Gen., UNCED, at the opening of the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 3 June 1992)”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of <strong><em>Sharif Nurul Ambia (ibid),</em></strong> this Division relied upon the case of Lakshmipathy Vs. Karnataka, AIR 1992 Karnataka 57, a portion of which is as follows :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The right to life inherent in Article 21 of the Constitution does not fall short of the requirements of qualitative life which is possible only in an environment of quality. Where, on account of human agencies, the quality of air and the quality of environment are threatened or affected, the Court would not hesitate to use its innovative power within its epistolary jurisdiction to enforce and safeguard the right to life to promote public interest. Specific guarantees Article 21 unfold penumbras shaped by emanations from those constitutional assurances which help give them life and substance. In the circumstantial context and actual back-drop, judicial intervention is warranted, especially since the Supreme Court of India have already laid the foundation of justice activism in unmistakable language of certainty and deep concern.”   </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The right to life of overwhelming number of residents of Dhaka City cannot be overlooked and the third party purchasers cannot claim any relief <em>dehors</em> the fundamental right of the residents of Dhaka City under articles 31 and 32 of the Constitution. <br/> <br/><strong>Whether Metro Makers has any obligation towards the third party purchasers ?</strong> By publishing advertisements to various national dailies Metro Makers invited people to purchase plots in Modhumati Model Town without disclosing the fact that it has not obtained the required permission from the concerned authority. In respect of filling up the nal lands for the purpose of housing, there is a bar in the new Master Plan and the Jaladhar Ain. The third party purchasers admitted that they were convinced by Annexure-X-1, the so-called permission of RAJUK in respect of development of the lands in question. In this situation, the third party purchasers can not be allowed to construct houses to the serious depredation of environment and ecology. Other means of compensating the loss of the third party purchasers have to be adopted. Metro Makers having led this purchasers through the garden path must be compelled to return the money that they received from the purchasers together with such compensation as may appear to be just and proper. In the case of <strong><em>Manju Bhatia vs. New Delhi Municipal Council,(1997) 6 SCC 370, </em></strong>the defendant sold unauthorizedly constructed flats which were demolished by the Municipal Council, the Court ordered the builder-respondent to pay to each of the flat owners Rs. sixty  lacs in compensation including the amount paid by the flat owners observing, <em>“in the tort liability arising out of contract, equity steps in and tort takes over and imposes liability upon the defendant for unquantified damages for breach of the duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.</em>” Similar view has also been taken in the case of <strong><em>Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra vs. State of U.P.,(1985)2 SCC 431 in para 12 as under:</em></strong><br/> <br/>“The consequence of this Order made by us would be that the lessees of lime stone quarries which have been directed to be closed down permanently under this Order or which maybe directed to be closed down permanently after consider-ation of the Report of the Bandyopadhyay Committee, would be thrown out of business in which they have invested large sums of money and expended considerable time and effort. This would undoubtedly cause hardship to them, but it is a price that has to be paid for protecting and safeguarding the right of the people to live in healthy environment with minimal disturbance of ecological balance and without avoidable hazard to them and to their cattle, homes and agricultural land and undue affection of air, water and environment. However, in order to mitigate their hardship, we would direct the Government of India and the State of Uttar Pradesh that whenever any other area in the State of Uttar Pradesh is thrown open for grant of lime stone or dolomite quarrying, the lessees who are displaced as a result of this order shall be afforded priority in grant of lease shall be given to the lessees who are displaced so that they can apply for grant of lease of such area and on the basis of such application, priority may be given to them subject, of course, to their otherwise being found fit and eligible. We have no doubt that while throwing open new areas for grant of lease for lime stone or dolomite quarrying, the Government of India and the State of Uttar Pradesh will take into account the considerations to which we have adverted in this order.”<br/><br/><strong><em>Whether there is any legal bar to acquiring more than 100 bighs of land under President’s Order (P.O) No.98 of 1972?</em></strong><br/><br/>This issue had been exhaustively argued by both the sides before this Division. This issue was also raised before the High Court Division which, however, failed to give any finding in this regard. This Division is, however, not precluded from addressing the issue on the basis of materials on record. Therefore, we have decided to address this issue. <br/> <br/>P.O.98 of 1972 as amended till date contains restrictions in article 3 (a) and (b) to retain or to acquire any land over the limit, that is, hundred bighas. These restrictions apply equally to a family or to a body.<br/> <br/>In its writ petition, BELA obtained an order of injunction against which Metro Makers filed an application for vacating the interim order and claimed to have purchased 350 acres in the aforesaid two mouzas as is evident at page No.295 of paper-book No.2. In the affidavit-in-opposition to the said application BELA pointed out that because of the ceiling fixed by P.O. No.98 of 1972 no “body” can own more than 100 bighs of land at a given time. At page 33 of its concise statement Metro Makers stated that it bought 550 acres of land in the two mouzas. At the very beginning of the argument in appeal, this issue came into consideration to which the reply of Metro Makers was that Metro was continuously buying and selling the lands so that Metro Makers did not own more than 100 bighas of land at any given time. The reply does not stand scrutiny. What is important to note here is that Metro Makers has not produced any evidence of selling any part of the lands purchased in the two mouzas before 2001. On the contrary, the documents produced by Metro Makers show that Metro Makers for the first time on 25.06.2001 published advertisement in the daily Ittefaq inviting people to purchase plots in Modhumati Model Town. On the other hand, Metro Makers has furnished list of the documents executed and registered by it selling plots in Madhumati Model Town. The list shows that the first deed executed and registered by it is dated 21.11.2001. Therefore, the irresistible conclusion to be reached is that Metro was holding lands much in excess of the ceiling fixed by P.O. No.98 of 1972 and the excess land stands forfeited to the Government under article 12 of P.O.No.98 of 1972 much to the detriment of the project of Metro Makers.<br/> <br/>It is a truism that right to life includes right to protection and improvement of environment and ecology. Even if there could not have been any law imposing restriction relating to the use of the nal lands in the areas in question which operate as reservoir of flood and rain water. If these lands are filled up it will cause serious problem in draining out water resulting from flood and rain and the affected people can compel the authorities through judicial review to take steps to preserve and protect health, environment and ecology in the Metropolitan areas. The fundamental right of the third party purchasers cannot override the fundamental right of overwhelming number of residents of the metropolis under articles 31 and 32 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/>BELA in its writ petition prayed for (I) direction to protect the Sub-Flood Flow Zone of Bilamalia and Bailarpur mouzas within Savar Police Station of Dhaka near Aminbazar from illegal earth filling and (II) declaration that Madhumati Model Town project is unauthorized and in violation of Jaladhar Ain, 2000. The facts and circumstances of the case, the documents placed on record and the law cited and discussed before clearly establish BELA’s contention that Bilamalia and Bailarpur mouzas within Savar Police Station of Dhaka have been treated as Sub-Flood Flow Zones in the Master Plan and there should not be any construction within this zone and that too without the permission of RAJUK and the earth-filling which has taken place in this zone is in violation of the provisions of the Jaladhar Ain,2000. The pleas of Metro Makers that they obtained permission from RAJUK on 29.05.1995 or at any rate there having been no requirement of prior permission, they can still apply for and obtain permission of RAJUK and that the interest of huge number of persons who have <em>bona fide</em> purchased plots developed by them may not be prejudiced cannot stand scrutiny and are untenable. The concept of <em>bona fide</em> purchase without notice has no application outside the realm of contract and cannot be introduced to overcome statutory bar; nothing is <em>bona fide </em>which is not done diligently and the third party purchasers having had the opportunity of verifying facts before purchase and not doing that cannot be taken to be  innocent purchasers. At any rate, they cannot claim protection in derogation of the right of millions of residents of the Dhaka City to have environment free from depredation. Metro Makers having not obtained permission from RAJUK, the High Court Division rightly discharged the Rule in the writ petition of Metro Makers but the High Court Division was not right in making the Rule in BELA’s writ petition absolute in part.<br/> <br/>This Division previously exercised the power of doing complete justice under Article 104 of the Constitution in several cases including the cases of <strong><em>Gannysons Ltd. and another Vs. Sonali Bank and others, (1985)37 DLR (AD)42 and AFM Naziru-uddin Vs. Mrs. Hameeda Banu (1993)45 DLR (AD)38</em></strong>. The subject matter of the instant case not only represents an occasion to, but also demands, exercise of this power by this Division for the avowed purpose of protection of environment. Madhumati Model Town project in Bilamalia and Bailarpur Mouzas is declared unlawful and Metro Makers are directed to restore the wetlands of these two mouzas to its original state within six months from the date of availability of the certified copy of the judgment, failing which, RAJUK is directed to undertake the work of restoration of these wetlands and recover the cost of restoration from Metro Makers and their directors treating the cost as a public demand. Though the third party purchasers may not be treated as <em>bona fide</em>, yet it is a fact that they have been roped in by Metro Makers by misrepresentation that permission for the development work had been obtained from RAJUK and justice demands that they should be compensated. Accordingly, Metro Makers are further directed to refund the purchasers double the amount of the money including the cost of registration of the deeds of sale received by them from the purchasers within six months from the date of availability of the certified copy of the judgment.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, Civil Appeal No.256 of 2009 and Civil Appeal Nos.254-255 of 2009 are dismissed without any order as to costs. Civil Appeal No.253 of 2009 is allowed without any order as to costs and Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1689 of 2006 is accordingly disposed of in the light of the above judgment. <br/> <br/>Let a copy of this judgment be transmitted to the Ministry of Land of the Government of Bangladesh for necessary action under Presidential Order No.98 of 1972.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Muhammad Imman Ali, J.:</u></strong> I have gone through the judgments proposed to be delivered by my brothers, Surendra Kumar Sinha, J. and Syed Mahmud Hossain, J.

Muzammel Hossain, J:</strong></span><br/><br/>This petition for leave to appeal under Article 103 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh is directed against the judgment and order dated 27.10.2010 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 4968 of 2007 discharging the Rule with a direction to the petitioner to make full payment of the claimed amount within two weeks from the date of receipt of the judgment and order failing which the Bank Guarantee No.101TS124LG07 dated 07.05.2007 will be encashed.<br/> <br/>The present petitioner filed Writ Petition No.4968 of 2007 challenging the direct formal demands made by the respondents alleging violation of Section 55 of Value Added Tax Act,1991 (Annexures-B-1, C-1, C-2, C-3 and C-4 to the writ petition and Annexures-I, J and K to the Supplementary Affidavit) and subsequent demand by their letter dated 23<sup>rd</sup> April,2007 (Annexure-E-1) of an open ended unconditional and continuous Bank Guarantee and a letter of Undertaking from the petitioner as security against their direct formal demand of Tk.2,75,42,815.02 (Taka Two Crore Seventy Five Lac Forty Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifteen and Two Paisa only) for approving the change of name of the petitioner company and seeking direction to release of the Bank Guarantee No.101TS124LG07 dated 7<sup>th</sup> May,2007 for Tk.2,75,42,815.02 (Taka Two Crore Seventy Five Lac Forty Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifteen and Two Paisa only) issued in favour of the respondent No.1 as security for CRAD Audit Objections raised against the petitioner (Annexure-F-1)<br/> <br/>The facts of the case in brief are that Organon (Bangladesh) Limited, a pharmac-eutical company was registered for VAT. The majority shareholder of Organon Bangladesh Limited decided to discontinue the business in Bangladesh. As a result the shareholding and controlling interest in the petitioner company was changed. On 29<sup>th</sup> November, 2006 the new management of the petitioner company chan-ged the name of the petitioner from Organ (Bangladesh) Limited to Nuvista Pharma Limited. The petitioner applied to different authorities namely, the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies &amp; Firms (RJSC), Board of Investments (BOI), Dhaka City Corporation (DCC), National Board of Revenue (NBR), Drugs Administration and Licensing Authority (Drugs), Customs, Excise and VAT Authority etc. to change the petitioner's name in their respective certificate and permissions. The petitioner applied to the VAT authorities under Rule 12 of the VAT Rules to record the change of the share transfer and the change of its name from Organon to Nuvista. The VAT authorities raised an issue regarding alleged outstanding VAT of Organon for the years 2001-2006 on the basis of CRAD audit objections to return of Tk.2,75,42,815.02. The amount was demanded by direct demands without issuing any show cause notice under Section 55 of the VAT Act. The demand was rejected by Nuvista for each year.<br/> <br/>It is stated that the petitioner required VAT Registration Certificate to carry on its business as it had imported raw materials for manufacturing which has already arrived at the airport and that were awaiting for clearance. The petitioner had already got the import registration certificate and bank account changed to the new name of the company and all documents were done in the name of Nuvista Pharma Limited. But the clearance of VAT authorities remained unresolved and in the compelling circumstances as per direction of VAT authorities the petitioner Nuvista Pharma Limited provided unconditional Bank Guarantee and undertaking from the directors of Nuvista under Section 59 of the VAT Act. Thereafter the change of name and ownership was approved and permitted by the VAT authorities on those terms. The petitioner Nuvista filed the instant writ petition challenging the alleged direct demands as stated above and sought release of the Bank Guarantee and undertaking stating that no liability for VAT had arisen. The process for recovering VAT under declared or paid has not been followed and the guarantee will severely hamper the profitability, liquidity and operating capability of the company which amounted to duress. The respondents cannot claim VAT for more than last three years as per provision of Section 55 of the Value Added Tax Act, 1991 and they are illegally claiming the additional VAT in violation of Section 55 of the aforesaid Act. The claim of additional VAT against the petitioner is illegal, unlawful and arbitrary and the respondent's claim for payment of additional VAT cannot sustain in law.<br/> <br/>It is further stated that there were SlX consignments that were awaiting clearance at the International Airport against letters of credit opened in the name of Nuvista Pharma Limited and these consignments could not be cleared by the customs authorities because the VAT Registration number was in the name of former company Organon (Bangladesh) Limited and in the compelling circumstances the petitioners had to provide Bank Guarantee and the letter of undertaking on 07.05.2007 in order to get approval of change of name of the company from Organon (Bangladesh) Limited to Nuvista Pharma Limited.<br/> <br/>A Division Bench of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order dated 27.10.2010 discharged the Rule. Being aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division the petitioner preferred the instant Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal before this Court.<br/> <br/>Mr. Ajmalul Hossain QC, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner submits that the High Court Division erred in law in passing the impugned judgment and order discharging the Rule as it failed to consider that the petitioner's legal arguments that the respondents under the law are not allowed to make their claim inasmuch as pursuant to section 55 of the Value Added Tax Act,1991 the respondents cannot claim VAT for more than last three years and as such they are claiming additional VAT in violation of the provision of Section 55 of the aforesaid Act. He then submits that the VAT is chargeable only on taxable supplies as per sections 2, 3 and 6 of the VAT Act and that there must be identified goods supplied for consideration and VAT is not charged on the quantities of raw materials and as such there cannot be any basis for the liability for VAT arising in the first place. Mr. Hossain then submits that the respondent's act of retaining the Bank Guarantee and personal undertaking where there is no valid and specific claim for additional VAT against the petitioner is unlawful and arbitrary and as such respondents' claim for payment of additional VAT cannot sustain in law. He finally submits that CRAD is not the appropriate VAT authority to re-determine VAT under-declared or under-paid and therefore, direct demands without following the process under Section 55 of the VAT Act are bad in law and the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>In the instant case the petitioner Nuvista Pharma Limited after buyout of the manag-ement of the predecessor of the petitioner company Organon (Bangladesh) Ltd. in the year 2007 after complying with the provision of Section 59 of the VAT Act,1991 and Rule 12 of the VAT Rules,1991 changed the name of the company from Organon (Bangladesh) Limited to Nuvista Pharma Limited by furnishing unconditional Bank Guarantee and undertaking. It has been judicially noticed by the High Court Division that the petitioner company admitted the demand made by the respondent and furnished unconditional Bank Guarantee as per provision of Section 59 of the VAT Act and Rule 12 of VAT Rule for changing the name and ownership of the company and got the same properly approved with the respondent authorities and various other authorities. It appears from the record that the predecessors of the petitioner company Organon (Bangladesh) Limited did not take any action against the demand notice dated 23.04.2007 (Annexure-E1) on the ground of non-compliance of procedure of the VAT Act before making the demand. The pertinent question before us for consideration is whether after change of the name of the petitioner company from Organ (Bangladesh) Limited to Nuvista Pharma Limited having complied with the provisions of the VAT Act and Rules framed thereunder by furnishing Bank Guarantee and undertaking the petitioner can maintain a writ petition challenging the aforesaid demand made by the respondent seeking the unconditional Bank Guarantee to be declared unconstitutional on the ground of non-compliance of various provisions of VAT Act and Rules. In the instant case admittedly the demand was made against the petitioner by the respondent. From the materials on record it appears that the respondent authority by Annexures-C series demanded various outstan-ding arrear VAT. Separate demand notices were issued at different times as per provisions of law but the petitioner knowing fully about the said arrear VAT liability intentionally refrained from making the payment of arrear VAT Liability which was detected by the Local Revenue Audit for the year 2001-2006 and that audit was conducted each year and there was separate demand notice for each year on time but the petitioner did not take any step for payment of the said arrears VAT liability or did not prefer any appeal. It appears that audit has been conducted by the auditors of the Local and Revenue Audit Directorate of the Government based on records such as price declaration, monthly returns and Mushak Challan, copy of Cash Book Register etc. filed by the assesses to the office of the Divisional Officer of Customs, Excise &amp; VAT and also to the office of the Circle Superintendent, Customs, Excise &amp; VAT. The respondent authority issued demand notices for payment of arrear VAT / evaded VAT on time after each year audit by the local revenue audit in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>The VAT Act, 1991 is a special law enacted for realization of VAT on <em>"</em><em>cY¨</em><em>"</em> and <em>"</em><em>‡mev</em><em>"</em> which has been very clearly stated in it’s preamble.  As per provisions of the aforesaid Act a special procedure for imposition and realization of VAT is required to be followed. Section 15 of the VAT Act provides for registration of VAT. According to Section 2(b) any person includes business organization, incorporated body and any association. Section 18 of the VAT Act, 1991 provides that if any person wants to change the name, address and any other information mentioned in the application for registration for VAT he may apply to the concerned authority at least 14 days before the date of change. Section 59 of the Act contains mandatory provisions for change of ownership of the business organization and the company which reads as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"৫৯। মালিকানা হস্তান্তর।-কোন নিবন্ধিত ব্যক্তি তাহার ব্যবসায় প্রতিষ্ঠানের আওতাধীন কোনো স্থাবর সম্পত্তি বা মালিকানা উক্ত ব্যবসায় পরিচালনায় এই আইনের অধীন প্রদেয় সকল মূল্য সংযোজন কর বা, ক্ষেত্রমত, মূল্য সংযোজন কর ও সম্পূরক শুল্ক, সম্পূর্ণরূপে পরিশোধ না করা পর্যন্ত, হস্তান্তর করিতে পারিবেন না।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">তবে শর্ত থাকে যে, উক্ত প্রতিষ্ঠানের স্থাবর বা অস্থাবর সম্পত্তি বা মালিকানা ক্রয়কারী ব্যক্তি প্রদেয় মূল্য সংযোজন কর বা ক্ষেত্রমত, মূল্য সংযোজন কর ও সম্পূরক শুল্ক পরিশোধ করার বিষয়ে কোনো তফসিলী ব্যাংকের নিঃশর্ত ব্যাংক গ্যারান্টি দাখিল করিলে যথোপযুক্ত বিবেচনায় সংশ্লিষ্ট কমিশনার তৎকর্তৃক নির্ধারিত শর্তে উহা হস্তান্তরের অনুমতি প্রদান করিতে পারিবেন।"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Rule 12(1) provides that for change of the place of business or for change of any situation of the business organization a registered person has to pay VAT or turnover tax or any supplementary duty minimum 14 days before such change and then submit a declaration in the prescribed form "VAT-9" to the Local VAT Office. It is pertinent to reproduce Rule 12(1) of VAT Act,1991 which runs as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"১২। ব্যবসায়ের স্থান বা পরিস্থিতির পরিবর্তন।- (১) কোনো নিবন্ধিত ব্যক্তির ব্যবসায়ের স্থান বা পরিস্থিতির পরিবর্তন হইলে তাহাকে উক্ত পরিবর্তনের অন্যূন চৌদ্দ দিন পূর্বে মূল্য সংযোজন কর বা ক্ষেত্রমত, সম্পূরক শুল্ক বা টার্ণওভার কর সম্পূর্ণ পরিশোধ সাপেক্ষে স্থানীয় মূল্য সংযোজন কর কার্যালয়ে বা প্রযোজ্যক্ষেত্রে, কার্যালয় সমূহে ফরম ’মূসক-৯’ এ একটি ঘোষনাপত্র দাখিল করিতে হইবে|"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The case of the petitioner is that there was a change in its shareholding and controlling interest. The new management of the petitioner company changed the name of the company from Organon (Bangladesh) Limited to Nuvista Pharma Limited. The petitioner company was previously running their business with VAT Registration in the name of Organon (Bangladesh) Limited and accordingly they obtained the VAT Registr-ation Certificate in the name of Organon (Bangladesh) Limited to carry on its business for importing raw materials for manufacturing. For this purpose the company had imported raw materials for manufacturing which has already arrived at the Shahajalal International Airport. Because of the change of name of the petitioner company it could not take delivery of it's goods from the airport, since the claim of the VAT Authority against the Nuvista Pharma Limited remain unresolved. Having faced with such a situation the petitioner company was required to obtain VAT Registration in the name of Nuvista Pharma Limited because of the change of name of the company. In compliance with the provisions of Sections 18 and 59 of the VAT Act, 1991 read with Rule 12(1) of the VAT Rules, 1991 the petitioner company was required to pay the outstanding arrear of VAT liability of Tk.2,75,42,815.02 based on CRAD Audit Objection for the years 2001-2006. The petitioner company in order to get registration of their change of ownership and other particulars of the company applied to the respondent authority. Having complied with the provisions of Sections 18 and 59 of the VAT Act,1991 read with Rule 12(1) of the VAT Rules, 1991 the petitioner company furnished unconditional Bank Guarantee. It appears from the record that the respondent No.2 Commissioner, Customs Excise and VAT, Dhaka by memo dated 23.04.2007 (Annexure-E-1) informed the Additional Commissioner, Customs approving the change of the name of the petitioner company from Organon (Bangladesh) Limited to Nuvista Pharma Limited subject to submission of an unconditional and continuing Bank Guarantee for Tk.2,75,42,815.02 under Section 59 of the VAT Act,1991.<br/> <br/>It has also been mentioned that if in the future any demand is made in respect of any outstanding VAT liability of the predecessor of the present petitioner company, it shall have to pay the same as per provisions of Section 59 of the said Act. From the scheme of the Act it is to be observed that payment of outstanding VAT, or any other dues of the respondent Government for change of name and ownership of the company it is mandatorily required that the company shall pay the said dues before making any application for change of name and ownership of the company. From the scheme of the Act it is also obvious that payment of outstanding dues is required to be paid before changing the place and situation of the registered person or business concern and without prior payment of outstanding dues there shall not be any change of VAT Registration in respect of the name and ownership of the company.<br/> <br/>In order to change the name and ownership of the company, according to Section 59 of the VAT Act,1991 and Rule 12 of the VAT Rules,1991 prior payment of outstanding dues of the VAT Authority is a condition precedent before changing the name and ownership of the company. In compliance with the provisions of the VAT Act,1991 and Rules framed thereunder the petitioner company furnished Bank Guarantee being No.101TS1241LG07 dated 07.05.2007 for Tk.2,75,42,815.02 in favour of the respondent No.1 as security of the outstanding dues of the respondent authority wherein it has been stated that "our liability under this guarantee is limited to Tk.2,75,42,815.02 (taka two crore seventy five lac forty two thousand eight hundred and fifteen and two paisa only) (Annexure-F)”. The petitioner company also gave a separate undertaking dated 07.05.2007 (Annexure-F-2) wherein all the directors of the company individually and jointly gave an unconditional undertaking that “Nuvista Pharma Ltd. will be liable to meet any claim from the VAT Authorities that may arise in future in the name of Organon (Bangladesh) Limited".<br/> <br/>It appears that the predecessor of the petitioner company did not raise any objection against the outstanding arrear VAT liability demanded by the respondent authority as contained in Annexure-E1 on the ground of non-compliance of procedure of the VAT Act before making the demand. In the circumstances of the case after submission of the Bank Guarantee No. 101TS1241LG07 dated 07.05.2007 for Tk.2,75,42,815.02 supported by an unconditional undertaking by all the directors of the petitioner company against the outstanding VAT liability of Tk.2,75,42,815.02 the claim for release of the Bank Guarantee is not tenable in law. However, the petitioner company can claim refund of any mistaken payment or excessive payment in respect of VAT turnover tax or any other dues if any to the respondent authority as envisaged in Section 67 of the VAT Act.<br/> <br/>At the time of issuance of Rule an ad-interim order was passed stating that injunction on the Bank Guarantee can not sustain in view of the decision of the case of Uttara Bank -Vs- Macneill &amp; Kilburn reported in 33 DLR(AD) 298 wherein it has been held that there cannot be any injunction whatsoever upon any Bank Guarantee. The Appellate Division observed-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"The decisions show that court will not interfere by granting an injunction from performing or discharging the contractual obligations.

It is nobody's case that there is any fraud of which the bank got notice." </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>We have heard the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner, perused the leave petition, impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and all other connected papers on record. We are in respectful agreement with the decision of the Appellate Division reported in 33 DLR (AD) 298. In view of the above mentioned findings and observations, we do not find any illegality in the impugned judgment and order.

The impugned decision was, therefore, completely without lawful authority since the impugned decision was without lawful authority, all actions that stemmed therefrom, was ipso facto, unlawful, nonetheless, and is destined to meet the same fate….(33)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 154</strong><br/><strong>Penal Code (XLV of 1860)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 409, 418, 217 and 218</strong><br/><strong>The FIR stories can not , with any stretch of imagination, be drawn anywhere near any of the ingredients of Sections 409, 418, 217 and 218 of the Penal Code or any other penal provision of the land....

The verbatim text of the FIR is reproduced below; ......</div> <div style="text-align: justify;">The afore reproduced First Information Report (FIR) was not the only one that was filed in respect to the event stated therein, two other FIRs were also filed , invoking more or less same Sections, which FIRs gave rise two other and distinct criminal cases, registered as Tejgaon Police Case Nos. 96 and 97 respecti-vely, which cases have also been challenged by two other writ petitions, registered as Writ Petition Nos. 7966 and 7967 of 2005 respectively.<br/> <br/>Although the Rule in response to instant petition was issued to require the respondents to show cause as to why the impugned decision reproduced above, should not be declared to have been taken without lawful authority, when the Rule was taken up for disposal, the learned Advocates for the Petitioner came up to argue the case with a much broader spectrum, challe-nging the very continuation of the criminal proceeding, contending that the same should be set aside, as the FIR stories disclose no offence as the evidence of malafide action is quite conspicuous.  <br/> <br/>In impugning the direction  concerned, the Petitioner has alleged that the direction contained in the impugned notification,  dated 24.08.2005, was totally bereft of jurisdiction in that (1) no officer( the respondent no 5 in the instant case) can dictate the investigating officer (the respondent no 6 herein) on the progression of investigation process (2) the Chairman of the Anti Corruption Commission, henceforth, the Commission, by himself had no power whatsoever to take any decision like the one that prompted the respondent no5 to issue the impugned order, (3) induction of the respondents No. 5 (the author of the impugned decision)  and 6 (upon whom the impugned decision  was conveyed for action), into the Commission were without lawful authority , and was, as such non est in the eye of law. <br/> <br/>The petition is structured on the allegations that the text in the subject notification were devoid of lawful authority and jurisdiction, that the same was  gestated with a diabolic and  malafide motive and that malicious consider-ation is what the Commission was propelled by, in embarking upon the impugned move,  the impugned decision was embryogenesised with a depraved fertilisation process that took place in the thoughts of the Commission.<br/><br/>The petitioner’s case is that the government in power at the relevant period, with malice afore-thought and ulterior motives, in order to malign the stature and the world wide acclamation of the Petitioner, and humiliate her to the whole world, who is none other than a former Prime Minister of the Republic, the primordial figure in the country’s oldest political party and one of the two progenies of the Founding Father of the Nation, who were lucky enough to miraculously survive the diabolic holocaust of 15<sup>th</sup> August 1975, and to tarnish her  image  to  the right thinking people world wide, initiated the said criminal case, the legality of which has been questioned by this petition. It has been asserted that since a decision arrived at with a malafide intent can not be reckoned to be a decision in the eye of law, the whole proceeding, from top to the toe, is bound to founder. It has been contended that as per Section 3 of the Durnity Daman Commission Ain, 2007, hereinafter cited as the Ain, read with Section 4( 1), the Commission, is a composite body, consisting  of it’s Chairman, henceforth cited as the Chair, and as many other Commissioners  as are there. Since the Commission means the whole body, as stated above, no decision arrived at by an individual Commissioner or even by the Chair, is a decision as contemplated by the Ain. It has been further averred in the petition that under Section 35(2), read with Sections 2(f), 2(j), 16(4) and 34 of the Ain, the appointment of the respondent nos.5 and 6 to the Commission  was illegal, without jurisdiction and null and void abinitio, which follows that the order dated 24.98.2005, purportedly passed by the respon-dent no.5, is liable to be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect as the same has purportedly been passed by someone who is a stranger in the eye of law. It is stated that Section 35 of the Ain, does not empower the respondent no.3 to induct the officers and employees of the defunct Bangladesh Bureau of Anti Corruption, into the present Commission, and hence, the respondent no 5 and 6, can not be recognised as the functionaries of the Commission, which necessarily follows that the purported decision, as pretentiously taken by respondent no. 6, is no decision at all through the legal spectacles.<br/><br/>Although the Rule was issued as early as on 27.10.2005, none of the respondents came up with any affidavit-in-opposition to dispel the contentions and the claims scripted in the Writ Petition. <br/><br/>When the Rule matured for disposal, Mr. Rafiq-ul-Huq, leading a high profile team of specialized and skilled learned advocates, inc-lusive of Mr. Abdul Matin Khasru, Mr.Yusuf Hossain Humayun, Mr. A.F.M. Mesbahuddin, Mr. S.M. Rezaul Karim, Mr. Nurul Islam Sujan, Mr. Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, Mehedi Hasan Chowdhury, and Mr. Md. Selim Jahangir made comprehensive submission in support of the Writ Petition. <br/><br/>In his opening speech, Mr. Sheikh Fazlee Noor Taposh had it to say that in the light of the attending facts, we should, instead of confining ourselves to the narrow specified terms of the Rule, for the interest of justice, look at a broader horizon, touching upon the question of very legality of the criminal proceeding as a whole. He proffered  that the FIR at page 26, read with the impugned memo at page 24, reveals that it was at the instance of the respondent no. 3, the Chair of the Commission, that the respondent no.5 conveyed the impugned direction to the respondent no 6, the pretentious officer, who was assigned  with the duty to conduct the investigation  into the case, adding that such a decision on the part of the Chair was completely without jurisdiction as that  decision could only be taken by the Com-mission as a conglomerate, as contemplated by the Ain. Mr. Taposh went on to submit that everything that emanated from the said direction, is void equally well, because a void entity can not bread any valid offspring. Mr Taposh concluded his profferment saying that as a malafide action destroys all traces, that itself would justify our move to set aside the whole criminal prosecution.<br/><br/>By referring to that part of the FIR, where the informant stated that the meeting of the Execution Committee of the National Econo-mic Council (ECNEC) was not attended by sufficient number of members, Mr. Abdul Matin Khashru submitted that the said passage in the FIR divulges an inexonerable flaw and falacy. He went on to state that Article 35 of the Constitution of the Republic contemplates trial without undue delay, whereas in the inst-ant case no step was taken until 2005, while the FIR was filed in the year 2002. He continued to submit that inordinate delay by itself is a ground for quashment. He went ahead arguing that the same is also reflective of malicious intent. Mr. Khashru further submitted that nob-ody, the Supreme Court inclusive, can ask an investigation officer to concluded investiga-tion, whereas in the instant case, the Chair of his own ventured to do so. Submitting  that the ECNEC is a very  high profile body, which is composed of the people with the highest auth-ority and stature in the Republic, is attended by the top people in the country, Mr. Khashru castigated the author of the FIR, stating that it was an unwarranted and audacious exercise on the part of the informant to pass such a silly and derogatory comment on the composition as well as on the attendance of  the ECNEC meetings, adding that the informant, by doing so, demonstrated his lamentable incognisance. Reminiscing his maiden experience as a member of the cabinet, Mr. Khashru submitted that the ECNEC meetings are never attended by all the Ministers, but by the concerned Ministers only.<br/><br/>Illustrating the role of the ECNEC and it’s meetings, Mr. Yousuf Hussain Humayun, submitted that the subject decision was taken by the members present at the relevant meeting, which was conspicuously attended by the sufficient number of members to form the quorum. He continued to submit that no impropriety or illegality whatsoever appears from the record, either at the inception or during the progression of the meeting in question. He continued to submit that the whole case was geared to assail the credibility and the integrity of the Petitioner, with a visibly vindictive intention.<br/><br/>Mr. A.F.M. Mesbahuddin submitted that the document at page 24 of the writ petition is a clear reflection of malafide exercise of power. He concluded his submission saying that the FIR reveals that the informant really acted under the dictation of his superior, rather than of his own volition.<br/><br/>Mr. Nurul Islam Sujan submitted that Article 7 of the Constitution has conferred all powers on the people, which are exercised by their elected representatives. In the case under consideration, submitted Mr. Sujan, the decision citing which the respondents to lodged the FIR concerned against the Petitioner, was taken by the representative of the people at the highest level. He submitted that Article 55 of the Constitution has vested the executive power of the Republic on the Cabinet headed by the Hon’ble Prime Minister, and it is only natural that in exercising the said power, the executive organ of the Republic is indispensably required to rely on certain degree of discretion. Unless it is evident that discretion was exercised with improper motive or illegally, they can not be impeached in any forum other than the Parliament.<br/><br/>Mr. S.M. Reza-ul-Karim, submitted that the facts as described in the FIR disclose no offence under any law of the country, and, hence we should travel beyond the narrower terms of the Rule in order to set the whole proceeding aside.<br/><br/>Mr. Rafiq-ul-Huq, the learned senior advocate and the leader of the petitioner’s team, with his characteristic eloquence,  submitted that apart from the fact that the Chair acted beyond vires, the whole  proceeding is also inflicted by multifarious  other maladies and illegalities. Mr. Huq went on to submit that the Commission means the Chair together with all the other Commissioners appointed by the Hon’ble President. He further submitted that no action can be taken by any individual Commissioner, not even by the Chair and that if any action or decision is so taken in isolation, such an action would be unlawful. Since it was the Chair who acted alone in arriving at the subject decision to set the respondent no5 in motion to issue the impugned direction, the same is bound to be capsized by the doctrine coram non-judice.<br/><br/>On the question of the High Court Division’s power to grant relief beyond the strict terms of the Rule, Mr. Huq by referring  to the book  titled the Constitutional law of Bangladesh , authored by Mr. Mahmudul Islam, submitted that jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution is similar to that which was exercised by the Chancellor in the Court of Equity, which connotes that  the Court can travel beyond the strict terms of the Rule, where such a move is necessitated  by the principle of equity fairness and justice. In support of his submission Mr. Huq  cited the case  of State of Kerala –v- TP Roshana, reported in AIR 1979 (SC) 765. He also took us through the decision in the case of Maico Jute and Bag Corporation –v- Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporations and others, reported in 55 DLR (AD) 23, to vindicate his argument on this point.<br/><br/>Mr. Huq also raised a very pertinent question as to the attractability of those Sections of the penal code which have been cited in the FIR. In elaborating his submission, Mr. Huq said that the facts as stated in the FIR can not net any of the ingredients of Section 409, 418, 217, 201 or 218 and as such, even if, for argument’s sake it is assumed that the FIR stories are established, there can be no conv-iction on those stories. He further submitted that the ingredients of Section 5 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, are also not attracted in the backdrop of the FIR stories, and as such the instant case must founder on this count as well. Mr. Huq continued his submission stating that it is crystal clear from the FIR that the case was initiated only to malign and derogate the standing of the Petitioner. In his concluding submission , Mr. Haque put it on board  that as many as 3 FIRs were  filed relying on one in single event, which is not permissible by Article 35 of our Constitution, as it breaches the doctrine against double jeopardy.<br/><br/>Mr. A.K.M. Fazlul Haque, appearing for the Commission, at the very inception impeached the maintainability of the Writ Petition, submitting that a criminal matter can not be reviewed under the umbrella of Article 102 of the Constitution, the correct device being an application invoking Section 561 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He further submitted that this Court has no power to pass any order beyond the terms of the Rule and as such, any order to be passed by this Division must remain confined within the four walls of the Rule. He also argued that there is no evidence of malice in the FIR. According to him the decision was in fact taken by the entire Commission, not by any individual Comm-issioner or the Chair and hence, no illegality is projected. He further submitted that an ancillary relief can be granted only if a foundation is established for such a relief and that in the instant case no such foundation has been established by the Petitioner. By referring to Section 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Mr. Huq submitted that irregula-rities can be rectified by having recourse to the said Section and as such, if any illegality have been Commissioned, the same can be rectified by virtue of the said Section. The Chair can obviously direct the Investigation Officer to expedite the investigation as well as to submit the memo of evidence. He also submitted that asking an Investigation Officer to submit a memo of evidence, and asking him to submit a charge sheet, is not proscribed by law. In support of this submission, Fazlul Mr Huq said that Article 102 of the Constitution mandates that a writ petition will be entertained only if the Court is satisfied that no other efficacious remedy is provided by the law, but here equally efficacious remedies are available to the petitioner. Mr. Haque also submitted  that although ingredients of Sections 418, 201, 217 can not be attracted in the back drop of the stories laid down in the FIR, those of Section 409 are, nevertheless, attracted, although he was unable to pinpoint out as to how ingredients  of Section 409 can be engaged. Mr. Fazlul Haque concluded his submission stating that in any event Section 5(2) on its own can be invoked without relying on any other penal law because Section 5(2) can stand on it’s own legs. <br/>Having heard the learned advocates of both the sides and having considered the documents in the file, it is our view that we are to address the following questions in the process of disposing the Rule of. The First one centres round the question of maintainability of this writ petition: is writ jurisdiction available in an essentially criminal matter: is it available when alternative statutory remedy is available? The second question is whether the Chair of the Commission acted beyond jurisdiction in issuing the direction as he had done, coupled with the question as to whether the respondents no 5 and 6 can be treated as officials of the Commission. The third question is whether the stories as figured in the FIR, attract the ingredients of the offences cited in the said document, or any ingredient of any other offence, recognised as such in our jurisdiction. The fourth question is what consequences ensue when the FIR discloses no offence. The fifth question is whether the allegation of malafide has been substantiated, and the last, but not the least, question is whether it is open to us to overstep the strict, specific terms of the Rules.<br/><br/>In addressing the question whether this petition is maintainable or not as it is essentially a criminal matter and, as alternative remedy in the form of an application under Section 561A is available to the Petitioner, we do immediately remind ourselves that the proposition that writ jurisdiction is not available in a criminal matter, is a myth, which must be dispelled.<br/><br/>In so saying we wish to emphasise that the doctrine of judicial review was first gestated in the womb of the criminal jurisprudence in it’s natal home. Even before advent of the Tudor period, from the year 1280 to be nearly precise the issuance of the writ of certiorari first saw the light of the day when the King’s Bench began the practice of asking for the records of the proceedings in the Courts of the Justices of Peace (JPs), with a view to quash such proceedings. During those days the Kings Bench embarked upon the procedure of issuing ‘Certiorari’ , meaning ‘certificate’, to the JPs to quash their judgments or orders(Henderson: Foundation of English Administrative Law: de Smith, Wolf and Jowel,: Judicial Review of Administrative Action, 4<sup>th</sup> Edition 584: Caenegem: Royal Writs in England from the Conquest to Glanville: R -v- Lowle 1759). <br/><br/>De Smith, Woolf (Former Master of the Roll)  &amp; Jowell in their book, ‘Principles of Judicial Review’ states, ‘Certiorari was historically linked with the King’s person as well as with the King’s Bench; it was of high importance for the control of the inferior tribunals , particularly  with respect to the administration of criminal justice’ (Page 532). The same authors went on to write; ‘The Court of King’s Bench, which had always been associated with the work of government and had retained jurisdiction over the work of the justices in the sessions and of other local bodies during the hay day of the Council and the Star Chamber, was manifestly the proper superintending authority. But it could not exercise it’s authority by menas of writ of error , for although error lay to impeach the record of a judgment given on indictment it would not lie to quash convictions and orders made in summary proceedings.... After a period of doubt and vacillation the Court ultimately committed itself to the proposition that the appropriate remedy in all cases where an inferior statutory tribunal had exceeded it’s jurisdiction or drawn up a conviction or order that was bad on it’s face was a writ of certiorari to quash the conviction or order. The process by which this proposition came to be established is still not free from obscurity; but by 1700 it was possible for Holt CJ., in the famous case of Groenvelt -v- Burwell (1700 1 Ld. Raym 454) to proclaim the grand generalisation that: “It is a consequence of all jurisdiction to have their proceedings returned here by certiorari to be examined here ........... Where any Court is erected by a statute, a certiorari lies to it .........” (Page 534-5).<br/><br/>That trend, however, did not remain confined to those olden ages, but continued to flourish unabated, which process is in prog-ression even today, as would be seen from the following decisions. So, in R -v- Herefordshire Magistrate Court ex p Rowlands (1998 QB 110), the Queen’s Bench Division quashed an irregular conviction after judicially reviewing the same notwithstanding the existence of right of appeal to the Crown Court.<br/><br/>Similarly in R -v- Wandsworth JJ ex parte Read (1942 1KB 281) thy Chief Justice Lord (Viscount) Caldecott had no hesitation to refute the contention that judicial review was not lie as the petitioner had a right of appeal as well as a right to take recourse to the device known as ‘case stated’, which is similar to our proceeding for quashment under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Lord Caldecott expressed; ‘It remains to consider the argument that the remedy of certiorary is not open to the appellant because others were available. It would be ludicrous in such a case, as the present, for the convicted person to ask for a case to be stated. It would mean asking the court to consider as a question of law whether the justices were right in convicting a man without hearing his evidence. This is so extravagant an argument as not to merit a moment’s consideration.’<br/><br/>The House of Lord’s decision in Leech –v- Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison (1988 AC 533), also lends heavy weight support to this contention.<br/><br/>In R-v- Reading Crown Court ex p Hutchinson (1988 QB 384) , R-v-Devizes Justices ex p Lee, DPP-v- Head (1959 AC 83), R-v- Smith (1984 Cr. L. R. 630) and in R-v- Oxford Crown Court ex p Smith (1989 2 Admin Law Report) the various English Courts , inclusive of the House of Lords judicially reviewed Magistrate and Crown Courts’ decision to ignore the plea raised by the accused persons that the criminal courts concerned were obliged to examine the validity of the by-laws, they were charged with, validity and the applicability of the orders they were indicted.<br/><br/>In Boddington –v- British Transport Police, the House of Lords judicially reviewed a Magistrate Court’s decision to refuse to examine the vires of a by-law, though, at the end held that the by-law was valid. In of R Vs. Chief Constable of Merseyside ex p Calveley 1986 Q.B. 424, it was held that the existence of alternative remedy notwithstanding, judicial review may be justified where there has been abuse of statutory power by the authority.  In Leach -Vs- Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison (1988 AC 533), the House Lords held  that the existence of alternative remedy does not deprive the Administrative Court  of jurisdiction, it simply requires  the court to exercise it’s discretion: whether leave  for judicial review to proceed is granted will depend  on whether the statutory remedy is satisfactory and effective.<br/><br/>True it is that unlike ours, in Britain there is no written constitution to dictate that the High Court Division may interfere, “if satisfied that no other equally efficacious remedy is provided by law”. But it is equally true that the area of the common Law principle, upon which the English doctrine of judicial review is founded, is no way different from our written Constitutional mandate. It is also very much an English Common Law requirement that judicial review may not normally be available where alternative, effective, statutory remedies are in hands, as depicted above. In any event, when fundamental right is invoked, question of alternative remedy becomes a matter of discretion only because unlike Article 102(2), Article 102 (1) does not speak of efficacious alternative remedy.<br/><br/>The Indian Supreme Court in State of Hariana -v- Bhajan Lal, (AIR1992 SC 604), inflexibly discarding the idea that writ jurisdiction can not be invoked in a criminal matter, expostulated seven types of situation, not exhaustive though, where the High Courts may review a criminal matter under writ jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Even our Appellate Division did not find any reason to jettison the above disclosed principles. So, in Government of the peoples Republic of Bangladesh and others –vs.- Iqbal Hasan Mahmood Tuku, 60DLR AD 147), the Appellate Division declined to endorse the contention that a criminal matter cannot be agitated through writ jurisdiction because of the existence of alternative remedy under Section 561A of the Cr. P.C.<br/><br/>The Appellate Division in M.A. Hai –vs- TCB (40 DLR AD 206) arrived at similar conclusion.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh Vs. Haque, reported in 16 DLR (AD) 147, the Appellate Division discussed the contention that the writ petition concerned was not maintainable because of the availability of a remedy under Section 561 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure and then categorically expressed that when a case raises question of law and requires provisions of a statute to be interoperated, remedy under article 102 of the Constitution is more apposite. In Jaha Howlader Vs. C.M.M. Court, Dhaka (58 DLR 106) this Division entertained a writ petition and made the same absolute availability of relief under Section 561A notwithstanding.<br/><br/>As the instant case is wholly founded on the allegation of malice and the Chair’s ultra vires action, and espouses the necessity of interpreting some statutory provisions, invocation of Article 102, in our view, can not be brushed of in the instant case. We are, therefore, inclined to resolve the first issue in favour of maintainability. That takes ask to consider the second question, ie, whether the impugned decision can pass the test of legality or not. It is beyond doubt that the Ain requires a decision like the one under challenge, to be taken by the Commission. Obviously the Ain defines the Commission as a composite body consisting of the Chair and all other Commissioners. In the instant case, the document annexed as Annexure-A divulges without distortion that the decision to ask the respondent no 5 to direct the respondent no 6 to issue the impugned order, was in reality taken by the Chair on his own, in exclusion of his peers. Furthermore the documents on record reveal that the purported induction of the respondents no 5and6, who were formerly functionaries of the defunct Anti Corruption Bureau, into the Commission, was not done in concord with the provisions laid down in Section 35 (2) the Ain, as the same was occasioned exclusively by the Chair, instead of being done by the whole Commission as a composite entity, as contemplated by the said Section. So, we find unimpeachable substance in the profferment Mr. Haque and his colleagues advanced, claiming that the decision was ultravires the Ain as it was taken by a persons who, was not, in exclusion of his peers, empowered to do so and also because the respondents no 5and 6 , who were instrumental to carry on the Chair’s desire, could not be treated as the functionaries of the Commission. The impugned decision was, therefore, completely without lawful authority. We are also in wholesome agreement with the learned advocates’ submission that since the impugned decision was without lawful authority, all actions that stemmed therefrom, was ipso facto, unlawful, nonetheless, and is destined to meet the same fate. The second question being so resolved against the respondents, we must, now move to address the third one. <br/><br/>It has been assiduously argued that the FIR stories are incapable of angling any ingredient of any of the Penal Code provisions that have been cited therein or of any other penal law of the land. To locate the correct answer we have thoroughly analysed the ingredients of Sections 409, 418, 217, and 218 of the penal Code, as well as those of Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947, having read them extensively  and intensively in juxtaposition  with the stories as figured in the FIR, the whole text of which stands reproduced above verbitame. Our considered and irresistible view is that the FIR stories can not , with any stretch  of imagination, be drawn anywhere near any of the ingredients of those Sections or any other penal provision of the land. The prime ingredient of Section 409 is criminal breach of trust. Under Section 405 PC, a Criminal Breach of Trust is occasioned only when the postulant dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use the subject property or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied , which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person to do so. There is no allegation that the Petitioner harboured any of the deeds listed in Section 405 PC, as cited above. Section 418 presupposes ‘cheating’. Now, Section 415 , in defining ‘cheating’ stipulates that cheating takes place when the postulant, by deceiving any person , fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person , or to consent that any person shall retain that property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body , mind , reputation or property. Again, there is no allegation that the Petitioner induced any person to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or induced any person to do or omit to do something he would not have done if not deceived. Since there is no allegation of causing disappearance of evidence, section 201 has no application. So, Section 418 is also out of context. As there is no allegation that the Petitioner disobeyed any direction of law as to the way she is to conduct herself , intending thereby to save or knowing it to be likely that she will thereby save any person from legal punishment, or subject him to a lesser punishment than that to which he is liable with intent to save , or knowing that she is likely thereby to save any property from forfeiture or any charge to which it is liable by law,  Section 217 is absolutely out of context . Similarly as there is no indictment that the Petitioner was charged with the preparation of any record or other writing , framed that record or writing in a manner which she knew to be incorrect, Section 218 PC has no threshold in the instant case.  Section 109 needs no discussion as it contains provisions as to inchoate offences only. So far Section 5(2) of the 1947 Act is concerned, again there is no allegation that the Petitioner had done anything catalogued in Section 5(1) of the said Act, and hence ingredients of Section 5(2) can also not be dragged to be relied on. We are therefore, in all four with Mr. Haque’s submission to the effect that the FIR stories do not, in the instant case, depict any offence.<br/><br/>What consequences would such a vacuous FIR entail? To trace an accurate reply, we are to dissect the ratio as have been  expounded in the following cases,.  The decision that deserves primordial consideration is the age old one, a genesis of the 1940s decade, that emanated from the Privy Council in the case of Emperor-v-Nazir Ahmed (AIR 1945 PC 18). In that case the Council’s advice to the Crown did not remain confined to the proposition that a case commenced with a frail FIR is incapable of reproductivity, but also that in such an event the Court need not wait to see the completion of investigation process because such a case can be brought to mortuary  at the very moment of it’s birth  for the reason that the police would, in a case like that, have no authority to investigate. That theory was followed in the countries of the sub-continent unabated. So, in a plentitude of cases, including the one catalogued below, the Indian superior courts held that an FIR or a complaint petition can be quashed at a very early stage, at the threshold if no offence is disclosed by the said instruments. In the cases of Shrei International Finance Ltd-v- M G Narayana (1998 Cr. L J 2220), State of UP –v- OP Sharma ((AIR 1996 SC 2983), State of HP -v- Pirthichand (AIR 1996SC 977), State of West Bengal –v-Swapan Kumar (AIR 1982 SC 949), the Supreme Court of India held that if the FIR taken at it’s face value and accepted at it’s entirety, does not prima facie constitutes any offence, or does not make out a case against the accused, it will be the duty of the Court to quash the criminal proceeding at the preliminary stage and that the Court need not wait  till the magistrate takes cognisance of the offence or issues process. In Rajesh Kumar Bansal –v-State (1992 Crimes 1 7, 9, Del) it was held that a case may be quashed at the initial stage if it is apparent from the FIR or the complaint petition that the chances of conviction is bleak. In Dr. Dattatraya –v- State of Maharashtra (1982 Cr L J 1025) and  State of Karnatikat -v- L. Muniswami (AIR 1977 SC 1489), it was held that an order of charge framing may be quashed where the witnesses do not make out prima facie case.<br/><br/>The following are some of the cases, among many others, to stand as astute authority for the proposition that if EIR or Complaint Petition disclose no offence, the proceeding can be quashed; (1) Kali Charan Gupta -v-Ashok Kumar Jain 1984 1 Crimes ALL) (1) Arnaraz –v- Alcox Metals Ltd, ((2005 Cr. L J 610), (2) Kali Charan Gupta-v- Ashoke Kumar Jain (1984 1 Crimes 221 ALL), (3) Sh Nayck, Br. Mgr. Bombay Mercantile Co-Operative Bank Ltd-v-Rahul Kunubhai Aashar (1995 4 Crimes 614 Guj), (4) Yashuwant Verilal Sanghvi –v- Sahed Sinh Dilubbhaj,(2004 4 Crimes 20 Guj) (5) M Narayana –v- State of Karnataka  2003 11 SCC 251) , (6) State of Andhra Pradesh –v- Golaconda Linga Swami (2004 6 SCC 522) Mangal Chowhan –v- State ( 1983 Cr. LJ 279- Cal -DB), (7) Vinod Kumar Sethi –v- State of Punjab AIR 1982 P&amp;H 372), (8) Subhash Chandra –v- State of Punjab (1988 2 Crimes 21 P&amp;H) . The wave of the same notion hit our jurisdiction as well simultan-eously. So, in Abdul Quader Chowdhury –v- The State (28 DLR AD 39) it was observed ; ‘Interference even at an initial stage may be justified where facts are so preposterous that even on the admitted facts no case can stand against the accused and that further prolongation of the prosecution would amount to harassment to an innocent party band abuse of the process of the Court. The Appellate Division in Nasiruddin Mahmud and others  –v- Momtazuddin Ahmed (36 DLR AD 14) reiterated the above stated version expressed in the case of Abdul Quader Chowdhury with approval(per Badrul Haider Chowdhury J). In Syed Mohammad Hashem –v- State (48 DLR AD 87) the Appellant Division observed that if the FIR discloses no offence, the Police would have no authority to investigate, and the case may stand liable to be quashed even at the threshold. Similarly in Motaleb Hussain –v- The State (6MLR SC 168) the Supreme Court stated that if the complaint petition discloses no offence, the case can be quashed. In Shokrana (Md) –v-State (6MLR SC 180) the Supreme Court stated that the FIR and the charge sheet having disclosed no offence under Section 409, read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 19947, the case can be quashed. In Radhaballav Sarkar -vs- Pijush Kanti Chakravarty (7 BLD AD 32) the Appellate Division expressed that since no offence has been depicted by the FIR, the case can be quashed. In Ali Akbar-v-Enayet Hussain (2MLR AD 166), the Appellate Division expressed in favour of quashment as the allegation did not constitute any offence. All the above cases were decided under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, So, a question naturally arises as to whether the same can happen when an application is filed engaging Article 102 of the Constitution. The answer has , however , been  undistortedly given by a very high profile decision of the Indian Supreme Court in the case of State of Haryana –v- Bhajan Lal ( AIR 1992 SC 604). In that celebrated case the Indian Supreme Court portrayed a list of seven situations, not making them exhaustive, sating that in the event of the presence of any of those situations, it would be open to the High Court to quash a case either under the inherent power as retained by Section 482,( which corresponds to our Section 561 A) or under the extra-ordinary jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution through Article 226, ( which is similar to our Article 102). The situations cited by the Indian Supreme Court included the one where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with malafide and/ or where proceeding is maliciously instituted with ulterior motive for wrecking vengeance on the accused, and the one where the FIR discloses no offence, or where such absurd or inherently improbable stories have been resorted to, which can lead no prudent person to reach a conclusion that there is a case.  Now that we are swamped with to the irreversible conclusion that the FIR stories, as laid down in the cases before us can not encompass any ingredient of any of offence traceable  in our law books, and that a mori-bund FIR is incapable of yielding any harvest, we would proceed to examine whether the allegation of mala fide, as tabled by the Petitioner, stand substantiated and what do the authorities say on  the consequences of mala fide decisions, before stepping upon the ladder to explore the final question, which is, whether we can travel beyond the specific term of the Rule, which question , in our reckoning, is of utmost importance. The learned Advocates for the Petitioners argued that the factum that as many as three FIRs, virtually in the same terms, containing  same facts and allegations, were filed against the Petitioner over the same fact, does , by itself constitute irrefutable evidence of malafide. We can not brush aside this contention. Such a move is obviously not permissible by Article 35 of the Constitution. It can not be assumed that the respondents were not aware of this Constitutional mandate, which is a matter of a very elementary, very basic knowledge. Why did they, then permeate into such a tinted arena ? We can not help but to infer that they were simply instigated by their inner perceived vendetta to trail this depraved path. The fact that a truly extra-ordinary, and thoroughly out of the way move was undertaken by none other than the person at the helm of the Commission’s affairs, for  a quick conclusion of the investigation in order to pave way for hurriedly commencing the trial, also bestows a significant degree of weight to the assertion of malice. The unpalatable and obnoxious fact that the informants did not even maintain minimum respect in writing the name of the Founding Father of the Nation, because of whom they do now live in independent Bangladesh and enjoy the fruits of freedom, also leaves a lot to be desired vis–a-vis  the allegation of malice. In recording the name of the Petitioner’s universally revered Progenitor, who is none other than the Founding Father of this Nation, in the FIR, the informants demonstrated highest and inexpiable audacity and disparagement, reflective of vicious reprehensibility, haughtiness, scornfulness, contempt and reprobation, leading us to infer that they were prompted by ill nurtured malice aforethought. In Humayun Kabir -v- State, (28 DLR 259) and of Serajul Islam –v- DG Food 43 DLR 237, it has been distinctively stated that malice in law is to be inferred when an order is made contrary to the object and the purpose of the Act and when the deciding authority permits himself to be influenced by conditions which he ought not to permit. Following this ratio, we reckon, we can in the instant case draw inference of malafide consideration. In Dr. Nurul Isalm –v- Bangladesh (33 DLR AD 201) the Appellate Division held that plunging the petitioner to compulsory retirement with a view to circumvent earlier High Court Division order(1981 BLD 12) , was vitiated by malice in law. The Indian Supreme Court in Express News Papers Ltd. -v- India (AIR 1986 SC 2257) set aside the government’s decision to forfeit the lease of land held by a news paper on the ground of mala fide exercise of power , prompted by the news paper’s  critical stance against the imposition of emergency. In Prapat Singh –v- Punjab(AIR 10964 SC 72), the Supreme Court set aside a decision on mala fide ground, holding that the allegation placed by the petitioner that he was a victim of the Chief Minister’s acrimony, has been proved. The Court considered evidence the petitioner adduced and took account of the fact that no affidavit in rebuttal had been filed. In the classic case of West Minster Corporation –v- London and the North Western Railway Co(1904 1 Ch 759) Vaughan William LJ,  observed that a person acts mala fide when he seeks to do something for a purpose not authorised by law. Viscount Haldane, the Lord High Chancellor in Shearer-v- Shield ( 1914 AC 808 ), observed ; ‘ Malice of fact is quite a different thing; it means an actual malicious intention on the part of the person who has done the wrongful act....’ Consequence of a mala fide decision is obvious. As Lord Justice Denning as he then was, observed in Lazarus Estate –v- Beaseley (1956 1 QB 702); ‘Fraud unravels everything. So, it is –the instant criminal proceeding is also destined to face the same fate.<br/><br/>Having been satisfied that the allegation of malafide has also been established along with the aspersion that the FIR discloses no offence, we would now proceed to the final question.<br/><br/>As we have already arrived at the synthesis that the respondents no 3 5 and 6 acted ultra vires, we can quite comfortably set aside the order that has actually been impugned by the Petitioner. But will that meet the ends of justice? According to Mr. Rafiqul Huq and his team, it will let the matter orbit in wilderness and hence nothing short of setting the whole case aside would be conducive to the notion of justice.  The core question, however, is whether we can set our feet on such an odyssey in the backdrop of the fact the Rule in question does not specifically stipulate this relief. Mr. Rafiqul Haque with his aura of advocacy, submitted quite assiduously that if we are satisfied that the FIR stories divulge no offence, that the allegation of malice stands vindicated, it will be totally incongruous to allow the criminal proceeding to continue, and that it is quite open to us to set aside the proceeding, absence of this relief in specific term in the Rule notwithstanding. Relying on the Appellate Division’s decision in the case of Maico Jute and Bag Corporation, supra, Mr. Haque argued that the relief under Article 102 is equitable which is comparable with those the Chancellor used to grant from the Court of Chancery, denoting that the principle of fairness and equity must reign supreme in adjudicating cases under the writ jurisdiction. He went on to say that in setting aside the whole case , we will not really be acting in excess of the terms of the Rule, we will only unlock  the compartment of discretion to secure entry into expanded part of the Rule,  which part reads;‘ and any other or further order or orders as to this court may seem proper and fit,’ adding that the said appended part of the Rule is actually meant to allow a court sufficient maneuv-erability where it is deemed that the circum-stances call for relief beyond what have specifically been stated in the Rule, and that this practice has been there to cater for a situation where the court feels that such other unspecified relief is indispensable for the interest of justice and fairness. He also argued that if we set aside the impugned decision only, allowing the criminal proceeding to continue, the case shall simply hang on a limbo as a stale one, plunging the whole thing to a state of nihility like a debased asteroid.<br/>We could not agree more on the contention that keeping the case alive would result in absurdity. This is a case where we have irreversibly concluded that the FIR disclose no offence. We have also projected decisions of impeccable authority to portray that a case commenced with an invertebrate FIR is normal ‘quod casseture’. Additionally we are swayed that the whole exercise was undertaken with a view to malign the Petitioner, to wreck vengeance on her.<br/><br/>Hence, we find no reason to jettison what Mr. Haque proffered on this question. Having examined the authorities Mr. Huq cited,  we remain more than satisfied that they lend inundating support to the view that when foundation has been created , we can travel beyond the strictly specified terms of the Rule, if the interest of justice so warrant, without which justice shall cry in wilderness. In addition to the cases Mr. Haque submitted, we can also look at the case of the Bangladesh Italian Marble Works Ltd –v- Government of Bangladesh and others (Special Issue, 2006 BLT, High Court Division, affirmed by the Appellate Division in the case Khandakar Delwar Hussain and others –v- Bangladesh Italian Marble Works Ltd. 18 BLT AD 2010, page 329) popularly known as the 5<sup>th</sup> Amendment Case, to be guided by, in this respect. In that case the directions were passed beyond the specified terms of the Rule.   The Indian Supreme Court’s decision in the State of Kerala -v- TP Roshan (AIR 1979 SC 765) also provides exquisite guideline in this respect, where K. Iyer J, in delivering the judgment for the Indian Supreme Court, stated at paragraph 14 of the judgment at page 770; ‘In the end, writ petitioner won the battle but lost the war, for she got an abstract declaration that her exclusion was invalid but was denied the concrete direction to be admitted into the college.’ In that case the Kerala High Court, whose decision was modified by the Supreme Court, as just stated, observed (reproduced at paragraph 13 of the Supreme Court’s judgment at page 770); ‘We grant a declaration to the writ petitioner to that effect. We deny effective relief to the writ petitioner on account of non- joinder of the selected candidates...’<br/><br/>To cure the frustration that the High Court’s limited relief caused to the writ petitioner, and indeed to enable them to win the war as well, not only the battle, the Supreme Court made a very elaborate and compreh-ensive direction upon the respondents, as can be seen from paragraphs 33, 34,35,36, 37,38,39, 40 41 and 42 of the decision at pages 775,and 776, asking the latter to create new vacancies to accommodate 30 students , so that the petitioners can obtain admission without disturbing or prejudicing  the interest of those students who had already been  admitted into the college, who were not made parties in the writ petition.. In channeling  this rather extra-ordinary direction, the Supreme Court, obviously travelled far beyond the terms of the Rule.   As a matter of concealed truth, should we decide to set the subject criminal proceeding aside, we will not really be departing from the terms of the Rule, we will simply permeate into the extended zone of the Rule, we will do something to supplement the Rule, to put required strength to the Rule so that it can fulfill the purpose for which it was animated. There can no doubt that by demonstrating that the FIR disclosed no offence, and that the respondents resorted to malafide exercise of power, the Petitioner has certainly laid down, not only a foundation, but an inviolable one.<br/><br/>If we part with this judgment by simply setting aside the impugned direction, that will lead to an irretrievable stalemate. In Justice K. Iyer’s language, the Petitioner will win the battle, only to lose the war.<br/>We do not, therefore, have any hesitation to say that it is not our desire to deliver a judgment of futility, a barren one, and that it is very much within our competence to set the subject criminal proceeding aside, without which move no real purpose would be served. We would, therefore, not confine ourselves to the specified term of the  Rule ,but would exercise our discretion and grant ‘such other or further relief as we deem fit and proper’, and thereby set the whole proceeding aside, bearing  in mind that keeping the still born babe unburied, will only spread stinks.<br/><br/>The Rule is, therefore, entitled to be braced with triumph, not only to the extent of seeing the impugned order at rest, but also to the extent of watching the burial of the still born.<br/><br/>A fortiori, the Rule is made absolute as stated above, and the proceeding of the Tejgaon Police Station Case no 97, dated 27<sup>th</sup> March 2002, under Sections 409, 418, 201, 217, 218, 109 of the Penal Code, and Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947l, is set aside, so far as the same relates to the instant Petitioner only.<br/><br/>There is no order on cost.<br/><strong>        <br/>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Moreover, the injuries</strong><strong> present on the dead body of the deceased were not consistent with suicidal death due to hanging. The ligature mark on the neck was post-mortem.

Fate of the convict-appellant and result of the case would have been the same whether it would have been tried either as a Nari-o-Shishu case by the Tribunal or as a Sessions case by learned Sessions Judge and if section 11(ka) of the Ain of 2000 was not attracted in respect of convict-appellant the offence of section 302 of the Penal Code could be very much pressed into service against the convict-appellant, and he could be conveniently tried and convicted for offence of section 302 of the Penal Code.</strong><br/><br/><strong>In the event of sending the case either to Tribunal or Court of Session for fresh trial</strong><strong> proceeding would be protracted which cannot be allowed in the interest of true dispensation of criminal Justice. Since offence of murder punishable under section</strong><strong> 302 of the Penal Code was carried to the door of convict-appellant he can be very much convicted for offence of section 302 of the Penal Code and as such we convert the offence of section 11(ka) of The Ain of 2000 to offence of section 302 of Penal Code. Convict-appellant, thus stands convicted for offence of section 302 of the Code. ...(73, 74, 78 and 86)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 374</strong><br/><strong>In respect of sentence of condemned prisoner, it appears that he was aged about 27 years when he was examined under section 342 of the Code.

Ziaul Karim, J:</strong></span><br/> <br/>This reference under Section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (briefly as the Code) has been made by learned Judge of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Jhenaidah (briefly as Tribunal), for confirmation of death sentence of condemned-prisoner.<br/> <br/>By the above appeals the appellant has challenged the legality and propriety of the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 02-11-2006 passed by learned Judge of Tribunal, convicting the appellant under Section 11(Ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain 2000(briefly as Ain 2000) and sentencing him to death by hanging and also to pay a fine of Tk.25,000/-.<br/> <br/>This death reference and all the above appeals having arisen out of a common judgment, these have been heard together and are being disposed of by this judgment.<br/> <br/>The prosecution case as projected in the first information report (briefly as FIR) and unfurled at trial are that Moyna Khatun (since deceased) was married with accused Sonowar Hossain Joarder on 11-05-2003. After marriage she used to live in her conjugal home with her accused husband. During their wedlock one female child born. Her husband demanded Tk.1,00,000/- to her as dowry. Failing which her accused husband used to torture her physically and mentally. Finding no other alternative she gave Tk.80,000/- to her accused husband by selling her share from paternal property. Lastly on 04-03-2005 her accused husband after severe beating droved her out from the conjugal home for the cause of bringing rest dowry for Tk.20,000/-. Later, she took shelter to her paternal home. As she had no means to pay dowry, so she returned to conjugal home on 14-03-2005(briefly as P.O.) wherein on the night following her accused husband assaulted her indiscriminately causing her instantaneous death. On the following day i.e. on 15-03-2005 at 4:00 p.m. the incident was informed to her parent’s house. Later, her sister Parul Khatun (P.W.2) and her uncle Yead Ali(P.W.7) rushed to the P.O. and found the dead-body of her sister. The body-bore multiple injuries having blackish in nature. After holding Post mortem examination the dead-body was handed over to them and they buried her. It was believed that she was killed by her accused husband as she failed to meet the demand for dowry for her greedy husband. With these allegations her sister Parul Khatun (P.W.2) filed a petition of complaint before the Magistrate, Jhenaidah. Later, it was referred to the local Police Station wherein it was recorded as Jhenaidah Sadar Police Station case no. 08 dated 09-04-2005 corresponding to G.R. no. 78 of 2005.<br/> <br/>Police after investigation submitted charge sheet under Section 11(ka) of the Ain, 2000 accusing the condemned-prisoner as accused and his other relations were let off from the charge-sheet.<br/> <br/>Eventually, the accused was called upon to answer the charge under Section 11(ka) of the Ain 2000 which was read over to him who pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/> <br/>In course of trial the prosecution in all examined thirteen witnesses out of fourteen charge sheeted witnesses and the defence examined none.<br/> <br/>After closer of the prosecution case, the accused was examined under section 342 of the Code and again he repeated his innocence but led no evidence in defence.<br/> <br/>The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses are that of innocence. It is divulged in defence that the deceased Moyna Khatun was suffering from abdominal pain and for such cause she committed suicide by hanging, but due to internal feud between them the accused was falsely implicated at the instance of his local rivals.<br/> <br/>After trial the learned Judge of the Tribunal convicted the accused as aforesaid holding:</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">It was proved by evidence that at the relevant time of occurrence the deceased was staying with her accused husband in the conjugal home;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The post-mortem report clearly indicates that the deceased Moyna Khatun bore six injuries upon her body and death was caused due to asphyxia as a result of strangulation which was anti-mortem and homicidal in nature;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The prosecution by uniform and consistent evidence succeeded to prove the case against the accused beyond all reasonable doubt.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State supports the reference and submits that admittedly the deceased was the wife of accused and they were staying in the same conjugal home; so the husband is duty bound to explain the cause of death. He adds that the prosecution successfully proved the case but the accused failed to discharge his burden towards the cause of death of his wife. In support of his contentions he refers the case of <em><strong>Sheikh Muksed Ali Vs. The State</strong></em> 10 MLR(AD)-27 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>Section 302- Husband’s liability in wife killing case-</em><br/><em>When it is established that the husband and his deceased wife were residing in the same house at the time of the occurrence the husband owes an obligation to explain the circumstance under which his wife died. When the explanation so offered is proved false and the victim is found to have died due to injuries which were ante-mortem and homicidal in nature, the conviction and sentence of the convict husband is held by the apex court to be perfectly justified.</em><br/><br/><em>From the materials on record, particularly from the evidence of P.W.6, it is seen that death to the victim was done in a violent manner i.e. by throttling. P.W.6 in his evidence had clearly stated that the injuries noticed by him in the body of the deceased were ante-mortem and homicidal in nature. The deceased was the wife of the convict and was with him at the time of death. The convict tried to explain the death of the deceased by taking the plea that the deceased committed suicide. The explanation so offered was found not correct because of the evidence of PW.6 who stated that death of the victim was due to asphyxia resulting from the injuries noticed by him and that the injuries were ante-mortem and homicidal in nature.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The learned Counsel lastly submits that after considering the evidence on record the learned Judge of the Tribunal rightly convicted the accused which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/> <br/>The learned Counsels appearing for the convict-appellant by their common contentions seek to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on five fold arguments:<br/> <br/><strong><u>Firstly:</u></strong><strong>  </strong>The F.I.R. was lodged after long lapse of time which cast a doubt upon the prosecution case. In support of their contentions they refer the case of Abdul Latif alias Budu and 6 others Vs. State 44 DLR-492 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>FIR- delay- The Court has always viewed First Information Report with grave suspicion when there had been unexplained delay in lodging it. It can be presumed that the delay was used for manipulation of the prosecution story.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><u>Secondly:</u></strong> The prosecution failed to prove the charge of demanding dowry against the appellant and all the witnesses categorically stated that the deceased died by committing suicide but the doctor most erroneously provided a different opinion which cannot be sustained. In support of their contentions they refer the case of Abdur Rahman Syed Vs. The State 44 DLR-556 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em> Section 45- </em><em>Deposition of a doctor giving certain opinion formed by examining certain facts is not an absolute truth.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>They next refers the case of Kalu Sheikh alias Kalam Sheikh and others Vs. The State 54 DLR-502 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em> Section 45- </em><em>The evidence of an expert cannot alone be treated and used to form basis to find an accused guilty and to form basis of his conviction independent of the substantive evidence of the PWs. in the case are required.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><u>Thirdly: </u></strong> It is a case of no evidence inasmuchas the prosecution failed to prove the charge under section 11(Ka) of the Ain-2000. Therefore, the trial held by the Tribunal was without jurisdiction. In support of their contentions they refer the case of Osena Begum alias Babuler Ma and another Vs. The State 55 DLR-299 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em> Sections 10(1) &amp; 14</em><br/><em>Jurisdiction–The moment the Adalat finds no proof of existence of motive of dowry for any offence within the mischief of the Ain, it must take its hands off the case. In such situation the only course remains open for the Adalat would be to send the case record to the Sessions Judge for trial.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><u>Fourthly:</u></strong>  After inclusion of the offence laid down in section 11(ka) by the Ain 2000 the Jurisdiction of the Sessions Judge has been ousted, so the case should be sent back for re-trial. In support of their contentions they refer the case of Firoz Miah Vs. State 51 DLR-37 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em> By inclusion of the offence of the above ordinance in the schedule to the special Powers Act the jurisdiction of the Sessions Court has been ousted. Now, as the death is proved but not for demand of dowry, the present case is sent back to the Sessions Court for trial.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><u>Fifthly:</u></strong> The Court below without considering the materials on record most illegally convicted the accused which cannot be sustained.<br/>        In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to their submissions.<br/>        Let us now weigh and sift the evidence on record as adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/>        P.W.1 Dr. Sheikh Md. Aminul Haq deposed that on 17-03-2005 he was posted as pathologist in Jhenaidah Sadar hospital. On that day he, as a Chairman of medical board held autopsy upon the cadaver of Moyna Khatun identified by C-Newaz. Other two members were Dr. Dulal Chakraborty and Dr. Swapon Kundu. He found the following injuries:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“</em>তার দেহে থুতনীর এক ইঞ্চি নিচে গোলাকার রশির দাগ ছিল, (ফাঁসির চিহ্ন <em>ligature mark</em>) ছিল। <em>Base</em> আধা ইঞ্চি চওড়া। এর ঠিক নিচে আর একটা গোলাকার রশির  দাগ ছিল, বিস্তৃতি ছিল আধা ইঞ্চি চওড়া। মুখের উভয় পাশে এবং কপালে বেশী  কালো ছিল। ডান পাঁজরের মাঝামাঝি তিন  ইঞ্চি * এক ইঞ্চি জখম ছিল। ডান উর্রর  নীচের দিকে পিছনের দিকে তিন ইঞ্চি * এক ইঞ্চি আরও একটা জখম ছিল। বাম উরুর  পিছনে আরো একটা  কালো জখম ছিল, চার ইঞ্চি * এক ইঞ্চি  বিস্তৃত। মুখের পাশ ও কপাল ও চামড়ার  নীচে <em>congested</em> ছিল। মাথার ঝিল্লি ও মস্তিস্ক <em>congested</em> ছিল। শ্বাসনালী  উভয় ফুসফুস  <em>congested</em> পাওয়া গেছে।<br/><br/>শব-ব্যবচ্ছেদ করে নিম্নর্রপ জখম পাইঃ<br/>মুখের পাশ,  কপাল, বাম কানের উপরে কপালের পিছনের অংশ সহ জখমে <em>highly congested</em> ছিল। <em>ligature</em> মার্ক গুলো অতিরিক্ত <em>congested</em> ছিল।<br/>সর্বসম্মত মতামত দেই যে, শ্বাসরুদ্ধ করা হয়েছিল গলায় রশি পেঁচিয়ে, ময়নাকে মৃত্যুর পূর্বে ধরা হয় এবং এভাবে তার মৃতাূ হয়। এটা ছিল নরহত্যামূলক। ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>He proved the post-mortem as Exhbt. 1 and his signature on it 1/1. He further stated that deceased Moyna Khatun did not commit suicide rather she was strangulated to death.<br/> <br/>In cross-examination he stated that the post mortem report was held with reference of U.D. case no. 21 of 2005; the inquest also held under the said reference; victim was strangulated to death, but not by committing suicide. He denied the suggestion that deceased Moyna Khatun committed suicide by hanging and his report is not correct.<br/> <br/>P.W. 2 Parul Khatun is the informant and sister of deceased. She deposed that deceased Moyna Khatun was married with accused Sonowar. She died in her in-laws house at village Radakantapur P.S. sadar District-Jhenaidah. She committed suicide by hanging as she was suffering from abdominal pain; she informed the incident to the Court at the advise of one Ranjan who took her L.T.I. on a plain paper and she had no knowledge, what was stated in the papers; she identified the accused Sonowar on dock.<br/> <br/>In cross-examination she stated that deceased Moyna was earlier married with one Bachuchu Miah’ but she was divorced; later the deceased married accused Sonowar at her own will; Sonowar never demanded dowry to her; they were found to led happy conjugal life; she found the dead-body of Moyna but did not see any injury therein; thereafter she sent Uzzal to the Police station; on the following day inquest was held; in their heridity there was a tendency of suicide; her father, uncle  and one cousin committed suicide by hanging; deceased Moyna left one daughter name Mamata.<br/> <br/>P.W. 3 Abdul Goni Mondol aged about ninety years, a local witness.

He deposed that he heard about the death of Moyna at the house of accused Sonowar but he had no knowledge about such death; he also stood as one of the witness in the inquest report ( Exhbt. 2, 2/2}.<br/><br/>Cross-examination was declined.<br/> <br/>P.W. 7 Yead Ali Sheikh is khalu of deceased; he deposed that Moyna died at the house of her accused husband Sonowar at village Radakantapur. He heard that she died by hanging; he identified the accused on dock.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that he heard that Moyna committed suicide for her abdominal pain; accused Sonowar was not found in his house at that time.<br/> <br/>P.W.8 Hasanuzzaman Hasan is the brother of deceased Moyna; he deposed that his sister died by abdominal pain at the house of her husband Sonowar; he identified accused Sonowar on dock.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that Moyna was suffering from abdominal pain and heard that she committed suicide.<br/> <br/>P.W.9 Abdul Quader is the cousin of deceased; he deposed that her (deceased) husband Sonowar hails from village Radakantapur P.S. and district Jhenaidah He heard that Moyna committed suicide by hanging; he identified accused Sonowar on dock.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that Moyna was suffering from abdominal pain but she did not disclose such fact to the others.<br/> <br/>P.W. 10, Sumi Khatun is the aunt of Moyna; she deposed that after two days of the occurrence she visited in-laws house of Moyna; she identified accused Sonowar on dock.<br/>In cross-examination she stated that deceased Moyna was suffering from abdominal pain but she did not disclose about her suicide.<br/> <br/>P.W.11 A.S.I. Robiul Islam deposed that on 16-03-2005 he was posted at the Jhenaidah Sadar Police Station; he investigated unnatural death case no. 21 of 2005; he found the dead-body of deceased Moyna Khatun at the house of accused Sonowar; he found injuries at the back, thigh, leg and ankle of deceased; also there were mark of violence with swelling injuries upon the person of deceased; then he sent the dead-body to the morgue for autopsy; before it he held inquest upon the cadaver of Moyna; he proved the same as Exhbt. 2, and his signature on it exhbt. 2/3.

He found marks of injuries at the back of deceased.<br/><br/>In cross- examination he denied the suggestion that there was no mark of injuries upon the person of deceased Moyna Khatun.<br/> <br/>P.W.13 S.I. Nasiruddin deposed that at the relevant time he was posted at the Jhenaidah Police Station; the case was entrusted to him for investigation; the case was recorded by S.I. Siddartha Sankor Dey (Exhbts. 4, 4/1, 4L, 4L /1,4L /2). Subsequently it was transformed into Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan case.During investigation he visited the P.O., prepared sketch map and index (Exhbt. 5,5(L), recorded the statements of the witnesses and arrested the accused; thereafter submitted charge-sheet against the accused Sonowar.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that the deceased Moyna Khatun was murdered on 14-03-2005 and the case was filed in the court and the FIR was recorded on 09-04-2005; he interrogated the informant Parul Khatun who supported the allegations made in the FIR; it was stated in FIR that Moyna assaulted to death by accused; he denied the suggestion that deceased Moyna committed suicide by hanging; being influenced by informant he submitted the charge-sheet.<br/> <br/>These are all of the evidence on record adduced by the prosecution.<br/><br/>In course of trial the prosecution in all examined thirteen witnesses, of them P.W.1 held autopsy upon the cadaver and P.W. 2 sister of deceased. P.W. 3 and 4 are the locals. P.W. 6 is the uncle, P.W.7 is khalu, P.W. 8 is the brother, P.W.9 is the cousin of the deceased. P.W 10 is aunt of deceased, P.W.11, 12 and 13 are the Police personnel, of whom P.W. 13 submitted charge-sheet.<br/> <br/>According to the prosecution the deceased Moyna Khatun was done to death for the cause of dowry. Such allegations were disowned by the defence. It’s definite case is that the deceased Moyna Khatun committed suicide by hanging<br/> <br/>We should bear in mind, credibility of testimony oral and circumstantial, depends considerably on a judicial evaluation of the totality, not isolated scrutiny. When dealing with the serious question of guilt or innocence of persons charged with crime, the following principles should be taken into consideration.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>a)   The onus of proving everything essential to the establishment of the charge against the accused lies on the prosecutor.<br/>b)   The evidence must be such asto exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.<br/>c)   In matters of doubt it is safer to acquit than to condemn, for it is better that several guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person suffer.<br/>d)   There must be clear and unequivocal proof of the corpus delicit.<br/>e)   The hypothesis of delinquency should be consistent with all the facts proved.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Inspite of the presumption of truth attached to oral evidence under oath if the Court is not satisfied, the evidence inspite of oath is of no avail. <br/> <br/>It is a wife killing case. In such case there would be no eye witness of the occurrence apart-from the inmates of the house, who may refuse to tell truth. The locals may not come forward to tell the truth. So, the prosecution is therefore, to rely on the circumstantial evidence.<br/> <br/>For the cause of intimacy with the accused some witness may hide the truth of occurrence. P.W. 2, Parul Khatun sister of the deceased categorically narrated the entire episode in the petition of complaint to the effect that her sister deceased Moyna Khatun was done to death by her accused husband for the cause of dowry. Soon-after the occurrence she rushed to the scene and found the dead-body of her sister. The body-bore multiple injuries but during trial he deposed that her sister committed suicide but she admitted that at the time of occurrence her sister was residing with her accused husband  at her conjugal home at Radakantapur. Similarly PWs. 2-10 admitted that the deceased Moyna Khatun was found dead at the house of her conjugal home when she was staying with her accused husband. They, all identified the accused Sonowar on dock. A three membered medical board headed by P.W.1 Dr. Sk. Md. Aminul Haq, held autopsy upon the cadaver. They found the following injuries:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>(1)        One circular ligature mark 1″ below the chin around the neck, base of the Sroove ½″ in wide, (2) One circular ligature mark, 1” below the above ligature mark around the neck, base of the Sroove ½″ in wide, (3) Face-both side, forehead unduly black, (4) One blackish area over right middle posterior maxilla ray line 3″ x 1″, (5) One blackish area over lower back and of right thigh 3″ x 1″, (6) One blackish area over back of left thigh middle area 4″ x 1″. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>On dissection, congestion was found, in and around the injury nos. 3-6 and left temporal, region skin and soft tissues under and above below the both ligature marks (nos. 1 and 2) was found highly, congested, trachea-was found congested, the P.M. was done by a medical board vide memo. no. C.S. Shemi, 600, dated 17-03-2005 with the under signed doctors.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>They opined that death was due to asphyxia as a result of strangulation which was ante mortem and homicidal in nature.<br/> <br/>Moreso, PWs-11 and 12 testified that they found injuries upon the cadaver of Moina Khatun. PW-13 investigated the case and he stated that PW-2 informant Parul Khatun categorically narrated the allegations to him.<br/> <br/>It is a matter of great regret that PWs. 2,3,4,6-10, by suppressing the truth testified that the deceased Moina Khatun committed suicide by hanging for the cause of abdominal pain. It is to be noted that even the full sister (PW-2) of the deceased forgetting the pain of losing her sister Moina khatun deliberately stated that her sister committed suicide. But they, this Court thinks, have failed to hush up the truth in any manner. Besides deviation by the informant from what has been narrated in the FIR for the reason of subsequent “ compromise” itself shall not tarnish  the entire prosecution. In this regard the following observations as made by this Court in the case of Khorshed (Md) alias Khorshed vs. The State 51 DLR-317 deserves to be mentioned here:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“First information report is not substantive evidence. It can be used to corroborate or contradict the maker thereof when the FIR is lodged within minimum possible time, such FIR story should not be disbelieved only because of any such result on the part of the informant.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>After initiating FIR, the informant is nobody excepting a mere witness. The narration in the FIR is not the first and last word, the truth is unfolded only in trial. The inconsistency in testimony when occurs due to deliberate suppression of fact favouring the accused only for the reason of compromise by the informant with the accused party, does not outright tarnish the prosecution case.<br/> <br/>In the case before us we have already got that for the reason of “compromise” the informant and other PWs. have opted to save the accused by deliberately hiding the truth. PWs.2-10 including the informant (PW-2) have deliberately testified a different story favourable to defence asto cause of death of the unfortunate victim. Thus they cannot be expected to disclose the detail story of “ demand of dowry”. The motive of the murderous episode in Court. Besides demand of dowry is an event which generally takes place in absence of eye witnesses. No outsider and the near relative of the wife are expected to have direct knowledge about it. Normally such unethical demand is raised in conjugal home of the wife.<br/> <br/>Let us now consider the medico- legal feature coupled with the injuries found on the neck and person of the victim.<br/> <br/>According to MODI’s Text book of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology violent death resulting chiefly from asphyxia are hanging strangulation throttling, Suffocation and Drowning.<br/> <br/>Hanging is a form of death produced by suspending the body with a continuous ligature mark round the neck. The mark is usually situated above the thyroid cartilage between the larynx and the chin and is directed obliquely upward following the line of the mandible (lower jaw) and interrupted at the back or may show an irregular impression of  a knot, reaching the mastoid processes behind the ears towards the point suspension. On the contrary strangulation is a violent form of death which results from constructing the neck by means of a non-continuous ligature mark or any other means without suspending the body. Such ligature mark usually situated lowdown in the neck below the thyroid cartilage and encircling the neck horizontally and completed.  <br/> <br/>It is in page 192 of the Parikh’s Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology. Fifth Edition.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em> Whether death was due to hanging”</em><br/><em>It is not uncommon in India to kill a victim and then suspend his body (post mortem hanging) from a tree or rafter to mislead the relatives and the police. In such a case, a ligature mart is usually found. Therefore, when a person is found dead and his body suspended, no opinion can be given from the ligature mark alone. Death could be attributed to hanging if one finds(1) a ligature mark with petechial hemorrhages and ecchymoses into or around its substance, (2) marks of dribbled saliva, (3) tear of the intima of carotid arteries with extravasation of blood within their walls, (4) congestion and hemorrhage in the lymph modes above and below the ligature mark, (5) fracture or dislocation of cervical vertebra and (6) absence of fatal injuries and poisoning:</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is in page 257 of the MODI’s Medical  Jurisprudence and Toxicology. Twenty Second Edition:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“ (1) Whether death was caused by hanging “In India, it is a common practice that to kill a victim and then to suspend the body from a tree or a rafter to avert suspicion. It is, therefore, necessary to find out if hanging was the cause of death in suspended body. The presence of ligature mark alone is not diagnostic of death from hanging, inasmuch as, being a purely cadaveric phenomenon it may be produced if a body has been suspended after death. Often a body is suspended after murder to simulate suicidal hanging. In such cases, a close examination of the direction of the friction marks on the fibers of the rope at the point of suspension, may indicate whether the body was pulled up by some one else or dropped down by its weight. Casper has illustrated by experiments that a mark similar to the one observed in persons hanged alive can be produced if suspended within two hours or even a longer period after death. Besides, a similar mark may also be produced by dragging a body along the ground with a cord passed round the neck soon after death. However, one can safely say that death was due to hanging, if, in addition to the cord mark, there was dribbling of saliva from the angle of mouth, ecchymosis and slight abrasions around the ligature mark, laceration of the intima of the carotid arteries with extravasation of blood within their walls and the post mortem sings of asphyxia, besides if there are no evidence of a struggle, scratches and nail marks, fatal injuries or poisoning.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the instant case besides the ligature mark other signs and symptoms of death like (1) One circular ligature mark 1″ below the chin around the neck, base of the sroove ½″ in wide, (2) One circular ligature mark 1″ below the above ligature mark around the neck, (3) Face–both side, forehead unduly black, (4) One blackish area over Rt. mid. Posterior maxilla-ray line 3″ x 1″, (5) One blackish area over lower back and of Rt. thigh 3″x 1″, (6) One blackish area over back of Lt. thigh mid area 4″ x 1″.<br/> <br/>Therefore it appears that there are non-continuous ligature mark at the neck of deceased, which is the violent forms of death caused by strangulation. So in the present case the death of the deceased could not be attributed to hanging.<br/> <br/>In the instant case the injuries, external and internal found by the doctors are consistent with their opinion that death was due to asphyxia as a result of strangulation which was ante-mortem and homicidal in nature. Moreover, the injuries present on the dead body of the deceased were not consistent with suicidal death due to hanging. The ligature mark on the neck was post-mortem. No symptom of suicidal hanging was present.<br/> <br/>According to the medico legal evidence it has been conclusively proved that the deceased Moina Khatun homicidally strangulated to death.<br/> <br/>Undisputedly the deceased, who was the wife of the accused, met with death in the conjugal home, while she was living with her accused husband. Presence of the accused in the house at the material time is not disputed. No plea of alibi has been taken. Moreover presence of the accused at the material time is supported by the evidence on record. Thus the death of the deceased was in the special knowledge of the accused. He knew how she met with death. Ordinarily an accused has no obligation to account for the death for which he is placed on trial. But in a case like the present one where the accused has special knowledge of the death of the deceased, under section 106 of the Evidence Act, he is under obligation to explain how the deceased died. If he fails to explain the death of the deceased or if his explanation is found false the irresistible inference would be that none besides him caused the death of the deceased. With this regard reliance may be placed in the cases of (1) Abdul Motaleb Howlader vs. State 5 MLR (AD) 362= 6 BLC(AD)1, (2) Elais Hossain vs. State, 54 DLR (AD) 78, (3) Golam Mortuza, vs. State, 2004 BLD (AD)201=9 BLC (AD)229, (4) Gouranga Kumar Shaha, vs. State 2 BLC (AD) 126, (5) Dipak Kumar Sarker, Vs.

It is not the case of the petitioner that he was away from the home while death occurred to his wife or that some miscreants whom he could not resist caused death of his wife. The petitioner tried to explain the cause of death by stating that the deceased committed suicide by hanging. The explanation offered as to how death occurred to the petitioner’s wife was found to be not correct because of the evidence of P.Ws. 12 and 13, the Medical Officers who held post-mortem examination of the dead-body of petitioner’s wife. The Medical Officers have stated that cause of death of the victim was homicidal and not suicidal. Since death to the wife was caused while she was residing in the house of her husband, the convict petitioner, is competent to say how death occurred to his wife and that the explanation which he offered having been found untrue, the conviction and sentence that was passed by the learned Sessions Judge has rightly been affirmed by the High Court Division.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The facts and circumstances of the above case are fully consistent with those of the case in our hand and as such the principle of law enunciated in that case is applicable in this case.<br/> <br/>It is pertinent to point out that the accused has no obligation to account for the death for which he is placed for trial. The murder having taken place while the wife was with the custody of her husband, then the accused husband under Section 106 of the Evidence Act, is under obligation to explain how his wife had met with her death. In absence of any explanation coming from his side it seems, none other than the accused husband was responsible for causing death.<br/> <br/>It is well settled that when it is established that the husband and wife were residing in the same house at the relevant time, the husband is duty bound to explain the circumstances how his wife met her death and in absence of any explanation coming form the husband, irresistible presumption is that it is the husband who is responsible for her death. In this regard reliance can be placed in the case of State Vs. Aynul Huq 9 MLR 393= 9 BLC 529. This view receives support in the case of Gouranga Kumar Saha vs. State 2 BLC (AD) 126. Abdul Mutaleb Howlader vs. State 5 MLR(AD)92= 6 BLC(AD)1, Dipok Kumar Sarkar vs. State reported in 40 DLR(AD) 139 and Sudhir Kumar Das alias Khudi Vs.

There is absolutely no reason to disbelieve those competent witnesses, therefore, the same are invulnerable to the credibility.<br/> <br/>The convict-appellant stood charged and convicted for offence of section 11(ka) of the Ain 2000. Section 11(ka) enjoins that if the husband of a woman or father, mother, guardian, relation or any other person on behalf of the husband for dowry cause death to a woman or ventures to cause death or causes hurt or have a try to cause hurt that husband, father, mother, guardian, relation or the person (a) shall stand sentenced to death for causing death or shall stand sentenced to imprisonment for life for mounting endeavour to cause death and in both the counts he shall be, also, liable to pay fine and (b) shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life causing hurt or be sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a period not more than 14(fourteen) years and less than 5(five) years for striving to cause hurt and in both counts shall be liable to fine.<br/> <br/>In order to attraction 11(Ka) of the Ain 2000, it is to be proved that death was caused in view of demand of dowry put forward from the side of husband or father, mother, guardian, or relation of the husband or any person for and on behalf of husband.<br/> <br/>From circumstantial evidence it has come to light that convict-appellant had caused the death of deceased and a clear case of murder had been brought home to the door of appellant.<br/>This takes us to a legal debate of fundamental character, which is,</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Whether the convict-appellant can be graced with a verdict of acquittal when charge of section 11(ka) of the Ain of 2000 could not be pressed against him;</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>When a clear case of murder has been established by circumstantial and medical evidence against him whether the convict-appellant can be convicted for the offence of murder punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Whether the case is required to be sent back to Tribunal or Court of sessions for fresh-trial.</em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Section 25 of The Ain of 2000 postulates that Tribunal defined section 2( Gha) shall be treated as Court of Sessions and Tribunal shall be able to exercise all powers of Sessions Court in holding trial of an offence.<br/> <br/>Section 26 of The Ain 2000 enshrines that Tribunal so constituted shall be recorded as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal and shall be constituted with one Judge and Judge of Tribunal shall be appointed from amongst District and Sessions Judge to the Government, if necessary, shall appoint any District and Sessions Judge as Tribunal Judge in addition to his charge. Section 20 further enjoins that under the section Additional District and Sessions Judge shall, Also, stand included as District and Sessions Judge.<br/> <br/>From the above it becomes manifestly clear that a Tribunal trying a case under the Ain of 2000 is, also, a Court of District and Sessions Judge. When a Judge sits in a Tribunal or Special Tribunal Case holding trial of an offence under a Statute or Special Statute is a Tribunal or Special Tribunal and a Judge when sits in Sessions Case trying an offence punishable under Penal sections of Penal Code sits as Sessions Judge.<br/> <br/>The case in hand, although, tried by a Tribunal constituted under The Ain of 2000 that Tribunal was, also, the court of Sessions. In the judgment, learned Judge was described as District and Sessions Judge, Jhenaidah as well as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat, Jhenaidah. Judgment demonstrates that learned District and Sessions Judge has been, also, exercising the power and Jurisdiction of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal. Fate of the convict-appellant and result of the case would have been the same whether it would have been tried either as a Nari-O-Shishu case by the Tribunal or as a sessions case by learned Sessions Judge and if section 11(ka) of the Ain of 2000 was not attracted in respect of convict-appellant the offence of section 302 the Penal Code could be very much pressed into service against the convict-appellant, and he could be conveniently tried and convicted for offence of section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>In the case of Asiman Begum vs. The State 51 DLR(AD)-18 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>When it is found after a full trial that there was a mis-trial or trial without jurisdiction, the Court of appeal before directing a fresh trial by an appropriate Court should also see whether such direction should at all be given in the facts and circumstances of a particular case.</em><br/><em>It is found that there was no legal evidence to support the conviction then in that case it would be wholly wrong to direct a retrial because it would then be a useless exercise. Further, the prosecution should not be given a chance to fill up its lacuna by bringing new evidence which it did not or could not produce in the first trial.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>As regards remand of the case, we may profitably refer the above decision in the case of Asiman Begum vs. state reported in 51 DLR(AD) 18 wherein it has been decided that the remand order for trial of the case as a Sessions case in the particular circumstances of the case will be a mere formality because Nari-O-Shishu Case no.2 of 1996, although tried under Bishes Bidhan Ain, 1995 by a Bishesh Adalat, the presiding officer was no other than the Sessions Judge himself and, as such, it was unlikely that the result would be anything different if the case was tried by him as a Sessions case. Appellate Division, thus sent the appeal to High Court Division to consider the case on merit and to pass whatever order or orders it might think appropriate in the interest of justice.<br/> <br/>In State vs. Abul Kalam , 5 BLC 230 one Abul Kalam stood convicted for offence of section 10(1) of The Ain of 1995 for murder of his wife for dowry by learned Sessions Judge and Special Tribunal no.1, Noakhali. Consequential sentence was death. Condemned-prisoner preferred Jail appeal and, also, regular Criminal appeal before High Court Division. There had been, also, Death Reference. A Division Bench of High Court Division heard Death Reference, Jail appeal and Criminal appeal together and disposed of those by a common Judgment. High Court Division found that there had not been cogent evidence asto committing murder for dowry and no evidence had been led as to the real cause of killing of wife by husband and held that the case did not come under section 10(1) of The Ain of 1995 and the case comes under section 302 of the Penal Code. The High Court Division further held that Sessions Judge, in fact, was the Special Tribunal no.1 who tired the case and for no fault of the accused the case had been tried as Special Tribunal case. High Court Division instead of sending the case back for fresh trial under Section 302 of The Penal Code by learned Sessions Judge disposed of the appeal. High Court Division altered conviction from section 10(1) of The Ain,1995 to one under section 302 of the Penal Code. Sentence of death was altered to one of imprisonment for life. The High Court Division in rendering decision took into account the case of Asiman Begum vs. State (Supra).<br/> <br/>In the case of Shibu Pada Acharjee vs. State reported in 56 DLR 285, accused-appellant was convicted for offence of section 4© of The  Ordinance of 1983 for commission of rape upon victim Ratna Rani but ingredients of section 4© of the Ordinance of 1983 could not be brought home to accused-appellant. In the case is had been laid down:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“ To take the prosecution out of Court on a question of technicality, will be a travesity of Justice and technicality must bend to cause of justice inasmuch as ends of law is Justice.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Accused-appellant can be fastened for offence of section 376 of the Penal Code and conviction under section 4(c) of the Ordinance of 1983 can be altered to one of section 376 of The Penal Code.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the said case conviction under section 4(c) of The Ordinance of 1983 was altered to one of section 376 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>In the case of The State vs. Mahbur Sheikh alias Mahabur ILNJ 139 i.e. I The Lawyers &amp; Jurist 139 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Since offence of murder punishable under section 302 of Penal Code was carried to the door of convict-appellant he can be very much convicted for offence of Section 302 of the Penal Code and as such we convert the offence of section 11(Ka) of the Ain 2000 to offence  of section 302 of the Penal Code.

There is no system or procedure in the Criminal Justice administration method or Rule to exercise such discretion. In sentencing process, two important factors come out- which shall shape appropriate sentence (i) Aggravating factor and (ii) Mitigating factor. These two factors control the sentencing process to a great extent. But it is always to be remembered that the object of sentence should be to see that the crime does not go unpunished and the society has the satisfaction that Justice has been done and court responded to the society’s cry for Justice. Under section 302 of the Code, though a discretion has been conferred upon the Court to award two types of sentences, death or imprisonment for life, the discretion is to be exercised in accordance with the fundamental principle of criminal Justice.<br/> <br/>In the light of discussions made above and the preponderant Judicial views emerging out of the authorities referred to above we are of the view that the impugned Judgment and order of conviction and sentence under section 11(ka) of the Ain 2000 suffers from legal infirmities, but the same will be proper under section 302 of the Penal Code. In respect of sentence of condemned prisoner Sonowar Hossain Joarder, we hold that he was aged about 27 years when he was examined under section 342 of the Code. Record indicates that he is not a hard criminal and has been languishing in the condemned-cell for about six years with suffering of mental agony of death within the death-cell. Taking an account of aggravated and mitigating circumstances ends of justice will be met if the death sentence is altered to one of imprisonment for life. Condemned-prisoner Sonowar Hossain Joarder thus, stands sentenced to imprisonment for life.<br/> <br/>In the result:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(a)    Death reference no. 100 of 2006 is rejected;<br/>(b)    The impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 02-11-2006 passed by the learned Judge of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Tribunal, Jhenaidah, in Nari-O-Shishu Tribunal case no.201 of 2005 is modified to the effect that the condemned-prisoner Sonowar Hossain Joarder is convicted under Section 302 of the Penal Code and sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Tk.2000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one month more.<br/>        In view of the provisions laid in section 35A(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure the total period the condemned-prisoner Sonowar Hossain Joarder have been in custody before conviction in connection with this offence shall be deducted from the period of imprisonment for life awarded to him.<br/>(c)  Accordingly, Criminal appeal no. 4835 of 2006 and Jail appeal no. 1044 of 2006 are allowed in part with modification of conviction and sentence in above terms.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Office is directed to send down the records at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
