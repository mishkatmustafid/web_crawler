Shawkat Hossain, J.</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>On an application under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, defendant-respondents obtained the instant Rule against the judgment and decree dated 05.08.2001 and 10.08.2001 respectively passed by Subordinate Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Faridpur in Title Appeal No. 258 of 2000 reversing those dated 09.08.2000 and 14.08.2000 respectively passed by Assistant Judge, Alfadanga, Faridpur in Title Suit No. 43 of 1999 and decreed the suit.<br/><br/>Plaint case, in short, is that the suit property under lot No. 1 appertaining to C.S. Khatians-542, 543 comprising .96 acre of land of mouja Kachiagram under P.S. Alfadanga, District-Faridpur originally belonged to Bhuban Mohan Majumder, who died leaving 4 sons-Jiban Kumar Majumder, Panchanan Majumder, Nil Ratan Majumder and Kalidas Majumder. They possessed the suit land under lot No.1 and thereafter transferred the same by registered patta deed No. 2247 dated 04.07.1944 in favour of plaintiff No. 1 and delivered possession in his favour. S.A. record was duly prepared in the name of plaintiff No.1 for the aforesaid land under lot No.1 and plaintiff No.1 has been in possession of the same.<br/><br/>The suit land under lot No.2 appertaining to C.S. Khatian No.168 comprising .90 acre of land under mouja-Noapara, P.S. Alfadanga, Distirict-Faridpur originally belonged to Goher Sheikh and others. On amicable partition with the co-tenants, Goher Sheikh, Abdul Mazid, Golam Rasul and Pachu got .50 acre of land under Plot No.803 and .40 acre of land under Plot No.1278 as described in lot No.2 in their saham. Goher Sheikh and others possessed the suit land under lot No.2 and thereafter Pachu transferred .22 acre of land in favour of plaintiff No.1 by registered deed 13.11.1957; Goher transferred .45 acre of land along with other land in favour of plaintiff No.1 by registered deed dated 04.08.1958 and Abdul Alim, the son of Abdul Majid transferred .22 acre of land in favour of plaintiff No.2 (wife of plaintiff No.1) by registered deed dated 05.10.1987. Plaintiff No.1 subsequently made a heba-bil-ewaj deed dated 25.03.1968 in favour of his wife (plaintiff No.2) and transferred .11 acre of land in favour of Abdus Samad the predecessor of plaintiff Nos. 4-13 by registered deed dated 06.04.1977 (in the aforesaid deed inadvertently .11 acre was written as .22 acre). Plaintiff No.1 further transferred .11 acre of land in favour of Hosne-Ara by registered dated 20.03.1975. Hosne-Ara afterwards sold the same in favour of plaintiff No.3. C.S. recorded tenant Golam Rosul died leaving plaintiff Nos. 14-19. Plaintiff No. 1 is in possession of suit land under lot No. 1 and plaintiff Nos.2-19 are in possession of land under lot No.2, adversely against the defendants and all others. On 31.07.1999 defendants raised their claim to suit the land having S.A. record prepared wrongly in their name. Plaintiffs thus filed the above suit for declaration of title and permanent injunction.<br/><br/>Defendant Nos. 6-8 contested the suit by filing written statement contending interalia that land under lot No.2 that appertaining to C.S. Khatian No.168 originally belonged to Goher Sheikh, Abdul Mazid, Golam Rasul and Pachu Sheikh. The aforesaid tenants mortgaged the land under lot No.2 by registered mortgage deed dated 13.08.1929 and there was an agreement that on payment of money including principle money and interest thereon, they will get the property released but the above mortgage land was never released thereafter. Since they could not pay the mortgage money and interest thereon, they surrendered possession of the land in favour of Sabdul Sheikh. Sabdul Sheikh by virtue of the mortgage deed remained in possession of the land under lot No.2 with his all interest and accordingly S.A. record was prepared in his name but with wrong insertion of the name of Abdul Majid. Mazid had no interest and possession to the land under lot No.2. The mortgagors never claimed the property afterwards and Sabdul Sheikh paid rents. The heirs of Sabdul Sheikh thereafter sold .44 and 1/2 acre of land in favour of defendants by registered deed dated 13.05.1999 and delivered posses-sion of the same in their favour. Plaintiffs have/had no possession to the suit land and they filed the suit on fictitious claim.<br/> <br/>On pleadings, trial Court framed the following issues:</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Is the suit maintainable in its present form?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Is the suit barred by limitation?</li><li style="text-align:justify"> Is the suit bad for defect of parties?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Have the plaintiffs any right, title, interest and exclusive possession to the suit land?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Are the plaintiffs entitled to get relief as prayed for?</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> Trial Court, in appreciation of the facts of the pleadings and on assessment of the evidence on record, decreed the suit in part in respect of the land under lot No.1. Plaintiffs thereby preferred the appeal.<br/><br/>On appeal, appellate Court after hearing both sides and weighing the evidence on record in view of the facts of the pleadings reversed the judgment passed by the trial Court and decreed the suit.<br/><br/>In the trial Court, plaintiffs examined P.W.1 Abdul Karim Mia, P.W.2 Md. Tuku Sheikh and P.W. 3 Md. Zahur Mollah and produced exhibits 1-4(cha).<br/><br/>Defendants, on the contrary, examined D.W.1 Abul Hossain Mollah, D.W. 2 Sayed Chand Ali and D.W.3 Yousuf Mollah and produced exhibits Ka-Gha.<br/><br/>Mr. Bivash Chandra Biswas, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners submits that, in fact, the defendants have no interest to the lot No.1 and the property under lot No.2 is under dispute, which was mortgaged in favour of Sabdul Sheikh. It was agreed that possession of the mortgage property shall remain with the mortgagors and the mortgagors shall have no right to sell the property until the mortgage money and interest thereon is paid and the mortgagors being failed to pay the mortgage money and interest thereon, subsequently surrendered its possession in favour of Sabdul Sheikh, the mortgagee who remained in possession and accordingly S.A. record was prepared in his name and subsequently the heirs of Sabdul Sheikh transferred .44  acres of land in favour of defendants by registered deed and the defendants are in possession of the suit property and trial court in view of the above facts and evidence on record decreed the suit in part as to land under lot No. 1, but the appellate Court by misreading of evidence and being failed to appreciate the facts of the pleadings reversed the judgment passed by the trial court without adverting to its findings and arrived at the decision resulting to an error occasioning failure of justice.<br/><br/>Mr. Bivash Chandra Biswas further submits that plaintiffs could not produce any evidence that mortgagors ever paid the mortgage money and interest thereon and the land under mortgage was thus redeemed and the plaintiff- predecessors in interest remained in possession of the same.<br/><br/>Mr. Bivash Chandra Biswas also submits that the appellate Court reversed the judgment without adverting to the findings of the trial court and having independent decision of it’s own and as such the impugned judgment is not a judgment of reversal.<br/><br/>Mr. Bivash Chandra Biswas further submits that the appellate Court failed to appreciate and weigh the evidence on record and arrived at an erroneous decision  resulting in an error occasioning failure of justice and it warrants interference.<br/><br/>Mr. Bivash Chandra Biswas refers citations from 4 BLC 362 and 4 BLC 490.<br/><br/>Mr. A.S.M. Khalequzzaman, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite parties submits that admittedly the mortgagors retained the possession of the  mortgaged property under lot No.2 as before and S.A. record was wrongly prepared in the name of Sabdul Sheikh along with  Abdul Majid and plaintiffs obtained rightful interest to the property under Lot No.2 by way of purchase.<br/><br/>Mr. A.S.M. Khalequzzaman further submits that in fact, although no document appears as to payment of mortgage money but on such non payment of mortgaged money, the title of the ex-tenants having been in possession of the same, was never extinguished and plaintiff Nos. 2-19 rightly acquired title by way purchase to the land under lot No. 2.<br/><br/>Mr. A.S.M. Khalequzzaman also submits that in fact, the deed of mortgage apparently reads as a deed of security and in the event of any failure of payment of money advanced to the mortgagors, the mortgagee was given authority to take legal action for recovery of the same with interest thereon but not doing so, the claim has now become time barred. <br/><br/>Mr. A.S.M. Khalequzzaman further submits that plaintiffs purchased the suit land from the legal owners and they have obtained title to the land under both the lots and appellate Court by way of adverting to the findings of the trial Court rightly reversed and decreed the suit and no occasion arises to call for any interference to the impugned judgment.<br/><br/>The bone of contention in the instant suit is the deed of mortgage that has been marked by the defendants as exhibit- ‘kha’.<br/><br/>From the facts of the pleading the land under lot No. 1 finds no dispute. Indisputably, plaintiffs No. 1 retains title and possession on it.<br/><br/>Main concern in the suit is the land under lot No. 2.<br/><br/>The recital of the deed, exhibit- ‘kha’ runs as under- “আমাদের নিম্নলিখিত জমি আবদ্ধ রাখিয়া আপনার নিকট হইতে আপনার মবলগে ২০০ টাকা কর্জ করিয়া লইলাম। টাকায় সুদ শতকরা তিন টাকা দুই আনা হিসাবে মাসিক (অপাঠ্য) টাকা পরিশোধের ওয়াদা আগামী ১৩৩৭ সালের আশ্বিন মাসের সুদ ও আসল টাকাসহ দিব ও ওয়াদা মধ্যে টাকা পরিশোধ করিতে না পারিলে উপরোক্ত  হারে সুদ চলবে, যখন সে টাকা দিব তখনই অত্র খাতের পৃষ্ঠে ওয়াশীল পাইব। আপনার টাকা পরিশোধ না হওয়া পর্যন্ত আবদ্ধ সম্পত্তি কোনরুপে লিখিত পড়িত ছাড়া হস্তান্তর করতে পারিব  না আবদ্ধীয় সম্পত্তিতে আপনার টাকা পরিশোধ না হইলে অগ্রে আবদ্ধীয় সম্পত্তি পরে আমাদের স্থাবর ও অস্থাবর সম্পত্তি ক্রোক নিলাম দ্বারা আপনার টাকা আদায় করিয়া লইবেন। আবদ্ধীয় সম্পত্তি আমাদের খাস দখলে আছে ও থাকিবে।”<br/><br/>From the reading of exhibit-‘kha’ it appears that it was a deed of security. The possession of the property under the deed was remained with the mortgagors. There was a time frame for payment of the money and for failing which there was condition to recover the same along with interest by way of attachment and sale of the mortgage property including other properties of the mortgagors but no evidence appears that in default of payment of money so advanced and interest thereon any legal action was taken for attachment  or sale of the property under the deed, exhibit- ‘kha’. Time for payment of the money advanced was expired after the month of Ashin, 1337 B.S. Obviously, the claim now stands time barred.<br/><br/>It is evident that the possession of the land remained with the mortgagor and plaintiffs 14-19 have obtained interest to the land under lot No. 2 as successors of C.S. tenant Golam Rani and plaintiffs 2-13 have obtained interest by way of purchase from the successors of C.S. tenants in support of which they have exhibited their chain of title deeds.<br/><br/>Since the exhibit- ‘kha’ proves the possession of the land under lot No.2 with the predecessors of the plaintiffs, the claim of the defendants that Sabdul Sheikh, the mortgagee got possession of the land can’t stand in view of section 91 of Evidence Act, and the oral evidence that has been adduced on behalf of the defendants does not, in any way, help the defendants.<br/><br/>In the case Begam Jan and others Vs Moklesor Rahman and others, 6 BLC 580, it has been held-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The oral evidence is not admissible in varying or contradicting the recitals contained in the registered sale deed in view of the sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Act which clearly excludes oral evidence for the purpose of varying or contradicting the terms contained in a registered document. The trial Court has committed wrong and error in granting one-third share to the plaintiffs accepting the oral evidence of the DWs overlooking the provision of sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Act’’. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It appears that appellate Court on due consideration of the evidence on record, both oral and documentary, in view of the facts of the pleadings adverted to the findings of the trial Court and reversed the same. It does not appear that appellate Court committed any glaring mistake or by misreading of evidence or non-consideration of evidence arrived at the decision that calls for any interference.<br/><br/>In course of hearing Mr. Bubash Chandra Biswas, the learned Advocate for the defendant-respondent-petitioners raises objections to the plaint having no valuation statement as required under Order 7, Rule 1(i) of the Code of Civil Procedure and it suffers from mis-joinder of parties having no joint interest to the land under dispute and thus the suit is not maintainable and the impugned decree can’t stand.<br/><br/>On perusal of the plaint it is evident that the plaint lacks valuation statement as requires Under Order 7 Rule 1(i) of the Code of Civil Procedure. But, para 5 of the plaint refers the valuation as under- “আদালতের এলাকা ও কোর্ট ফি নির্ণয়ার্থে নালিশী জমির বাৎসরিক আয়-ব্যয় এর পর নীট লাভ ১৩,৯৫০/- টাকা অত্র মোকদ্দমার তায়দাদ সাবর্থে তদুপরি কোর্ট ফি প্রদানে দায়ের করা গেল।”<br/><br/>In this respect Mr. Khalequzzaman refers from page 245 of Ganguly’s Civil Court Practice and Procedure by M.R. Mallick which approves such valuation statement in a plaint.<br/><br/>It is evident that plaintiff No. 1 has no interest to the property under lot No. 2 and similarly plaintiff Nos. 2-19 have no interest to the property under lot No. 1 and both the schedule property belong to separate holdings but in fact, for the reason above it can’t be termed as misjoinder of parties.<br/><br/>Order 1, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“All persons may be joined in one suit as plaintiffs in whom any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same act or transaction or series of acts or transactions is alleged to exist, whether jointly, severally or in the alternative, where, if such persons brought separate suits, any common question of law or fact would arise.’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Under the aforesaid provision plaintiffs having separate and distinct causes of action may join in one suit if the right to relief arises out of the same set of acts or circumstances and involves a common question of law or fact. In the case Jahanara Begam being dead his heirs: Sheikh Sahanaj Begam and others –Vs- Hazera Khatun being dead her heirs: Md. Aminul Haque and others 24 BLD (AD) 47, it has been held-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“A person to be joined in a suit as the plaintiff is subject to two conditions; the right to relief must in each case be in respect of or arise out of the same act or transaction or series of acts or transactions alleged to exist, whether jointly, severally or in the alternative and where, if such persons brought separate suits, any common question of law or fact would arise. It is desirable to read Order 2 Rule 3 as both Order 1 Rules 1 and 3 deal to some extent with the joinder of causes of action.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It is apparent that the suit in hand has common question of law or fact as requires under Order 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure for joining as plaintiffs and the same question of law or fact would arise if the plaintiffs filed separate suits. Obviously, the suit as it is framed does not hit either by Order 7, Rule 1(i) or by Order 1, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the objection raised by Mr. Bibash Chandra Biswas the learned Advocate for the petitioners does not hold good.<br/><br/>The decisions in the case Rokeya Begam Vs Mozammel Haque reported in 4 BLC 364 finds no relevancy to the case of the petitioners. In the above case ‘it was clearly stipulated that in the event of failure to repay the mortgage money the kot kabala will be treated as saf kabala and the title of the mortgaged property will be absolutely vested in the mortgagee’.<br/><br/>The decision in the case Nurul Islam Chawdhury Vs. Mrs. Fazal Ahmad reported in 4 BLC 490 also finds no relevancy in facts and circumstances of the instant case and it helps, in no way, the petitioners.<br/><br/>In view of the discussion made herein before, the Rule bears no substance.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the Rule is, therefore, discharged.<br/><br/>No order as to costs.<br/><br/>Send down the L.C. Record at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Case No. 451 of 2007 was started against the respondent Mohammad Bayazid, the Superintendent Engineer, Roads and Highways. The investigating agency eventually submitted a police report recomm-ending for prosecution of the respondent on 13<sup>th</sup> January, 2009. The case record was eventually sent to the Senior Special Judge, Mymenshing for trial. The Special Judge who got the case for trial subsequently on rejecting the respondent’s petition made under section 265C of the Code of Criminal Procedure, framed charge against him under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 on 26<sup>th</sup> January, 2009. Thereafter, the respondent moved the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>Though the High Court Division noticed that the police report was submitted with prior sanction of the Commission, it was observed that such sanction was not in conformity with Form-3 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Rules. The High Court Division was of the view that the sanction letter under memo dated 7<sup>th</sup> October, 2009 was a mechanical one without application of mind and accordingly quashed the proceeding. <br/> <br/>Mr. Khurshid Alam Khan, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the High Court Division erred in law in quashing the proceedings on technical ground despite the fact that the Anti-Corruption Commission has accorded sanction for submission of police report in accordance with law. In this connection the learned counsel has drawn our attention to the sanction letter under memo dated 7<sup>th</sup> October, 2009 of the Anti-Corruption Commission which has been reproduced in the body of the judgment.<br/> <br/>We have perused the impugned judgment and other materials on record. We have heard the learned counsel of both sides. In the sanction letter it has clearly been stated that ‘‘দুর্নীতি দমন কমিশন আইন, ২০০৪ এর ৩২ ধারা এবং দুর্নীতি দমন কমিশন আইন, ২০০৭ এর বিধি ১৫ উপ-বিধি (১) প্রদত্ত ক্ষমতাবলে নিমেণাক্ত ব্যক্তিদের বিরম্নদ্ধে নিমেণাক্ত ধারায় চার্জশীট দাখিলের অনুমোদন (sanction) জ্ঞাপন করা হইল।’’. Section 32 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act prescribes for the sanction of the Commission which is a mandatory requirement of law for taking cognizance of offences punishable under the Act and the investigating officer is required to obtain prior sanction of the Commission after completion of the investigation and submit the same together with the copy of the sanction letter given by the Commission. Sub-section (1) of Section 32 was amended by Ordinance No. VII of 2007 which came into effect on 18<sup>th</sup> April, 2007. Before amendment of section 32(1) by the Anti-Corruption Commission (amendment Ordinance, 2007) prior sanction for filing of case under the Anti-Corruption Act was a precondition. Sub-section (1) of Section 32 as stood prior to amendment is as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“Mandatory requirement of sanction of the commission for filing case-(1) Notwith-standing anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law for the time being in force, prior sanction of the Commission shall be necessary <strong><u>for filing case</u></strong> under this Act and a copy of the sanction of the commission shall be submitted in the court at the time of filing the case.” (emphasis supplied)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>After amendment, sub-section (1) of section 32 stands thus:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“Mandatory requirement of sanction of the commission (1) notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure or in any other law for the time being in force no court shall take cognizance of an offence under this Act without the sanction of the Commission.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Under the amended provision the words ‘for filing case’ have been deleted and sanction is necessary only for the purpose of taking cognizance of the offence. The prior sanction as was required for filing a case under the Act is not necessary. Sub-section (2) of section 32 has not been amended which requires the investigating officer to obtain prior sanction of the Commission before submitting police report. In accordance with sub-section (2) of section 32 prior sanction for submission of the charge sheet was duly taken. The question is whether sanction for filing the case as noticed by the High Court Division is necessary or not. In Form-3 appended to the Anti-Corruption Rules in the subject matter as well as the contents to be included in the order of sanction letter, it was mentioned ‘sanction for fling case/submission of charge sheet’ was necessary. Form-3 appended to the Rules, 2007 was printed in accordance with unamended provision of sub-section (1) of section 32 under which provision for filing a case under the Act prior sanction of the Commission was required to be taken. Though Rule 15(7) prescribes for prior sanction for filing a case as well, this Rule has been framed in accordance with the unamended provision of section 32 of the Act and no corresponding amendment to the said Rule has been made after amendment of section 32(1). Though it was mentioned in Form-3 that it was drawn up in exercise of power under section 32 of the Act, there was nothing to infer that it was in accordance with the amended provision.<br/> <br/>When there is conflict between the parent law and this Rule, the law will prevail over the rules. Rules made under a statue must be treated for all purposes of construction or obligations exactly as if they were in the Act and are to be of same effect as if contained in the Act and are to be judicially noticed for all  purposes of construction and obligation. The exercise of power of making rules is referable to a power which confers validity upon it. The rules framed under a power conferred by a section of an Act should be read as part of that section and not as an additional section to that Act. In construing ‘rules’ it is now settled that they shall be given the same effect as if they were contained in the Act. It means that they cannot be given any other construction that that they shall for all purposes of construction or obligation or otherwise, be treated exactly as if they were in the Act. In other words, if validity made the rules are to be given the effect as the provisions of the Act.<br/> <br/>More so, the question of validity of subordinate legislation depends on the vires of the rules made by the rule-making authority under powers conferred by the enabling statue. If the authority in making the rules transcends its powers, the rule will be invalid for, statutory rules made in exercise of the delegated ay are valid and binding only if made within the limits of the authority conferred.<br/> <br/>Therefore, under the amended provision no prior sanction of the Commission for filing a case is necessary in accordance with Form-3. The High Court Division was confused by the use of the words “sanction for filing case’ which were deleted by Ordinance No. VII of 2007 and by overlooking this aspect of the matter quashed the proceeding.<br/> <br/>The copy of the sanction letter as quoted in the judgment clearly shows that the Anti-Corruption Commission has accorded sanction for submission of police report. Therefore, there is no illegality or impropriety on the part of the learned Special Judge in taking cognizance of the offences and also in framing charge against the respondent. The High Court Division without application of its judicial mind quashed the proceedings. Since charge had already been framed in the case against the respondent as back as on 26<sup>th</sup> January, 2009 and about 4(four) years had elapsed in the meantime, we find it not necessary to examine the question by granting leave which would unnecessarily delay the disposal of the case. The reason upon which the High Court Division quashed the proceeding is apparently contrary to law. The impugned judgment of the High Court Division is not tenable in law and accordingly, it is liable to be interfered with. The judgment of the High Court Division is accordingly set aside. We direct the learned Special Judge to proceed with the case in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>This petition is disposed of with the above observations.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Thereafter the respondent lodged an FIR before the Cantonment<br/><br/>Police Station stating inter alia that the accused petitioner acquired movable and immovable property valued at Tk. 62,21,99,545/- (Sixty two crores twenty one lacs ninety nine thousands five hundred and forty five) which is inconsistent with the known source of his income; hence the case.<br/> <br/>On 08.05.2007 Md. Ibrahim, Assistant Director of the Anti-Corruption Commission lodged a FIR with the Cantonment Police Station against the appellant along with another under section 27(1) of the Anti-Corruption Commission Ain, 2004 read with section 109 of the Penal Code and Rule 15(gha)(5) of the Emergency Power Rules -2007.<br/> <br/>The case was duly been investigated by the Officer of the Anti-corruption Commission, who submitted a report on 24.10.2007 against the appellant and his wife under section 27(1) of the Anti-Corruption Commission Ain, 2004 read with section 109 of the Penal Code and rule 15(gha) 5 of the Emergency Power Rules-2007.<br/> <br/>Thereafter the case was transmitted to the Court of Special Judge, Court No. 7, Dhaka for trial and registered as Special Case No. 01 of 2008 wherein a charge was so framed against the accused appellant under section 27(1) of the Anti Corruption Commission Ain, 2004 along with section 109 of the Penal Code. The prosecution examined 83 P.Ws and the defence examined none.<br/> <br/>Considering the evidence of the witnesses and hearing the parties, the learned Judge of the trial court convicted and sentenced the appellant as stated above under section 27(1) of the Anti-Corruption Commission Ain, 2004 and sentenced him to suffer R.I for 10 years with fine of TK. 10 lacs, in default to suffer R.I for 1 (one) year and confiscating the properties of the appellant and his dependents in favour of the State.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved there against the appellant preferred this appeal.<br/> <br/>Mr. Rafiqul Haq, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that admittedly the notice under section 18 and 20(1) of the Anti-Corruption Commission Ain, 2004 read with Rule l5(Gha) of the Emergency Power Rules 2007 was served on the accused on 18.2.2007, when admittedly the Commission was not in existence at that time and as such the very issuance of the notice is illegal and without jurisdiction. He further submits that the judgment and order of conviction and sentence having been passed on the basis of the notice dated 18.2.2007 is void abinitio. He then submits that when the very initiation of the proceeding is illegal and without jurisdiction as it is based on the notice dated 18.2.2007, the impugned judgment passed in that proceeding also illegal and not sustainable in law. He lastly submits that it is not at all necessary to go into the detailed facts of the case as the Appellate Division in the case of Anti-Corruption Commission Vs. M.K. Alamgir, 62 DLR(AD). 20p. has held that the notice dated 18.2.2007 issued by the secretary to the Commission was without any lawful authority as such void and any proceeding based on the said void Notice is a nullity in the eye of law.<br/> <br/>Mr. Khurshid Alam Khan along with Mr. Abdul Aziz Khan learned advocate appearing on behalf of the Anti-Corruption, on the other hand, candidly admits that he can not dispute the proposition of law laid down by the Appellant Division in the case of Anti-Corruption Commission vs. Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir. He further submits that this appeal should be disposed of only on law point without going into the detailed facts of the case so that the Anti-Corruption Commission may issue notice on fresh cause of action.<br/> <br/>Admittedly, the case was initiated on the strength of the notice dated 18.2.2007 (Ext-2) issued by the Secretary of the Anti- Corruption Commission.

The notice Exhibit-2 dated 18.2.2007 was issued when the Commission was not inexistence. Therefore, the Special Case No. 1 of 2008 proceeded against the accused appellant on an invalid notice. Consequently the judgment delivered in Special Case No. 01/2008 is void.<br/> <br/>Mr. Rafiq-UI-Haq and Mr. Md. Khurshid Alam Khan, learned Advocates submit that since this appeal rests on law point, it is not at all necessary to go into the detailed facts of the case. We also hold the same view. It is however pertinent to quote the relevant portion of the judgment of the Appellate Division in case of Anti-Corruption Commission Vs. Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir.<br/> <br/>“In the present case, the notice dated 18.2.2007 under section 26 of the Act, was issued by the secretary of the Commission but he does not represent the Commission, he is only one of its employees, to carry out the decision of the Commission. But at the relevant time there were no Commissioners, as such, apparently, the Secretary issued the notice on 18.2.2007 on his own, without any satisfaction and decision from the Commission, in violation of Section 26 of the Act, the concerned authorities on realizing this error, tried to cover it up by inserting sub-section (2) in Section 18 on 18.4.2007 by Ordinance No. VII of 2007. Sub-section (2) provides for ex post facto ratification of the acts done by the officers of the Commission during the period from 7.2.2007 to 24.2.2007 without any authorization from the Commission but the question of jurisdiction goes to the root of the matter. If any person acts beyond his authority, to the prejudice of any person such acts cannot be ratified or validated by post facto legislation his action remain void.”<br/> <br/>In the present case the notice was issued on 18.2.2007. Therefore the decision held by the Appellate Division applies to the facts and circumstances of the present case. Mr. Khursid Alam Khan has drawn our attention to the concluding portion of the judgment, which is quoted below:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“There is however, no legal impediment for the commission to issue fresh notice under section 26 of the Act, if so advised, but not in those cases where the accused has already been acquitted on merit of the case as is in this case."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The above finding of the Appellate Division is binding on the High Court Division. But the fact remains that the convict appellant was acquitted of the charge leveled against him.<br/> <br/>In the light of the findings made before we find substance in the appeal.<br/> <br/>Accordingly the appeal is allowed and the judgment and order dated 27.03.2008 passed by the Special Judge, Special Court No. 7, Dhaka in Special Case No. 01 of 2008 passed against the accused appellant under section 27(1) of the Anti- Corruption Commission Ain, 2004 is hereby set aside and the accused appellant is acquitted of the charge leveled against him.<br/> <br/>The order passed for confiscation of the property of the appellant is also set aside.<br/> <br/>Let the appellant be discharged from his bail bond.<br/> <br/>Send down the L. C. records.<br/> <br/>Communicate the judgment and order to the court below and the office concern.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The said direction was modified at the instance of the petitioner by order dated 19.6.2013  allowing the petitioner to operate the Bank Account of the school, and sign the salary sheet of the staff as usually jointly with the Headmaster. However, in C.M.P No. 602 of 2013 filed by added respondent No.4, the learned chamber Judge of the Appellate Division by order dated 20.6.2013 modified the said direction dated 19.6.2013 allowing one Mr. Dewan Mustafa Muznu  to sign the salary sheets and cheques of the teachers and employees of the school in question.<br/> <br/>Facts, for the purpose of disposal of the Rule, in short, are that Upazilla Nirbahi Officer, Shibpur, Narshingdi appointed Mr. Mohammad Ashraful Alam Siddique, the Upazilla Academic Supervisor, Shibpur, Narshingdi as the presiding officer for holding election of the managing committee of Shibpur Pilot Girls’ High School, Narshingdi. Said presiding officer declared election schedule on 4.11.2012 fixing 22.11.2012 for holding election. In the said election 9 (nine) persons were elected as members of the managing committee in different categories.  The elected members of the committee held a meeting on 28.11.2012 for election of the Chairman of the managing committee and in the said meeting the name of the petitioner and  added respondent No.4 were proposed as the chairman and they secured 5:5 votes and as per provision of Probidhan 35(6) of “মাধ্যমিক ও উচ্চ মাধ্যমিক শিক্ষা বোর্ড, ঢাকা (মাধ্যমিক ও উচ্চ মাধ্যমিক সতরের বেসরকারী শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠানের গভর্নিং বডি ও ম্যানেজিং কমিটি) প্রবিধানমালা, ২০০৯” (hereinafter referred to as “Probidhanmala, 2009”) the petitioner got casting vote and was elected as chairman of the managing committee defeating the added respondent No.4 by a margin of 1 (one) vote and accordingly a resolution (Annexure-C) was written to that effect.<br/> <br/>The full committee of the school was forwarded on 29.11.2012 by the Headmaster to the Education Board in prescribed form for approval. The respondent Board accorded approval of the committee on 13.1.2013 as contained in Annexure-E to the writ petition but in the approval letter it transpired that the committee was approved by the Board with the added respondent No.4 as chairman in place of the elected chairman i.e the petitioner.<br/> <br/>Challenging the legality and propriety of the said letter dated 13.1.2013 issued under the signature of respondent No. 3, the   petitioner has invoked our jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/>Mr. A.K.M Jaglul Haider Afric, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the respondents violated the principle of natural justice in excluding the name of the petitioner by adding the name of added respondent No.4 as chairman in his place at the time of approval of the  managing committee by the impugned order though petitioner was legally elected as chairman as per probidhan 8 read with probidhan 35(6) of Probidhanmala, 2009 by the newly elected members of the proposed managing committee and as such the same is illegal, malafide and colourable exercise of power and liable to be declared to have been passed and issued without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Shohrowardi, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of added respondent No. 4 submits that  process of election of chairman of the proposed managing committee was ex-facie illegal in view of the  provision laid down in probidhan 8 of Probidhanmala, 2009 inasmuch as though the Headmaster of school is authorised only to arrange meeting of the newly elected members of the proposed committee for the purpose of election of Chairman by their majority support and in doing so the Headmaster of the institution acts as the Head of the educational institution and not as the member-secretary of the proposed managing committee and though he/she has no  right to cast vote for election of chairman of the proposed committee but in the instant case the Headmaster illegally cast vote infavar of the petitioner, which is no vote in the eye of law and as such question of casting vote by the president of the meeting does not arise at all. To elaborate his contention, learned Advocate further submits that  added respondent No.4 got 5(five) votes out of 9(nine) votes of the newly elected members and the petitioner got 4 (four) votes and accordingly  the added respondent No.4 was elected as the chairman of the managing committee but the Headmaster in collusion with the petitioner sent the proposal of the managing committee to the Board by including the name of the petitioner as the Chairman showing that the petitioner obtained 6 (six) votes mentioning in the resolution dated 28.11.2012 to the effect that the Headmaster cast 1(one) vote for the petitioner and being the position 5:5 the president of the meeting applying provision of probidhan 35(6) cast second vote (casting vote) in favour of the petitioner and declared him as chairman, violating the provision of probidhan 8 of Probidhanmala, 2009. Learned Advocate further submits that aforesaid act of illegality was taken to the notice of the Board by  the  five elected members of the committee, who were present in the meeting by application dated 2.12.2012 and 5.12.2012 as contained in Annexure-2 and 3 to affidavit-in-opposition and the Board considering all the relevant papers and the above illegality rightly approved the managing committee  by the impugned memo with the added respondent No.4 Md. Asaduzzaman as chairman in place of the petitioner and as such  no interference is called for by this Court.

In this way petitioner got total 5 votes and the margin of vote between the petitioner and added respondent No. 4 stood at 5:5, the president of the meeting gave a casting vote in favour of the petitioner invoking his right under probidhan 35 (6) of Probidhanmala, 2009.<br/>Now question arises as to whether Headmaster of a non-government school is authorized under law to cast vote for any of the chairman candidate and whether the president of the meeting authorized to cast a second vote or casting vote in favavour of any of candidates in view of the provision laid down in probidhan 8 readwith  probidhan 35(6) of Probidhanmala, 2009.<br/><br/>To consider the submissions of the contending parties as well as to answer the above questions we are to look into the relevant provisions relating to forming managing committee of a non-government high school contained in Probidhanmala, 2009.

Once a managing committee is approved and notification is issued it obtains legal character accruing rights and duties of the committee as provided in probidhanmala, 2009. Unless such approval is given by the Board and notification is issued, no member including member-secretary of the committee can exercise his/her power. On the other hand, probidhan 9 provides tenure of managing committee which is two years effective from its first meeting held within one month from the date of publishing notification issued by the Board as provided in probidhan 33(1). Proviso to probidhan 9 also provides that the outgoing managing committee will function, though its tenure expires, till the 1<sup>st</sup> meeting of the new managing committee is held. <u>A combined reading of probidhans 9, 29(3) and 33(1) it is clear that a new managing committee obtains legal character as and when it is approved and a notification is published to that effect by the Board and tenure of the committee starts from it’s first meeting within 30 (thirty) days from the date of publication of such notification by the Board.</u> (emphasis added)<br/> <br/>As per probidhan 7(জ) Headmaster of a non-government high school acts as member-secretary of managing committee as a ‘head of the institution’ and his function as member-secretary of new managing committee starts from the date of first meeting of the committee in view of the provisions laid down in probidhan 9, 29(3) and 33(1). The headmaster is not authorized to act as the member-secretary of the proposed managing committee before holding it’s first meeting . <u>So before holding first meeting of new managing committee and during the ongoing process of forming new managing committee, the Headmaster acts as the ‘Head of the Institution’ as well as member-secretary of previous managing committee. </u>(Emphasis added) <br/> <br/>Next question whether provision of probidhan 35(6) can be applied at the time of election of chairman of managing committee as per probidhan 8. It would be profitable to quote probidhan 35:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“৩৫। <strong>সভা পরিচালনা পদ্ধতি</strong>।-(১) সকল সভা সংশ্লিষ্ট বেসরকারি শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠানে অনুষ্ঠিত হইবে।<br/>(২) গভর্ণিং বডির বা, ক্ষেত্রমত, ম্যানেজিং কমিটির সভাপতি সকল সভায় সভাপতিত্ব করিবেন এবং তাহার অনুপস্থিতিতে সংশ্লিষ্ট সদস্য-সচিব ও শিক্ষক সদস্যগণ ব্যতীত উপস্থিত অন্য সদস্যগণের মধ্যে হইতে উপস্থিত সদস্যগণের সংখ্যাগরিষ্ঠের সমর্থনে কোন সদস্যের সভাপতিত্বে সভা অনুষ্ঠিত হইবে।<br/>(৩) মোট সদস্য সংখ্যার অর্ধেক সদস্যের উপস্থিতিতে সভার কোরাম গঠিত হইবে, তবে অর্ধেক সংখ্যা গণনায় কোন ভগ্নাংশ দেখা দিলে পরবর্তী পূর্ণ সংখ্যা কোরামের জন্য বিবেচনায় আনিতে হইবে।<br/>(৪) যদি কোন সভায় কোরাম পূর্ণ না হয় তাহা হইলে সভা পরবর্তী কার্যদিবস পর্যন্ত মূলতবী থাকিবে এবং উক্ত কার্যদিবসে পূর্ব দিনের নির্ধারিত স্থান ও সময়ে উক্ত মূলতবী সভা অনুষ্ঠিত হইবে।<br/>(৫) মূলতবী সভায় কোরাম প্রয়োজন হইবে না এবং উপস্থিত সদস্যগণের দ্বারা সভার কার্য পরিচালনা করা যাইবে।<br/>(৬) সভায় উপস্থিত সদস্যগণের সংখ্যাগরিষ্ঠ সদস্যগণের সম্মতিতে সিদ্ধান্ত গৃহীত হইবে এবং ভোটের সমতার ক্ষেত্রে সভায় সভাপতিত্বকারী ব্যক্তির দ্বিতীয় বা নির্ণায়ক ভোট থাকিবে।”<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Learned Advocate of the petitioner argued that procedure laid down in probidhan 35 would apply in taking decision in the meeting for election of chairman as per probidhan 8 inasmuch as in case of equal vote in deciding the election of chairman, decision have to be taken as per sub-probidhan (6) of probidhan 35 by a casting vote or second vote by the president of the meeting. It appears that language of probidhan 35 or 35(6) is very clear which indicates that those are applicable for conducting meeting of regular managing committee approved by the Board. According to probidhan 8(3) chairman is to be elected by ‘সভায় উপসিহত সদস্যদের সংখ্যা গরিষ্ঠের সমর্থনে’ i.e, by support of the majority members present in meeting which is a pre-condition in electing chairman. There is no express provision in probidhaman 8 for conducting meeting and taking decision, in case of ‘equal vote or support, as the case may be. So we are unable to accept the contention, as raised by the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/> <br/>It also appears that 9 (nine) elected members were present in the said meeting out of them 5 (five) voted for the added respondent No.4 and the rest 4 (four) including the president of said meeting voted for the petitioner. In view of majority support of the elected members the added respondent No.4 was elected as the chairman of the proposed managing committee according to probidhan 8(3). It is the contention of added-respondent No.4 that when the headmaster of the school ignoring the result of election proposed the name of the petitioner as the chairman forwarded the full committee to the Board as per probidhan 29(3) showing that the petitioner obtained 6 votes including one vote of headmaster and casting vote of the president of the meeting, the said five members, who voted for added respondent No. 4, raised objection before the Board by application dated 2.12.2013 and 5.12.2013 as contained in Annexure-2 and 3 of affidavit-in-opposition. The Board considering such objection approved the managing committee on 13.1.2013 with the added respondent No.4 as chairman excluding the name of the petitioner.<br/> <br/>Now question arises whether the respondents violated the principle of natural justice in passing the impugned order. In this regard we may refer probidhan 36 of Probidhanmala, 2009. Probidhan 36 prescribes legal consequence for adopting decision, by the managing committee or any of it’s member, which is inconsistent with the probidhanmala and other rules and regulations issued by Government and Board. Probidhan 36 runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“৩৬। <strong>সিদ্ধান্ত গ্রহণ সংক্রান্ত অনুসরণীয় বিধান</strong>।-(১) গভর্ণিং বডি বা, ক্ষেত্রমত, ম্যানেজিং কমিটি এই প্রবিধানমালা বিংবা বেসরকারি শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠান সংক্রান্ত সময় সময় সরকার কর্তৃক প্রদত্ত কোন আদেশ, সিদ্ধান্ত এবং বোর্ড কর্তৃক জারিকৃত কোন আদেশের সহিত সংগতিপূর্ণ নহে এইরুপে কোন সিদ্ধান্ত গ্রহণ করিবে না।<br/>(২) এই প্রবিধানমালার সহিত সংগতিপূর্ণ নহে এইরুপ কোন সিদ্ধান্ত গৃহীত হইলে, উক্তরুপে গৃহীত সকল সিদ্ধান্ত বাতিল ও অকার্যকর বলিয়া গণ্য হইবে এবং উক্তরুপ সিদ্ধান্ত গ্রহণের জন্য গভর্ণিং বডি বা, ক্ষেত্রমত, ম্যানেজিং কমিটির সদস্যগণ একক ও যৌথভাবে দায়ী হইবেন।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Above provision of probidhan 36 expressly says that any decision of managing committee, which is inconsistent with this probidhanmala shall be void and ineffective as well as members of the managing committee shall be held liable jointly and severally for such decision. <br/> <br/>We have already held that Headmaster of the school has no authority to participate in the election process for the purpose of election of chairman and vote for any person as chairman in view of the provision of probidhan 8. So the vote cast by the Headmaster was invalid on the face of it and no vote in the eye of law and is clearly hit by probidhan 8(3).<br/> <br/>Thus decision of the Headmaster in casting vote for the petitioner being void ab inito and ineffective in view of the provision of probidhan 36(2), we are of the view that question of violation of natural justice does not arise. Furthermore, the petitioner by virtue of the forwarding of the Headmaster did not accrue any legal right as chairman as no notification was issued by the Board after approval of the managing committee in view of probidhan 29(3). We, therefore, find no subst-ance in the submission that the respondents violated principle of natural justice. <br/> <br/>Given the facts and circumstances of the case and discussion made above we find no illegality in passing the impugned order dated 13.01.2003, approving the added respondent No. 4 Md. Asaduzzaman as chairman in place of the petitioner and no interference is called for by us.<br/> <br/>This rule merits no consideration, which is liable to discharged.<br/> <br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged, however, without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/>The order of stay and direction, which was modified later are recalled and vacated.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The outright rejection of an acquittal basing on power to continue parallel departmental proceedings, therefore, is unacceptable being contrary to law.

Hassan Ali, an employee of Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation, wasissuedasking the respondents to show cause as to why the Memo dated 21.5.2012 issued by Respondent No.4 refusing to reinstate said Hassan Ali (since dead) in his service shall not be declared to have been issued without lawful authority and why they shall not be directed topay to the petitioner thearrear salary, allowances and other benefits to which Hassan Ali would have been entitled but for the suspension and dismissal orders passed against him.<br/><br/>Facts, in brief, are that the petitioner is wife of one Md. Hassan Ali, who was an employee of Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (referred to hereinafter as “BADC”). Hassan Ali was employed as a clerk and later was working as Godown Supervisor, Sherpur Zone of the BADC, under PS- Nokla, District- Sherpur.<br/> <br/>An allegation of misappropriation was brought against said Hassan Ali. Departmental proceeding was initiated against him and by a Memo dated 18.10.1992 he was placed under suspension during inquiry. After inquiry Hassan Ali was dismissed from service <em>vide</em> an office order dated 12.9.1993 issued by the Executive Engineer, BADC, Sherpur.Meanwhile on 31.5.1993 a criminal case was filed by the District Anti-Corruption Bureau, against him which gave rise to Special Case No. 07 of 1994 of the Court of the Special Judge, Sherpur. The Special Judge upon trial found him guilty and by his judgment and order dated 28.9.2097 convicted and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment (“RI” for short) for1 year and to pay a fine of Tk. 72,000/-, in default, to suffer RI for 3 years more.<br/><br/>Convict Hassan Ali challenged in appeal the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial court which gave rise to Criminal Appeal No. 2225 of 1997, in the High Court Division. A Division Bench of the High Court Division heard the appeal and allowed the same thereby acquitted Hassan Ali by its judgment and order dated 03.7.2008.<br/> <br/>Having been so acquitted by the High Court Division Hassan Ali made an application on 24.11.2008 to the Respondent No.3 (Chief Engineer, Sech, BADC) narrating the story of acute hardships he was undergoing for want of money and praying for payment of arrear salary and allowances payable to him treating him as an employee reinstated in service.Executive Engineer (Khudra Sech), Jamalpur Region, Jamalpur, took up the matter by reference to a Memo dated 26.11.2008 issued by the Assistant Engineer, (Khudra Sech), Sherpur, and addressed a Memo dated 01.12.2008 to the Superintending Engineer (Khudra Sech) Tangail Circle, asking the latter to take appropriate steps in the light of the judgment of acquittal and application for payment of arrear salary etc. made by Hassan Ali. Thereafter a letter dated 14.1.2009 was issued by Superintending Engineer (Khudra Sech), Tangail, addressing the Additional Chief Engineer (Khudra Sech), Dhaka.And the Additional Chief Engineerin his turn issued a letter dated 02.02.2009 addressing the Chief Engineer (Khudra Sech), BADC, Dhaka, for favor of appropriate steps to be taken on the application made by Hassan Ali.<br/><br/>The Chief Engineer (Res-.3) <em>vide</em> his office Memo dated 09.6.2009 responded saying that Hassan Ali was dismissed from service by an office order dated 12.9.1993 issued by Executive Engineer (Sech), Sherpur Region. No legal step was taken against the order of dismissal. There is no scope of reinstatement or payment of salary etc merely because he has been acquitted in the criminal case.<br/> <br/>Hassan Ali, however, did not lose heart and continued to pursue the authority for his dues in different ways. Lastly on 16.5.2012 he addressed another letter to Respondent No.4 by reference to his earlier letter dated 24.11.2008 urging upon the latter to consider him as reinstated in service and pay off all the arrear salaries and allowances payable to him.<br/> <br/>Respondent No.4 in reply given <em>vide</em>the impugnedoffice Memo dated 21.5.2012 informed Hassan Ali that meanwhile the office madeclear its position and at the momentthere was no scope for his reinstatement in service and payment of arrear salary or allowances he prayed for.<br/> <br/>Soon thereafter, ie, on 30.6.2012 Hassan Ali died leaving his wife, the writ petitioner and six children. His wife on behalf of herself andas constituted attorney of her six children (who by now are major and <em>sui juris</em>) brought this writ petition and obtained the instant rule.<br/> <br/>Respondent No.2 and 3 (BADC &amp; the Chief Engineer) contested the Rule by filing an affidavit-in-opposition. Theircase is that the petitioner’s husband has failed to challenge the order of dismissal in the departmental forumwhich he could do in an appeal brought under Rule 17(1) of theGovernment Servant (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1985. Since law does not bar departmental and court proceedings to continue simultaneously the dismissed employee is not entitled to any service benefit merely by reason of his acquittal in the criminal proceedings initiated on the self-same matter.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Mr. Aminul Islam learned Advocate, appearing for the respondents found it difficult to assail the contentions raised by Mr. Mutahar Hossain. He, however, tried to argue that the case of Ferdous Laskar and Nurunnabi are distinguishable as they wereyet to reach the age of superannuation. He tried to indicate that it is difficult for a statutory body like BADC to treat an employee, who has reached the age of superannuation, as reinstated in service in absence of express law or a direction from court. Mr. Aminul Islam by way of repelling the imputation of disregard contended that a body bereft of power to do something cannot be said to have shown disregard by not doing or even by refusing to do that thing. It is, therefore, not correct to say that BADC has shown disregard to the decision given by the court.<br/> <br/>In the instant case a godown supervisor was dismissed from service as his reply was not satisfactory about short-fall of the various agricultural stuffs stored in the godown under his supervision. He was initially placed under suspension and after completion of inquiry was dismissed from service. Meanwhile a criminal case was started against him on the self-same facts. The case was put to trial and ended in conviction under section 409 of the Penal Code. Finally the godown supervisor was acquitted in appeal. By the time he was acquitted he far exceeded the age of superannuation. A wretched man, as he was, the godown supervisor, however, tried by formal applications to be treated as reinstated in service for the purpose of getting his salary and benefits. His applications were refused by his employer on the ground that the dismissal order not being challenged was still valid. Therefore, there was no scope for reinstatement in service or payment of the money asked for merely by reason of his acquittal from criminal charges.In the milieu he died.<br/> <br/>The language of refusal is significant and perhaps goes to the root of the problem ie, the co-relation and resultant tension between ‘acquittal’ and ‘reinstatement’ <em>vis-à-vis</em> the employer’s power to put his own house in order.The issue, however, is much deeper than what is up with us in this case and something to be addressed in an appropriate case.<br/> <br/>In the factual and legal background of this case and deliberations made, the moot question that falls to be considered is:whether the employer can stick to the dismissal order passed in a departmental proceeding although the dismissed employee is subsequently acquitted from the criminal charge grounded on the same facts.<br/> <br/>Since the dismissed employee was an employee of BADC the answer must be sought at the first instance in the BADC Employees’ Service Regulations.The Service Regulations do not bar departmental proceedings to go side by side with a criminal proceeding but nowhere say that the simultaneity of proceedings accrues any right to the employer to maintain the dismissal order irrespective of acquittal of the dismissed employee from criminal charges grounded on the same facts. Reg. 50, on the contrary, makes it obligatory for the departmental authority towithhold punishment proposed to be imposed till conclusion of criminal trial.To quote the language:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>৫০। আদালতে বিচারাধীন কার্যধারাঃ-</strong><br/>(১) কোন কর্মচারীর বিরুদ্ধে কোন আদালতে একই বিষয়ের উপর কোন ফৌজদারী মামলা বা আইনগত কার্যধারা বিচারাধীন থাকিলে, তাহার বিরুদ্ধে বিভাগীয় কার্যধারা সমাধানের ব্যাপারে কোন বাধা থাকিবেনা। কিন্তু যদি কর্তৃপক্ষ বিভাগীয় কার্যধারায় উক্ত কর্মচারীর উপর কোন দন্ড আরোপ করার সিদ্ধান্ত গ্রহণ করে, তাহা হইলে উক্ত আইনগত কার্যধারা নিষ্পত্তি বা সম্পন্ন না হওয়া পর্যন্ত এইরূপ দন্ডারোপ স্থগিত থাকিবে।<br/>(২)        ***       ***       ***<br/>(৩)        ***       ***       ***<br/>(৪)         ***       ***       ***</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From a bare reading of the law it is difficult to conclude that power conferred to continue with departmental proceeding side by side with criminal proceeding means, in any view, power conferred to execute the punishment proposed to be given before conclusion of the criminal trial. Rather by plain meaning it suggests that the law is intended to avoid conflict between decisions coming out of departmental and criminal proceedings grounded on the same facts. It follows by necessary implication that decisiongiven by a court on charges grounded on common facts matters significantly and weigh with the decision to be taken by the department. The employer, therefore, is not free to pass its final verdict before the verdict of the court.It must reconcile its own opinion with the verdict of the court according as the circumstances of the case demands. The outright rejection of an acquittal basing on power to continue parallel departmental proceedings, therefore, is unacceptable being contrary to law.The two proceedings, departmental and criminal, grounded on same facts do never interact as independent variables. They vary in varying circumstances. There cannot be any straightjacket formula to be adopted in all cases.<br/> <br/>Reg. 47 of the BADC Employees’ Service Regulations says, <em>inter alia</em>, that –if any employee is detained in prison in connection with a criminal offence he will not be entitled to his salary, allowances or other benefits (except subsistence allowance) for the period of his absence from duty. Provided that if he is acquitted of the charges all his dues shall be paid. If all his dues payable to him as salary, allowances and other benefits are paid off he shall be deemed to have been on duty for the period he was absent.To quote the language of the law:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>ফৌজদারী মামলা, ইত্যাদিতে আবশ্যক কর্মচারীঃ</strong>- ঋণ বা ফৌজদারী অপরাধের দায়ে কোন কর্মচারী কারাগারে সোপর্দ হওয়ার কারণে কর্তব্য হইতে অনুপস্থিতি থাকিলে, তাহার বিরূদ্ধে দায়েরকৃত মামলার পরিসমাপ্তি না হওয়া পর্যন্ত এইরূপ অনুপস্থিতিকালের জন্য তিনি কোন বেতন, ছুটিকালীন বেতন বা উক্ত সোপর্দ থাকাকালীন অন্যান্য ভাতাদি (খোরাকী ভাতা ব্যতীত) পাইবেন না। মামলার পরিস্থিতি অনুসারে তাহার বেতন ও ভাতাদি, উক্ত ঋণ বা অপরাধ সংক্রান্ত মামলা নিস্পত্তির পর, সমমবয় সাধন করা হইবে। তিনি অভিযোগ হইতে খালাস পাইলে, অথবা ঋণের দায়ে কারাবরণের ক্ষেত্রে, উক্ত দায় তাহার নিয়ন্ত্রণ বহির্ভূত পরিস্থিতির কারণে উদ্ভব হইয়াছে বলিয়া প্রমাণিত হইলে, তাহার প্রাপ্য বেতন-ভাতাদির টাকা সম্পূর্ণরূপে প্রদান করা হইবে। এইরূপে তাহাকে সম্পূর্ণ টাকা প্রদান করা হইলে, উক্ত অনুপস্থিতিকালের তিনি কর্তব্যরত ছিলেন বলিয়া গণ্য হইবে; এবং উক্ত রূপে প্রাপ্য বেতন-ভাতাদি বাবদ সম্পূর্ণ টাকা অপেক্ষা কম টাকা প্রদান করা হইলে, উক্ত সময় কর্তব্যকাল বা ছুটি বলিয়া গণ্য হইবে, কিন্তু আদেশদানকারী কর্তৃপক্ষ সেই মর্মে নির্দেশ প্রদান না করিলে এইরূপ গণ্য করা হইবে না ।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Reg. 47, in its strict literal sense, determines the entitlements of an employee who was out of duty on account of his detention in custody in connection with a criminal case and his entitlement on the event of acquitted from charges as well as conditions and mode of payment of arrear salary and allowances payable under such circumstances. It also empowers the authority to grant full pay and allowances on account of acquittal and uplifts the status of the employee making him entitled to be ‘deemed to have been on duty’, if full pay and allowances are so paid. But Reg. 47 is unclear about his re-instatement in service pursuant to his acquittal in the criminal case.<br/> <br/>Reg. 46 of the Service Regulations, however, speaks of re-instatement in service with full pay but of those who were not dismissed, removed or reduced in rank. Reg. 46(2) makes Bangladesh Service Rules (shortly, BSR) <em>mutatis mutandis</em> applicable to the employees of the Corporation but only in case of temporary suspension. The case at handis one of dismissal not temporary suspension. Rule 72 of the BSR Part I requires ‘honourable acquittal’ forgrantingfull pay and allowances to which the dismissed employeewould have been entitled had he not been dismissed. The BADC Service Regulations is silent about the nature of acquittal that is needed for granting full pay to the employee acquitted of criminal charges.<br/> <br/>BADC as a public corporation and essent-ially as an instrumentality of the Government works under the broader governmental objectives and may and indeed does call in aid the laws applicable to the Government servants where the Service Regulations are found inadequate for issues touching upon service conditions of its own employees. BADC Employee’s Service Regulations in Reg. 57 expressly empowers the Corporationso to do.In the fitness of things laws applicable to government servants come to play as of course.<br/> <br/>So far as the Government servants are <em>concerned</em> co-relation between ‘dismissal’ and ‘acquittal’ generally wavers between the legitimate departmental objectives to bring about discipline in the administration and overriding effect of the decision given by the court. There is no consensus of judicial opinion on this point and views often differ being driven by the apparent differences between the two proceedings in their trappings and objectives.But the two must meet at a certain point so that the affected employees are not pitted against the uncertainty of executive fiat.<br/> <br/>Sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the Public Servants (Dismissal on Conviction) Ordinance, 1985 says- ‘If a public servant acquitted on in service, provided he has not already attained the age of superannuation or the post or service has not been abolished’. The Ordinance requires a plain acquittal for the purpose of reinstatement.By contrast Rule 72 of the BSR Part I requires ‘honourable acquittal’to grantfull pay and allowances to which the dismissed employeewould have been entitled had he not been dismissed.The Ordinance is made in addition to but not in derogation of any law, rule or regulations for the time being in force. In the sense the provisions of the Ordinance cannot be read in a manner derogatory to the requirements of the Rule.<br/><br/>In view of the legal position as it now stands, it is difficult to say mere technical acquittal given for want of evidence or for other formal defects may be called ‘honourable acquittal’.If the oft-used phrase ‘ honourable acquittal’ is to be read in its proper signification an acquittal to be called ‘honourable’ there should be a trialand the accused acquittedon benefit of doubt or, in other words, acquittal is given on the failure of the prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.The acquittal on benefit of doubt, as an acquittal on consideration of evidence, should have effect of ‘honourable acquittal’ for the purpose of Rule 72 of the BSR Part-I.<br/> <br/>BADC cannot afford to take a different stand in respect of reinstatement and payment of dues of an acquitted employee unless so empowered by express provision of law. It follows as a logical corollary that if an employee of BADC is acquitted by a competent court allowing him benefit of doubtthe departmental proceeding on the same facts becomes inconsequential and the punishment proposed to be given or even ifgivenis superseded.The employee so acquitted shall be entitled to be reinstated in service provided in the meantime he does not reach the age of superannuation or the post or service is not abolished and alsofull pay and allowances to which he would have been entitled had he not been dismissed. It follows by parity of reasoning that the employee so entitled, if meanwhile superannuated, shall be treated by fiction of law as ‘on duty’ as required by Reg. 47, for the purpose of paying off his arrear salary, allowances and other service benefits.<br/> <br/>In the instant case the authority dismissed Hassan Ali during pendency of a criminal proceeding initiated against him on the same facts, without waiting for the conclusion of the criminal proceeding. An order passed beyond the authority of law is an order passed without jurisdiction and is clearly void. The order of dismissal besides being <em>ex facie</em> illegal and void appears to be grossly arbitrary and oppressive which has harshly operated on a poor employee like Hassan Ali.<br/> <br/>Husband of the petitioner preferred appeal challenging the conviction and sentence passed on him by the trial court. The court of appeal heard the appeal and allowed the same on merit and thereby acquitted the accused-appellant which necessarily means that Hassan Ali was acquitted on benefit of doubt. More precisely, the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt which by necessary implication is honourable acquittal. His acquittal, thus, entitles him to reinstatement in service with full pay and allowances. Respondents are not within their powers to refuse reinstatement merely by reason of their right to run a parallel proceeding or by reason of the employee’s failure to challenge the dismissal order.<br/> <br/>Unfortunately for Hassan Ali, by the time he was acquitted he exceeded the age of superannuation and died too. His monetary entitlements and benefits as an employee of BADC subsist which cannot be defeated or refused on the ground of his failure to challenge the dismissal order or on the excuse of departmental power to run parallel proce-edings. The case of <em>Nurunnabi</em> referred to by Mr. Mutahar Hossain seems to be closer to point save that the dismissed employee here is superannuated. Nurunnabi was reinstated in service with arrear pay and allowances treating the period of his absence as time spent on duty. In a similar case, <em>A.</em> <em>Razzaque v Bangladesh, </em>reported in 45 DLR 613, BADC was directed to reinstate in service its employee acquitted in appeal.<br/> <br/>It is now well settled that when the dismissal is found illegal and unsustainable in law reinstatement in service with arrear salary and allowances is the rule and refusal to allow the privilege is exception to be justified by the employer. And acquittal of charges grounded on the same facts, ifhonorable, has the same effect that wipes out the stigma of misconduct and/or corruption and entitles the indicted employee to the same privilege and the employee should be so allowed if not otherwise impracticable.<br/><br/>Since dismissal of Hassan Ali is ex facie illegal and he is acquitted honourably in appeal he was entitled to be reinstated in service with full pay and allowances had he not been superannuated. Now that he is superannuated (and also dead) direction may be made to pay off his arrear salary and allowances to his legal heirs treating by fiction of law the period of his absence as time spent on duty.<br/><br/>For what we have stated above, we are of the view that this is eminently a fit case for the rule to be made absolute.<br/> <br/>In the result, this rule is made absolute. Respondents are directed to treat the period of absence of Md. Hassan Ali from service (from date of suspension to superannuation) as ‘time spent on duty’ and accordingly pay to the petitioner (or in her absence to other legal heirs of Hassan Ali) arrear salary, allowances and other service benefits payable to him against the period within 3 (three) months from date of receipt of this judgment.<br/> <br/>No order as to cost.<br/> <br/>Communicate copies of this judgment at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

These two condemned prisoners along with other accused Mir Hossain, with cool brain, made a plan to hijack a baby taxi by killing the driver and according to that preplan they hired the C.N.G. baby taxi of the deceased as pas­sengers and took the baby taxi to a lonely place and thereafter they murdered the baby taxi driver brutally. This type of crime is on the increase in our society. For hijacking a baby taxi or any other vehicle the hijackers do not hesitate for a moment to take the life of the innocent driver of the vehicle which is very much precious for the near and dear ones of that poor driver. This type of killers/murderers can­not and should not get any mercy from the court of law. There is no reason for show­ing any leniency or mercy to this type of offenders who are enemy for the whole society. So we are unable to accept the submission of the learned advocate for the condemned prisoners to reduce the sentence of death to life imprisonment.

Shahid Ullah @ Shahid and Md. Saiful Islam @ Shahid have filed this Jail Petition against the judgment and order dated 31.01.2011 passed by the High Court Division in Death Reference No. 170 of 2005 with Jail Appeal Nos. 1430 of 2005, 1431 of 2005 and 1432 of 2005.<br/> <br/>These two condemned prisoner-petitioners along with another accused named Mir Hossain were put on trial in Sessions Case No. 597 of 2004, corre­sponding to G.R. Case No. 81 and 2004 and Fatikchhari police Station Case No. 8(9) of 2004 under Sections 302/34 of the Penal code before the learned Sessions Judge, Chittagong.<br/><br/>The Prosecution case, in short, was that deceased  Reazul  Karim  @ Azim,  the brother of the informant was a baby taxi driver. He used to play CNG vehicle bearing No. Chhatta-Metro-Tha-11-4571. On 19.05.2004 he went out with that vehicle from his house but did not come back. On 20.05.2004 the informant got information from Miraswarai Police Station that the dead body of his brother was recovered from the Datmara Takia Jalanti Rubber Plantation Garden by Police. Receiving that news, the informant along with some other people went to that place and iden­tified the dead body of his brother. He saw there <em>2 </em>accused persons also in appre­hended condition. At that time those 2 apprehended accused persons confessed before him and others that they along with accused Mir Hossain hired the CNG baby taxi of the deceased with the intention to hijack the same and took the same along with the deceased-driver to the place of occurrence and there they brutally killed him and after killing while the accused persons were changing their blood stained wearing clothes, the people of nearby market appreh-ended the present two con­demned petitioners and interrogated them and the accused persons confessed that they murdered the brother of the inform­ant. The other accused Mr. Hossain Managed to flee away. Being informed by the local people the police came to that place and as per showing of the appre­hended accused persons they recovered the dead body of the deceased. The informant, thereafter, lodged the First Information Report on the basis of which the case was started. The police took up investigation of the case and after com­pletion of investigation submitted charge sheet against all the three accused persons under sections 392/302/34 of the Penal code. The trial court framed charge against all the three accused persons under sections 302/34 of the Penal code. The charge so framed was read over and explained to the accused persons who pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The prosec-ution examined 11 witnesses and tendered two witnesses. The defence adduced no witness. The accused persons were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that time also they pleaded innocence only and informed the court that they would not adduce any witness. The trial court, on consideration of the evidence adduced by the prosecution and the confessional statements of all the three accused per­sons recorded by a Magistrate, 1st class, found all the three accused persons guilty of the charges levelled against them and convicted them thereunder and sentenced these two present condemned prisoners to death and the other accused Mir Hossain to imprisonment for life along with fine.<br/><br/>On a reference made by the trial court for confirmation of the death sentences of these two condemned prisoners Death Reference No.  170 of 2005 was regis­tered. All the three accused persons also preferred three separate jail appeals as already mentioned above. A division bench of the High Court Division heard the Death Reference and all the three jail appeals analogously and by the impugned judgment accepted the death reference and dismissed all the three jail appeals affirming the judgment and order of con­viction and sentence passed by the trial court.<br/><br/>The condemned prisoner Md. Saiful Islam @ Shahid in his jail petition has stated that they were entangled in this case falsely on mere suspicion by some terrorist of their locality who beat them mercilessly causing bleeding injuries on their persons and thereafter handed them over to the police and the police also tor­tured them inhumanly and thus obtained the so-called confessional statements from them against their will. That the confessional statements are not voluntary and true. The other condemned prisoner Shahid Ullah @ Shahid also in his petition, has stated a same story and has stated fur­ther that he is physically handicapped his right leg is crippled and he is not able to move normally.<br/><br/>Mr. ABM Bayzid, the learned advocate for the condemned prisoner petitioners has made argument focusing mainly on these two petitions of the condemned prisoners. The learned advocate has argued to the effect only that both these two condemned prisoners, in fact, were not at all involved in the alleged murder of the deceased and that they were caught by local people on suspicion only and were beaten mercilessly causing bleeding injuries on their persons and that the police also tortured them inhumanly and compelled them to make the so-called confessional statements as per the dicta­tion of the police and that these confes­sional statement are not at all voluntary and true. The learned advocate has sub­mitted also that the condemned prisoner Shahid Ullah @ Shaid is physically handi­capped whose right leg is crippled and he is unable to move norm-ally and has argued that it is not believable at all that such physically handicapped man could murder any person in the manner as stat­ed by the prosecution. The learned advo­cate for the condemned prisoners has argued also that the death sentences imposed on these two petitio-ners have been too harsh and that for the ends of justice this division may reduce the sen­tence of these condemned prisoners.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Salim, the learned Deputy Attorney General, on the other hand, has made submissions to the effect that this is a very heinous crime and in this case the commission of this heinous crime by these two condemned  prisoners have been proved beyond all reason-able doubt by overwhelming evidence adduced by the prosecution and that considering the very nature  and  gravity  of this  offence  no lenient view can be taken and no mercy-can be shown to these condemned prison­ers by reducing their sentences to imprisonment for life even.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned advocates of both the sides and gone through the  impugned judg­ment, that of the trial court and the evi­dence on record.<br/><br/>The prosecution case as it appears from the FIR, the evidence of the prosecuting witnesses and also the 164 statements of all the three accused persons is that the deceased Reazul Karim <em>@ </em>Azim was a baby taxi driver and he used to ply a CNG vehicle. That on 19.05.2004 he went out of his house with that CNG vehicle and the three accused persons hired his vehi­cle with intention of hijacking the same alter murdering the driver Reazul Karim @ Azim and  accordingly,  after going some distance they stopped that vehicle at Datmara Takia Jalanti Rubber Plantation Garden and these two condemned prison­ers took the deceased Reazul Karim <em>@ </em>Azim inside that   Rubber Plantation Garden and there they brutally murdered Reazul Karim @ Azim by inflitting knife blows  indiscriminately  on his persons causing grievous bleeding injuries on var­ious parts of his  body  including  some vital parts and as a result Reazul Karim @ Azim died there. Thereafter while these accused persons were about to flee away with that baby taxi the local people saw them with their blood stained clothes and on suspicion they caught these 2 present condemned petitioners and thereafter, on their asking, these condemned petitioners confessed that they murdered the driver of the CNG baby taxi. The local people then informed the police and the police came and thereafter as per showing of these conde-mned petitioners the police along with the local people recovered the dead body of Reazul Karim from that rub­ber Plantation Garden.<br/><br/>It appear that the above prosecution case has been proved by sufficient reli­able and convincing evidence including the confessional   statements of all the three accused persons. Both the trial court and the High Court Division have dis­cussed all these evidence and the confes­sional statements of all the three accused persons elaborately in their respective judgment.<br/><br/>It appears that among the 11 prosecu­tion witnesses the P.W.I, P.W.2, P.W.3, P.W.4, P.W.5, P.W.7, and P.W.8, have deposed before the court to the effect that both  the accused condemned prisoners Md. Saiful Islam @   Shahid  and Md. Shahid Ullah @ Shahid made extra judi­cial confessional statements before them stating that they and the other accused Mir Hossain, with an intention to hijack the baby taxi of the deceased, hired that baby taxi as passengers and went with that baby taxi near the Datmara Takia Jalanti Rubber Plantation Garden and took the deceased driver inside that Rubber Plantation Garden and there they brutally murdered him by inflicting knife blows indiscriminately causing grievous bleeding injuries on his person. From the evidence of these prosecution witnesses it has also been proved beyond all reason­able doubt that as per these extra judicial confessional statements of these two accused condemned prisoners and also as per their showing the dead body of the deceased was recovered from that Rubber Plantation Garden. Besides these evi­dence of the prosecution witnesses the judicial confess-ional statements of all the three accused persons under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure also have corroborated this prosecution case fully. In their judicial confessional state­ments all the three accused persons have-corroborated the above stated prosecution case entirely. In their judicial confession­al statements these 2 condemn petition­ers have stated that they all made a pre­plan to hijack a baby taxi and according to that pre-plan, they on the night of occur­rence, hired the baby taxi of the deceased as passengers and took the baby taxi to Datmara Takia Jalanti Rubber Plantation garden and there they asked the driver to stop the baby taxi and took the driver inside that Rubber Plantation Garden and murdered him there brutally by inflicting knife blows on his person indiscriminate­ly. The other accused Mir Hossain also has made conf-essional statement support­ing the prosecution case and also the con­fessional statements of these two con­demned prisoners. It appears that both the trial court and the High Court Division, on meticulous examination of all aspects and the facts and circumstances and other evidence on record found all the 3 confes­sional statement of the accused persons voluntary and true.<br/><br/>Mr. A. 8. M. Bayezid, the learned advocate for the accused petitioners though has alleged before us that these confessional statements were not volun­tary at all, these were extracted by inhu­man torture, but he could not point out anything before us in support of this argu­ment. Rather, it appears that during the whole trial of the case these condemned accused petitioners or the other accused Mir Hossain did not make any prayer even for retraction of their confessional statements making allegations that those were not voluntary and were extracted from them under tortured. During exami­nation under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure also they did not deny the voluntariness or truth of these confessional statements though these were specifically brought to their notice by the trial Judge at that time also. The learned Magistrate who recorded the con­fessional statements of the accused per­sons, also was examined by the prosecu­tion as P.W. 12 and it appears that to this recording magistrate also, from side of these accused persons, no suggestion even was put to the effect that these con­fessional statements, were not voluntary and true. The learned advocate for the condemned-petitioners has drawn our attention to the jail petition submitted by the condemned prisoners and argued that in fact these accused petitioners were caught by local terrorists from their hous­es and they were beaten mercilessly by those terrorists and thereafter were entan­gled in this case falsely on suspicion. But it appears that during the whole trial, of the case and even before the High Court Division no such case was put forward from any of the accused persons. During cross examination of the prosecution-witnesses also no such suggestion even was put to any of the witnesses, nor dur­ing examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure any single statement alleging any such plea was  made by any .of the accused persons except the plea of innocence only. So in  the circumstances we are unable to put any reliance on the mere statements made in the jail petition by the condemned-petitioners.<br/><br/>However, we find that in this case there are overwhelming evidence from the side of the prosecution to prove its case. The evidence of the prosecution witnesses have proved sufficiently that immediately after the murder of the deceased both these condemned prisoners  were caught by the local people with their  blood stained wearing clothes and at that  time, on their asking, both these condemned prisoners confessed that they  with an intention to hijack a C.N.G. baby  taxi murdered the driver of that baby taxi  and thereafter as per showing of these condemned prisoners the dead body of the deceased driver was recovered. The evidence of the prosecution witnesses have; been corroborated fully by the own confessi-onal statements of these condemned  prisoners which have been found voluntary and true by both the trial court and the appellate court.<br/><br/>We also do not see anything to find the confessional statements of these two accused condemned prisoners not voluntary and true, We do not find anything else also to differ with the findings of the trial court and the appellate court as to guilt of these two condemned prisoners. In our opinion also the charges against these two condemned prisoners have been  proved beyond all reasonable doubt.<br/><br/>The offence which these two con­demned prisoners committed is most heinous and brutal. These two condemned prisoners along with other accused Mir Hossain, with cool brain, made a plan to hijack a baby taxi by killing the driver and according to that preplan they hired the C.N.G. baby taxi of the deceased as pas­sengers and took the baby taxi to a lonely place and thereafter they murdered the baby taxi driver brutally. This type of crime is on the increase in our society. For hijacking a baby taxi or any other vehicle the hijackers do not hesitate for a moment to take the life of the innocent driver of the vehicle which is very much precious for the near and dear ones of that poor driver. This type of killers/murderers can­not and should not get any mercy from the court of law. There is no reason for show­ing any leniency or mercy to this type of offenders who are enemy for the whole society. So we are unable to accept the submission of the learned advocate for the condemned prisoners to reduce the sentence of death to life imprisonment. In our opinion this is a fit case for imposing death sentence on killers. The trial court rightly imposed the death penalty on these two condemned prisoners and the High Court Division also rightly affirmed the sentences of death of these two con­demned prisoners.<br/><br/>In the circumstances this jail petition is dismissed.<br/><br/>        <strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Rezaul Hasan, J.</u></strong><br/> </span><br/>This is an application filed under section 233 of the Companies Act, 1994 (the Act).<br/> <br/>It has been stated, amongst others, that the petitioners are private limited companies incorporated under the Companies Act, 1994, having their registered offices at the addresses given in the cause title. The petitioners are shareholders of respondent No.1-Bangladesh Commerce Bank Limited (BCBL), currently holding an aggregate of 1,247,295 ordinary shares in “Ga” class of shareholders as on 28.08.2010, which is not less than one-tenth of the issued shares of BCBL, which are fully paid up; that the respondent No.1 BCBL, is a public company limited by shares and has been incorporated under the Companies Act, 1994 pursuant to Section 3 of the Bangladesh Commerce Bank Limited (Reconstruction) Act, 1997; the respondent No.2 and 3 are the Chairman and the Managing Director, respectively, of the respondent No.1; the respondent No.4 is Government of Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Finance, respondent No.5 is the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms, and the proforma-respondent No.6 is the Securities and Exchange Commission. (SEC). The petitioners do not seek any relief against the pro-forma respondent No.6, which has been impleaded so that it is aware of any order that may be passed by the Hon’ble Court. The addresses of the respondents are as given in the cause title; that the respondent No.1, BCBL, is a statutory bank incorporated on 01.06.1998 under Section 3 of the Bangladesh Commerce Bank Limited (Reconstruction) Act, 1997 (“the 1997 Act”). Pursuant to Section 5(2) of the 1997 Act, the shareholding structure of BCBL is divided into 3 classes, namely:<br/>     “Ka” Class: Promoters of the bank, i.e. Government of Bangladesh<br/>     “Kha” Class:Scheduled banks and financial institutions<br/>    “Ga” Class: Amanatkari; that pursuant to Section 7(1) of 1997 Act, the Board of Directors of BCBL is composed of 11 (eleven) directors, with 4 directors from “Ka” Class shareholders, 2 directors from “Kha” Class shareholders, 4 directors from “Ga” Class shareholders and 1 director nominated by the Government of Bangladesh; that pursuant to Section 5(1) of 1997 Act, the authorized capital and paid up capital of BCBL at the time of incorporation was fixed at Tk.200.00 crore and Tk.92.00 crore respectively. Subsequently the authorized capital of BCBL was increased to Tk.1000.00 crore. Thereafter, in order or enhance the paid-up capital to the level specified in Basel-I and Basel-II, the Bangladesh Bank by its BRPD Circular No.11 dated 14.08.2008 directed the scheduled banks which include BCBL to raise its paid up capital to Tk.200 crore by December, 2010 and thereafter to Tk.400 crore within August, 2011. Accordingly, the Board of Directors in its 167<sup>th</sup> and 177<sup>th</sup> meeting (held on 15.10.2009 and 20.05.2010 respectively) recommended raising the paid-up capital of BCBL by Tk. 115,00,00,000/- through issuance of Right shares comprising 1,15,00,000 ordinary shares of Tk.100/- each in the ratio of 1.25:1(i.e 1.25 right share for each ordinary share). The record date for entitlement of the right shares was fixed on 02.12.2010. The shareholders in the 12<sup>th</sup> Annual General Meeting (AGM) held on 28.08.2010 also approved the said recommendation. Bangladesh Bank by its letter dated 13.06.2010 accorded no objection in respect of the recommendation relating to issuance of Right Shares. The information stated in this paragraph has been set out in the Offer Letter dated 6.12.2010; that in view of the above mentioned recommendations, the respondent No.3 filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 10.10.2010 under Rule 3(1) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (Issue of Capital) Rules, 2001 (“the Rules”) seeking consent of SEC for raising capital of BCBL through issuance of Right Shares. Upon considering the application, the SEC issued a Letter of Intent dated 08.11.2010 and thereafter, upon receipt of the necessary consent fee, SEC accorded consent for the raising of capital of BCBL through issuance of Right Shares by its letter dated 10.11.2010 (Ref No. SEC/CI/CPLC-262/10-477); that with regard to issuance of Right Shares, a “Notice of Issuance of Right Shares” was published by the BCBL in the Daily Ittefaq and the Daily Financial Express on 26.11.2010 (“the Notice”) which stated, inter alia, as follows:<br/>      Book Closure Date: 03.12.2010 to 05.12.21010<br/>      Subscription Date: 14.12.2010 to 20.12.21010<br/>      Banker to the Issue:  All branches of BCBL; that on 06.12.2010, the petitioners received separate “Offer Letter for Right Share Issue” (“the Offer letter”) from BCBL in which the petitioners were offered proportionate number of ordinary shares of Tk.100/- each against ordinary shares respectively held by them as on 02.12.2010. The Offer Letter stated, inter alia, that a shareholder may accept and apply for the shares hereby offered, wholly or in part by filling in the Application-‘Form A’ and submitting the same along with the application money to the Bankers to the Issue on or before December 20,2010.”; that upon receipt of the Offer Letter, the present petitioners separately and duly accepted the offer and subscribed to the Right Shares by filling in the Application- ‘Form A’ and submitting the same along with the application money to the Bankers to the Issue before December 20, 2010; that it may be noted that an offer letter with similar terms and conditions was also issued to the Government of Bangladesh, a shareholder in “Ka” Class. However, the Government of Bangladesh (respondent No. 4), failed to accept the offer as per the terms and conditions of the Offer Letter by failing to make payment of the application money to the Bankers to the Issue on or before December 20, 2010. The respondent No. 4 instead of making an application along with necessary payment as required by the Offer Letter, merely wrote a letter to BCBL stating that it would make payment at a later date; that on 27.12.2010, the Respondent No.4 issued a Government Order (GO) regarding subscribing to the Right Shares of the value of Tk. 37.50 crore and thereafter, made payment of Tk. 37.50 crore in respect  of Right Shares to BCBL on 28.12.2010. It is stated that the payment of the aforesaid amount by the Government was not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Offer Letter inasmuch as the payment has been made after the expiry of the time for acceptance of the offer, i.e 20.12.2010; that since the respondent No. 4 failed to make payment in respect of the right shares within business hours of 20.12.2010 as required by the Offer Letter and the Notice, the offer is to be deemed to have been declined by the concerned shareholders. Consequently, the right shares of the value of Tk. 37.50 crore, which was initially offered to the shareholders in “Ka” class of shareholders, would be considered to have been unsubscribed and as per the recommendation of the Board, the total unsubscribed shares would be allocated to the other existing shareholders on pro-rate basis. Accordingly, on 11.01.2011, the petitioner No. 1 through its lawyers served a legal notice upon the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 instructing it to refrain from allotting any Right Share in favour of the shareholders in the “Ka” Class of shareholders; that upon receipt of the above legal notice, instead of complying with the requests made in the notice, the respondent No. 3 and two others issued a memorandum, being Memo No. 20/2011 dated 20.01.2011 purportedly stating that measures regarding the purported issuance of Right Shares in favour of shareholders in “ka” Class, had been completed by 31.12.2010; that it is submitted that the purported issuance of right shares by the respondent No.1 in favour of the shareholders in “Ka” class is unjust, illegal and prejudicial to the interest of the petitioners inasmuch as the respondent No.1 purportedly issued the right shares in favour of the shareholders in “Ka” class despite the fact that the said shareholders failed to accept the offer as per the terms of the Offer Letter and the Notice, i.e. by making full payment within 20.12.2010; that  the purported issuance of Right Shares in favour of the shareholders in “Ka” class is unjust, discrimi-natory and prejudicial to the interest of the petitioners inasmuch as the petitioners has been discriminated against as a result of the respondents’ purported decision to allow the shareholders in “La” class to make payment long after the expiry of the time stipulated in the Notice and the Offer Letter for making payment in respect of the Right Shares, whereas shareholder in “Kha” and “Ga” class had made payment within the stipulated time. Hence this application.<br/> <br/>The respondent Nos. 1 and 3 to appeared in this matter and filed joint affidavit-in-opposition denying all materials facts as alleged in the petition and further stating  at the outset  that the petitioners have not made out a case under section 233 of the Companies Act; the petitioners have not shown that the affairs of the company are being Managed or conducted or the powers of the directors are being exercised in a manner prejudicial to one or more of its members or debenture holders or in disregard of their interest; nor has a case been made out that the company is acting or is likely to act in a manner which discriminated or it likely to discriminate the interest of any member or debenture holder; nor that a resolution of its members, debenture holders or any class of them has been passed or is likely to be passed which discriminates or is likely to discriminate the interests of one or more of its members; that it is submitted that in an application under section 233 of the Companies Act the Court is empowered as it deems fit to make such order including a direction to cancel or modify any resolution or to regulate the affairs of the company in future in such manner as is specified  therein or to amend any provision of the memorandum or articles of the company; no such prayer for direction has been made; the prayer in the petition is “to cancel the purported issuance, if any, of rights shares of the value of Tk. 37.50 crore in favour of Respondent no.4”; this is a typical prayer to be made under section 43 and not under section 233 of the Companies Act; that the second part of the prayer, namely to cancel the allotment in favour of Respondent No. 4, is a matter of share register rectification, for which a remedy lies either in the civil court or in the company court under section 43 of the Companies Act; section 233 is not a proper remedy for rectification of share register which there is a specific remedy available; the  parties should avail of that specific remedy and cannot resort to the section for protection of minority shareholders for share register rectification; it has not been shown that the affairs of the company are being run in a manner prejudicial to the interest of the company or the other requirements for application of section 233 have been met; that petition has been filed and moved on 3<sup>rd</sup> February 2011, much after the issuance of all shares to the shareholders entitled to rights issue, including the petitioners; the fact of issuance of rights shares is a past fact and nothing further needs be done  for issuance of rights shares, and hence the first part of the prayer in the petition is in fructuous inasmuch as the share register of the company now reflects the existing shareholders owning the newly issued rights shares; that therefore is  submitted that the company may offer shares to any person whether or not they have been offered first to the existing shareholders u/s 155(1)(a). <br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud, appearing along with the learned Advocates Mr.Sharif Bhuiyan, Mr. Mohammad Mutahar Hossain and Mr.Mohammad Muddasir Hossain,  for the petitioners, having placed the petition alongwith the supplementary affidavit and the documents annexed therewith mainly submits that as it would be evident from the offer letter dated 6.12.2010 (Annexure-D) issued for right shares  and it as has been further specified in a notice dated 26.11.2010 (Annexure-C) published in Financial Express and the respondent No. 4 ought to have accepted the offer letter for right shares  along with  payments to be made in cash or by P.O/D.D/cheque for 37.50 corers of shares between 14.12.2010 to 20.12.2010. Next, referring to the minutes of 1892<sup>nd</sup> meetings of the Board of Directors held on 14.11.2010 (Annexure-E), the learned Advocate submits that the Ministry of Finance, Banking and Finance Division, has accepted the  Offer, by a letter dated 20.12.2010, as against the existing shares of Tk.30 corers held by respondent No.4 and has further informed in that letter that by issuing a government order (GO) the amount due against the right shares (being Tk. 37.50 crores) will be paid through a cheque to be drawn in favour of the BCBL. As such it is clear and admitted position that although the government,  (respondent No.4) has accepted the offer letter on 20.12.2010, it has, however, not made payment as against the right shares, either in cash or by pay order or DD or cheque  on or before 20.12.2010. Thereafter, the respondent No. 4 shall be deemed to have declined to accept the offer for acceptance of the right shares as against the shares held by them in BCBL. He further submits that one of the directors of the Bank though raised objection in allotting the right shares in favour of respondent No.4, the Board of Directors has, however, allotted the shares on 30.12.2010 as is evident from Annexure-2 to the supplem-entary affidavit sworn on 2.5.2013. He continues that, issuance of the right shares  to the respondent No.4 on 13.12.2010 who has failed to deposit the price of right shares on 20.12.2010 alongwith the letter of acceptance is a clear violation of the terms and conditions of the offer Letter as well as provisions of section 155 of the Companies Act. But, by ignoring the terms and conditions and issuing the right shares in favour of the respondent No.4 (Government) on 30.12.2010, the respondent No.1 has treated these petitioners with discrimination and such conduct of the respondents is prejudicial to the interest of the petitioners. He also submits that the respondent No.4, having failed to pay the price of the right shares on 20.12.2010, it should have been resolved by the BCBL Board that the respondent No.4 has declined to accept the offer and the petitioners are entitled to all the right shares issued to the respondent No.4, hence the resolution to allot right shares in favour of respondent No.4 is liable to be cancelled and the said shares are to be allotted amongst the petitioners and other share holders as per provisions of section 155 of the Companies Act.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Dr. M. Zahir, appearing along with the learned Advocates Mr. Shamim Khaled Ahmed, Mr.Muhammad Shafiqur Rahman and Mr.Md.Fazlur Rahman Khan, on the other hand, submits that respondent No.4 is holding shares of ‘Ka’ Class and the respondent No.1 (BCBL) has been reconstituted by respondent No.4 under an scheme to re-organized it under BCBL (Reconstruction) Act, 1997 (BCBL Act). The learned Advocate further submits that unlike an individual or any privately owned concerned,  government has to undergo certain formalities and that usually requires some time in implementing its decision, but government has unequivocally accepted the offer with the commitment made in the letter dated 20.12.2010 and  has paid the price accordingly. It has caused no prejudice to the petitioner or to the BCBL. He further submits that the petitioners have failed to make out any case that their interest, in any way, have been prejudiced because of the allotment of right shares made in favour of the government. He next submits that there is no case that the petitioner have also accepted the offer letter on 20.12.2010 without payment of the price of the right shares and that  the price paid by the government was accepted subsequently and that they have also paid the price subsequently,  like the respondent No. 4, but their payment was refused. As such, the question of discrimination, in this case, is totally misconceived and baseless one. The learned Advocate further submits that if name of the government were unreasonably entered into the Register of Members of the company, then they could have filed application under section 43, not under section 233 of the Act. Besides a mere perusal of the provisions of  section 155 would show that there is nothing in that section to allot unsubscribed shares, if there were any, to the respondent No.4. Unsubscribed shares, if any, would always remain under the control and disposal of the Board of Directors and the allotment made by the Board in favour of the government, who has accepted the offer on 20.12.2010 with a commitment to pay the price after allocation of the fund by the Finance Division, was clearly within the competence of the Board of Directors as per provision of clause-(c) of Sub-section-(1) as well as per provision of Sub-section-(2) of Section 155 of the Companies Act. The petitioners, having received the right shares in proportion to the shares held by them in BCBL, they have no grievance, whatsoever, nor any cause of action to file this application under section 233 of the Act. Besides, the learned lawyer did not forget to add, that the Board of Directors, that has allotted the right shares, admittedly comprises all classes of the shareholders, namely ‘Ka’, ‘Kha’ and ‘Ga’ and the Board has resolved to issue the right shares in favour of respondent No.4 and has received the entire price of the share on 28.12.2010 and allotted the shares on 30.12.2010. Hence this petition, filed long after allotment of the right shares, has been filed with collateral purpose and is a clear abuse of the process of the court. Then referring to the prayer portion in the petition, the learned Advocate for the respondent submits that none of the prayer comes within the  scope of section 233 of the Act. As such, he concludes, that the petition is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>The learned Attorney General Mr. Mahbubey Alam, alongwith the learned Deputy Attorney General Mr.A.K.M Zahirul Huq and the learned Assistant Attorney General  Mr.Md. Matiur Rahman Howlader, appearing on behalf of the respondent No.4, submits that the government (respondent No.4) has re-organized the Bank in the public interest by enacting the BCBL Act, 1997. The government has accepted the offer within the time limit mentioned in the offer letter dated 20.12.2010, vide letter dated 20.12.2010 issued by the Banking and Finance Division, Ministry of Finance, and it has also assured that the payment, as against allotment of the right shares, shall be made when the Finance Division would release the fund, pursuant to Government Order (GO), by cheque to be drawn in favour of BCBL. This assurance, emanating from the executive organ, exercising the sovereign power of the state like two other organs, is as good as payment made in cash. The government has contributed to the capital of the company by subscribing the right shares in the public interest, unlike an individual share holder/members or any privately owned companies, like the petitioners. He next submits that public interest should not be allowed to be jeopardize by the petitioners who has failed to show any fact of discrimination made in the matter of allotment. It has also been submitted that the government has paid entire money, being Tk. 37.50 crores, on 28.12.2010 and the right shares against the said amount was issued to the government on 30.12.2010, as has been admitted by the petitioner, vide the letter dated 10.1.2011 (Annexure-2) to the supplementary affidavit. This decision to issue the right shares was taken in the Board Meeting in which the representative of all class of directors were present. Besides, the learned Attorney General also submits that, neither section 155 nor section 233 invest the petitioner with any right or otherwise entitle them to compel the Board of Directors to allot the shares to them or to get allotment of unsubscribed shares, if there were any. He next submits that the allotment was made  which is quite  bonafide and serves the public interest and is clearly  within the competence of Board of Directors as per clause-(c) of sub-section (1) of Section 155 and sub-section (2) of section 155 of the Companies Act, 1994. Hence this petition is totally misconceived and is liable to be dismissed with exemplary costs, he concludes.<br/> <br/>I have heard the learned Advocates appearing for the petitioners and the respon-dents, perused the application filed under section 233, the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners sworn on 2.5.2013 and the affidavit-in-opposition alongiwth all annexures.<br/> <br/>It is admitted by all the parties that pursuant to BRPD circular No.11 dated 14.8.2008 the paid up capital of the company was increased to Tk. 400 crore, by issuing right shares amongst the existing shareholders. It is also the admitted that in the offer letter, it has been stipulated that the offer has to be accepted in between 14.10.2010 to 20.10.2010 and that the acceptance letter shall be accompanied with payment of the price of the shares, to be made in cash  or by PO/DD/cheque within the said period of time. It is also admitted that the Government (respondent No.4) has accepted the right share offer, vide its letter dated 20.12.2010 (Annexure-I to the supplementary affidavit).  That letter reads as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"> </div><div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: center;">গণপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলাদেশ সরকার<br/>অর্থ মন্ত্রণালয়<br/>ব্যাংক ও আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান বিভাগ<br/>প্রবিধি ও নীতি অধিশাখা<br/>Website: <a href="http://www.mof.gov.bd">www.mof.gov.bd</a></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">নথি নং- ৫৩.০০৯.০৩৪.০০.০০.০০১.২০১০-২৩৯</div><div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: right;">তারিখঃ <u>২০-১২-২০১০ খ্রিঃ</u></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">প্রেরকঃ    মোঃ রিজওয়ানুল হুদা<br/> উপ-সচিব।<br/>প্রাপকঃ ব্যবস্থাপনা পরিচালক<br/>            বাংলাদেশ কমার্স ব্যংক লিমিটেড<br/>            ঢাকা।<br/><br/><strong>বিষয়ঃ- </strong>বাংলাদেশ কমার্স ব্যাংক লিঃ (বিসিবিএল)- এর মূলধন পুরণের লক্ষ্যে সরকার কর্তৃক রাইট শেয়ার গ্রহন।<br/><br/>সূত্রঃ- বিসিবিএল এর পত্র নং-বিসিবিএল/প্রকা /এমডি/ ২০১০/ ৯৪১০ তারিখ ১৫-১১-২০১০ খ্রিঃ<br/><br/><strong>মহোদয়,</strong><br/>উপর্যুক্ত বিষয়ের সূত্রোক্ত পত্রের প্রেক্ষিতে বিসিবিএল-এ সরকারের ধারণকৃত ৩০ কোটি টাকার শেয়ারের বিপরীতে ১ঃ১.২৫ অনুপাতে ৩৭.৫০ কোটি টাকার রাইট শেয়ার গ্রহণের জন্য আবেদন পত্রের ফরম (Application Form-A) পূরণ করে এ সংগে নির্দেশক্রমে প্রেরণ করছি।<br/>২.         উল্লেখ্য যে, প্রস্তাবিত রাইট শেয়ারের ৩৭.৫০ কোটি টাকার অর্থ বরাদ্দকরণের জন্য অর্থ বিভাগ-কে অনুরোধ করা হয়েছে। অর্থ বিভাগ হতে বরাদ্দ পাবার পরপরই বিসিবিএল বরাবরে সরকারী আদেশ জারী করা হবে।</div><div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: right;"><br/>আপনার বিশ্বস্ত,<br/>সংযুক্তঃ <u>বর্ণানামতে।</u><br/>(মোঃ রিজওয়ানুল হুদা)<br/>উপ-সচিব<br/>ফোনঃ ৭১৬১৫৫৮<br/>E-mail: <a href="mailto:rizwanh@finance.gov.bd">rizwanh@finance.gov.bd</a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>As such, I find the respondent No.4 has accepted the offer and gave a clear assurance to pay the amount against the right shares, once the money is allocated by the Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance. This commitment from an executive organ of the government, which exercises the sovereign power of the state like two other organs of the government, in my considered view, was a sovereign assurance and shall be treated as good as cash payment. Besides, unlike and individual or a privately owned concern like the petitioners, the respondent No.4 (Government) has to comply with certain formalities that may require some times in the process of  releasing money to pay the price of the right shares to be allotted to the government. So, the mere fact of  not enclosing the pay order/DD/cheque along with the acceptance letter dated 20.12.2012 does not disqualify the respondent No.4 from getting allotment of the shares as against the existing shares held by it in BCBL. Moreso, the government is holding shares in BCBL in the public interest, reorganized by it under an scheme in the form of an Act of Parliament i.c. BCBL (Reconstruction) Act, 1997.<br/> <br/>On the other hand, there is no case of the petitioner that they have accepted the offer for right shares on 20.12.2010 and had failed to enclose DD/PO/Cheque, like the case of respondent No.4, and that discrimination has been made by the respondent Bank in accepting the application of the government and rejecting the applications of the petitioners in a similar situation. So, the question of discrimination does not arise. Rather, in this case, the petitioners have received entire right shares against the shares held by them in BCBL.<br/> <br/>Besides, the petitioners have no pre-emptive right in respect of shares allotted to the government (respondent No.4), nor they can assert that they have any legitimate expectation to get those shares allotted to the government, because such a case would not only be absurd, but the doctrine of legitimate expectation is not applicable in company matter.<br/> <br/>I am also of the opinion, that the BCBL has received the entire price of right shares on 28.12.2010, being Tk. 37.50 crores, the Board of Directors is very much competent to issue the right shares to respondent No. 4, at least in the sense that they are competent to make allotment of these shares as empowered by clause (c) to subsection (1) and by subsection (2) of section 155 of the Act.<br/> <br/>For considering the provision of Section 155 of the Companies Act, it is apt of quote here section 155, that reads as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“155. Further issue of capital-(1) Where the directors decided to increase the subscribed capital of the company by issue of further shares within the limit of the authorized capital-<br/>(a) such further shares shall be offered to the members in proportion, as nearly as circumstances admit, to the capital paid up on the existing share held by such member, irrespective of class, at the date of the offer;<br/>(b) such offer shall be made by notice specifying the number of shares offered and specifying the time limit, not being less than fifteen days from the date of the offer, within which the offer if not accepted will be deemed to have been declined;<br/>(C) after the expiry of the time specified in the notice aforesaid, or on receipt of earlier intimation from the members to whom such notice is given that he declines to accept the shares offered, <u>the directors may dispose of the same in such manner as they may think most beneficial to the company.</u><br/>(2) <u>Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), the further shares aforesaid may be offered to any person whether or not those persons  referred to in clause (a) of that sub-section in manner whatsoever</u>.” (underlining is mine)</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>A plain reading of clause-(c) to sub-section (1) and sub- section (2) of section 155 clearly shows that the shares of a company remain under the control and disposal of the directors and the Board of Directors were competent to issue the right shares in favour of the respondent No.4 in the manner it has been allotted. On the facts of this case, it cannot be concluded that the affairs of the company were conducted or that the powers of the directors have been exercised in a manner prejudicial to the interest of the petitioners, the petitioners having no right under Article of Association of BCBL or section 155 of the Act to claim that the Board of Directors ought not to have allotted the right shares to the respondent No.4.<br/> <br/>The petitioners, I am of the view, have failed to make out any case of discrimination or any case that they have any statutory right to get the shares allotted in their favour, even if the government had rnunciated to accept these shares. More over, when the government has paid the entire price, being Tk. 37.50 crores, on 28.12.2012, for the right shares allotted in its favour and right shares have already been allotted in its favour on 30.12.2010, filing of this application under section 233, on 3.2.2011, is apparently not bonafide.<br/> <br/>I have also considered the prayer made in this petition. In the prayer portion. The petitioners claimed relief in the form of perpetual injunction only to restrain allotment of right shares to the respondent No.4, which does not fall within the ambit of section 233 in the fact of this case, as has been rightly pointed out on behalf of the respondents.<br/> <br/>Having considered the entire case in its totality, I hold that the interest of the petitioners or of the bank have not, in any way, been prejudiced. The petitioners were not treated discriminatorily, nor the Boards decision to allot the right shares to the respondent No.4 amounts to mismanagement or oppression on minority, in any sense whatsoever.<br/> <br/>I consider this petition as totally miscon-ceived and that it has no merit.<br/><br/>In the result the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/>The parties are directed to bear their respective costs.    <br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Bazlur Rashid, Sub-Assistant Settlement Officer, filed an application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the High Court Division for quashing the proceeding of GR No. 331 of 2008 arising out of Thakurgaon Police Station Case No. 01 dated 03.06.2008 under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 read with Rule 15 of the Jaruri Bidhimala, 2007 pending in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thakurgaon.<br/><br/>The prosecution case, in brief, is that one Md. Abdur Rahman, by arresting the respondent No. 1 and two others with the help of the members of Bangladesh Army of Thakurgaon camp as informant lodged a First Information Report with the Thakurgaon Police Station on 03.06.2008 alleging, inter alia, that the informant on 03.06.2008 at about 10.00 a.m. went to the temporary settlement camp situated at Khaliashajuri Primary School for correction of Parcha of land of the informant; that the Mutation Assistant accused Azizul Islam after seeing the papers for correction of parcha demanded Tk. 5000/- as bribe and the informant agreed to pay 2500/- and later on the informant went to the Thakurgaon Camp and informed army personnel about the aforesaid facts; that according to their advice the Army personnel wearing civil dress asked the informant to hand over five notes of Tk. 500/- to them by marking those notes; that according to their advice informant at 2.00 O’clock handover those five hundred taka notes to mutation Assistant Azizul Islam in his office room and Azizul Islam handed over the said money to office peon Shamsul Huda who handed over the money to the accused-petitioner; that in the meantime the Army personnel caught the accused persons red handed and recovered 2500/- from the pocket of co-accused Shamsul Huda and that in presence of the witnesses, seizure list was prepared and thereafter Thakurgaon Police Station Case No. 1 dated 03.06.2008 has been recorded against the respondent No. 1 and two others.<br/><br/>During investigation the petitioner filed Criminal Misc.

Khurshid Alam Khan, the learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that the High Court Division committed serious illegality in quashing the proceeding during investigation; that before taking cognizance, an application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not maintainable; that the process of sanction is an administrative act and it is not subject to judicial scrutiny; that the sanction relates to trap case and as such the High Court Division committed serious illegality in quashing the proceeding relying upon the said sanction with regard to trap case during investigation and moreover it is the subject matter of trial and that the first information report discloses offences against the respondent No. 1 under section 161 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (II of 47) but the High Court Division committed serious illegality in quashing the proceeding during investigation.<br/><br/>None appears on behalf of respondent No. 1 to defend his case.<br/><br/>We have perused the judgment and petition for leave to appeal. Heard the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/><br/>On perusal of the record, it appears that the learned High Court Division quashed the proceeding of Criminal Miscellaneous case No. 23071 of 2009 when the case was under investigation. In such stage, the said proceeding cannot be quashed.<br/><br/>The process of sanction is an administr-ative act and it is not subject to judicial scrutiny and thus High Court Division committed serious illegality in quashing the proceeding.<br/><br/>On perusal of the record, it further transpires that the first information report discloses offences against the respondent No. 1 under section 161 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (II of 47) but the High Court Division committed serious illegality in quashing the proceeding during investigation.<br/><br/>In this connection, we may refer to the decision reported in the case of AHS Rahman vs. State, 58 DLR (AD) 63 wherein their Lordships held, “Since the first information report discloses a prima facie case against the petitioner and to that effect the charge sheet has been submitted, there is no substance in the submission made on behalf of the petitioner for quashing the proceeding.”<br/><br/>Here in this case, First Information Report discloses a prima facie case and charge sheet is awaiting submission, in such stage quashment does not lie.<br/><br/>The ground shown for condonation of delay being satisfactory is accepted and the delay is accordingly condoned.<br/><br/>Preparation of the paper book is dispensed with as prayed for.<br/><br/>For the above reasons, the petitioner for Leave to appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and order is set aside.<br/><br/>        Let the appeal be heard along with Criminal Appeal No. 01 of 2013.<br/><br/><strong>End.</strong></div></div></div>
