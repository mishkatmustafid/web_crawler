Further case of the petitioner is that he has paid Tk. 2,59,60,715.02 and claiming of Tk. 8,74,74,699.61 or any other amount from the petitioner is absolutely false, without any basis and the sweet will of the plaintiff-Bank.<br/><br/>After submitting written statement the petitioner filed an application before the respondent No. 1-Artha Rin Adalat, Dhaka praying for holding a settlement  conference  to settle  the dispute between the parties in an alternative dispute resolution as contemp-lated under section 22 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the Ain, 2003).<br/><br/>On the other hand the respondent-Bank upon filing an application expressed its un-willingness to go for settlement conference stating inter-alia therein. (copy was not produced)<br/><br/>Upon hearing of both the parties the respondent No. 1-Artha Rin Adalat, 2nd  Court, Dhaka by its impugned order dated 7.6.2012 rejected the application filed by the petitioner seeking for holding mediation or settlement conference mainly on the ground that the plaintiff-Bank expressed its un-willingness to go for settlement conference to mediate the dispute between the parties and thereby fixed 26.6.2012 for framing issues. The defendant-petitioner against the said order of the respondent No. 1 approached this Court and obtained the present Rule and order of stay as stated above.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Mamunur Rashid, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner having placed the impugned order and other materials on record submits that there is no option for the plaintiff-Bank to raise any objection against mediation process to be referred by the court to the parties and as such non referring of the Artha Rin Suit to the mediator on the face of the objection made by the plaintiff-Bank is illegal, without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/><br/>Mr. Mamunur Rashid, the learned Advocate upon referring the unamended provision and the amended provision of mediation process submits further that before amendment it was the discretion of the court either to send the pleadings for arbitration or not. But after amendment, the provision for holding settlement conference has been made mandatory for the court to refer the Artha Rin Suit to the parties for mediation and in such view of the matter the impugned order of the Artha Rin Adalat should be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/><br/>Mr. Rashid, the learned Advocate submits further that language of section 22 is very clear wherein it has been provided that after submission of the written statement, the Adalat shall send the pleading to their engaged lawyers and if any lawyer has not been appointed the matter shall be sent to the parties for holding settlement conference and in sending the pleadings section 24 of the Ain, 2003 should also to be taken into consideration.<br/><br/>In support of his submission Mr. Mamunur Rashid, the learned Advocate placed reliance on the case of M/S Rana Apparel Limited and another vs. Government of Bangladesh and others reported in 15 BLT (2007), 104.<br/><br/>Mr. M. Moksadul Islam, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent No. 2-Bank supporting the impugned order on the other hand submits that the provision of mediation is not only for the defendant of the suit but also for both the parties, in such view of the matter when either of the parties like the plaintiff-Bank refuse to go for settlement conference at this stage, the whole purpose of the process of mediation would be fruitless and as such the order passed by the Artha Rin Adalat is not required to be interfered with.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned Advocate of both the parties, perused the writ petition, annexures and also gone through the decision referred to.<br/><br/>         On the face of the submissions of both the parties we have to look into the intention of the legislature and in doing so we are to see both the unamended  and  the  amended  provision  of  mediation  process  which  is provided in Chapter-5 of the Ain, 2003 under the heading “বিকল্প পদ্ধতিগত বিরোধ নিষ্পত্তি” which reads as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">         “২২। মধ্যস্থতা।--(১) ধারা ২১ এর অধীনে মীমাংসা সভার মাধ্যমে বিরোধ নিসপত্তির লক্ষ্যে প্রয়াস গ্রহনের জন্য কোন আদেশ না করিয়া থাকিলে, বিবাদী কর্তৃক মামলায় লিখিত জবাব দাখিলের পর, আদালত, ধারা ২৪ এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, পরবর্তী কার্যত্রুম স্থগিত  রাখিয়া, মধ্যস্থতার মাধ্যমে বিরোধ নিসপত্তির লক্ষ্য প্রয়াস গ্রহনের জন্য মামলাটি নিযুত্তু আইনজীবিগন, কিংবা আইনজীবী নিযুত্তু না হইয়া  থাকিলে, পক্ষগনের নিকট প্রেরণ করিতে পারিবে।<br/>         তবে শর্ত থাকে যে, পক্ষগন যদি এই মর্মে আদালতের নিকট দরখাসত করিয়া আবেদন করেন যে, তাহারা মধ্যস্থতার মাধ্যমে মামলার নিসপত্তি করিতে আগ্রহী, তাহা হইলে এই ধারার অধীন মধ্যস্থতার মাধ্যমে নিস্পত্তির চেষ্টার জন্য মামলা প্রেরণ করা আদালতের জন্য বাধ্যতামূলক হইবে।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The law was amended in 2010 vide Act XVI of 2010 and the provision of section -22(1) as provided after the said amendment is as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ধারা ২২। মধ্যস্থতা।-(১) চতুর্থ পরিচ্ছেদে বর্ণিত সাধারণ পদ্ধতিতে মামলার বিচার বা শুনানী সম্পর্কিত যে বিধানই থাকুক না কেন, এই আইনের অধীন দায়েরকৃত কোন মামলায় বিবাদী কর্তৃক  লিখিত জবাব দাখিলের পর, আদালত, ধারা ২৪ এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, মধ্যস্থতার মাধ্যমে বিরোধ নিস্পত্তির লক্ষ্যে, মামলাটি, নিযুত্তু আইনজীবীগন কিংবা আইনজীবী নিযুত্তু না হইয়া থাকিলে পক্ষগনের নিকট প্রেরণ করিবে।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The section 24 of the Ain, 2003 also should be taken into consideration for the purpose of materializing the mediation process under section 22 of the Ain, 2003 which reads as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">       ২৪। (১) এই আইনের অধীন মধ্যস্থতার মাধ্যমে বিকল্প পদ্ধতিতে মামলার নিস্পত্তির  উদ্দেশ্যকে কার্যকর  করার  লক্ষ্য,আর্থিক  প্রতিষ্টান  উহার   পরিচালক (Board  of  Director) বা  অনুরতপ উপযুত্তু  পর্যায়  কতৃৃক, তদউদ্দেশ্য রিজুলিউশন বা সিদ্ধামত গ্রহনপূর্বক, কেনিদ্রয়, আঞ্চলিক ও সহানীয় পর্যায়ে  উপযুত্তু ব্যবস্থপক বা কর্মকর্তাকে যথাযথ ক্ষমতা অর্পণ করিয়া আদেশ বা  পরিপত্র জারী করিবে।<br/>       (২) আর্থিক প্রতিষ্টান,উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন জারীকৃত আদেশ বা পরিপত্রে, প্রদত্ত  অনুমোদন ও অর্পিত  ক্ষমতার সীমা  এবং উত্ত ক্ষমতা  প্রয়োগের পদ্ধতি  ও নীতি, সুস্পষ্টভাবে উল্লেখ করিবে।<br/>       (৩) আর্থিক  প্রতিষ্টান,উপ-ধারা  (১)  এর  অধীন  জারীকৃত  আদেশ  বা পরিপত্রের অনুলিপি সংশ্লিষ্ট এলাকার অর্থ ঋণ আদালতে প্রেরণ করিবে।<br/>       (৪)     আদালতে, এই আইনের অধীন মধ্যস্থতার মাধ্যমে বিকল্প  পদ্ধতিতে উপনীত আপোষ অনুযায়ী ডিত্রুী বা আদেশ প্রদান করিবার পূর্বে নিশিচত হইবেন যে, উত্ত আপোষ উপ-ধারা (২) এর নির্ধারিত সীমার অধীনেই হইয়াছে এবং, ক্ষেত্রমত, আর্থিক  প্রতিষ্টানের  ব্যবস্থাপনা  পরিচালক  বা  প্রধান  নির্বাহী  কর্মকর্তা  কর্তৃক  উহা অনুমোদিত হইয়াছে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;">        <br/>This section 24 deals with the delegation of power for effective role in the arbitration or settlement conference as provided under section 22 of the Ain, 2003.<br/> <br/>On a plain reading of those provisions of mediation or settlement conference it is seen in the unamended provision that it was mandatory upon the Artha Rin Adalat to place the dispute or the pleadings to the parties for the purpose of mediation when the parties of the suit by filing an application to the court want to settle the dispute by holding settlement conference at the intervention of the mediator.<br/> <br/>But in the amended provision of section 22 of the Ain, 2003 (Act 16 of 2010) provides the court to send the pleadings or dispute to the engaged lawyer or the parties as the case may be after filing written statement by the defendant for settling the matter through mediation or by way of settlement conference without any application for such mediation. But the parties have no option to expresses their unwillingness to go for mediation process at this stage. So, we hold that the amended provision of the Ain, 2003 for holding mediation is mandatory one. Because subsection (11) of section 22 of the Ain, 2003 has been provided consequence if the parties have failed to mediate the dispute by arbitration which reads as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">   “ধারা ২২(১১) মধ্যস্থতার মাধ্যমে বিরোধ নিষ্পত্তির প্রয়াস ব্যর্থ হইলে আদালত মধ্যস্থতার কার্যক্রম পূর্ববর্তী অবস্থান হইতে মামলার শুনানীর কার্যত্রম আরম্ভ করিবে।”<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">         The unamended provision for mediation under section 22 of the Ain, 2003 clearly said that if the parties by filing an application desire to go for mediation for settling the matter by arbitration, then the court has no other choice but to send the pleadings for mediation/ arbitration. But in the amendment Act, 16 of 2010 the above provision of mediation was repealed by the legislature by incorporating new provision for mediation whereform we find the clear intention of the legislature that the power given to the court under amended Act is a mandatory power.<br/> <br/>In such view of the matter there is no provision for any of the parties of the suit to expresses their unwillingness to go for mediation by filing an application to the court.<br/><br/>         Moreover, if the parties to the suit failed to settle the dispute between them under section 22 of the Ain, 2003 they have another alternative provision/remedy in this chapter to settle the dispute invoking section 23 of the Ain, 2003 which provides as follows:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">  ২৩। (১) ধারা ২২ এর অধীন মধ্যসহতার  মাধ্যমে বিকল্প পদ্ধতিতে বিরোধ নিস্পত্তি না হইলে ৪র্থ পরিচ্ছেদের বিধান অনুযায়ী আদালত কর্তৃক রায় বা আদেশ প্রদানের পূর্বে মামলার যে কোন পর্যায়ে উভয়পক্ষ আদালতের অনুমতিক্রমে ধারা ২২ এর উপ-ধারা (২), (৩) ও (৪) এ উল্লিখিত বিধান মোতাবেক বিকলপ পদ্ধতিতে মামলা নিসপত্তি করিতে পারিবে।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">  (২) উপ-ধারা  (১)এর  অধীন  প্রদত্ত  মধ্যস্থতার  মাধ্যমে  মামলা নিস্পত্তির  সুযোগ  এই  আইনের  ধারা  ১৭  তে  উল্লিখিত  মামলা  নিস্পত্তি সময়সীমার ব্যত্যয় ঘটাইতে পারিবে না।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The legislature has incorporated these provisions of mediation or settlement conference or in other words alternative dispute resolution to mediate the dispute or to realize the outstanding dues from the defaulted borrower without unnecessary spending time, energy and money in litigations. In this respect if we look into the preamble of the Ain we will see that the whole purpose of Ain is to realize the unpaid loan given by the financial institution to the borrower for different purposes of their business. The preamble of the Ain reads as follow:<br/><br/>         “যেহেতু আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান কর্তৃক প্রদত্ত ঋন আদায়ের জন্য প্রচলিত আইনের অধিকতর সংশোধন ও সংহতকরন প্রয়োজনীয়, সেহেতু এতদ্বারা নিম্নরুপ আইন করা হইল”<br/> <br/>So, the legislature while incorporating the Ain has given prime consideration for realization of the unpaid loan. Since the whole purpose of enacting the law is for recovery of loan and as such the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 has been incorporated upon consolidating the existing law of 1990 and since under the existing law it appeared that by filing suits or execution cases money could be recovered but not in a short span of time and thus the legislature has incorporated the provision of chapter 5 in the new Ain, 2003 for easy recovery of money within a short time and as such alternative dispute resolution has been incorporated in the new Ain for the purpose of realizing money without spending much time and money in litigations.<br/><br/>As such chapter 5 has been incorpo-rated in the present Ain, 2003 allowing the parties to ask for amicable settlement under section 22 of the Ain, 2003 and lastly by Act No. 16 of 2010 this mediation process has been amended and make it mandatory for the parties of the suit to go for mediation at a certain stage of the proceeding to decide the dispute between the parties at the intervention of the mediator.<br/><br/>Adalat is under a statutory obligation of the provision of law that it should send the pleadings to the parties of the suit or their engaged lawyer as soon as filing the written statement by the defendant without any prayer either of the parties of the suit.<br/><br/>Moreover, when the defendant borrower wants to settle the dispute with the intervention of the mediator in an alternative dispute resolution. In such  a  situation  the  plaintiff-Bank  should  have  extended  its  hand  to materialize the intention of the legislature and also for early recovery of its dues from the defaulted borrower without spending much time or money in litigation.<br/><br/>Be that as it may we find that the parties of the suit have many options, if they want to settle the dispute in an alternative manner. It is necessary to mention here that in all purposes of mediation or settlement conference or alternative dispute resolution (ADR) Adalat should have taken a vital role to materialize the dispute of the contending parties out of court without expending time and energy unnecessarily.<br/><br/>The decision as referred to by the learned Advocate for the petitioner is applicable in the present facts and circumstances of the instant case in our hand.<br/><br/>For  the  reasons  and  discussions  made  herein  above  and  also  the relevant law we are of the view that the Rule has merit and thus the Rule is made absolute, however without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>The  judgment  and  order  dated  7.6.2012  passed  by  the  Artha  Rin Adalat, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka in Artha Rin Suit No. 237 of 2011 is hereby declared illegal and is of no legal effect.<br/><br/>The trial court concerned is hereby directed to send the pleadings of the suit to the parties or their engaged lawyers for holding mediation within 15 (fifteen) working days of receipt of this judgment. In doing so, the parties of the suit are also directed to take positive steps for holding mediation keeping in view of the provision of subsection (5) of section 22 of the Ain, 2003. The concerned Artha Rin Adalat is also directed to proceed with the suit in accordance with law, if the parties of the suit failed to mediate the dispute within 90 (Ninety) days from receipt of the pleadings of the suit as provided under section 22(5) of the Ain, 2003.<br/><br/>Send copy of this judgment to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Court of Artha Rin Adalat, Dhaka at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

We do not have any reservation to observe that both DCC and the Government have been trying to sidetrack the legitimate demand of respondent Nos.1-88 by trying to shift the responsibility on the shoulders of each other. We do not have any word to deprecate such behavior. Over the years, respondent Nos.1-88 have been moving heaven and earth to be absorbed in the revenue budget of DCC and at the last resort they had to file the writ petition before the High Court Division. In the case in hand not only DCC but also the Government in the Ministry of Local Government have made express promise to absorb the service of respondent Nos.1-88 in the revenue set-up of the DCC.

On receipt of the letter dated 20<sup>th</sup> September, 2006 the Secretary, Ministry of LGRD, vide his letter dated 31<sup>st</sup> October, 2006 requested the Chief Engineer, LGED and the City Corporation to give opinion as to the absorption of the writ-petitioners in the revenue budget of DCC. In response to the letter dated 31.10.2006, the Chief Engineer, LGED recommended continuing the activities of the project and absorbing the writ-petitioners in revenue budget. Subsequently, on 14<sup>th</sup> May, 2007 the Chief Slum Development Officer and Member Secretary SBSUAP requested the Zonal Executive Officer, DCC to shift the 84 Urban Development Centres to DCC. Accordingly, the Urban Development Centres were shifted within the establishment of the DCC. The Chief Slum Development Officer and Member Secretary, LGED/PD (SBSUAP) forwarded the staff service particulars of 100 employees employed in the project to DCC. Writ-respondent No.3, DCC, vide office order dated 9<sup>th</sup> October, 2007 allowed the writ-petitioner-caretakers to draw salary and allowances of 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Time Scales as they completed 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> years of their service under DCC, Dhaka in “Support for Basic Service in Urban Areas Project.” On 02.09.2007, a committee was formed with the Chief Revenue Officer as its convenor and 10 Zonal Executive Officers, the Chief Urban Planner, the Law Officer and the Principal Development Officer and the Principal Development Officer as its members to report, amongst others, whether the manpower of the project could be transferred to the revenue budget of DCC. On 10.12.2007, the committee submitted a report recommending, amongst others, that the 512 persons employed in the project could be absorbed within the administrative framework of DCC. After that, the Chief Executive Officer of DCC, vide his letter dated 14<sup>th</sup> of January, 2008 sent a proposal to writ-respondent No.2, Secretary, LGRD, requesting him to transfer 512 officers and employees of “Support for Basic Service in Urban Areas Project” in the service of DCC under revenue budget as per the decision of Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC) dated 03.01.2008. The Joint Chief, Planning Division, Government of Bangladesh, vide his letter dated 10<sup>th</sup> January, 2008 requested all concerned including the Chief Executive Officer, DCC to transfer manpower from the completed projects to revenue budget following the existing Rules and Regulations as per the decision of ECNEC dated 31<sup>st</sup> December, 2007.  The Government in the Ministry of Local Government Rural Development and Co-operatives, Local Government Division, vide letter dated 4<sup>th</sup> March, 2008 through its Senior Assistant Secretary requested the Chief Executive Officer of DCC to send a specific proposal for transferring the manpower of the projects to revenue budget following all the Rules and Regulations. After that, writ-respondent No.3 (DCC) took up no steps whatsoever for absorption of the writ-petitioners in the revenue budget of the DCC and also to pay the arrear salaries and other service benefits in spite of the decision of the ECNEC to absorb the writ-petitioners in the revenue budget as per  Rules and Regulations. The writ-petitioners, thereafter, served a legal notice dated 29<sup>th</sup> June, 2008 claiming arrear salaries amounting to TK.1,07,08,048.00. Pursuant to a meeting held on 12<sup>th</sup> July, 2008 with the Chief Executive Officer of DCC for deciding the demand of salaries and allowances of 300 employees of “Support for Basic Service in Urban Areas Project”, a positive initiative was taken. At that meeting it was decided that as per the direction of the Mayor of DCC and in compliance with the Government Rules, two officers of DCC were required to submit a proposal regarding the salary and allowance of 300 employees within 10 days. They accordingly submitted their report on 11<sup>th</sup> August, 2008 recomm-ending payment of salary.<br/> <br/>After that, On 21<sup>st</sup> September, 2008, the Chief Executive Officer, DCC wrote a letter to writ-respondent No.2 praying for sanctioning of TK.3,51,84,800.00 for payment of salary and allowances of 300 employees and officers of “Support for Basic Service in Urban Areas Project” for December, 2008. Accordingly, DCC paid TK.12 lacs for distribution amongst 300 employees on 29<sup>th</sup> September, 2008. Lastly, at its fourteenth General Meeting of Commissioners, DCC decided to send a request letter for transferring the said project in the revenue budget of DCC. Therefore, the writ-petitioners are entitled to get all benefits such as selection grade, promotion, time scale etc. as they served the projects of DCC and they are legally entitled to continue as such. The writ-petitioners have served DCC for 10 to 18 years awaiting absorption in the revenue budget of DCC.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the decision taken at the 14<sup>th</sup> General Meeting of Commissioners of DCC, the writ petitioners filed the writ petition before the High Court Division and obtained the Rule Nisi in Writ Petition No.9675 of 2008.<br/> <br/>The writ-respondent contested the Rule by filing affidavit-in-opposition controverting the material statements made in the writ petition.<br/> <br/>The learned Judges of the High Court Division upon hearing the parties by their judgment and order dated 23.07.2009 made the Rule absolute with a direction that writ-petitioner Nos.1-88 be absorbed in the revenue budget of the DCC with their arrear, salaries and other benefits.<br/> <br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with judgment and order dated 23.07.2009 passed by the High Court Division, the writ-respondent, DCC, moved this Division by filing Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.2122 of 2009 in which leave was granted on 09.02.2010 resulting in the initiation of Civil Appeal No.101 of 2010.<br/> <br/>Mr. Tofailure Rahman, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the appellant, submits that the writ-respondents having known about the fate of their status on completion of the project and their service being contractual in nature, continuation of their service in the project did not create any right in their favour to be absorbed in the revenue budget of the DCC. He further submits that DCC being guided under the Ordinance of 2008, now under the Act of 2009 and there being no scope for DCC to absorb any employee beyond their organogram, the High Court Division erred in law in directing the appellant to absorb respondent Nos.1 to 88 in the revenue budget with all arrear salaries and benefits. He lastly submits that respondent Nos.1 to 88 knew that they would be automatically terminated from the service on completion of the project and that they have been notified from time to time including clear assertion of their letters of appointment and as such, the High Court Division has erred in law in construing that continuation of their work in the project created legitimate expectation in favour of respondent Nos.1 to 88.<br/> <br/>Mr. Abdul Matin Khasru, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the writ-petitioner-respondents, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment stating that the actions of the appointing authority culminated in legitimate expectation in the minds of the writ-petitioners that they would be absorbed in the revenue budget of Dhaka City Corporation.<br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Senior Advocates, the impugned judgment and the materials on record.<br/> <br/>Before addressing the conflicting submissions of the learned Senior Advocates of both the sides, it would be proper to go through the submissions of the learned Advocate, on which, leave was granted as under: </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The writ-petitioner-respondents having known about the fate of their status on completion of the project, the service being contractual in nature, continuation of their service in the project did not create any right in their favour to be absorbed in the revenue budget of the Dhaka City Corporation. The Dhaka City Corporation being guided under the Ordinance of 2008, now under the Act of 2009 and there being no scope for Dhaka City Corporation to absorb any employee beyond their organogram, the High Court Division erred in law in directing the petitioner to absorb the writ-petitioner-respondents in the revenue budget in the revenue budget with all arrears, salaries and benefit; the writ-petitioner-respondents knew that they would be automatically terminated from the service on completion of the project and that they have been modified from time to time including clear assertion of their letters of appointment and as such, the High Court Division has erred in law in construing that continuation of their work in the project created legitimate expect-ation in favour of the writ-petitioner-respondents. The length of service in the project of the writ-petitioner-respondents does not create any right to be absorbed in the revenue budget automatically without sanction from the Government and as such, the High Court Division erred in law making the Rule absolute.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Respondents Nos.1-10 were originally appointed in the first project namely, SIP (Slum Improvement Project) (second phase) as a community organizers under Dhaka City Corporation. The Urban Basic Service Delivery Project    (in short, UBSP) under the Ministry of Local Government,  Rural Development and Co-operatives, Local Government Division, commenced on 1<sup>st</sup> January,1996 and the project was approved by ECNEC on 1<sup>st</sup> Aprial,1997. The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) through 4 City Corporations and 21 Pourashavas implemented the projects. The support staff were engaged from previous Slum Improvement Project (second phase). Respondent Nos.1-10 were absorbed in the second project i.e. UBSDP on 19<sup>th</sup> October, 1997 and respondent Nos.11-76, 86-88, 77-79 and 80 were directly appointed through competitive examination as the caretakers in the UBSDP on 11.06.2008 and 30.12.1998. The Project Director of UBSDP by the letter dated 23.03.1998 informed that salaries of the caretakers of the second project would be paid as per national pay scale of 1997 with effect from 01.07.1997. The third project i.e. local partnership for Urban Poverty Alleviation Project (Revised) commenced on 01.09.1998 to be completed on 30.06.2006. Respondent Nos.1-80 and 86-88, caretakers of second project (UBSDP) were absorbed in the third project on 15.07.2001 and respondent Nos.81-85 were appointed on 08.07.2005 in the third project.<br/> <br/>The Ministry of LGRD by its office order dated 03.06.2002 requested Chief Executive Officer, DCC, to continue the activities of the third project even after its completion by the letter dated 02.10.2002 with own fund of DCC.<br/> <br/>Having considered different annexures to the writ petition, it appears that some of the respondents have been trying diligently and persistently to establish their claim to be absorbed in the revenue budget of DCC. There is no gainsaying the fact that respondent Nos.1-88 were given assurance from time to time by the DCC and the Ministry of LGRD that their services would be absorbed in the revenue budget.<br/> <br/>In the Project Pro-forma from Slum Improvement Project (2bd phase) contained in Annexure-B to the writ petition states, amongst others, “The community organizer will be an appointed staff member of the municipality. The salary of the community organizer will be paid by the project for the duration of the project. Upon completion of the project, they will continue as Pourashava employees, paid under the Pourashava budget. Community Health worker will be working on honorarium. Upon completion of the project they will continue as permanent employees and paid under the Pourashava budget. Community health workers will be working on honorarium.” Even in the highest body of the Government, ‘ECNEC’, a positive decision was taken to absorb respondent Nos.1 to 88  and others standing on the same footing in the revenue budget as contained in Annexure-‘R’ to the writ petition dated 10.01.2008, which reveals that the decision of ECNEC was communicated to the all City Corporations including DCC.<br/> <br/>By an office order dated 09.11.2007 as contained in Annexure-‘O’ to the writ petition, DCC allowed respondent Nos.1-88 time scale the relevant portion of the office order is extracted below :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">‘‘সিটি করপোরেশনের বস্তি উন্নয়ন বিভাগের অধীনে ‘‘সাপোর্ট ফর বেসিক সার্ভিস ইন আরবান এরিয়াস ’’ প্রকল্পে নিয়োজিত কেয়ারটেকারদের (স্কেলভূক্ত) যোগদানের তারিখ হবে প্রকল্পের মেয়াদ শেষ দিন পর্যন্ত (৩০শে জুন/০৭ইং) ক্রমে ৮, ১২ ও ১৫ বৎসর পৃর্তিতে ১ম, ২য় ও ৩য় টাইম স্কেলের বকেয়া বেতন-ভাতাদি প্রদানের অনুমতি দেয়া হল।<br/>কর্তৃপক্ষের অনুমোদনক্রমে এই আদেশ জারী করা হলো। ইহা অবিলমেব কার্যকর হবে।’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Time-scale is usually granted to a permanent staff in revenue set-up. By according time-scale, the appellant in effect gave recognition to respondent Nos.1 to 88 as its permanent staff members.<br/> <br/>On 15.01.2008, the Chief Executive Officer of Dhaka City Corporation wrote a letter to the Secretary, Local Government Division stating at serial No.7 as under :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">‘‘৭। একইসাথে গত ০৩/০১/২০০৮ তারিখে অনুষ্ঠিত পরিকল্পনা বিভাগের ঊঈঘঊঈ সভার ৪.৩(খ) সিদ্ধান্ত (অস্পষ্ট) অনুযায়ী (কপি সংযুক্ত-৪) ঢাকা সিটি করপোরেশন কর্তৃক বাস্তবায়িত নগর দারিদ্র দূরীকরণ প্রকল্প অংশ-২ পার্ট ফর বেসিক সার্ভিস ইন আরবান এরিয়াস প্রকল্পের ৫১২ (পাঁচশত বার) জন কর্মকর্তা-কর্মচারীর চাকুরী মান বিধি বিধান অনুসরণ পূর্বক রাজস্ব বাজেটে স্থানান্তরের বিষয়ে প্রয়োজনীয় ব্যবস্থা গ্রহনের জন্য বিনীতভাবে অনুরোধ জানাচ্ছি। ’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the backdrop of the above, respondent Nos.1-88 with the passage of time have developed in their mind a legitimate and reasonable expectation that they would be absorbed in the revenue budget of DCC. We do not have any reservation to observe that both DCC and the Government have been trying to sidetrack the legitimate demand of respondent No.1-88 by trying to shift the responsibility on the shoulders of each other. We do not have any word to deprecate such behavior. Over the years, respondent No.1-88 have been moving heaven and earth to be absorbed in the revenue budget of DCC and at the last resort they have to file the writ petition before the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>The phrase “legitimate expectation” first emerged in its modern public law context in the judgment of Lord Denning in <strong><em>Smith Vs. Secretary of State for Home Affairs [1969] 2 Ch. 149, 170 </em></strong>and it has gained an ever more prominent presence in the case reports. Despite this increasing visibility, however, many of its features remain undefined. In order to establish legitimate expectation there must be a commitment which can be characterized as a promise.    <br/> <br/>The root of the principle of legitimate expectation is constitutional principle of rule of law which requires regularity, predictability and certainty in Government’s dealing with the public.<br/> <br/>In the case of the <strong><em>Council of Civil Service Union and others Vs. Minister for the Civil Service 1985 AC 374,</em></strong> the House of Lords observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Legitimate expectation may arise either from an express promise given on behalf of a public authority or from the existence of regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case in hand not only DCC but also the Government in the Ministry of Local Government have made express promise to absorb the service of respondent Nos.1-88 in the revenue set-up of the DCC. Because of shifting responsibility on the shoulders of each other by the Government and DCC, respondent Nos.1 to 88 could not yet be absorbed in the revenue set-up of DCC.  <br/> <br/>In his book “<strong><em>Constitutional Law of Bangladesh”,</em></strong> Third Edition, Mr. Mahmudul Islam, having considered a large number of reported cases of English, Indian and our jurisdictions deduced the principles emerged from those cases as under :</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">The statement or practice giving rise to the legitimate expectation must be sufficiently clear and unambiguous, and expressed or carried out in such a way as to show that it was intended to be binding. A statement will not be binding if it is tentative, or if there is uncertainty as to what was said. Where it was said that a recommendation from X was ‘almost invariably’ accepted there was no legitimate expectation that it would be accepted. Legitimate expectation cannot be based on departmental note to which concurrence of the relevant authority has not been obtained. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Legitimate expectation cannot be pressed in aid when the policy or practice on which the expectation is based is <em>ultra vires</em>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Substantive protection of legitimate expectation will generally require that the promise is made to a small group and a general announcement of policy to a large group is unlikely to be presented substantively.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">An expectation to be legitimate must be founded upon a promise or practice by the public authority that is said to be bound to fulfill the expectation and a Minister cannot found an expectation that an independent officer will act in a particular way or an election promise made by a shadow Minister does not bind the responsible Minister after the change of the government.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A person basing his claim on the doctrine of legitimate expectation has to satisfy that he relied on the representation of the authority and the denial of that expectation would work to his detriment. The court can interfere only if the decision taken by the authority is found to be arbitrary, unreasonable or in gross abuse of power or in violation of the principles of natural justice and not taken in public interest.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The statement or practice must be shown to be applicable and relevant to the case in hand. Thus where an offer of an interview had been made in 1986, but action was taken in 1988 without an interview, there was no legitimate expectation of an interview in 1988 as the circumstances then were quite different.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Legitimate expectations are enforced in order to achieve fairness. Thus where it was argued that a previous practice of giving an oral hearing gave rise to a legitimate expectation of a hearing, the court said that the question was whether the official in question had acted unfairly and in the circumstances the decision on the papers was held fair. Even if a case of legitimate expectation is made out, the decision or action of the authority will not be interfered with unless it is shown to have resulted in failure of justice. There cannot be any legitimate expectation ignoring a mandatory provision of law requiring permission to be obtained.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Clear words in the statue or in the policy statement override legitimate expectation.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">If the statement said to be binding was given in response to information from the citizen, it will not be binding if that information is less than frank, and if it is not indicated that a binding statement is being sought.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">He who seeks to enforce must be a person to whom (or a member of the class to which) the statement was made or the practice applied.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Even though a case is made out, a legitimate expectation shall not be enforced if there is overriding public interest which requires otherwise.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A claim based on legitimate expectation cannot be sustained when there is non-compliance with a mandatory provision of law. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The principles expounded above may be the guiding principles for deciding the cases on legitimate expectation.<br/> <br/>In the case in hand, serial No.(V) of the aforesaid principles applies.<br/> <br/>In the light of the findings made before, we do not find any ground for interference.<br/> <br/>The findings arrived at and the decision made by the High Court Division are based on proper appreciation of laws and facts.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. There is no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The learned advocate further submits that since the property as leased out was followed by certain terms and condition incorporated in annexure-f to the petition any aggrieved party specially leassee may seek relief in a civil court not in writ jurisdiction. Moreover lessee, the writ petitioner, has not yet paid the enhance rate as claimed by the lessor in terms of the lease granting order annexure-F to the petition.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Mr. Fida M.

Moreover, in pursuance of the payment of entire lease money petitioner has already handed over the physical possession of the lease property on 23.05.2006 (annexure-H to the petition) and thereafter began to drag to execute the deed in favour of the lessee and this conduct of the lessor as a senior public servant is highly undesirable and also to be deprecated.<br/><br/>The High Court Division since made the rule absolute with a direction to execute the Kabala deed in favour of the lessee we find neither any illegality nor irregularity which can be interfered with and accordingly we find no merit in this petition for leave to appeal. The petitioner-lessor should be more vigilant to perform his official duty in accordance with the law and accordingly he is directed to execute the deed within next 30 (thirty) days from the date of receipt of the order.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Plaintiff is an employer of Forest Department of the Government. He came to the locality time to time from his work place to personally take care of his properties including the schedule ‘Kha’ property. While serving at Kare Hat under Mirersorie being transferred there in December 1996, he went to the suit land on 14.02.1997 and found that the defendant Nos. 1-3 illegally entering into the ‘Kha’ schedule land under the title and possession of the plaintiff mobilizing construction materials and cutting earth for construction wall. Being asked by the plaintiff defendant No. 1 stated that their father purchased the ‘Kha’ schedule land and while enjoying title and possession started construction work. Plaintiff told respondent No. 1 that his father has not purchased the land under serial No. 9 instead he was purchaser of the plot under serial No. 10 and subsequently the plaintiff filed the suit for declaration as well as recovery of khass possession and own the alongwith allegation in their plaint.<br/> <br/>That the defendant Nos. 1-7 contested the suit by filing written statement denying all the materials allegation of the plaint and stating inter-alia that the suit is not maintainable and it was further stated that which is possessing by the defendant are the purchased land and he denied the possession of the plaintiff. It was further stated that the suit was not maintainable want of partition as because the defendant are of co-sharer of the said khatian including other allegation there in their written statement. Thereafter the learned trial Court pass an order to inspect the land in question through an Advocate Commissioner who after holiding inspection submitted report which is annexed with the application as Annexure A at the time of trial the plaintiff adduced their evidence in support of their case and on the other hand, the defendant adduced evidence including the documentary evidence from both the sides and after taking evidence from the citation and perusal the record the trial Court was pleased to decree the suit and against which the defendant as appellant preferred title appeal and on hearing the learned lower appellate Court was pleased to allow the appeal on the ground that the land in question was not specific and further reason that the suit was not maintainable due to want of partition and against the said judgment and decree the petitioner preferred this present revisional application and obtained the present rule.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Shamsul Haque Bhuiyan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the learned lower appellant Court failed to consider the specific possession of the plaintiff petitioner and thereby it committed an error of law resulting in an error in his decision occasioning failure of justice. He further submits that the rule may be absolute.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Afzal Hossain, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite parties submits that the specification of the land neither in the plaint nor in the report which was exhibited in where the title of both the parties are admitted but land of the plaintiff was not ascertained neither by the plaint nor by the advocate commissioner therefore the sketch map prepared by the advocate commissioner was not proper not in accordance with rules and even he has no experience about the survey of the land in question therefore on the basis the said report it is not safe to pass any judgment. He lastly submits that the rule may be discharged.<br/> <br/>Heard the learned Advocate, perused the materials on record as well as survey report itself which is annexed as Annexure A  and the learned Advocate who after making inspection submitted his report categorically stated that he was not a survey knowing advocate and he did not prepared the sketch map though there is mentioning about a sketch map in the  averment of the plaint practically we do not find any such sketch map along with the plaint that the  advocate commissioner also did not prepared any sketch map for the land in question. The relevant portion of the advocate commissioner’s report is as under,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<u>পরিদর্শনের প্রস্তাবিত বিষয়াদি ও ফলাফলঃ-</u><br/>বিষয়ঃ-      ১) আর্জির সহিত সংযোজিত কলমি নক্সায় প্রদর্শিত মতে বিরোধীয় দাগের সম্পত্তি বিভক্ত এবং সীমানা দেওয়াল দ্বারা উহা পরিচিহ্রিত কিনা? উত্তর হ্যাঁ হইলে ১-১২ নং প্লটের আয়তন সহ সীমানা দেওয়ালের বিস্তারিত বর্ণনা প্রদান করুনঃ<br/>ফলাফলঃ  হ্যাঁ, বাদীর বিজ্ঞ কৌশুলীর সরবরাহকৃত কলমি নক্সায় প্রদর্শিত মতে বিরোধীয়  দাগের সম্পত্তি বিভক্ত এবং সরেজমিনে পাকা সীমানা দেওয়াল দ্বারা পরিচিহ্রিত করা আছে।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>This material fact disclosed that there was sketch map along with the plaint but practically there is no sketch map and on the other hand the commissioner report speaks that the sketch map was supplied by the learned Advocate which is totally contrary.<br/><br/>It further appears that he did not prepared the sketch map by himself and the learned Advocate for the petitioner brought are notice that the writ was delivered by the learned Advocate only to make inspection without preparing any sketch map by the advocate commissioner. After considering the report of the advocate commissioner along with the evidence on record as discussed above we find that the preliminary point to determine the land in question is quite absurd and in such facts and circumstances to determine the preliminary point as to attraction of the plaintiffs land with the land in question is required to determine and for which it requires to make inspection by a survey knowing advocate commissioner and it also is required to prepare the sketch map with index.<br/><br/>It appears that since the title of the parties are admitted but the possession as well as the position of the land is required to be determined by the Court and that is why it requires to make an inspection of the suit land by a well survey knowing lawyer who after holding inspection prepared the sketch map and index and submitted report in accordance with law to determine the preliminary point in question along with other evidences by the Court.<br/>In view of the above facts and circumstances, we find that the ends of justice would be met if the suit is send back on remand to determine the preliminary point after appointing a survey knowing advocate commissioner for holding inspection and report along with map and index in accordance with law. <br/><br/>In the result, the rule is made absolute without any order as to costs. Both the judgment and decree dated 21.05.2008 and 28.05.2008 passed in the Other Appeal No. 361 of 2006 by the Additional District Judge, Bankruptcy Court, Chittagong and the judgment and decree dated 21.06.2006 and 28.06.2006 respectively passed by the Joint District Judge, Environment Court, Chittagong in Other Suit No. 02 of 2006 are hereby set aside and the suit is send back on remand to the court of the joint District Judge, Environment Court Chittagong and the trial Court is directed to appoint a survey knowing advocate commissioner for holding inspection and report along with sketch map and index in accordance with law and the learned Judge is also directed to trial the suit thereafter in accordance with law within 04 (four) months from the date of receipt of this judgment and order of this court.<br/><br/>Send down the lower Court records together with a copy of the judgment and order of this court to the court below at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

But the fact remains that the appellant was not a certificate debtor. Admittedly, the certificate debtors were not found in their houses situated on the disputed plots and because of their non-payment of land development tax, their plots were put on sale in public auction. Admittedly, the disputed plots along with the structures standing thereon were sold in auction by the Government and it had the right to do so for non-payment land development tax through the Collector of the District under the provisions of the Public Demands Recovery Act. The appellant is a Government Organization, which did not have the <em>locus-standi</em> to challenge the disputed auction sales held by competent Government officials. Consequently, the writ petition filed by the appellant was a misconceived one. It is important to note that the auction purchasers of the disputed plots stepped into the shoes of the original lessees and they are now bound by the terms and conditions of the agreement for lease executed with the original lessees.

After liberation of Bangladesh the allottees of the plots of the Housing Society were not found and as such the said plots were declared abandoned by the Government. But in pursuance of certificate cases filed for recovery of land development tax against the allottees under the Public Demands Recovery Act, some of the plots of the society were sold in auction to different auction purcha-sers, that is, the respondents. The petitioner feeling aggrieved by those auction sales filed Revision Case No. 25 of 1998 under section 53 of the Public Demands Recovery Act before the Deputy Commissioner, Khulna praying for setting aside the auction sales. The Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Khulna by his order dated 05.04.1993 set aside the auction sales.<br/><br/>Respondent Nos. 2 to 43 thereupon filed Miscellaneous Appeal No. 167 of 1993 before the Divisional Commissioner, Khulna. The Additional Divisional Commissioner, Khulna by judgment and order dated 03.01.1995 dismissed the appeal affirming the order of the Additional Deputy Commissioner. After that, respondent Nos. 2 to 4 preferred further appeal before the Land Appeal Board, Government of Bangladesh. The Land Appeal Board by the judgment and order dated 13.02.1997 allowed the appeal setting aside the orders passed by the Additional Divisional Commissioner, Khulna.<br/><br/>Against the aforesaid orders dated 13.02.1997, the appellant filed a petition for review before the Land Appeal Board which by its judgment and order dated 11.05.1997 rejected the petition of review.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the order dated 11.05.1997, the appellant thereafter moved the High Court Division in its writ jurisdiction by filing Writ Petition No. 3459 of 2000 and obtained Rule Nisi.<br/>Respondent No.7 filed one set of affidavit-in-opposition. The case of this respondent, in short, is that the owners of plots of land of Mouza-Goalpara (Housing), defaulted in payment of land development tax and as such, on the direction of the Deputy Commissioner, Khulna, vide Memo No. 849/C dated 18.11.1984 advertisement for sale of the concerned plots of land in Khalishpur Housing Estate was made under the provisions of the Public Demands Recovery Act. In response to the said advertisement, respondent No. 7 with other respondents participated in the open bid for auction of the plots and the concerned plots were sold in auction by the Certificate Officer on 16.04.1984 in Certificate Case No. 8 of 1982-83 to the highest bidders. The sale was confirmed on 17.06.1984, sale certificate was issued on 20.09.1984 and the delivery of possession was given in favour of respondent No.7 on 26.09.1984. In this manner, respondent No.7 and other respondents purchased their respective plots of land in auction held by the Certificate Officer for which they made their bids. Therefore, they are not in any way connected either with the original allottees or with the appellant, Khalishpur Housing Estate. The further case of this respondent is that the concerned plots of land were never declared abandoned; rather, the respondents purchased those plots in certificate sales held by the concerned officials of the Government for non-payment of the development tax by the owners of those plots of lands and as such, the appellant never had any claim in respect of the said plots. Consequently, the writ petition is liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>The affidavit-in-opposition filed on behalf of the other respondents also raised similar contentions.   <br/><br/>The High Court Division after hearing the parties discharged the rule by its judgment and order dated 24.01.2004.<br/><br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with judgment and order dated 24.01.2004 passed by the High Court Division, the appellant moved this Division by filing Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1032 of 2004.  Upon hearing the parties, this Division granted leave on 23.03.2006 resulting in the initiation of Civil Appeal No. 47 of 2006.<br/><br/>Mr. Rajik-Al-Jalil, learned Deputy Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the appellant, submits that the tenants having no authority to sell or dispose of the demised property before construction of building thereon except with the permission of the Government, the purchase of different plots of the Housing Society in auction was violative of the provisions of clause Nos. 19,20,21,22 and 24 of the deed of agreement of lease and the High Court Division erred in law in discharging the rule without considering this aspect of the matter. He further submits that the service of notice as envisaged under section 7 of the Public Demands Recovery Act which is mandatory provision of law having not been complied with the High Court Division erred in law in not making the rule absolute.<br/><br/>Mrs. Nahid Sultana, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing on behalf of respondent Nos. 2-5, 7-17, 21, 23, 24, 26, 30-35, 37, 41 and 42, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates, the impugned judgment and other papers incorporated in the paper book.<br/><br/>The submissions on which leave was granted should be stated at the very outset as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>Whether the tenants having no authority to sell or dispose of the demised property before construction of the building thereon except with the permission of the Government, the purchase of different plots of the Housing Society in auction were violative of the provisions in clause No. 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the deed of agreement of lease and the High Court Division erred in law in discharging rule without considering this aspect of the matter.<br/><br/>Whether the service of notice as envisaged under section 7 of the Public Demands Recovery Act which is mandatory provision of law having not been complied with the High Court Division erred in law in not making the rules absolute. He further submits that in view of the fact the same Land Appeal Board in Appeal Case No.2-28/97(Khulna) dismissed the appeal of some other alleged auction purchasers and upheld the order of the Additional Commissioner, Khulna setting aside the certificate sales of some of the plots of the Khalishpur Housing Estate, the High Court Division erred in law in discharging the rule without considering that aspect of the matter and without applying its judicial mind.<br/><br/>Whether the lands in question being abandoned properties having vested in the Government of Bangladesh according to the provisions of P.O. 16 of 1972, the auction sales being violative of the provisions of said President’s Order, the High Court Division erred in law in discharging the rule.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Deputy Attorney General, the impugned judgment and the papers annexed to the paper book. Admittedly, the appellant, Khalishpur Housing Estate was established under the Ministry of Housing and Public Works in order to rehabilitate the refugees from India. The designated plots were allotted to the refugees back in 1961 and onwards. But subsequently, after liberation of Bangladesh, many of them were not found in their houses situated on those plots. Subsequently, land development tax for those plots was not paid to the Government. For realization of rents accrued against those plots, the revenue officials of the Government arranged for sale of those plots by public auction pursuant to the decision of the Deputy Commissioner, who was also the Collector of the District. In response to the offers, respondent Nos. 2-43, being the highest bidders, purchased those plots in public auction and obtained possession thereof from the concerned Government officials. There is nothing on record to show that the Certificate Officer, who conducted the sale, did not have the authority to do so. The objection of the appellant is that the provisions of section 7 of the Public Demands Recovery Act relating to issuance of notice were not complied with. Section 7 of the Public Demands Recovery Act requires that whenever a certificate case is filed in the office of the Certificate Officer under sections 4 or 6, he would cause the notice to be served upon the certificate debtors in the prescribed manner. But the fact remains that the appellant was not a certificate debtor. Admittedly, the certificate debtors were not found in their houses situated on the disputed plots and because of their non payment of land development tax, their plots were put on sale in public auction. In addition to above, the certificate debtors could raise objection in this respect and not anybody else. Therefore, the objection raised on behalf of the appellant, which is, admittedly, not a certificate debtor is not maintainable. The appellant could not show that any charge or dues had fallen outstanding against any of the disputed plots. The appellant contends that the terms and conditions of the deed of agreement for lease were violated. In this regard, the High Court Division came to a finding that the appellant could not provide any of the original agreement for lease which was executed by the then Government of East Pakistan and the concerned lessors or allottees, who were refugees from India. The High Court Division further found that it examined the proforma copy of an agreement for lease annexed to the writ petition as Annexure-E but could not find violation of any of the terms and conditions of the lease.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the disputed plots along with the structures standing thereon were sold in auction by the Government and it had the right to do so for non-payment land development tax through the Collector of the District under the provisions of the Public Demands Recovery Act.<br/><br/>There is no gainsaying the fact that the appellant, Khalishpur Housing Estate, was established under the Ministry of Housing and Public Works to rehabilitate the refugees from India. Therefore, the appellant is a Government Organization, which did not have the <em>locus-standi</em> to challenge the disputed auction sales held by competent Government officials. Consequently, the writ petition filed by the appellant was a misconceived one. It is important to note that the auction purchasers of the disputed plots stepped into the shoes of the original lessees and they are now bound by the terms and conditions of the agreement for lease executed with the original lessees. The learned Deputy Attorney General could not show any violation of the terms and conditions of any of the agreement for lease with the appellant.<br/><br/>The findings arrived at and the decision made by the High Court Division are based on proper appreciation of law and facts and do not call for interference. Therefore, we do not find any substance in this appeal.<br/><br/>        Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

He stated that the case land originally belonged to Rampada Mondal, Tarapada Mondal and Kalipada Mondal. The S.A Katian No. 2073 was rightly recorded in their names. Tarapada Mondal died leaving his wife Ranga Bala Mondal and daughter Swashani Roy as his heirs. Pre-emptor petitioner purchased their share by a registered deed dated 04.01.1982. The pre-emptor petitioner also purchased the share of Kalipada Mondol through a registered deed dated 17.11.1980 and thereby he became co-sharer to the case land. Rampada Roy died leaving behind his son Shree Vas Roy as his heir and thereby the pre-emptor petitioner and the said Sree Vas Roy remained co-sharer of the case land. The  said son of late Rampada Roy, Sree Vas sold out the case land to the pre-emptee opposite party No.1 Mst. Naitan Nessa by executing a registered deed dated 01.02.1996 beyond the knowledge of the pre-emptor petitioner. The pre-emptee opposite party No. 1 Mst. Naitan Nessa is a stranger in the suit jot. Thereafter on 02.03.1996 the petitioner instituted the case for pre-emption.<br/><br/>The opposite party No.1 Mst. Naitan Nessa contested the case by filing a written objection. She stated that the case to be dismissed as bad for defect of parties. She also stated that pre-emptor petitioner did not mention as to how Tarapada Roy acquired his share of the land. Two deeds by virtue of which the pre-emptor claimed to have purchased some land from the case plot are forged and fabricated. Pre-emptor petitioner was present at the time of talk of sale and at his mediation case land was transferred in her favour and consideration of the case land was also settled at Tk. 8,000/- through him (Pre-emptor) and after purchase of the case land she has been living there by erecting thatched hut. Since the case land had been transferred in her favour at the mediation of the pre-emptor, his right of pre-emption has waived as a co-sharer.<br/><br/>The trial court taking deposition of both the parties considered the materials on record and pleased to dismiss the Miscellaneous Case and against which the pre-emptor as appellant preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No. 28 of 1999 before the learned District Judge, Magura who transferred the same to the then Sub-ordinate Judge, 1st Court, Magura for disposal, who by his impugned judgment and order dated 19.10.1999 dismissed the Miscellaneous Appeal and thereby affirmed the judgment and order of the trial court. Thereafter the petitioner moved this court and obtained the present rule as stated above.<br/><br/>Mr. Riazuddin Khan, the learned Advocate for the petitioner submits the following submission in support of the Rule:<br/>(1) The impugned judgment and order is bad in law and on facts.<br/>(2) Both the courts below have fallen into error of law occasioning failure of justice in holding that the case land was transferred at the mediation of the pre-emptor-petitioner.<br/>(3) Both the courts below concurrently failed to consider the settled principle of law that mere presence of knowledge cannot take way the statutory right of a pre-emptor, and<br/>(4) Both the courts below concurrently failed to appreciate that the evidence on records do not make out a case of waiver and acquiescence.<br/> <br/>The pre-emptee-opposite party No. 1 did not enter appearance in the rule though the notice was duly served upon her.<br/> <br/>The learned Assistant Judge framed as many as 4 following issues in disposing the Miscellaneous Case:<br/>(a) Whether the case is maintainable in its present form?<br/>(b) Whether the case is bad for defect of parties?<br/>(c) Whether the case is barred by law of limitation?<br/>(d) Whether the applicant is entitled to get relief of pre-emption as prayed for?<br/> <br/>The learned Assistant Judge decided the issue Nos. a-c in favour of the pre-emptor petitioner. And lastly has taken decision about issue No. d against the pre-emptor-petitioner and held that the pre-emptor had knowledge about transfer of the case land and at his mediation such transfer was made.<br/> <br/>The pre-emptor petitioner examined solely himself in the instant case who reiterated the version of the Miscellaneous Case filed under section 96 of the State Acquisition &amp; Tenancy Act.<br/> <br/>The P.W. 1 produced S. A katian No. 2073 (exhibit-1), deed No. 6632 dated 17.11.80 (exhibit-2), deed No. 147 dated 04.01.1982 (exhibit-3) certified copy of the disputed deed No. 435 dated 01.02.1996 (exhibit-4).<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that he came to know from pre-emptee about the transfer of the case land for the 1st time and at that time no one present thereat. He denied the suggestion that he had knowledge about transfer and at his mediation transfer was made and he waived his statutory right.<br/><br/>On the other hand O.P.W.1 Naitan Nessa stated that she had to work as a maid servant to the deferent houses for her livelihood. She also stated that she purchased the case land at the instance of the pre-emptor and at his mediation transfer was made at a consideration of TK. 8,000/-. She stated that there was a talk of transfer in the house of pre-emptor and at that time her brother (O.P.W. 2) Muslim Uddin and her vendor Sree Vas were present.<br/><br/>In cross-examination she stated that there was a hut and subsequently she constructed a thatched hut in the case land. O.P.W. 2 Muslim Uddin also stated about his presence at the time of talking of transfer of the case land in the house of pre-emptor and said that the pre-emptor himself negotiated the price of the case land. Upon such materials evidence on record the learned trial court dismissed the Miscellaneous Case on the ground of waiver and acquiescence. The learned appellant court after hearing both the parties also dismissed the appeal and thereby affirmed the judgment and order of the trial court concurring with the finding of the trial court as a final court of fact.<br/>   <br/>I have gone through the materials on record namely the pleadings of the case, evidence produced by the parties, exhibited documents and considered the submissions of the learned Advocate for the pre-emptor petitioner and the grounds taken in the revision application by the pre-emptor-petitioner.<br/><br/>In the case of <strong>Nayarandas Nandkishore vs. Jagan Nath</strong> and others reported in AIR 1950 (Madhya Bharat) 85, it has been held that:“Both as a proposition of Mohammadan law as well as principle of equity, if a Pre-emptor has given his consent before sale, he should not be allowed to assert his claim after the sale.”It has further been held that: “In Pre-emption cases, the Doctrine of estoppels as a substantive rule of law is to be invoked and as a result of if when a Pre-emptor refuses to purchase or consents to a sale or acquiesces he is stopped from subsequently ascertaining his claim of Pre-emption.”<br/><br/>In the case of <strong>Maulana Abdul Karim vs. Nurjahan Begum</strong> and others, reported in VI BLD, 125. It has been held that “when the Pre-emptor negotiates the sale under Pre-emption or the facts are such that his acquiescence can be safely concluded, the doctrine of estoppels comes into full play. His conduct will be a bar even though he files his application for Pre-emption within time and even though Pre-emption is a statutory right.”<br/><br/>The case under my consideration is therefore, not so much a case of only waiver, but to also a case of acquiescence and also a case of estoppel under section 115 of the Evidence Act. The concurrent finding of facts is that the Pre-emptor had a leading part in bringing about the transaction by assisting the seller in selling the land and encouraged the buyer in purchasing it and himself negotiated the price, the conduct of the Pre-emptor is sufficient to give rise to waiver and acquiescence and as such estoppels operates against him.<br/><br/>It appears that the pre-emptor petitioner examined himself only and he could not prove the date of knowledge about transfer by adducing any other corroborative evidence. On the other hand the pre-emptee has been able to prove that the transfer was held at the mediation of the pre-emptor who settled the price of the transfer by producing O.P.W. 2 in court, who proved his presence at the time of talk of sale to the house of the pre-emptor.<br/><br/>O.P.W-1 Mst. Naitan Nessa stated in her cross -examination that:<br/>“জমি কেনা বেচার পরে জমি রেজিষ্ট্রি হয়।  কথা বার্তার ১০/১৫ দিন পরে জমি রেজিষ্ট্রি হয়। জমির মূল্য শ্রীবাস আমার কাছে ৮০০০/- টাকা চায়। জমির মূল্য রুহুল আমিন ও আমার ভাই মোসলেম শেখ ঠিক করে দেন। রুহুল মেয়ে পাঠায়ে আমাকেই ডেকে আনেন। রুহুল আমিন বলেন যে,তুমি অন্যের বাড়ী কাজ করে বেড়াও জমি তুমিই কেন। সকাল১০ টার দিকে কথা বার্তা হয়। ঞ্জগুগুগু..টাকা দেই রুহুল আমিনের বাড়ীতে  প্রথম ৪০০০/- টাকা দেই। টাকা দেওয়ার সময় আমার ভাই রুহুল আমিন ও শ্রীবাস ছিল।<br/><br/>O.P.W-2 .Moslemuddin stated in this cross that:<br/>“নালীশি জমি কেনা বেচার কথা বার্তার সময় আমি ছিলাম। রহুল আমিনের বাড়ীতে কথাবার্তা হয়z আমাকে ডেকে আনেন শ্রীবাস..............................।“রুহুল আমিনের বাড়ীতে আমি অনুমান  ৮/৯ টার দিকে যাই। রুহুল আমিন কে বলি নালিশী জমির তুমি শরিক  তুমি জমি রাখ। রুহুল আমিন বলে যে, আমার জমি নেওয়ার কায়দা নেই। এর পর রুহুল আমিন তার মেয়েকে দিয়ে নয়তনকে ডাকায়” ............................প্রথম ৪০০০/- টকা দেওয়ার সময় আমি ছিলাম। নয়তন দেয় আমাকে আমি রুহুল আমিনকে দিই,রুহুল আমিন শ্রীবাস কে টাকা দেয়।<br/><br/>From the perusal of the evidence of o.p.ws it transpires that at the mediation of the pre-emptor talk was held and price of the case land was also settled in his house in presence of o. p. w. 1, o.p.pw. 2 and the vendor Sree Vas thereby clear case of waiver and acquiescence is established and both the courts below rightly held that the case is barred by waiver and acquiescence and rejected the prayer for pre-emption accordingly.<br/><br/>Moreover finding of facts arrived at by the courts below concurrently as to waiver and acquiescence cannot be interfered in revision until and unless the said findings is found to be perverse and in the instant case I do not find any perversity with the finding of both the courts below.  <br/><br/>For the reasons stated above, the judgment and order of the courts below need not be interfered with.<br/><br/>In the result, the rule is discharged however without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>Let a copy of this judgment and lower courts record be sent immediately.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Zahirul Hoque, J.</u></strong></span><br/><br/>This rule was issued calling upon the opposite party Nos. 1 and 2 to show cause as to why the impugned order No. 96 dated 24.08.2010 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Sadar, Chittagong in Miscellaneous Case No. 07 of 2007 arising out of Other Suit No. 56 of 2005, should not be set aside and/or pass such other or further order or orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/><br/>Facts relevant for the purpose of disposal of the rule, in short, is that the petitioners as plaintiffs instituted a suit being Other Suit No. 56 of 2005 before the Court of learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Sadar, Chittagong praying for Specific Performance of Contract impleading the opposite party Nos. 1-3 as defendants.<br/><br/>The case of the plaintiffs in short, is that the opposite party Nos. 1 and 2 being owner and possessor of the suit schedule land offered to transfer the suit land by Saf Kabala deed and the plaintiffs accepted the offer of the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 fixing the value of the suit schedule land at Tk. 15,00,000/-(Taka fifteen lacs) only. Thereafter the plaintiffs paid Tk. 14,60,000/- (Taka fourteen lacs sixty thousand) only on 18.09.2002 to the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 as earnest money by executing an agreement for sale. It was stipulated in the agreement for sale that defendants would received the rest of earnest money of Tk. 40,000/-(Taka fourty thousand) only and will executed and registered a Saf Kabala deed in favour of the plaintiffs. But subsequently the defendants did not execute and register a Saf Kabala deed in favour of the plaintiffs in spite of repeated demand for Saf Kabal deed. Hence the plaintiffs filed the instant suit for Specific Performance of Contract.<br/><br/>Thereafter the summons of the suit were properly served upon the defendants. But in spite of service of summons the defendants did not appear in the suit. Thereafter the suit was fixed for examination of witnesses and 3 (three) P. Ws were examined on behalf of the plaintiffs and after considering the evidence on record the learned Joint District Judge, Chittagong exparte decreed the suit by his judgment and decree dated 28.03.2006 (decree signed on 04.04.2006).<br/><br/>Thereafter the defendants being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid exparte judgment and decree filed a case being Miscellaneous Case No. 07 of 2007 on 26.05.2007 under Order 9 Rule 13 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the exparte decree on the averments that the plaintiffs obtained the exparte decree through an agreement for sale which is false, fabricated without consideration and created through false personification.<br/><br/>As against the aforesaid Miscellaneous Case filed by the defendants the plaintiffs appeared in the Miscellaneous Case and filed a written objection on 19.09.2007 contending inter-alia that the summons of Other Suit No. 56 of 2005 were properly served upon the defendants. Moreover, the defendants are not entitled to get the benefit of Order 9 Rule 13(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure and as such the Miscellaneous Case filed by the defendants is liable to be rejected.<br/><br/>Thereafter the plaintiff Nos. 1-3 filed 02(two) other additional written objection on 12.02.2008 and 26.10.2009 denying the averment of the defendants made in the Miscellaneous Case praying for its dismissal.<br/><br/>During the pendency of the aforesaid Miscellaneous Case for hearing the plaintiffs filed an application on 24.08.2010 for examination of the signature of the defendants by hand writing expert to compare the signature of the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 with the signature of the defendants put in the postal A/D summons returned in Court with the service report.<br/><br/>After hearing the aforesaid application for handwriting expert the learned Joint District Judge (in charge), 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Sadar, Chittagong rejected the said application on 24.08.2010 with the findings that there is no necessity of appearing of defendants for examination of their signature put in the summons returned in Court with service report and against the said order of the learned Joint District Judge the petitioner preferred this revisional application and obtained the present rule.<br/><br/>Mr. Ahsanul Kabir, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners submits that the learned Joint District Judge without giving any reason summarily rejected the application which is bad in law inasmuch as against the materials on record and the same is liable to be set aside. He further submits that the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 received the same by executed the signature on the return and it can be decided by the hand writing expert so the learned Joint District Judge ought to allow the application of the petitioner but it committed an error of law by rejecting the said application. In support of his submission the learned Advocate for the petitioners referred a decision in the case of <strong>Government of Bangladesh represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Public Works and another Vs. M. Saiful Alam and others, reported in 6 BLD 201</strong>.  He lastly prays that the rule be made absolute.<br/><br/>Mr. Sk. Md. Zahangir Alam, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite party submits that originally the case was started in the year, 1996 and the petitioner filed the application for hand writing expert on the date of argument of the Miscellaneous Case which has nothing but with an intention to delay the trial of the case, therefore the rejection order of the Trial Court is very much proper and legal. However, he submitted that the hand writing can be examined by the Court itself as per section 73 of the Evidence Act without making any delay and in passing such direction upon the court below the matter can be disposed of.<br/><br/>Heard the learned Advocates for both the sides, perused the materials on record including the impugned order itself.<br/><br/>We have gone through the impugned order dated 24.08.2010 and the relevant portion of the order is as under; “এমতাবস্থায় ১-৩ নং প্রতিপক্ষের দরখাস্ত না মঞ্জুর করা হইল। আগামী ২৬/৯/২০১০ইং তারিখ যুক্তি তর্ক শুনানী।”<br/><br/>It appears that the learned Subordinate Judge without giving any specific reason for rejecting the prayer has passed the opinion to the effect that; “উক্ত বিষয়ে সিদ্ধান্ত  গ্রহন বা প্রমান করার জন্য নানা উপায় আছে।” And the findings and opinion of the court below are very much unspecific which does not carries any value in the eye of law.<br/><br/>We have gone through the decision in the case of <strong>Ishaque (Md) Vs. Ekramul Haque Chowdhury and others, reported in 54 DLR (AD) 26 </strong>in where their lordships held that,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>“It is well settled that Section 73 of the Evidence Act permits the Court to make a comparison of signature or writings and so adoption of such a method cannot be termed as hazardous or dangerous.”</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Therefore in the light of the above decision along with the facts and circumstances of the case we find that the ends of justice would be met if the learned Subordinate Judge disposal the matter after examining the hand writing by himself as per provision of Section 73 of the Evidence Act we have got the notice that the matter is very much old of 1996.<br/><br/>Accordingly we find substances in the submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/><br/>In the result, the rule is made absolute. The impugned order No. 96 dated 24.08.2010 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Sadar, Chittagong in Miscellaneous Case No. 07 of 2007 arising out of Other Suit No. 56 of 2005 is hereby set aside and on the other hand, the learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Sadar, Chittagong is hereby also directed to disposal the matter in accordance with law after taking decision in the said hand writing in pursuance of Section 73 of the Evidence Act instead of other expart  opinion within 03 (three) months from the date of received of this judgment and order.<br/><br/>Send down a copy of the judgment and order to the court below at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Riazul Haque Khan as plaintiffs on 6.9.2003 instituted Title Suit No. 251 of 2003 in the Court of Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Dhaka impleading the opposite parties as defendants praying a decree for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession on the averments that the suit land being C.S. Khatian No. 138, Plot No. 55 of Mouza-Bhater, Police Station-Gulshan, Dhaka measuring an area of 6 decimals belonged to Karim Kha, who died leaving behind 5 (five) sons namely Samir Kha, Mohammad Kha, Ainuddi Kha, Jainuddin Kha and Jamir Kha. Jamir Kha died leaving behind 2 sons Habibullah and Aminuddin. Shamir Kha died leaving 3 sons Afzuddin, Riazuddin and Shahabuddin and 2 daughters Jamila Khatun and Ayesha Khatun and 2 wives Alladi Bibi and Ator Banu. Plaintiffs and Ayesha Khatun were born in the womb of Ator Banu. Sahabuddin and Jamila Khatun were born in the womb of Alladi Bibi. Ayesha Khatun while possessing the suit land including other land as her ancestral share, died leaving her husband Omar Ali and 2 brothers, the plaintiffs and mother Ator Banu. Then Omar Ali amicably had been possessing the suit land including other land as the share of his wife Ayesha Khatun. During the life time of Ayesha Khatun there was a talk she would transfer her share to the plaintiffs but after the death of Ayesha Khatun her husband Omar Ali sold her share to the defendants by a registered deed No. 2358 dated 15.02.1966. But the defendants did not get possession of the suit land. Thereafter, a salish took place in the locality over the matter and the defendants transferred 20.5  decimals of land including 6 decimals of suit land to the plaintiffs by a registered Heba-Bil-Ewaz deed No. 4559 dated 09.04.1969 but the plaintiffs had possessed the suit land before execution of the deed dated 15.02.1966. Suit land was mutated to the plaintiffs name and in the R.S. Khatian the name of the plaintiffs had been recorded duly. Defendants instituted Title Suit No. 94 of 1999 against the plaintiffs for cancelation of said Heba-Bil- Ewaz deed No. 4559 dated 09.04.1969 which was dismissed on contest and against which Title Appeal No. 745 of 1999 was preferred and the same was also dismissed on 8.5.2000. Thereafter the defendants forcibly dispossessed the plaintiffs from the suit land on 23.06.2002 and entered therein and hence the suit.<br/> <br/>The defendant Nos. 1 and 2 entered appearance and contested the suit by filing a joint written statement denying most of the averments of the plaint stating inter alia that the suit is not maintainable in its present form, there is no cause of action for filing of the suit, and the suit was also barred by law of limitation. Further case of the defendants are that they purchased 31.5 decimals of land from 28 plots of C.S. Khatian No. 138 by a registered deed No. 2358 dated 15.02.1966 from Omar Ali, the husband of Ayesha Khatun and out of the decision of a Salish, the defendants gifted 20.5 decimals of land to the plaintiffs by a registered deed No. 4559 dated 09.04.1969. Defendants got 11 decimals of land under C.S Plot No. 55 by inheritance and purchase, and they had been possessing their homestead for last 50 years and the plaintiffs also possessing their homestead for last 20/25 years. Defendants never sold out 6 decimals of suit land to the plaintiffs and did not dispossess them from the suit land on 23.06.2002 and hence the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>The learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Dhaka on the pleading of the parties framed as many as 4 (four) issues to determine the suit.<br/><br/>At the trial the plaintiffs examined as many as 5 P.Ws. and the defendants examined in all 2 D.Ws. and both the parties exhibited a series of documents including their registered deeds to prove their respective cases. The learned Joint District Judge decreed the suit by his judgment dated 30.11.2008 holding that the plaintiffs having been able to prove their title as well as possession and dispossession in the suit land.<br/>The unsuccessful defendants, thereupon, preferred Title Appeal No. 438 of 2008 before the learned District Judge, Dhaka. Eventually the said appeal was transmitted to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Court of Additional District Judge, Dhaka for disposal who by the impugned judgment and decree dated 15.07.2010 allowed the appeal and set-aside the judgment and decree of the trial court below holding that without partition the suit is not maintainable and the plaintiffs failed to prove their possession in the suit land and dispossession thereof.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 15.07.2010 the plaintiffs as petitioners have come before this Court and obtained the present Rule.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Lutfor Rahman Mandal, learned Advocate appearing with Ms. Feodora Rahman Pretty on behalf of the petitioners having placed the evidence of both the sides and other materials on record including the judgment of two courts below submits that the impugned judgment of the court of appeal below is not a proper judgment of reversal as the court of appeal below without adverting the material findings of the trial court most illegally without and decree of the trial court holding that the plaintiffs failed to prove their possession in the suit land and dispossession thereof and as such the impugned judgment and decree of the appellate court should be set-aside.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the petitioners submits further that the court of appeal below made a perverse finding that without partition the plaintiffs cannot get decree for declaration of title and recovery of possession, which has arrived at beyond material evidence on record, as the plaintiffs had possessed the suit land with specific boundaries since 1966.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the petitioners next submits that the court of appeal below as a final court of fact without discussing all the P.Ws. allowed the appeal and thereby dismissed the suit of the plaintiffs which has occasioned a failure of justice.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the petitioners lastly submits that the appellate court was not justified in disturbing the finding of fact of the trial court and thus the decision of the appellate court’s below should be set-aside and the judgment of the trial court should be restored.<br/><br/>None appears for the opposite parties although notices have been served upon them.<br/><br/>Now, to deal with the contentions raised by the learned Advocate for the petitioners we feel it necessary to decide first whether the plaintiff-petitioners have been succeeded to prove their case by adducing evidence both oral and documentary. For coming to appropriate decision about sustainability of the impugned judgment and decree, we need to assess and examine whether the impugned judgment and decree suffer from any error of law of which resulting in an error in the impugned decision occasioning failure of justice. In doing so we also thought it proper to examine the evidence on record as the appellate court below did not discuss all the evidence produced by the parties of the suit.<br/><br/>P.W-1 Md. Riajul Haque Khan, stated that they got the suit land along with other land from the defendants and had been possessing the same. The defendants transferred the suit land to the plaintiffs by a Heba-Bil-Ewaz deed dated 9.4.1969 and delivered possession thereof in favour of them and they got possession of the suit land from plot No. 55. The defendants forcibly disposed them on 23.06.2002 from the suit properties.<br/><br/>P.W-2 Omar Ali, stated that he got the suit land along with other land as an inheritor of his wife Ayesha Khatun and sold out the suit land along with other land to the defendants in the year 1966 and subsequently the defendant No.1 and his wife, defendant No. 2 transferred 20  decimals of land including the suit land to the plaintiffs by a registered Heba-Bil-Ewaz deed dated 09.04.1969. This P.W-2 stated that the plaintiffs were dispossessed from the suit land on 23.6.2002 by the defendants. He deposed that he was a judge.<br/><br/>P.W-3 Jamal Uddin, stated that the defendants transferred the suit land to the plaintiffs by a Heba-Bil-Ewaz deed and the plaintiffs possessed the suit land but later on 23.06.2002 they were dispossessed form the suit land by the defendants. This P.W-3 also stated that the plaintiffs had possessed the suit land with specific boundary thereof.<br/><br/>P.W-4 Halim Bhayan, stated that he was a tenant of the plaintiffs and the defendants dispossessed the plaintiffs from the suit property on 23.06.2002.<br/><br/>P.W-5 Md. Habibur Rahman,an Advocate commissioner stated that he made an investigation over the suit land and prepared sketch map of the suit land and identified thereof and submitted report to the court and the defendants raised objection about his report.<br/><br/>D.W-1 stated in cross-examination that<em>“</em>আমার পিতা যখন মারা যায় তখন আমার সৎ বোন আয়শা খাতুন তাহার ড়বতক্ষন প্রাপ্ত হয়। আমার বোন আয়শা ৫৫ দাগের সম্পত্তিতে মালিক থাকে।<em>”</em><br/><em>............... “</em> ওমর আলীর কাছ থেকে যে সম্পত্তি খরিদ করি উহা বাদীদের দান করিয়া দেই।<em>”</em><br/><br/>But D.W-2 stated in cross-examination that he did not know whether the land owned by Ayesha Khatun was transferred to the plaintiffs.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned Advocate for the petitioners, perused the evidence on record including the judgment of the two courts below and exhibited documents produced by boththe contending parties, wherefrom it transpires that the trial court below having found plaintiffs title, possession and dispossession in the suit land decreed the suit but the court of appeal below without controverting the findings of the trial court below allowed the appeal and thereby dismissed the suit of the plaintiffs on the finding that without partition the plaintiffs cannot get a decree for declaration of title and recovery of possession in the suit land, which is based on misreading and non-consideration of the material evidence on record. It appears that the appellate court below as a final court of fact did not discuss, assess and analyse all the plaintiffs’ witnesses and came to a wrong conclusion that without partition the plaintiffs are not entitled to get decree for declaration of title and recovery of possession in the suit land which is contrary to the evidence on record. When the plaintiffs succeeded to prove their possession in the suit land before their dispossession by giving oral and documentary evidence and the defendants did not deny the transfer of land from plot No. 55 to the plaintiffs by a Heba-Bil-Ewaz deed dated 09.04.1969 (exhibit-6) in such a situation the defendants cannot claim title over the suit land. We have also noticed that the defendants earlier filed Title Suit No. 94 of 1999 against this plaintiffs for cancelation of registered Heba-Bil-Ewaz deed dated 09.04.1969 (exhibit-6) executed by the defendants of the instant suit in favour of the plaintiffs and the suit was dismissed on contest (exhibit-10) and the appeal was preferred which was also dismissed(exhibit-11) but the judgment of the said appellate court was not challenged by the defendants of the present suit in any higher forum. It appears that the court of appeal below failed to notice the testimony of D.W. 1 who stated that they transferred 20 .5 decimals of land to the plaintiffs by a Heba-Bil-Ewaz deed dated 9.4.1969 (Exhibit-6), which clearly supported the plaintiffs’ case and thus the plaintiffs’ case has been substantiated by the evidence of the defendants side.<br/><br/>It is necessary to mention here that the appellate court in its judgment held that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“Therefore I do not take any exception but to form an opinion in favour of the plaintiff’s title”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It means the defendants have no title over the suit land and as such plaintiffs title had been found concurrently by both the courts below.<br/><br/>When all the P.Ws. consistently corroborated each other and succeeded to prove the possession and dispossession of the plaintiffs in the suit land in such a situation the plaintiffs are entitled to get decree for declaration of title and recovery of possession of the suit land. Since the suit land is properly demarcated and the same is substantiated by the report of the Advocate Commissioner and other evidence, in such a situation prayer for partition is not necessary and thus the suit is very much maintainable in its present form. We have already found that the plaintiff’s witnesses succeeded to prove the possession of plaintiffs in the suit land before their dispossession. But the appellate court committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in reversing the judgment and decree of the trial court without considering the material evidence and without adverting to the finding of the trial court below.<br/><br/>From the evidence on record and the exhibited documents we find substance in the submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioners.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute, however without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>The judgment and decree dated 15.07.2010 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka in Title Appeal No.438 of 2008 is hereby set-aside and the judgment and decree dated 30.10.2008 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Dhaka in Title suit No. 251 of 2003 is hereby affirmed.<br/><br/>Communicate this judgment and order at once to the court concerned for information and necessary action.<br/><br/>Send back the lower court’s record immediately.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Zahirul Hoque</u></strong><strong><u>, J.</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This rule was issued calling upon the opposite party to show cause as to why the impugned order dated 08.04.2001 passed by the Subordinate Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka in Miscellaneous Case No. 726 of 1983 allowing the Miscellaneous case by setting aside the judgment and decree dated 08.07.1983 passed exparte by the learned Subordinate Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka in S.C.C. Suit No. 62 of 1980 decreeing the suit should not be set aside and or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/><br/>Facts, relevant for the purpose of disposal of the rule, in short, is that the petitioner as the plaintiff filed S. C. C Suit No. 62 of 1980 before the Subordinate Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka for ejectment of a monthly tenant.<br/><br/>The case of the plaintiff-petitioner as set out in the plaint in short is that the plaintiff purchased holding No. 135, Sakhari Bazar from Sreemati Bilash Manjuri Sur by a registered sale deed dated 31.05.1969 and after purchase the plaintiff mutated his name in the S. A. Khatian No. 2766. That the vendor of the plaintiff Sreemati Bilash Sur let out one room as mentioned in the schedule to the defendant at a monthly rent of Tk. 50.00. After purchase of the said holding the plaintiff on several occasions demanded rent of the tenanted room from the defendant and the defendant by raising false excuse did not pay rent to the plaintiff. The plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 43 of 1972 in the Court of 1<sup>st</sup> Munsif, Dhaka against this defendant and Sreemati Bilash Manjuri Sur and others for permanent injunction restraining the defendant not to pay rent of his tenanted room to the aforesaid Sreemati Bilash Manjuri Sur or others and the said suit was decreed on 13.07.1972 against the defendant and others. Even after passing of the decree of permanent injunction the present opposite party did not care to pay rent of his tenanted room to the plaintiff. A notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was sent to the opposite party but he refused to accept it. The defendant is a defaulter and his tenancy has been terminated by serving the said notice. The plaintiff requires the room for his bonafide use and occupation and also for thorough repair. The plaintiff is entitled in equity and law to evict the defendant and get the room in his khass possession.<br/><br/>The defendant opposite party contested the case by filing a written statement deying all the material allegations made in the plaint. The case of the defendant opposite party in short is that the case is not maintain able in the present form, there is no cause of action and that the plaintiff has no title over the case property, the defendant is the tenant of Bilash Monjuri Sur and pays rent to her. The defendant is not a defaulter as a tenant. The case property is not required by the plaintiff as bonafide and as the suit will be dismissed.<br/><br/>The case was fixed for hearing on different dates and the defendant took time from the Court in several times. On 29.06.1985 on the prayer of the defendant time was allowed as a last chance with a cost of Tk. 70/- in favour of the plaintiff-petitioner. On 08.07.1985 the case was fixed for preemptory hearing and the learned Subordinate Judge decreed the suit exparte after hearing and considering the oral and documentary evidence.<br/><br/>The plaintiff-petitioner filed Execution Case No. 74 of 1985 for the recovery of possession of the suit property and on 17.08.1985 on the instruction of the Bailif of the Court the defendant vacated the suit property and possession was delivered to the plaintiff-petitioner by the Court.<br/><br/>Thereafter the defendant-opposite party filed Miscellaneous Case No. 726 of 1985 in the said Court to set aside the decree dated 17.08.1985 and the plaintiff-petitioner was contesting the Miscellaneous Case by filing a written objection. The plaintiff-petitioner as Advocate of District Court at Dhaka is an old man aged about 90 years fell sick in the month of February, 2001 and the Doctor advised and prescribed him to take complete bed rest.<br/><br/>Under such unavoidable circumstances the plaintiff executed a power of attorney appointing his son, Mr. Provat Kumar Sarker (Sunil) but due to unavoidable circumstances he could not appear before the Court and ultimately Miscellaneous case was allowed  exparte in the absence of the plaintiff. Though, no deposit of the amount due under the decree was deposited in the Court by the opposite party.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the order dated 08.04.2001 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka in Miscellaneous Case No. 726 of 1985 the petitioner preferred this revisional application and obtained the present rule.<br/><br/>Mr. M. G. Mahmud (Shaheen), the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that since the opposite party did not deposit the amount as due under the decree neither above the Court nor to the plaintiff land lord and therefore the statutory mandatory provision of Section 17 of the Small Cause Courts Act has been violated but the learned court below failed to consider this legal aspect and thereby the impugned judgment is bad in law. He categorically submits that after obtaining decree from the Small Causes Court by the plaintiff petitioner then filed execution case and that decree has already been executed long before the impugned order and after execution of the decree in the execution case then the decree in SCC suit has been set aside by the learned court below is an infractous one which has no value in the eye of law but the learned court below who himself is the execution court has failed to consider this material as well as legal aspect and therefore it committed an error in passing the order. He lastly submits that the defendant opposite party willfully and deliverately was absent on the date of experte decree of the SCC suit while he was present and contested the SCC suit by filing written statement without denying the land lordship of the petitioner this material fact was not considered by the lower Court in passing the impugned order and therefore the impugned order is also against the material on record and the same is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>No one appears for the opposite party to oppose the rule.<br/><br/>Heard the learned Advocate for the petitioners, perused the materials on record including the judgment and order itself.<br/><br/>It appears from the statement of the application under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure in where the petitioner obtained the decree in the SCC suit on 07.08.1985 and then on Execution Case No. 74 of 1985 for recovery of possession was preferred and in pursuance of bailiff of the Court the defendant opposite party vacated the suit property and on 17.08.1985 the petitioner restored his possession. Thereafter the opposite party filed the Miscellaneous Case No. 726 of 1985 in the said Court for setting aside the experte decree which was already executed and before that defendant opposite party did not deposit the amount due under the decree neither before the Court nor to the plaintiff and therefore it violated the statutory mandatory provision of Section 17 of the Small Cause Courts Act and the Section 17 of the Small Cause Courts Act is as under;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>“Application of the Code of Civil Procedure-(1) [The procedure prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, (V of 1908) shall, save in so far is otherwise provided by that Code or by this Act], be the procedure followed in a Court of Small Causes in all suits cognizable by it and in all proceedings arising out of such suits. </strong><br/><br/><strong>Provided that an applicant for an order to set aside a decree passed ex parte or for a review of judgment shall, at the time of presenting his application, either deposit in the Court the amount due from him under the decree or in pursuance of the judgment, or give [such security for the performance of the decree or compliance with the judgment as the Court may, on a previous application made by him in this behalf, have directed].</strong><br/><br/><strong>(2) Where a person has become liable as surety under the proviso to sub-section (1), the security may be realized in manner provided by section [145] of the Code of Civil Procedure. [1908].”</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>This above proviso shows that it was the mandatory duty of the opposite party to deposit the amount due to him under the decree or any such security for the performance of the decree or compliance with the judgment as the Court may on a previous application made by him at the time of application made by the Court. This mandatory provision of law was not followed by the opposite party in filing the application for set aside the miscellaneous application. It further appears that the decree which obtained by the petitioner in SCC suit and that decree has been executed through an execution case and restored his possession before filing the miscellaneous case therefore the subsequent miscellaneous case for setting aside the decree has become no force in the eye of law under the facts and circumstances of this case. <br/>   <br/>Considering the above facts and circumstances and relevant provision of law, I find substance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner that the learned Subordinate Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka committed error of law in allowing the miscellaneous case and it further appears that the said miscellaneous case did not disclose any reason under what circumstances the miscellaneous application was allowed apparently the said impugned order is non speaking order which carries no value in the eye of law.<br/><br/>In view of the facts and circumstances and reasons thereof I am of the opinion that there is substance in the rule.<br/><br/>In the result, the rule is made absolute without any order as to costs.  The impugned order dated 08.04.2001 passed by the Subordinate Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka in Miscellaneous Case No. 726 of 1983 is hereby set aside.<br/><br/>The order of Stay granted at the time of issuance of the Rule on 11.11.2001 is hereby vacated.<br/><br/>Send down a copy of the judgment to the Court below at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

In view of language used in this section, any </strong><strong>vague or indefinite or incomplete information,</strong><strong> even if it relates to a cognizable offence, cannot be an information to be treated as an FIR. It cannot be a universal dogma that the information in respect of commission of a cognizable offence first in point of time to the Police Station is always must be an FIR and if it is taken as a matter of fact it will be risky and suicidal for the administration of criminal justice. Thus we find that the FIR lodged by PW 1, the father of deceased knowing the fact from the witnesses who were present in the scene of the occurrence was rightly treated as FIR by the Court below. . . .(67 and 70)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 154</strong><br/><strong>When any father losses his only beloved son like the deceased, it is very much natural and probable that he will be shocked and perplexed as it could be. So, it cannot be the top most priority of filing an FIR than that of the burial function of the deceased by a father. Moreso, immediate after occurrence PW 1 became also sick for the shock which he received due to the murder of his only son. So, in this particular case though the FIR was lodged after almost 22 hours but that cannot be considered as an inordinate delay in the above facts and circumstances of the case it cannot be considered that delay was caused intentionally in order to concoct the prosecution case. . . .(73)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I ov 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 3</strong><br/><strong>Mere relationship of the witnesses with the deceased or informant cannot be the only ground to discard the  evidence of such witnesses if they are not found biased in deposing the Court. In this particular case the ocular witness PW 2 is not a relation of the deceased though he is a man of informant’s camp for the same politics of BNP and though PWs 3 and 8 are the cousins of the deceased, but in the facts and circumstances of the case it led us to hold that they are the most natural, probable and competent witnesses of the occurrence as the situation, the time of occurrence and the place of occurrence provides their presence in the place of occurrence and there appears no biasness, emotion and falsity in their evidence. . . . (84)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 8</strong><br/><strong>The 4 witnesses were cross-examined by the defence extensively as to the means of recognition. But their evidences has not been shaken away in any way rather the evidence of PWs 2,3,8 and 13 as to the means of recognition is very much consistent and corroborative with one another. So, considering the consistent and credible evidence of P.Ws. 2,3,8 and 13 that they had seen the accused in the light of </strong><strong>electricity available in the place of occurrence</strong><strong> cannot be thrown away. . . . (93)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Penal Code (XLV of 1860)</strong><br/><strong>Section 34</strong><br/><strong>The reason for making more than one accused guilty under the provisions of section 34 of the Penal Code as the very presence of co-accused gives encouragement, support and protection to the person actually committing an act. It may so happen that without the support of the co-accused who did nothing other than standing on the scene with the master mind offender, he would not be able to hit the victim without the support of the co-accused. In this particular case it was not possible on the part of accused Mohammad Ali alone to cause a pistol shot on the ear of deceased Shafiq without the support, encouragement and protection of his other accomplice co-accused that is why all the accused persons who remaining present in the scene of occurrence had given support, encouragement and protection to the principal accused in committing the crime of murder of Shafiq is held liable under section 34 of the Penal Code. . . . (100)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 376</strong><br/><strong>As condemned prisoners Jewel alias Jahirul Haque, Akter Hossain son of Alimuddin, Abul Bashar alias Badsha and Shahin have been languishing in the condemned cell for a quite long time with a mental agony of death by hanging along with their tender age appears to us as extenuating circumstances to commute their sentence from death to </strong><strong>imprisonment for life.

Shaheen preferred Jail Appeal no. 110 of 2007, convicts Kamal and Jahirul Islam preferred Criminal Miscellaneous Case no. 5789 of 2008 and convict Jalil Miah preferred Criminal Miscellaneous Case no. 4472 of 2007 under section 561A of the Code to scrap of the judgment and order of conviction and sentence. Since the death reference, the criminal appeals, the jail appeals and criminal miscellaneous cases arose out of the same judgment and the order of conviction and sentence all the proceedings have been heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment.<br/><br/>Mr. M. A. Mannan Mohan, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing with Mr. Md. Osman Gani Khan, the learned Assistant Attorney General for the State having taken us through the judgment and order of conviction and sentence under the reference, the FIR, the evidence on record and the other materials on record makes his submission supporting the reference and opposing the appeals and criminal miscellaneous cases. He submits that a very shocking and gruesome murder of deceased Md. Shafiqul Islam was taken place on 08.11.2005 at 9.30 P.M. in front of Sunny confectionary (known also as Babul confectionary) at Vulta under Rupganj police station, Narayanganj when he was entering into his car by the convicts of this case and the occurrence of murder has been witnessed by the ocular witnesses namely PWs 2,3,8 and 9. The other witnesses namely PWs 10 and 12 also found some of the accused to leave the place of occurrence after causing murder of the deceased. He categorically submits that PWs 2,3,8 and 9 found accused Mohammad Ali to fire a pistol shot on the right ear of the deceased causing his instant death and the rest accused also had participated in the murder of Md. Shafiqul Islam with Mohammad Ali. They had raided the deceased as well as the car of the deceased so that the deceased cannot escape from the place of occurrence and thus they had actively participated in the murder of deceased Md. Shafiqul Islam jointly in furtherance of their common intention of all. He also submits that though the convicts and the deceased belonged to same political identity but there was a hitch between them. The convicts under the leadership of Mohammad Ali were engaged in the nefarious activities of the locality but the deceased tried to resist them but failed and the deceased also did not give blow to the illegal activities of the accused which made them furious. Before 3/4 days of occurrence, an illegal motor cycle used by accused Mohammad Ali was seized by the police. Accused Mohammad Ali and his followers held deceased Md. Shafiqul Islam responsible for the said seizing and took the decision to murder him and ultimately they had executed their plan murdering the deceased in the place of occurrence and after causing murder of the deceased they fled away successfully. But the eye witnesses found them in the light of the electricity available in the place of occurrence and the Tribunal being convinced of the univocal and cogent evidence of the eye witnesses and other materials on record found the accused guilty rightly under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code and awarded death sentence upon 6 (six) accused and imprisonment for life upon the rest 11 accused. The conviction and sentence of the accused are based on legal and nitid evidence of the witness. So, the judgment of order of conviction and sentence do not call for any interference from this Court and with these words he canvases for the acceptance of the reference, dismissal of the appeals and discharging of the Rules of the miscellaneous cases filed by the convicts.<br/><br/>On the other hand Mr. Md. Abdul Aziz Miah the learned Advocate appearing for the condemned prisoners Mohammad Ali and Tipu opposes the reference submitting that both the accused and the deceased belonged to same political identity. The accused did not murder the deceased as alleged by the prosecution case and though the prosecution examined 37 witnesses in this case and out of these 37 witnesses PWs 2,3,8 and 9 deposed as ocular witnesses but in fact they did not witness the occurrence. The evidence of PWs 2,3,8 and 9 are not also credible. PW 2 Md. Jahangir had no any business at Vulta at the relevant time. He is known as common witness of the locality whose presence has been introduced in this case in order to strengthen the prosecution story and as such he is a chance witness of this case. He also submits that though PWs 3 and 8 appears to be accompanying member of deceased and though it was claimed that at the relevant time they were at Sunny confectionary but for two reasons they did not witness the occurrence. It is in the evidence of PW 13, the proprietor of Sunny confectionary that when they had heard the sound of firing they lied on the floor, so there was no scope on the part of PWs 3 and 8 to witness the occurrence of firing and the other gesture and posture of the rest accused and secondly there was no sufficient light in the place of occurrence. So, in the absence of any acceptable means of recognition, the evidence of PWs 3 and 8 regarding the identification of the accused is not compatible with the facts and circumstances of the case. He also submits that PW 9 is a political friend of the deceased who had no occasion to witness the occurrence. He had deposed for his friend only. But the Tribunal without considering this aspect of the case wrongly found the condemned prisoners Mohammad Ali and Tipu guilty under section 302/34 of the Penal Code and awarded the death sentence. So, the death sentence of condemned prisoners Mohammad Ali Tipu is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>Mrs. Hasna Begum, the learned Advocate appearing for the condemned prisoners Abul Bashar alias Badsha, Akter Hossain alias Akter, Abdur Rab alias Rouf, Aslam Bhuiyan and Shaheen in Jail Appeals being nos. 1049 of 2006, 1048 of 2006 and 110 of 2007 opposes the death reference and supporting the jail appeals filed by those five condemned prisoners reiterated the argument advanced by the stated defence lawyer Mr. Abdul Aziz Miah. She also submits that though the Tribunal awarded death sentence upon those 3 accused and imprisonment for life upon rest of 2 accused but there was no legal and unblemished evidence on record to find them guilty. She categorically submits that though there was a long list of witnesses in the case but as per prosecution case PWs 2,3,8 and 9 are the only eye witnesses in this case. But their evidence is not believable and credible at all. PW 2 is a chance, partisan and a common witness of the criminal cases of that locality. She also submits that there was no sufficient light to identify the accused, so, PWs 3 and 8 were not in a position to witness the assailant and other accused. So the Tribunal very erroneously relied on the incredible evidence of PWs 2,3,8 and 9 and thereby came to a wrong conclusion finding the condemned prisoners and others guilty under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code. Thus she conjures to reject the reference and to allow the jail appeals filed by those 5 convicts.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Baharuddin-Al-Razi, the learned Advocate appearing for the condemned prisoner Jewel reiterating the arguments advanced by the learned Advocate Md. Abdul Aziz Miah and Mrs. Hasna Begum submits that the conviction and sentence of condemned prisoner Jewel is based mainly on the evidence of so-called eye witnesses of PW 2,3,8 and 9. But PW 2 is a chance witness in any view of the matter. PWs 3 and 4 though claimed to have been in the Sunny confectionary at the relevant time but in view of their own evidence they did not get any chance to witness the occurrence as well as the assailant and the other accused and PW 9 was also a partisan witness of the prosecution. Thus he conjures to acquit Jewel from the charge levelled against him.<br/><br/>Mr. Syed Mizanur Rahman, the learned Advocate appearing for the condemned prisoner Abul Bashar alias Badsha in Criminal Appeal no. 5422 of 2006 submits that deceased Md. Shafiqul Islam might have been murdered on the date of occurrence at Vulta but accused Abul Bashar alias Badsha is not involved with the occurrence of this case. He categorically submits that the prosecution had knitted the prosecution story leaving the facts of the case. PW 2 is a common witness of the locality and he is not a man of clean image and he was convicted in a criminal case and he has become an expert witness to face the lawyers in the Court. As such, he was examined in this case as an important witness. He also submits that the there was a police out post adjacent to the said place of occurrence at Vulta but none of the member of police was informed about the occurrence and the presence of police in the scene of the occurrence is almost nil though there appears the presence of many witnesses which is very unusual and unbelievable. He submits that PWs 3 and 8 cannot be trusted at all as they are the close relations of the deceased. The prosecution could not prove the means of recognition of this case by any cogent and reliable evidence thereby arrived at a wrong decision finding accused Abul Bashar alias Badsha guilty. He also submits that though there appears a recovery of mobile set by witness Kaiyum allegedly belonged to accused Abul Bashar alias Badsha but the fact of recovery did not find place in the FIR. So the recovery of mobile set is nothing but a myth which has been introduced to include the accused with the case. He further submits that though PW 9 claimed to have seen the occurrence as eye witness but at the time of occurrence he was near the baby taxi stand at Vulta which is far away from the place of occurrence. So he had no occasion to witness any accused of this case. But the trial Tribunal wrongly relied on the evidence of PW 9 also. He further submits that the fire arms allegedly used in the occurrence of this case was allegedly recovered at the instance of this accused and though the said arms was examined by the ballistic expert but there is nothing in the said report to connect the said fire arms with the occurrence of this case. Some pillets were also recovered from the place of occurrence and from the dead body of the deceased but there is no any such proof that the pillets correspond the fire arms. So, there was no scope to say that said recovered arms was used in the murder of the deceased. Thus the learned Advocate prays for rejection of the reference and to allow the criminal appeal filed by this condemned prisoner.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Fazlul Haque Khan Farid, the learned Advocate appearing for condemned prisoner Akter Hossain son of Alim Uddin, convicts Abdur Rob alias Rouf and Aslam Bhuiyan in Criminal Appeal no. 5323 of 2006 submits that the investigation of this case was started on the basis of a GD entry but during the investigation and trial, the FIR lodged by PW 1 was treated as FIR. He adds that when an investigation is started upon a GD entry that DG entry is the FIR and the subsequent FIR lodged by PW 1 is nothing but a statement under section 161 of the Code. But this principle of law has been seriously ignored. He also submits that the FIR was lodged after 22.15 hours of the occurrence with an intention to include the accused who were not in the scene at all. Prosecution could not examine a single independent and disinterested witness in this case. He categorically submits that PWs 2,3,8 and 9 claimed to have seen the occurrence from a close vision but none of them are independent and disinterested witness. So, it is natural and probable that they will give obliging evidence in the Court favouring the prosecution but these realities have not been appreciated by the trial Tribunal. If the evidence of PWs 2,3,8 and 9 are left out from consideration there appears no evidence against any of the accused of this case.  PW 13,  the Proprietor of Sunny alias Babul confectionary is a competent as well as independent and disinterested witness and at the time of occurrence he was present in his confectionary. He simply deposed that he heard the sound of firing but he did not witness the occurrence and if it is so, the PWs 3 and 8 who were in his shop also did not witness the occurrence but the total prosecution case is based on the evidence of PWs 3 and 8. The trial Tribunal relying on the evidence of PWs 3 and 8 found the accused guilty and awarded highest sentence to them. Thus he conjures to reject the reference and to allow the criminal appeal filed by these 3 appellants.<br/><br/>Mr. Sheikh Mohammad Rezaul Islam, the learned Advocate appearing for the convict appellants Ayiub Hossain, Syed Hossain and Mukul alias Mokbul Hossain in Criminal Appeal no. 5316 of 2006 and also for convict petitioner Kamal and Zahirul Islam in Criminal Miscellaneous Case no. 5789 of 2008 opposing the judgment submits that the informant lodged the FIR after almost 22 hours of the occurrence implicating the accused with the case but the prosecution could not prove the charge relying on the cogent and unblemished evidence of the prosecution witnesses. The prosecution as well as the trial Tribunal relied much upon the evidence of PWs 2,3,8 and 9 but none of them were present in the place of occurrence. The presence of PW 2 Md. Jahangir in the place of occurrence did not justify from his own evidence. He also submits that Mukul alias Mokbul is not FIR named accused, had he been in the place of occurrence, his name would have been in the FIR. The so called eyewitnesses PWs 2 and 3 did not tell the name of accused Mukul alias Mokbul. He further submits that there was no sufficient light to witness the occurrence and the prosecution could not prove the means of recognition in this case. PWs 11 and 26 were not named in the charge sheet as witnesses but the prosecution examined them, so their evidence is not admissible and believable in this case. Thus he prays for the acquittal of convict appellants Ayiub Hossain, Syed Hossain and Mukul alias Mokbul while he prays for quashing the judgment and the order of conviction and sentence as against accused Kamal and Zahirul Islam.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Zafor Sadeque, the learned Advocate appearing for the convict petitioner Jalil Miah in Criminal Miscellaneous Case no. 4472 of 2007 reiterating the arguments as advanced by the learned Advocates for others adds that the petitioner Jalil Miah could not face the trial and after pronouncement of the judgment he was arrested, as such, he could not prefer appeal within time, thus he preferred a criminal miscellaneous case under section 561A of the Code to quash the judgment against him. He submits that the trial Tribunal though convicted and sentenced him relying on the evidence of PW 2,3,8 and 9 but they are not independent and disinterested witnesses rather they are the partisan and relations of the deceased, as such, the trial Tribunal should have not relied on their evidence in convicting the petitioner.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Abdul Razzak, the learned Advocate appearing for the convict appellant Ayiub Hossain in Criminal Appeal no. 5316 of 2006 reiterating the arguments advanced by the other lawyers submits that the so called eyewitness PW 2 did not tell the name of accused Ayiub Hossain. PW 8 another eye witness testified that there was not light in the post where the car was parked, so the recognition of the accused is doubtful. PW 9 another eye witness though told the name of this accused before the Tribunal but at the time of statement under section 164 of the Code did not tell his name. He adds that presence of PWs 3 and 8 in the place of occurrence is doubtful. He prayed for acquittal of accused Ayiub Hossain from the charge levelled against him.<br/><br/>Now, in order to appreciate the arguments advanced by the prosecution and the learned Advocates for the convict appellants and the petitioners let the evidence adduced by the prosecution in this case be scrutinized and analyzed.<br/><br/>PW 1 Mofizuddin Bhuiyan alias Mofiz Member, the informant as well as the father of deceased is not an eyewitness of the occurrence. He stated that on 08.11.2005 when he was at Murapara bazaar, Kamal over cell phone informed him that Md. Shafiqul Islam being injured by gun shot has been admitted at Vulta general hospital, he having been there found the dead body of his son, he found Kamal, Monir, Ripon, Jahangir, Mahbub, Badsha, Kaiyum and others in the hospital, Monir and Kamal told him that at 9.30 PM accused Mohammad Ali fired pistol shot on the right ear of the deceased in front of Babul confectionary, they also told him that when Shafiq was entering into his private car accused Mohammad Ali, Jewel, Tipu, Badsha, Akter, Shaheen, Ayiub, Rouf, Aslam, Syed, Kamal, Zahirul, Jalil and 3/4 unknown miscreants had raided him and his private car, thereafter Mohammad Ali caused the pistol shot on the right ear of the deceased and the accused persons firing the blank gun shot had left the place of occurrence, they also told him that they had identified the accused in the light of the electricity. He further stated that after post mortem examination deceased was buried in his family graveyard, thereafter, he had sent the FIR to the police station through his relation Mofiz member. He proved the FIR and his signature in it, marked exhibits 1 and 1/1. He also stated that for the previous enmity the accused had murdered his son. In cross-examination of the defence he stated that the FIR was written on his dictation, the police station is half a mile away from his residence, there is a police outpost at Vulta which is 300 yards away from the Vulta general hospital, he became senseless hearing the news of the occurrence. He further stated that he is the President of Murapara Union BNP and very much active in the politics of BNP, before the occurrence of this case police seized a motor cycle used by Mohammad Ali at the instance of his deceased son, Akter Hossain is the son of local Awamileague leader, accused Badsha Mia did not belong to Juboleague rather he was a member of BNP but for his nefarious activities he has been expelled from the BNP. He denied the defence suggestion that for the inner contradiction of BNP politics his son has been murdered by his opponent group.<br/><br/>PW 2 Md.

He adds that the doctor recovered the parts of bullet from the body of the deceased which was given to him and he seized the same under a seizure list, D.B Officer Ehsan was not the supervising officer of this case, he cannot say whether seized bullets belonged to same pistol or not, witnesses Monir and Kamal are the cousins of the deceased. He denied the defence suggestion that Jahangir is a professional witness. He denied the defence suggestion that no motorcycle belonged to Mohammad Ali was seized ever rather the same plot has been created for the purpose of this case. He further stated that Vulta turning point is a populous area of the locality, he did not examine the constables of Vulta Police Outpost, the police of that outpost was not in the mobile duty at the time of occurrence, later on they were suspended, he arrested Alauddin, the President of Murapara Union Awamileague suspiciously, Alauddin is the father of accused Akter and father-in-law of accused Rouf.<br/><br/>He adds that he examined witness Jahangir on 09.11.2005 who did not state to him that immediately after occurrence he had informed the occurrence to the informant. PW 13 Md. Ashraful Islam Babul did not state to him that Shafiq had parked the car in front of his shop and also did not state that his accompanying members had taken snacks from his shop from time to time, he also did not state that the said two accompanying members of Shafiq had been roaming around the place of occurrence. PW 17 Alam did not state to him that on the date of occurrence he met with Kamal and Monir at Vulta and came to know from them that Shafiq was in the meeting of Chatrodal office and Alam also did not state to him that Shafiq told him that he will go to the house of his aunt. He denied the defence suggestion that he invented PW 26 as witness in this case to implicate Badsha with the occurrence of this case and also to serve the same purpose he invented PW 27 also, he did not ascertain the ownership of the yellow taxi cab. He denied the further defence suggestion that he in order to strengthen the prosecution case introduced the story of yellow taxi cab and mobile set. He denied the defence suggestion that the deceased was murdered by some unknown assailants but with an ill motive he has implicated the accused falsely in this case. He further stated that the FIR was lodged after 21.30 hours. He denied the defence suggestion that he did not investigate the case properly and has submitted a perfunctory charge sheet against the accused in this case.<br/><br/>These are the evidences that have been given by the prosecution in this case. From the evidence discussed above it appears that the prosecution examined 37 witnesses in all out of which PW 22 is a doctor, PWs 23 and 34 are Magistrates, PWs 33,34,35 and 37 are the police personnel and the rest 30 are the local witnesses.<br/><br/>The death of deceased Md. Shafiqul Islam on 08.11.2005 at around 9.30 PM at Vulta under Rupganj Police Station is not at all disputed in this case. The common defence case of the condemned prisoners as well as the convict appellants is that deceased Shafiqul Islam might have been murdered by some unknown assailants on 08.11.2005 at Vulta. After the death of Shafiqul Islam post mortem examination on his cadaver was held by PW 22 Dr. Md. Shahjahan Miah who found one bullet injury on the right ear where laceration was found and he also found another swelling on the left tempro occipital area where a bullet was found. In the opinion of the doctor death of the deceased was caused due to shock and hemorrhage resulting from the gun shot injury which was antemortem and homicidal in nature. PW 22 was crossed examined extensively by the defence but his such evidence has not been squeezed or discredited in any way. In cross-examination the only point raised that an injury caused by bullet must be a punctured injury but PW 22 in his reply stated that it is not a common feature that bullet injury always must be a punctured injury rather it may be a lacerated injury even. Thus we find nothing wrong in the medical evidence for which we can discard this evidence. Moreso as we have noticed it earlier that the death of the deceased for the gun shot injury which he had received on the date of occurrence is not disputed at all. Thus from the medical evidence on record we find that deceased Shafiqul Islam was done to death for the gun shot injury which he had received at the time of occurrence.<br/><br/>From the hearing of this reference, appeals and petitions if we encapsulate the arguments and submissions of the learned Advocates appearing for the condemned prisoners as well as for the appellants and the petitioners we find that they by their common submissions seek to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence mainly on seventh fold arguments.<br/><br/>Firstly, the investigation of this case was started immediately after the death of the deceased by PW 37 on the basis of a G.D entry. So, the subsequent FIR should have been considered as statement of the witness and the G.D entry which was recorded on 08.11.2005 should have been considered as FIR, but the trial Tribunal failed to appreciate this fact and legal position of the case.<br/><br/>Secondly, the trial Tribunal relying on the evidence of so-called eye witnesses of PWs 2,3 and 8 found the accused guilty but PW 2 is a professional as well as chance witness who had no occasion to be present in the place of occurrence at the relevant time and PWs 3 and 8 are the close relations of the deceased as well as the informant. So, it is very usual and probable that they would depose favouring the prosecution under any circumstances. So, the trial Tribunal should have not relied on the evidence of PWs 2, 3 and 8. PWs 9, 10 and 12 though allegedly inferred the occurrence of shooting and though they allegedly found some of the accused to run away from the place of occurrence and though the Tribunal had relied on their such evidences but the Tribunal failed to appreciate that PWs 9, 10 and 12 are seriously involved with the politics of BNP and the deceased and as his father, the informant Mofizuddin member are also activist of BNP. So, it is very natural and probable that PWs 9, 10 and 12 will favour the prosecution.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the recovery of mobile set from the place of occurrence and the subsequent evidence in respect of said mobile set that the set belonged to Badsha are not believable at all. The FIR was lodged after 22 hours of the occurrence but the story of the said recovery did not find place in the FIR. So, the Tribunal should have disbelieved the story of recovery of the mobile set.<br/><br/>Fourthly, deceased Shafiqul Islam and his father were the leaders and activists of BNP while the accused belonged to Awamileague as such the informant had implicated the accused with the occurrence of this case to address their political rivalry.<br/><br/>Fifthly, the  alleged meeting and sitting by some of the accused in the shop of PW 11 to hatch the plan of murder of Shafique and the witnessing of some of the accused by PW 7 at Vulta immediate before the occurrence is nothing but a myth and the same has been introduced in order to strengthen the prosecution case.<br/><br/>Sixthly, there was no light in the place of occurrence, so the recognition of the accused by the witness in the night of occurrence is not believable and in the absence of means of recognition conviction and sentence is not maintainable.<br/><br/>Seventhly and lastly, if it is conceded for a moment that condemned prisoner Mohammad Ali fired the gun sot on the ear of deceased Shafiq causing his death in that case also for the mere presence of other accused in the place of occurrence was not sufficient to find them guilty under sections 302/34 of the Penal code as they did not participate in the occurrence of murder of the deceased and they had no any intention to kill the deceased. So, the conviction and sentence of co-accused other than Mohammad Ali is bad and illegal in the eye of law.<br/><br/>Now, let us scan and explore the evidence on record and the legal aspect thereto to find out the justification of the above arguments.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the appellants referring the decision of the case of Muslemuddin and others-Vs-The state, 38 DLR(AD) 311 argued that from the evidence of PW 37 it transpires that the investigation was started on the basis is of G.D no. 370 dated 08.11.2005. So, the said G.D should have been treated as FIR and subsequent to that G.D, any information to the police station should have been considered as statement under section 161 of the Code. It is fact that in the reported case it was held that any information at the earliest opportunity to the Police Station in respect of commission of cognizable offence is the FIR within the meaning of section 154 of the Code and all other subsequent information will come within the provision of section 161 of the Code. With all regards to the reported case we find that in the reported case, the information was given to the Police Station in respect of commission of murder of that particular case by somebody else, but the case in our hands goes to show that the G.D was recorded on the basis of a radio message and no body else informed the police station about the commission of murder of Shafiqul Islam. So, it is difficult to find similarity between the reported case and the case in our hands in respect of recording of the G.D entry. Moreso, an FIR is recorded in accordance with the provision of section 154 of the Code, as such naturally before treating an information as FIR, it is to be seen whether it fulfills the requirements of section 154 of the Code. In view of language used in this section, any vague or indefinite or incomplete information, even if it relates to a cognizable offence, cannot be an information to be treated as an FIR. In the case of Bachchu Sarder and others-Vs-The State reported in 11 BLT (AD) 53 the same argument was placed before the Appellate Division. From the case of 11 BLT we find that PW 2 who was a widow of one of the victim deposed that during the incident when the accused persons were assaulting her husband she had rushed to the Police Station and informed the Inspector and thereupon a G.D entry was recorded. PW 1 who was the mother of the victim deposed that soon after the incident she had rushed to the local Police Station and on the way she found the police officer coming towards the place of occurrence and on that spot, the Officer-in-Charge recorded the FIR on her statement. The Sessions Judge as well as the High Court Division noticed the aforesaid circumstances in which the G.D was made and the FIR was recorded. Leave was sought on the ground that the trial Court acted illegally in not considering the G.D as FIR. But the Appellate Division turned down the plea of the petitioner. Thus we find from the decision of 11 BLT (AD) 53 that any information or a G.D entry which is the first in point of time may not necessarily be treated as FIR.<br/><br/>In the reported case of Moni Mohan Ghose-Vs- The King Emperor 35 CWN 623 the Court considered the third information as FIR in view of the facts and circumstances of that case, in that case, the first FIR was found to be vague and the police found the second information as not true and the third information for the first time indicated the commission of cognizable offence, as such the third information was treated as FIR. So, vague and indefinite information even if it relates to a cognizable offence cannot be treated as FIR. In the instant case the G.D was recorded mainly hearing the news of death of Shafiqul Islam over a radio message. The information was not complete and full in respect of the commission of the murder of the deceased. So, such a superficial G.D entry can not be treated as FIR.<br/><br/>Moreso, if an information which is first in point of time is always considered as FIR, the consequence may frustrate the purpose of real justice. Sometimes it happens that those who actually commit the offence, to save themselves lodge misleading information narrating a concocted story. In this connection the case reported in 6 MLR (AD) 170 may be cited here. In this case it was found that the accused persons mislead the father of the victim stating that his daughter committed suicide by taking poison and accordingly the father lodged the FIR stating that his daughter died by taking poison. On the basis of this FIR when the Investigating Officer started investigation, found marks of injury on the dead body and sent the dead body for autopsy and after receiving the postmortem report second FIR was lodged by the police. In these circumstances, it was held that the second FIR was not barred and the second FIR was neither treated as a statement under section 161 of the Code nor it was considered inadmissible under section 162 of the Code.<br/><br/>In this connection, the case of State-Vs- Zillul Bari and others reported in 57 DLR(AD) 129 may also be cited here. In this case, one Chapa was found dead in her bed room. The accused who are inmates and close relations of Chapa lodged FIR stating that Chapa was murdered by some unknown miscreants by an iron rod from outside the window in order to take away her ornaments. Police started investigation and found that  the FIR story was not true and found evidence that some inmates of those of the house had murdered Chapa. The police lodged another FIR and on the basis of this FIR, charge sheet was submitted and trial was held.<br/> <br/>So, we find that it cannot be a universal dogma that the information in respect of commission of a cognizable offence first in point of time to the Police Station is always must be an FIR and if it is taken as a matter of fact it will be risky and suicidal for the administration of criminal justice. Thus we find that the FIR lodged by PW 1, the father of deceased knowing the fact from the witnesses who were present in the scene of the occurrence was rightly treated as FIR by the Court below.<br/><br/>The learned counsel for the appellants argued in respect of credibility of the evidence of PWs 2,3 and 8 that PW 2 Jahangir is a professional, common as well as chance witness while PWs 3 and 8 are the close relations of the victim as well as the informant. So, the Tribunal should have not relied on their evidence. It is fact that PWs 2, 3 and 8 are the star witnesses of this case as the occurrence of murder of deceased Shafiqul Islam was witnessed by these 3 witnesses from a close vision. It was canvassed seriously before us  that PW 2 was accused in many criminal cases and as such he has become a very sharp and cunning witness and to take the advantage of his such skill knowledge of legal arena, the prosecution has introduced his presence in the scene of the occurrence with a plan to examine him as an eye witness. It is also submitted before us that he is a common witness of the cases of that locality. But we find that the defence could not bring a scrap of paper to show that he had deposed in any case as canvassed by them. So, their such submission that PW 2 is a common and chance witness of the case of that locality has no merit to stand. It is fact that PW 2 was the accused of a criminal case and he was also convicted in that case but subsequently he has been acquitted from that case. But that cannot be a ground to discard the evidence of a witness if otherwise his evidence is found to be true and genuine.<br/><br/>Admittedly, PWs 3 and 8 are the cousins of the deceased Shafiqul Islam. It is in the FIR that Shafiqul Islam had gone at Vulta along with these 2 witnesses and when he had attended in the meeting at Awal market PWs 3 and 8 were roaming in front of Sunny confectionary centering the said confectionary. The FIR was lodged after almost 22 hours of the occurrence. The defence also assails the lodging of the FIR with such a delay alleging that the FIR was lodged after 22 hours intentionally so that a concocted and got up story can be built up through the FIR. The FIR itself has an explanation as to the delay in lodging the same. In the FIR it has been adverted that since some time has been killed to complete the burial function of the deceased, the delay took place in lodging the FIR. It is in the evidence of PW 1 that the burial function of his son was completed after the Asar prayer and the FIR was lodged at 7.45 PM on the following day on 09.11.2005. The learned counsel for the defence referred the case of Shamsul Haque-Vs-The State reported in 6 BCR 65 wherein it was observed that the FIR was lodged after 10 hours which could have been lodged within the 3-4 hours at the best. But PW 1 in his cross-examination stated in the following manner:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"ঘটনার কথা শুনিয়া অজ্ঞান হইয়া যাইz অজ্ঞান হওয়ার কথা আমি এজাহা­র লিখি নাই. আমি কাদ­ত কাদ­ত অজ্ঞান হইয়া পড়ি"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>By the occurrence of this case PW 1 had lost his only son who happened to be an educated and at the same time a business man and he was involved with the local politics of BNP. From the whole record we find no aspersion or bad remarks on the character of the deceased. So, when any father losses his only beloved son like the deceased, it is very much natural and probable that he will be shocked and perplexed as it could be. So, it cannot be the top most priority of filing an FIR than that of the burial function of the deceased by a father. Moreso, immediate after occurrence PW 1 became also sick for the shock which he received due to the murder of his only son. So, in this particular case though the FIR was lodged after almost 22 hours but that cannot be considered as an inordinate delay in the above facts and circumstances of the case and it cannot be considered that delay was taken intentionally in order to concoct the prosecution case. In such a natural, probable and unblemished FIR, the presence and the role of PWs 2,3 and 8 has been manifested clearly and their presence in the scene of the occurrence have been supported by the other witnesses. PWs 9, 10 and 12 though were involved with the politics of BNP but were not any nearest relations or close to the deceased, they testified that immediately after occurrence they found witness Janangir, Kamal and Monir in the place of occurrence who were trying to shift the victim to the hospital. PW 13, the proprietor of Babul alias Sunny Confectionary had confirmed the presence of PWs 3 and 8 at the time of occurrence. The defence did not hesitate to characterize PW 13 as a disinterested and independent witness. So, his evidence in respect of presence of PWs 3 and 8 in the place of occurrence is very much significant in this case.<br/><br/>PWs 9, 10 and 12 appears to be most natural and probable witnesses in this case. They were in the meeting of chatradal with the deceased and after closing of the meeting while they were waiting in the baby stand, a nearby spot of the place of occurrence for going to their own destination heard the sound of firing and coming to the place of occurrence found blood stained Shafiqul and witnesses Monir, Kama and Jahangir. PWs 9, 10 and 12 were cross examined extensively by the defence but their evidences has not been squeezed and discredited in any way. We find no minimum reason for which we can discard the evidence of these 3 witnesses in respect of witnessing Jahangir, Monir and Kamal in the place of occurrence immediately after occurrence.<br/><br/>Moreso, PW 32 Alhaj Md. Hasan Ali testified that he being informed of the occurrence at 10.15 PM of the night of occurrence over telephonic call by Ripon having been at Vulta general hospital found witness Jahangir from whom he heard the whole occurrence. PW 32 appears to be an aged man of 60 years who is a retired Vice President of Dhaka Bank though involved with the politics of BNP but at the same time he is not relation of the deceased. In this case it is to be noticed here that the materials on record show that the deceased was involved with the politics of BNP, but at the same time accused Mohammad Ali and his other most of the accomplice were also involved with the BNP politics. So, it is not expected that PWs 9,10,12 and 32 for the cause of politics only will depose favouring the prosecution. Since the deceased and most of the accused were involved with the same politics, so there should not be any aspersion and blame on their evidence that for the cause of politics they had deposed falsely favouring the prosecution. So, from the evidence on record we find that the presence of witnesses PW 2 Jahangir, PW 3 Monir and PW 8 Kamal in the place of occurrence at the time of occurrence has been proved by the cogent, reliable and credible evidence of other witnesses.<br/><br/>It is fact that the evidence of relative and partisan witnesses are to be scrutinized and considered carefully. But the witnesses are related with the deceased or the informant that should not be the only criteria to reject their evidence out rightly. In the case of 1981 BLD (AD) 200 it was held by the Appellate Division that relationship of the witness with the informant or the victim by itself cannot be a ground for rejecting his testimony unless it is shown that the witness was biased and restored to false hood. So, it can safely be said that the relationship of the witnesses with the deceased or informant should not to be the only criteria for rejection of their evidences unless there appears any biasness and falsity in their testimony rather we are to consider whether they gave any false and emotional evidence in the Court.<br/><br/>In the case of Majibur Rahman Vs. State 39 DLR 437, it was held that a close relative, who is a very natural witness cannot be branded as interested witness. The word "interested" postulates that witness must have some direct interest in having the accused somehow or otherwise convicted for some animus or for other reasons. Interested witness is not necessarily false witness though in fact that witness has personal interest in the matter. Evidence of such witness should be scrutinized on its merit, before investigating whether he is an interested one and such scrutiny of evidence is required as rule of prudence and not as rule of law (para 6 of the judgment).<br/><br/><strong>In the case of </strong>Abu Taher Chowdhury Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 253, the Appellate Division held in the following ways:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“It is settled law that a conviction may be based only on the sole testimony of a single witness, if believed, and mere interestedness is no ground to reject the testimony of a witness, if otherwise the testimony is free from doubt".  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The gist of the decision of the above referred case is that if the testimony of an interested witness is free from doubt that can be considered as sufficient to find the accused guilty.<br/><br/>In the case of Samad Sikder Vs. State 50 DLR (AD) 24, the Appellate Division observed in the following ways:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The learned Judges ought not to have rejected the evidence of these two witnesses merely on the ground that they were not disinterested witnesses when their examination-in-chief could not be shaken in cross-examination by the defence”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Yogeshwar Gope Vs. State 58 DLR (AD) 73, it was held by the Appellate Division that only because of relationship their evidence cannot be thrown away unless the evidence is found to be  untrue or tainted with motive.<br/><br/>In the case of Abdul Hye Sikder Vs. State, 43 DLR (AD) 95=12 BLD (AD) 180, it is held in the following ways:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"The conviction of the appellants can safely be based on the solitary evidence of the eye witness, PW1.............His evidence is full, complete and self contained. It may not have received corroboration from other witnesses, but it stands fully corroborated by the circumstances of the case and the medical evidence on record. If this evidence is believed, and it has been rightly believed by both the Trial Court and the High Court Division, its fullness and completeness are enough to justify the conviction" (para 13 and 15 of the judgment).  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Abdul Quddus Vs. State, 43 DLR 234 the Appellate Division held in the following ways:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"We have indicated earlier that she (PW2) is the most natural, probable and competent witness in the present case as she was reading in the same room with her deceased sister Dilara and saw the entire occurrence. She has given details of the entire occurrence and even in her cross-examination the defence could not show any material discrepancy for which her ocular testimony should be disbelieved. She having deposed the entire incident from the beginning to the end it is very difficult for us to discard her evidence only on the ground that she was an interested witness and was a minor girl aged about 16 years. Even the law provides that a child witness can be relied if he/she is capable of understanding and replying the questions intelligently" (para 14 of the judgment).     </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The preponderant views emerged from the above reported cases are that mere relationship of the witnesses with the deceased or informant cannot be the only ground to discard the  evidence of such witnesses if they are not found biased in deposing the Court. In this particular case as we have noticed it earlier that the ocular witness PW 2 is not a relation of the deceased though he is a man of informant’s camp for the same politics of BNP and though PWs 3 and 8 are the cousins of the deceased, but in the facts and circumstances of the case it led us to hold that they are the most natural, probable and competent witnesses of the occurrence as the situation, the time of occurrence and the place of occurrence provides their presence in the place of occurrence and there appears no biasness, emotion and falsity in their evidence.<br/><br/>So, we find that mere relationship of the witnesses with the deceased either for the cause of politics or blood relationship is not the only ground to discard their evidence, if their evidence appears to be true and corroborated by the other witnesses in the record and that can be considered as sufficient and cogent to find the accused guilty.<br/><br/>PWs 2, 3 and 8 from a close vision found accused Mohammad Ali to cause gun shot on the right ear of deceased and also found his other accomplice to raid the deceased and his car so that the deceased cannot be escaped in any way from the hands of Mohammad Ali. The evidence of these 3 eyewitnesses cannot be disbelieved and discarded on any ground.<br/><br/>The learned counsel for the appellants submit that the recovery of a mobile set by PW 10 Abdul Quiyum from the place of occurrence immediately after occurrence has been introduced by the prosecution to include accused Badsha with the occurrence of this case, but there appears no cogent and reliable evidence on record to show that the mobile set belonged to accused Badsha. PW 10 testified that when he was going to Vulta general hospital from the place of occurrence he found a mobile set on earth. The mobile set has been seized by PW 37 under a seizure list, exhibit-20 having its SIM no. 0188017309. PW 26 Mrs. Akhi Noor was examined in this case to prove that the SIM no. 0188017309 belonged to Badsaha. PW 26 testified that she had gone to the house of her sister at Baniadi village where she had a occasion of intraction with one Jahir and accused Badsaha and at one stage they had exchanged their mobile numbers but in our consideration the exchange of mobile numbers between Aki Noor, a young women of 22 years with Badsha is improbable and unbelievable in the social context of our country and save and except this evidence of PW 26 we find no other materials on record to connect the said mobile set and number with accused Badsha.<br/><br/>The learned counsel for the appellants also argued that deceased Shafiqul Islam and his father PW 1 were seriously involved  with  the  politics of BNP while the accused belonged to Awamileague, so due to political rivalry the accused were implicated in this case without any basis. But the materials on record did not support the contention of the learned counsel of the appellants. PW 1 testified that he is an activist of BNP and at present he is the president of Murapara union BNP, he also stated that accused Akter Hossain is the son of an Awamileague worker and accused Badsha Mia was a BNP worker but for his nefarious activities he has been expelled from the party, accused Ayiub Hossain is a member of Jatiotabadi Jubodal, accused Syed Hossaina and his father are involved with the politics of BNP, PW 21 himself is the Secretary of Murapara Union Jubodal testified that accused Mohammad Ali was the President of Murapara Union Jubodal and after the murder of Shafiqul Islam he was expelled from his such position. So, we find that save and except accused Akter, son of Alimuddin most of the accused including accused Mohammad Ali under whose leadership the occurrence of murder took place were involved with the politics of BNP. However, from the above discussion also from the materials on record we find that there is nothing in the record to show that for the political rivalry the accused were implicated in this case.       <br/>The learned counsel for the appellants argued that the episode of the meeting by the accused in the shop of PW 11 and also witnessing of the accused prior to the occurrence at Vulta by PW  7  and also witnessing to cross  the  Kanchon  ferry by PW 4 immediately after occurrence is highly improbable and a cock and bull story which have been invented in order to strengthen the prosecution case. PW 11 Md. Jahirul Islam testified that on 05.11.2005 at 12.30 PM accused Badsha, Jewel, Tipu, Kamal, Akter, Shahin, Mokter and Jahirul had been discussing that for the resistance of Shafiq they could not do anything as such at any cost Shafiq should be finished but he did not disclose this fact to anybody else for fear of the accused. The evidence of PW 11 appears to be very  much appetizing that some of the accused had been at a meeting in his shop in his presence where they had taken a decision to murder the deceased. But this type of meeting and sitting regarding the commission of a heinous crime in presence of a witness who did not belong to them is highly improbable and unbelievable.<br/><br/>PW 7 Md. Shakawat Hossain Kamal testified that on 08.11.2005 at 8.00 PM of the night when he came at Vulta bus stand found accused Syed Kamal, Jahirul Islam, Ayuib, Rouf, SDU and Mokbul to gossip among themselves and in the same night at 9.45 PM he came to know about the murder of the deceased and he having been at Vulta general hospital found the dead body of Shafiq. He also categorically stated that he stated this occurrence to PW 1. From the materials on record we find that this particular prosecution story that PW 7 found the accused near the place of occurrence immediately before the occurrence did not find place in the FIR. So, we are unable to accept the evidence of PW 7 that he had witnessed some of the accused immediately before occurrence as the FIR was lodged after a reasonable time of the occurrence and PW 1 being a sensible man who is involved with the politics as well as a successful businessman must not leave such an important fact at the time of lodging FIR.<br/><br/>PW 4 Md. Mofizul Islam testified that on 08.11.2005 at 10.00 PM he found accused Mohammad Ali, Badsha, Shahin, Jewel, Tipu to get down from a yellow taxi cab to cross the Kanchon ferry ghat. By this evidence of PW 4 the prosecution tried to draw a conclusion that after committing the murder of the deceased those 6 accused had left the place of occurrence by a yellow taxi cab and they had crossed the Kanchan ferry ghat. There appears no corroboration to the testimony of PW 4 that he had witnessed those accused to cross the Kanchan ferry ghat. So, we are unable to rely on the evidence of PW 4 that he had witnessed some of the accused at Kanchan ferry gnat.<br/><br/>As to the means of recognition the learned counsels for the appellants contend that the prosecution could not prove the means of recognition in this case. They categorically submits that the occurrence took place at 9.30 PM and the car of deceased was parked under a pillar where admittedly there was no light of electricity, so it was not possible on the part of the eye witnesses to witness the accused. In the case of State-Vs-Monjur 15 BLD 193 it was held that means of recognition is important in criminal case when the incident took place in the night. PW 2, an eye witness of the occurrence stated in his evidence in the following ways:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“ঘটনাসহ­ল বিদ্যুৎ ছিল পর্যাপ্ত, আমরা আসামী­দর­ক চিন­ত পে­রছি”<br/>PW 3 another eye witness stated in following ways:<br/>“সানি কন­ফকশনারী থে­ক ঘটনাসহল গাড়ীর দূরত্ব ছিল ৬/৭ গজ. ঘটনাসহ­ল ­বৈদ্যুতিক আ­লা ছিল. তিনটি  সাইন বোর্ড ছিল. বৈদ্যুতিক আ­লা­ত আসামী­দর চিন­ত পে­রছি”<br/>PW 8 another eye witnesses stated that –<br/>বৈদ্যুতিক আ­লা­ত আসামী­দর চিন­ত পারি, তৎম­র্ম সমস¹ ঘটনা বাদী নিহত শফি­কর পিতা­ক জানাই.<br/>In cross-examination he stated in the following ways:<br/>“ঘটনার সময় রাস্তায় লাইট ছিল কিনা জানা ­নই. ত­ব একটি খাম্পার লাইট ছিল. সত্য নয় যে, ঘটনার সময় ভুলতা মো­ড় কোন বাতি ছিল না”<br/>PW 13 Md. Ashraful Islam Babul, the proprietor of Sunny confectionary stated in the following ways:<br/>“গাড়িটি একটি পিলা­রর পা­শ রাখে. বৈদ্যুতিক পিলার সেটি. এই পিলারটি­ত লাইট ছিল না. অন্য পিলা­র লাইট ছিল. দোকা­নর সাইন বো­র্ডর আ­লা ছিল উক্ত সহা­ন.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The above noted 4 witnesses were also cross-examined by the defence extensively as to the means of recognition. But their evidences has not been shaken away in any way rather the evidence of PWs 2,3,8 and 13 as to the means of recognitioin is very much consistent and corroborative with each other. So, considering the consistent and credible evidence of P.Ws. 2,3,8 and 13 that they had seen the accused in the light of electricity available in the place of occurrence cannot be thrown away.<br/><br/>The Tribunal mainly relying on the evidence of PWs 2, 3 and 8 found the condemned prisoners and other appellants guilty under section 302/34 of the Penal Code. It was argued by the learned counsel of the appellants that if it is conceded for a moment that deceased Shafiqul Islam met his death for the gun shot injury caused by Mohammad Ali in that case also the other accused who were allegedly found present in the place of occurrence having no active participation in the act of the murder of the deceased should have not been found guilty under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>Now, from the arguments of the learned counsels for the appellants it appears that the main question which is involved on this point is whether condemned prisoners other than Mohammad Ali and the other appellants had shared their common intention of causing murder of the deceased Shafiq with accused Mohammad Ali. In this regard the learned Deputy Attorney General referred the case of The State-Vs-Abul Khair 44 DLR 284 where it has been held that common intention of several persons is to be inferred from their conduct, manner and doing of the act and the attending circumstances of the case.<br/><br/>From the consistent and unequivocal evidence of PWs 2,3 and 8 we find that accused Mohammad Ali, Jewel alias Jahirul Haque, Tipu, Akter Hossain son of Alimuddin and Badsha Mia and Shahin forming a group had come in the place of occurrence from the eastern side of Vulta and they encircled the deceased while accused A. Rob alias Rouf, Mobarak Hossain, Kamal, Syed Hossai, Ayuib Hossain and Aslam Bhuiya, Md. Jalil Miah and Jahirul Islam forming another group had come in the place of occurrence from the western part of Vulta who had encircled the private car of deceased Shafiqul Islam and when Shafiq was trying to enter into the car Mohammad Ali fired the gun shot on the right ear of the deceased. It is not the prosecution case that those accomplice of Mohammad Ali were present in the place of occurrence accidentally or for any other reason they had gone there forming two groups at the same time. The very arrival of those accused in the place of occurrence at the same time when Shafiq had arrived beside his car is the gorgeous prove that all the accused had a common intention of causing murder of the deceased. Those accused had no any other business in the place of occurrence other than the sharing of the intention of murder of the deceased with accused Mohammad Ali. So, their such presence with accused Mohammad Ali in the spot has established that they had the common intention to cause the murder of Shafiqul Islam. The presence of other accused with Mohammad Ali in the spot encircling the deceased and his private car in that particular time is nothing but sharing the common intention with accused Mohammad Ali in causing the murder of deceased. They had no any job at the relevant time without ensuring the murder of the deceased. The deceased and his car were encircled by the other accused in such a manner so that the deceased cannot be escaped from the men circle in any way planted by the accused. The very guarding of the deceased by the other accused is the conclusive prove that they had a common intention to cause the murder of deceased.<br/><br/>In the case of Nazimuddin and others-Vs-State 36 DLR 22 it has been held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"It is the essence of section 34 PC that the accused persons must be physically present at the place and at the time of commission of crime and the incriminating acts and circumstances must be necessary to lead the inference of common intention to commit the crime."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Rasool Box-Vs-State 22 DLR(SC) 297 it has been held by H Rahman J as his Lordship then was, that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"There is no doubt that to bring a case within the ambit of section 34 of the Penal Code it is necessary that some overt act or acts must be established to lead to the inference that the participators in a crime acted in pre-concert or under a pre-arranged plan but this does not mean that every participant in the crime must be shown, to have committed the same kind of act. It is sufficient to show that they joined together in the commission of a particular act, for then they must all be deemed to have intended the natural and inevitable consequence of that act even if some of them did nothing but merely helped by their presence the commission of the act."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Thus it is not necessary to show that any overt act must have been done by a particular accused but section 34 of the Penal Code is attracted if it is established that the criminal act has been done by all or any one of the accused persons in furtherance of a common intention. Common intention does not mean similar intention of several persons. Common intention may as well be inferred from the evidence or facts and circumstances of the case.<br/><br/>Thus the preponderant views emerged from the above noted decision is that the reason for making more than one accused guilty under the provisions of section 34 of the Penal Code as the very presence of co-accused gives encouragement, support and protection to the person actually committing an act. It may so happen that without the support of the co-accused who did nothing other than standing on the scene with the master mind offender, he would not be able to hit the victim without the support of the co-accused. In this particular case it was not possible on the part of accused Mohammad Ali alone to cause a pistol shot on the ear of deceased Shafiq without the support, encouragement and protection of his other accomplice co-accused that is why all the accused persons who remaining present in the scene of occurrence had given support, encouragement and protection to the principal accused in committing the crime of murder of Shafiq is held liable under section 34 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>PWs. 2,3 and 8 are the eye witnesses of the occurrence who very consistently stated that at the time of occurrence Mohammad Ali, Jewel alias Jahirul Haque, Tipu, Akter Hossain son of Alim Uddin, Md. Badsha Mia and Shahin coming from the eastern side of Vulta had encircled the deceased and Mohammad Ali fired pistol shot on the deceased causing him to death, they also stated that they found those accused to leave the place of occurrence immediately after occurrence. The evidence of these three ocular witnesses has not been shaken away in any way. The unequivocal and unblemished evidence of PWs 2,3, and8 has proved beyond all reasonable doubt that those 6 accused coming from the eastern side of Vulta had participated in the murder of deceased. In the same way PWs 2,3 and 8 stated that accused A. Rab alias Rouf, Kamal Miah, Syed Hossain, Jalil Miah and Jahirul Islam coming from the western side of Vulta into the place of occurrence had encircled the car of the deceased and participated in the commission of murder of the deceased. PWs 3 and 8 sated that accused Mobarak Hossain, Ayiub Hossain and Md. Aslam Bhuiyan coming from the western side had participated in the commission of murder of deceased. PW 2 though in his evidence did not state the names of above 3 accused namely Mobarak Hossain, Ayiub Hossain and Md. Aslam Bhuiyan but it is very much probable and natural that all the witnesses of a case may not see all the accused of an occurrence. Their such evidence had not been shaken away in any way though defence left no stone untouched to discredit them and their evidence. So, the trial Tribunal relying on their nitid, cogent and unshaken evidence rightly found convict Ayiub Hossain and Md. Aslam Bhuiyan guilty under sections 302/34 of the Code. Mobarak Hossain is not appellant before us, so we are refrained from making any comment as to the fugitive accused Mobarak Hossain. Though PW 2 did not tell the names of accused Ayiub Hossain and Aslam Bhuiyan but the rest 2 eye witnesses confirmed their presence with the other accused in the commission of murder of the deceased. So, the trial Tribunal rightly found them guilty relying on the evidence of PWs 3 and 8.<br/><br/>So far the convict appellants Akter Hossain alias SDU and Mukul alias Mokbul Hossain is concerned it appears that PW 8 the only eye witness who had found these two accused in the company of the other accused at the time of committing murder. The FIR was lodged by PW 1 hearing the occurrence from PWs 2, 3 and 8. It is in the evidence that all the accused and the eye witnesses belonged to the same area and they were known to each other before the occurrence of this case. Had the accused Akter Hossain alias SDU and Mukul alias Mokbul Hossain been witnessed by PW 8 at the time of occurrence that would have been revealed in the FIR. But we find that they are not FIR named accused. As such, there creates a doubt as to their presence in the place of occurrence and accordingly accused Akter Hossain alias SDU and Mukul alias Mokbul Hossain are entitled to get the benefit of doubt.<br/><br/>Accused Jalil Mia, Kamal alias Md. Kamal Hossain and Jahirul Islam alias Md. Jahirul Islam sought to quash the judgment and order of conviction and sentence invoking section 561A of the Code. But as we have found that from the evidence of PWs 2,3 and 8 the charge under sections 302/34 has been proved against them. In the case of Abdul Kader Chowdhury-Vs-The State, 28 DLR(AD) 38 it was held that where there is either no legal evidence adduced in support of the case or the evidence adduced clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge, quashing of the  proceeding would be justified. The evidence of PWs 2,3 and 8 appears to be very much legal against the petitioners and by their cogent evidence charge has been proved against the petitioners. So, we find nothing illegal in the judgment and order of conviction and sentence in respect of these 3 petitioners also. So, Rule issued against the petitioners under section 561A of the Code are liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>Having regards to the above discussions and the materials on record we find that the prosecution was successful in proving the charge under sections 302/34 of the penal Code as against convicts Mohammad Ali, Jewel alias Jahirul Haque, Tipu, Akter Hossain son of Alim Uddin, Abul Bashar alias Badsha, Shahin, and convict appellants Abdur Rab alias Rouf, Kamal Miah, Syed Hossain, Ayuib Hossain, Md. Aslam Bhuiyan, Jalil Miah and Jahirul Islam.<br/><br/>As condemned prisoners Jewel alias Jahirul Haque, Akter Hossain son of Alimuddin, Abul Bashar alias Badsha and Shahin have been languishing in the condemned cell for a quite long time with a mental agony of death by hanging along with their tender age appears to us as extenuating circumstances to commute their sentence from death to imprisonment for life. But the said extenuating circumstances is not available to those of the convicts Mohammad Ali and Tipu who are still fugitive from the justice.<br/><br/>In the result, the death reference so far as it relates to the convicts Mohammad Ali and Tipu are accepted. The judgment and the order of conviction and sentence dated 22.10.2006 so far as it relates to the convicts Mohammad Ali and Tipu are hereby confirmed and upheld. Their death sentence will be executed in terms of the judgment and also in accordance with the law whenever they will be available in the jail.<br/><br/>The reference so far as it relates to condemned prisoners Jewel alias Jahirul Haque, Akter Hossain, Abul Bashar alias Badsha and Shahin are rejected. But their conviction under section 302/34 is maintained with the modification of sentence of death. Their sentence of death is commuted to imprisonment for life with a fine of Taka 10,000/- each in default to suffer imprisonment for 1 (one) month more. The Criminal Appeal no. 6669 of 2007 and Jail Appeal no. 936 of 2007 filed by condemned prisoner Jewel alias Zahirul Haque, Criminal Appeal no. 5323 of 2006 and Jail Appeal no. 1048 of 2006 preferred by condemned prisoner Akter Hossain son of Alim Uddin, Criminal Appeal 5422 of 2006 and Jail Appeal no. 1049 of 2006 filed by condemned prisoner Abul Bashar alias Badsha and Jail Appeal No. 110 of 2007 preferred by condemned prisoner Shahin is allowed in part accordingly.<br/><br/>The conviction and sentence of the convict appellants Abdur Rab alias Rouf, Kamal alias Md. Kamal Hossain, Syed Hossain, Ayuib Hossain and Aslam Bhuiyan, Jalil Miah and Jahirul Islam passed in Dhaka Druto Bichar Tribunal Case no. 11 of 2006 on 22.10.2006 is hereby upheld and confirmed.<br/><br/>The Criminal Appeal no. 5323 of 2006 and Jail Appeal no. 1048 of 2006 preferred by convict appellants Abdur Rab alias Rouf and Aslam Bhuiyan is dismissed.<br/><br/>Criminal Appeal no. 5316 of 2006 so far as it relates to convict appellants Syed Hossain and Ayuib Hossain is dismissed and so far as it relates to appellant Mukul alias Mokbul Hossain is allowed and he is acquitted of the charge levelled against him.<br/><br/>The Rule issued in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 5789 of 2008 filed under section 561A of the Code by convict petitioners Kamal alias Md. Kamal Hossain and Jahirul Islam are discharged.<br/><br/>The Rule issued in Criminal Miscellaneous Case no. 4472 of 2007 filed under section 561A of the Code by convict petitioner Jalil Miah is also discharged.<br/><br/>The Criminal Appeal no. 5137 of 2006 preferred by convict appellant Akter Hossain alias SDU is allowed and he is acquitted of the charge levelled against him.<br/><br/>Convict appellants Akter Hossain alias SDU and Mukul alias Mokbul Hossain be discharged from their respective bail bonds.<br/><br/>Since convict appellants Abdur Rab alias Rouf, Kamal Hossain, Ayuib Hossain, Md. Aslam Bhuiyan, Jalil Miah, Jahirul Islam are in bail now they are directed to surrender their bail bonds to the trial Tribunal within 1 (one) month from the date of receipt of this judgment and order by the Tribunal failing which the Tribunal will proceed to secure their arrest and to commit them into custody in accordance with law to serve out the remaining part of the sentence.<br/><br/>Let a copy of this judgment and order be communicated to the concerned Tribunal at once for necessary action along with the lower Courts record.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

No. 94 of 2004.<br/><br/>The prosecution case, in brief, is that one Chandra Dhar (P.W.1) lodged a First Information Report, shortly, “FIR” on 15.03.2004 with Birganj police station alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that marriage was held between the informant’s daughter and the accused Jotish Chandra Ray about 2/3 years ago; that after few days from the date of their marriage accused Jotish Chandra Ray demanded Tk. 40,000/= as dowry to the informant’s daughter; that the informant disclosed his inability to pay the same as result the accused Jotish Chandra and his brother, father mother used to torture upon the daughter of the informant; that the informant considering the peace of his daughter paid Tk. 15,000/= as dowry to the accused Jotish Chandra Ray to purchase a shallow machine but the accused persons did not stop the torture; that the informant informed the matter to the local respectable persons; that on 14.03.2004 at about 3.30 A.M the accused Jotish and his uncle Kaltu came to the house of the informant and disclosed that informant’s daughter Moyna Rani committed suicide by hanging herself; that being informed the said news ;the informant along with his son and others went to the place of occurrence and found the death body of his daughter covered by a cloth; that the informant found sign of injuries on the various part of body of the victim.<br/><br/>On the basis of the aforesaid fact Birgonj Police station case No. 09 dated 15.03.2004 was lodged against the convict-appellant and (5) five others under section 11(ka)/30 of the Ain, 2000 corresponding to G.R. No. 94 of 2004.<br/><br/>The Investigating Officer took up the case for investigation; he visited the place of occurrence and prepared the Inquest Report of the dead body in the presence of respective witnesses. He duly sent the body of the deceased to the Forensic Medicine Department of Dinajpur Medical College Hospital for post mortem. Post mortem examination of the victim was performed by one Dr. Rafiqul Islam.<br/><br/>Ultimately, on conclusion of investigation the Investigating Officer, submitted charge-sheet against the accused Jotish along with two accused Pakhi Rani and Upananda under section 11(ka)/30 of the Ain, 2000 while final report submitted in the name of accused Bhamar, Fatik and Indra Mohan.<br/><br/>Later, the case was duly sent to the concerned Tribunal for trial. Learned Judge of the Tribunal on taking cognizance of the offence against all of the accused under section 11(ka)/30 of the Ain, 2000 framed charge against them under the said provision of law. On being read over and explained the charge to the accused they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>During the course of trial the prosecution produced as many as 13 witnesses including the Medical Officer and the Investigating Officer. However, the defense did not adduce any defense witness. The Tribunal after considering the evidence and materials on record found the accused Jatish guilty under section 11(Ka) of the Ain, 2000 and sentenced him to death and acquitted of the charge Pakhi Rani, Upananda, Bhamar, Fatik and Indra Mohan by its judgment and order dated 18.03.2008.<br/><br/>Death sentence matter has been referred to this Court by way of a Reference by Tribunal and the Reference has been noted as Death Reference No. 32 of 2008. Convict Jotish however, presented a petition of Appeal from jail which has been numbered as Jail Appeal No. 361 of 2008. He also carried a petition of Appeal being registered as Criminal Appeal No. 1741 of 2008.<br/><br/>Death Reference, Jail Appeal and Criminal Appeal are heard together and are disposed of by this common judgment.<br/><br/>Mr. Bishmadev Chakrabortty, the learned Deputy Attorney General with Mr. Nizamul Haque Nizam, the learned Assistant Attorney General appeared in support of the Reference. While Mr. Khairul Alam, the learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the condemned prisoner. Mrs. Shirin Afroz (Shelley), learned Advocate appeared in support of Jail Appeal.<br/><br/>Mr. Bishmadev Chakrabortty, the learned DAG, submits that the prosecution had successfully established its case beyond any reasonable doubt and that the ingredients of the aforesaid special provision of law having been attracted the Tribunal duly found that the condemned-prisoner had committed the offence as alleged. He also submits that there is no reason to disbelieve the witnesses nor the defence could shake the credibility of the witnesses. The story of the case clearly and exclusively suggests the involvement of the convict Jotish with the offence, that is, the accused has tainted his relationship with the victim over demand of dowry which the father of the victim was unable to pay. In this regard learned DAG contends that the victim was an  innocent village house wife who did not have any enmity with anyone so that and the defence has also failed to produce any evidence on that count. The alleged occurrence also took place after 2/3 years of the marriage as meted out by the accused. Learned DAG in this regard insisted that a close reading of the statements of the P. Ws will also suggest that the accused is solely responsible for the murder of the victim. He finally submits that the Tribunal committed no error of law or facts in passing the judgment of conviction and sentence against the convict and, therefore there is no justifiable reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order passed by the Tribunal.<br/><br/>Convict Jotish is defended by Mr. Khairul Alam learned Advocate who took us through the FIR, and the entire evidence on records including the materials exhibit and submitted that the Tribunal fell into error of law in finding the accused guilty of the charges so levelled against him, for the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. He further submits that allegation of killing the victim Moyna is not believable and the victim Moyna had committed suicide by hanging herself and that the accused has been implicated by the informant out of suspicion. Considering the same the Tribunal came to its findings merely upon conjectures and surmises, not upon legal evidence on records. The tainted relationship sought to be proved as a motive of the offence has not been proved by cogent and credible evidence. He further submits with emphasis that the sentence of death passed upon the accused is extremely harsh and too severe. Death sentence, he added, should not be passed as of routine and that this is not a case in which sentence of death is warranted.<br/><br/>The informant Chakradhar was examined as P. W.1 who identified the FIR and his signature as endorsed therein was marked as exhibits 1 and 1/1 respectively. The said witness specifically stated in his deposition that the informant gave his daughter into marriage with accused Jatish about 2/3 years ago; that after a few days of their marriage the accused Jotish demanded Tk. 40,000/= as dowry from the informant’s daughter and began to torture the victim. However, the informant could not fulfill this unlawful demand; but considering the peace of his daughter he paid Tk. 15,000/= as dowry to the accused. But the accused continued to torture her. The informant to the brought this the notice of the local elite that on 14.03.2004 at about 3.30 A.M the accused and his uncle Kaltu came to the house of the informant and informed that Moyna had committed suicide by hanging herself that on receiving the news the informant along with his son and others rushed to the house of the accused and saw the dead body of his daughter covered with a cloth.  That the informant also found injuries on her person.<br/><br/>P.W. 2 Amal, brother of the victim, in his examination-in-chief stated that the victim Moyna was given into marriage with accused Jatish. She gave birth to one child. The accused used to demand Tk. 40,000 as dowry from his father-in-law and wife and tortured her.

The accused told him that his sister Moyna had committed suicide.<br/><br/>P.W. 5. Shib Proshad deposed that after marriage, Jatish and Moyna started consugal life and from the beginning the accused used to assault her for dowry. On 14.03.2004 he came to know that Moyna had died and he went to the house of the accused and saw the dead body of Moyna. He also saw the injuries on her body.

Dilip, deposed that he went to house of accused Jatish and saw the dead body of Moyna.<br/><br/>P.W. 12. Dr. Rafiqul Islam deposed that he was the Medical Officer at Dinajpur Medical College Hospital and Dr. Jalal Uddin performed the post mortem on 16.03.2004. His hand writing and signature was known to Dr. Rafiqul Islam (PW.12). Dr. Jalal Uddin also found the following injuries:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>1. Blood coming from right ear.<br/>2. Swelling on right cheek.<br/>3. A thin mark from left ear to right side of neck.<br/>4. Blood coming from vagina.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Death, in his opinion, was caused due to haemorrhage, shock and asphyxia which was antimortem and homicidal in nature.<br/><br/>P.W.13. Sayeed, Sub-Inspector of Police in his examination-in-chief stated that on 15.03.2004 he was performing his duty at Birgonj Police Station. On the basis of verbal allegation of the informant the Officer-in- Charge recorded the FIR with Birgonj Police Station against Jatish alleging that he had killed his daughter Moyna for dowry. Earlier unnatural Death Case No. 08 dated 15.03.2004 was started. Offcer-in-Charge, handed over the case to him for investigation. He prepared inquest report of dead body of Moyna. He took up the case for investigation. During investigation of the said unnatural Death Case and on the basis of said FIR he visited the place of occurrence, examined witness, prepared sketch map and index. He proved the sketch map and index and his signatures thereon so endorsed was marked as exhibits 3, 3/1, 4 and 4/1 respectively. He further deposed that he had arrested the accused and seized a rope as alamat.<br/><br/>All the prosecution witnesses were cross-examined by the defence but nothing acceptable or tangible could be made out by the defence in support of his claimed innocence. P.Ws. 2 and 3 brother and mother of  deceased were not examined by the police. Accordingly, their statements are not considerable. P.W. 12 is a Doctor who proved Post Mortem Report and gave evidence that deceased Sreemoti Moyna Rani died due to haemorrhage, shock and asphyxia which was antemortem and homicidal in nature. P.W. 13 who is the Investigating Officer gave evidence and proved inquest report of the dead body of Moyna, sketch Map, index, and seizure list.<br/>In the case there is no ocular evidence witnessing the commission of crime by convict-appellant. Prosecution relied upon circumstantial evidence in proof of its case. It is always to be remembered that there is no law that commission of a crime must by witnessed by witnesses and they are to stand in witness box to prove the crime. Commission of crime can be also, well proved by circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is more cogent and convincing than the ocular evidence. It is correctly said that witnesses may tell a lie and it is not difficult to procure false, tutored and biased witness but it was very much difficult to procure circumstantial evidence.<br/>Prosecution in proof of guilt of offence relied upon the following circumstances:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>First Circumstance:</u> Deceased and convict-appellant were admittedly husband and wife and they lived in the same house at the time of commission of offence. Ordinarily an accused has no obligation to account for the death for which he is placed on trial but in a wife murder case position of law is altogether different. The murder having taken place while the convict-appellant was living with the deceased wife Moyna in the same house, the convict-appellant had an obligation to explain how his wife met with death. The plea adopted from the side of husband convict-appellant stood proved to be false. From the above, the legitimate conclusion that inevitably flows is that it is the husband convict-appellant who had killed his wife deceased Moyna.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>Second Circumstance:</u> Medical evidence: Dr. Jalal found injuries on her right ear, swelling on right cheek, a thin mark from left ear to right side of neck and blood amitting of her vagina. Dr. Jalal recorded opinion that the victim died due to haemorrhage, shock and asphyxia which was antemortem and homicidal in nature.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>Third Circumstance:</u> Convict-appellant did not even lodge any information to the police station about the unnatural death of his wife; deceased Moyna by way of commission of suicide nor did he take any medical help for saving the life of the deceased and this conduct speaks volumes against him and is an inference of guilt on the part of convict-appellant.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>Fourth Circumstance:</u>  False plea adopted by convict-appellant: Strategy adopted by convict-appellant was the deceased  Moyna committed suicide by hanging        herself. This plea totally nullified by medical evidence of Dr. PW.12. This false plea added an additional link to complete the chain of circumstance.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Circumstances noted above do not at all suggest innocence of convict-appellant rather formidably suggest his involvement in the murder of his wife deceased Moyna and all the circumstances unerringly point to the guilt of convict-appellant.<br/><br/>This brings us to a legal aspect of the matter. Convict-appellant stood charged and convicted for offence of section 11(ka) of the Ain of 2000. Section 11(Ka) enjoins that if the husband of a woman or the father, mother, guardian, relations or any other person on behalf of the husband for dowry causes death to a woman or ventures to cause death or causes hurt or have a try to cause hurt that  husband, father, mother, guardian, relation or the person (a) shall stand sentenced to death for causing death or shall stand sentenced to imprisonment for life for mounting endeavor to cause death and in both the counts he shall be, also, liable to pay fine, and (b) shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life for causing hurt, or be sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a period not more than fourteen (14) years and less than five (5) years for striving to cause hurt and in both counts shall be liable to fine.<br/><br/>In order to attract section 11(Ka) it is to be proved that death was caused in view of demand of dowry put forward from the side of husband or father, mother, guardian, or relation of the husband or any person for and on behalf of husband. <br/><br/>The demand of dowry by convict-appellant could not be proved by evidence. PWs. 2 and 3, brother and mother of deceased Moyna, would have been the best witnesses to testify to the demand of dowry by convict-appellant but they were not examined by the police.<br/><br/>This takes us to a legal debate of fundamental character, which is,</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the convict-appellant can be graced with a verdict of acquittal when charge of section 11(Ka) of the Ain of 2000 could not be pressed into service against him.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">When a clear case of murder has been established by circumstantial and medical evidence against him whether the convict-appellant can be convicted for the offence of murder punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the case is required to be sent back to Tribunal or Court of Sessions for fresh trial.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Section 25 of the Ain of 2000 postulates that Tribunal defined section 2 (Ghha=W) shall be treated as Court of Sessions and Tribunal shall be able to exercise all powers of Sessions Court in holding trial of an offence.<br/><br/>Section 26 of the Ain of 2000 enshrines that Tribunal so constituted shall be recorded as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal and shall be constituted with one Judge and Judge of Tribunal shall be appointed from amongst District and Sessions Judges to the Government and Government, if necessary, shall appoint any District and Sessions Judge as Tribunal Judge in addition to his charge. Section 20 further enjoins that under the section Additional District and Sessions Judge shall, also, stand included as District and Sessions Judge.<br/><br/>From the above it becomes manifestly clear that a Tribunal trying a case under the Ain of 2000 is, also, a Court of District and Sessions Judge. When a Judge sits in a Tribunal or Special Tribunal Case holding trial of an offence under a Statute or Special Statute is a Tribunal or Special Tribunal and a Judge when sits in Sessions Case trying an offence punishable under Penal sections of Penal Code sits as Sessions Judge.<br/><br/>The case in hand, tried by a Tribunal constituted under the Ain of 2000 that Tribunal was, also, the Court of sessions. In the judgment learned judge was described as District and Sessions Judge, Dinajpur as well as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat, Dinajpur. Judgment demonstrates that learned District and Sessions Judge had been, also, exercising the power and jurisdiction of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal. Fate of the convict-appellant and result of the case would have been the same whether it would have been tried either as a Nari-O-Shishi case by the Tribunal or as a Sessions case by learned sessions Judge and if section 11(ka) of The Ain, 2000 was not attracted in respect of convict-appellant, the offence of section 302 of the Penal Code be very much pressed into service against the convict-appellant and he could be conveniently tried and convicted for offence of section  302 of Penal Code. <br/> <br/>In <strong><em>Asiman Begum Vs State</em></strong> represented by <strong><em>Deputy Commissioner, 51 DLR(AD) 18</em></strong> the accused-appellant along with 6 others was put on trial before Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Bishesh Adalat, Patuakhali to answer a charge of section 10(1) of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995  in Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 2 of 1996. Accused-appellant was found guilty under the first part of section 304 of the Penal Code and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for four (4) years and, also, a fine of Tk. 1,000 in default of payment of fine to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one (1) year more. A single Judge of High Court Division disposing of the Criminal appeal preferred by convict-appellant observed that the trial had been vitiated for want of jurisdiction inasmuch as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Adalat, could only try an offence under the aforesaid Bishesh Bidhan Ain, 1995 and not an offence under The Penal Code, learned Single Judge sent the case back on remand to learned Sessions Judge to try it in accordance with law. Before Appellate Division it was argued from side of accused-appellant that the remand order for trial of the case as a Sessions Case in the particular circumstances of the case will be a mere formality because Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 2 of 1996, although, tried under Bishesh Bidhan Ain, 1995 by a Bishesh Adalat, the presiding officer was no other than the Sessions Judge himself and, as such, it was unlikely that the result would be anything different if the case was tried by him as a Sessions Case. Appellate Division found considerable substance in the submission of learned Advocate for accused-appellant. Appellate Division, thus sent the appeal to High Court Division to consider the case on merit and to pass whatever order or orders it might think appropriate in the interest of justice.<br/> <br/>In <strong><em>State Vs Abul Kalam</em></strong>, <strong><em>5 BLC 230</em></strong> one Abul Kalam stood convicted for offence of section 10(1) of The Ain of 1995 for murder of his wife for dowry by learned Sessions Judge and Special Tribunal No. 1, Noakhali. Consequential sentence was death. Condemned-prisoner preferred Jail appeal and, also, regular Criminal appeal before High Court Division. There had been, also, Death Reference. A Division Bench of High Court Division heard Death Reference, Jail Appeal and Criminal Appeal together and disposed of those by a common Judgment. High Court Division found that there had not been cogent evidence as to committing murder for dowry and no evidence had been led as to the real cause of killing of wife by husband and held that the case did not come under section 10(1) of The Ain of 1995 and the case comes under section 302 of The Penal Code. The High Court Division further held that Sessions Judge, in fact, was the Special Tribunal No. 1 who tried the case and for no fault of the accused the case had been tried as Special Tribunal Case. High Court Division instead of sending the case back for fresh trial under section 302 of The Penal Code by learned Sessions Judge disposed of the appeal. High Court Division altered conviction from section 10(1) of The Ain, 1995 to one under section 302 of Penal Code. Sentence of death was altered to one of imprisonment for life. The High Court Division in rendering decision took into account <strong><em>Asiman Begum vs State, (Supra).</em></strong><br/> <br/>A similar question was, also, considered in <strong><em>Shibu Pada Acharjee Vs. State, 56 DLR 285</em></strong>. In the said case, accused-appellant was convicted for offence of Section4(c) of The Ordinance of 1983 for commission of rape upon victim Ratna Rani but ingredients of Section 4(c) of the Ordinance of 1983 could not be brought home to accused appellant. In the case it had been laid down: “To take the prosecution out of Court on a question of technicality, will be a travesty of justice and technicality must bend to cause of Justice inasmuch as Ends of law is Justice”.<br/><br/>Accused appellant can be fastened for offence of section 376 of the Penal Code and conviction under section 4(c) of The Ordinance of 1983 can be altered to one of section 376 of the Penal Code.<br/>In the said case conviction under section 4 (c) of the Ordinace of 1983 was altered to one of section 376 of the Penal Code. <strong><em>Asiman Begum vs State, (Supra) </em></strong>and <strong><em>State Vs Abul Kalam, (Supra</em></strong>) had been, also, discussed considered and meditated in <strong><em>Shibupada Acharjee vs State (supra).</em></strong><br/><br/>In the event of sending the case either to Tribunal or Court of Sessions for fresh trial proceeding would be protracted which cannot be allowed in the interest of true dispensation of criminal Justice.<br/> <br/>Since offence of murder is punishable under section 302 of Penal Code was carried to the door of convict appellant he can be very much convicted for offence of section 302 of the Penal Code and, as such, we convert the offence of section 11(ka) of the Ain of 2000 to offence of section 302 of Penal Code. Convict appellant, thus stands convicted for offence of section 302 of the code.<br/> <br/>Legal debate stands solved in the following terms and language:</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">Convict appellant can not be graced with a verdict of acquittal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Convict appellant can be convicted for the offence punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Case is not required to be sent either to   </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Tribunal or Court of Sessions for fresh trial.<br/> <br/>What sentence is to be imposed upon convict-appellant—death or imprisonment for life? Sentencing discretion on the part of a Judge is the most difficult task to perform. There is no system or procedure in the Criminal Justice administration method or Rule to exercise such discretion. In sentencing process, two important factors come out which shall shape appropriate sentence a. Aggravating factor, and b. Mitigating factor. These two factors control the sentencing process to a great extent. But it is always to be remembered that the object of sentence should be to see that the crime does not go unpunished and the society has the satisfaction that justice has been done and Court responded to the society’s cry for justice. Under section 302 of The Code, though, a discretion has been conferred upon the Court to award two types of sentences, death or imprisonment for life, the discretion is to be exercised in accordance with the fundamental principle of criminal justice.<br/> <br/>Convict-appellant was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Record indicates that convict-appellant is not a hard criminal and he cannot be at all characterised to be a menace to the society. Taking an account of aggravating and mitigating circumstance, we are of this considered view that ends of justice will be met if death sentence is altered to one at imprisonment for life. Convict-appellant thus, stands sentenced to imprisonment for life. Convict-appellant, also, is to pay a fine of Taka 10,000 and in default of payment of fine to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six (6) months more.</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">On the premises of the foregoing discussion, the following orders are passed: Death Reference No. 32 of 2008 is rejected.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Jail Appeal No. 361 of 2008 and Criminal Appeal No. 1741 of 2008 stand dismissed with modification of conviction and sentence. Judgment of conviction and sentence dated 18<sup>th</sup> March, 2008 passed by Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat (Tribunal), Dinajpur in Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 246 of 2004 is modified in the epithet that convict-appellant is found guilty of the offence of section 302 of Penal Code and not for an offence of section 11(ka) of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and conviction for offence of section 11(ka) of The Ain of 2000 is altered to one of section 302 of The Penal Code and death sentence is altered to one of sentence of imprisonment for life and he is to pay a fine of Tk. 10,000 and in default of payment of fine to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six (6) months more. The period in custody before commencement of trial and after commencement of trial be deducted from the total sentence under section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Let a copy of the judgment be sent to the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Dinajpur. The Jail Superintendent, Dinajpur is directed to shift the condemned prisoner from death cell into the common accommodation for the convict-appellant. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Lower Court record be sent down as immediate as possible.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

He also pleaded that he constructed a house in the suit land and the kabala of the defendant No. 3 in collusive that in the suit defendant No. 3 got himself added as a defendant claiming that he has purchased a portion of the suit property and the defendant Nos. 1 and 3 filed a written statement and denied to have executed the agreement on receipt earnest money and also denied the tender and also alleged that the document is forged and it was created in collusion of the deed writer. That upon the above pleadings that the trial Court framed 04 issues as to maintainability; whether the agreement is a gunine one and whether the plaintiff was entitled to any relief.<br/><br/>During the trial 3 P. Ws and 3 D. Ws were examined and trial Court found that the suit is not barred by limitation since the suit was filed within the time from refusal and as per under Article 113 of Limitation Act the suit was not barred.<br/><br/>The trial Court decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiff and against the said judgment and decree the defendant as appellant filed Title Appeal No. 85 of 2008 ultimately the said appeal was heard by the Joint District Judge who allowed the appeal by the impugned judgment and decree.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and decree passed by the Additional District Judge the petitioner preferred this revisonal application under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the present Rule.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Ali Reza, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the after consdering the evidences on record as well as the genuineness of the signature of the executent namely Monoranjan Shil came to a finding that the Bainapatra was genuine one and subsequently on appeal the appellate Court only considering the evidence of D. W. 4 dismissed the suit mere only basis of signature  of deed writer and thus it committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. He further submits that since the genuineness of the signature not only proved by the plaintiff but also admitted by the defendant in paragraph 12 of written statement that the D. W. 4 has written the bainapatra therefore the genuineness of baina can not be questioned but the lower appellate Court without considering these legal as well as the materials on record including the pleading came to a wrong conclusion occasioning failure of justice. In support of his submission the learned Advocate for the petitioner referred a decision in the case of <strong>Jahanara Begum Vs. Md. Aminul Islam Chowhdhury and others, reported in 2 MLR(AD) 215</strong>. He also relied upon another decision in the case of <strong>A. Jabbar Bari and others Vs. Sultan Hossain Matbar and others, reported in BCR 2006 AD 111</strong>.<br/><br/>Mr. Muhammad Eunus, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite party submits that the plaintiff claimed the suit land by a registered baina in a suit for Specific Performance of Contract in where Swapon has been mentioned as a deed writer of baina but Swapon was not examined by the plaintiff to prove the said bainapatra rather Swapon was examined by the defendant as D. W. 4 and in where he denied the said baina and categorically stated that the did not writ the baina. So the genuineness of the baina cannot be proved beyond reasonable doubt. He also submits that the plaintiff claimed the land in pursuance of baina which was executed on 28.02.1999 and cause of action arose on 25.12.2003 that is the suit was filed after more than 06 (six) years this delay is unusual. He further submits that the gunuineness of the baina is also doubtful without any satisfactory explanation for unusual delay of 6 years to file the suit from the plaintiff. He also submits that the trial Court though found only the signature of the executant is tally with the signature of the baina and this finding of the trial Court was found as not correct it was reversed by the lower appellate Court after proper scrutiny of the signature of Monoranjan in his deposition as well as Exhibit Ga alongwith the signature of baina and thereafter the lower appellate Court as a final Court of fact found that the signature of the baina of Monoronjan is not correct. In support of his submission the learned Advocate for the opposite party relied upon a decision in the case of <strong>Md. Fazlul Haque Vs. B. H. Rahman @ Mahbubur Rahman and others, reported in 15 BLD 228</strong>.<br/><br/>Heard the learned Advocates for both the sides, perused the revisional application under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure as well the judgment of both the Courts below including the evidences on record led by the parties.<br/><br/>It appears from the pleadings that the plaintiff filed the suit for Specific Performance of Contract in pursuance of a unregistered deed of bainapatra on 28.02.1998 against the defendant Monoranjan and by showing cause of action arose on 25.12.2003 on the allegation that the suit land measuring 18 decimals entered into contract for a consideration Tk. 36,000/- out of which 30,000/- was paid at the time of bainapatra and only 6000/- was unpaid and on refusal to receive the rest amount the plaintiff filed the suit for Specific Performance of Contract against the defendant. On the other hand the defendant case is that he did not execute any bainapatra and he did not take any consideration from the plaintiff for the suit land rather he stated that 04 decimals of land his land was sold to the defendant No. 3 immediately after said alleged bainapatra for a consideration of Tk. 18,000/-. He further stated that after 06(six) years the unusual claimed of plaintiff petitioner is for the purposely. These are the pleadings of the parties.<br/><br/>It appears from the judgment of the trial Court who after only compare the signature of the defendant No. 1 without discussing the evidence led by the parties side by side as required by law in passing his judgment. He passed the judgment and decreed in the suit only he after comparing the signature of bainapatra alongwith the signature of Monoranjan in a deed dated 28.07.1991 and deposition of D. W. 1 alongwith signature of Exhibit ‘Ga’ a registered deed dated 26.04.1998 came to a finding that the signature of Monoranjan is similar with the signature of bainaptara and subsequently he came to the opinion that the signature of bainapatra is  the signature of Monoranjan. On the other hand, the lower Appellate Court considering the evidence of D. W. 4 whose name has been mentioned as a writer of the bainapatra namely Swapan Kumar Dutta and considering the evidence of Swapan he came to the finding that the signature of bainpatra of defendant Monoranjan is not tally with the signature of Monoranjan with the Exihibit No. ‘Ga’ alongwith deposition of D. W. 1 and he found that the bainapatra was not genuine and therefore he dismissed the suit and allowed the appeal. I have gone through the evidence on records Exhibit 3 the bainpatra which is the basis of the plaintiff case. That the bainapatra was written by a deed writer but it appears from the said bainapatra that there is no heading of bainaptra and it has been written on a non judicial stump paper and it is unregistered one and there is no explanation regarding the over writing in the schedule of the bainapatra after written the word (S. A. Khatian number)in the said bainapatra and no explanation was given as to the overwriting of the said deed of bainapatra in the schedule of the land. It appears that Ripon and Niranjon have been mentioned as witnesses of the bainapatra and Swapan being No. 2033 has been mentioned as scribe of the bainapatra and out of 03 only Nironjan was examined as P. W. 2 who claimed himself as a Teacher but he categorically stated that on 25.02.2003 his school was opened and after performing  his duty in the school he went to the defendants house alongwith the plaintiff and others. But it is admitted that on the date of 25.12.2003 our nation observed as a national holiday due crist much. So all the Schools were remained closed. Therefore the deposition of P. W. Mirarijan can not be reliable and believable rather he is a chance witness. Similarly P. W. 3 who is cousin of the plaintiff and he is not a witness of bainapatra but P. W. 3 categorically stated that the deed was written by Swapan but Swapan was not examined by the plaintiff to prove the bainapatra. Even there is no explanation under what circumstances Ripon and Swapan were not examined by the plaintiff to prove the unregistered bainapatra. It appears from deposition of P. W. 2 that there are serious contradiction in respect of material particular as to the prove of cause of action in the depositions of P.Ws though the plaintiff in his plaint of paragraph No. 9 categorically stated that on the date of cause of action he alongwith 03 persons namely Ripon, Binandra and Kismot went to the residence of the defendant No. 1 but said averment was not corroborated and supported by P. Ws. in their deposition.<br/><br/>Now let me consider the signature of defendant No. 1 in where one Monoranjan has been mentioned as executent in the baina and the signature of the said Monoranjan and the signature of the defendant No. 1 in the deed dated 28.07.1996 and Exhibit Ga alongwith the deposition of D. W. 1. On proper scrutiny after considering the manner and style o writing of the defendant in his deposition and his admitted deed exibit ‘Ga’ it can be said that the signature of the bainapatra is similar with his admitted signature but can not be said as same  and identical. It appears that the alleged baina was alleged to execute on 28.02.1998 and the suit was filed long after 06 years without any satisfactory explanation from the plaintiff as well as it appears immediately after 28.02.1998 the defendant No. 1 executed and registered a kabala in favour of the defendant No. 3 on 26.04.1998 for a land measuring 04 decimals with a consideration of Tk. 18,000/- in this material fact was not denied by the plaintiff. There is no bindings effect of any terms in the bina by mentioning any time limit is bound  to execute the said deed. So the baina is a vague and unspecific in respect of payment and execution of deed that is to say a baina can not be for a unlimited period. It is true that in a suit for Specific Performance of Contract that the plaintiff must prove the genuineness of bainapatra of the plaintiff by examining in the reliable and believable evidence as decided in the case of <strong>Jahanara Begum Vs. Md. Aminul Islam Chowhdhury and others, reported in 2 MLR(AD) 215 </strong>but in the particular case where the suit for Specific Performance of Contract the plaintiff totally failed to prove the genuineness of his baina by adducing any independent and reliable and believable witness rather he avoid the vital witness who was very much present and written the alleged baina as well as witness of baina namely Ripon, Swapan by the plaintiff and withhelding of the such vital witnesses the presumption is to go in favour of the defendant as per section 114 (g) of the Evidence Act. However the D. W. 4 came forward at the appellate stage and deposed that he is a licencee as a deed writer being licence No. 2033 and he did not write the baina dated 28.02.1998 in favour of the plaintiff.<br/><br/>I have gone through his signature of the baina as well as the signature of the deposition of said Swapan as D. W. 4 which is apparently quite different with the signature of bainapatra. So considering the facts and circumstances alongwith baina itself as well as material on record it is apparent face of the records that the plaintiff failed to prove the genuineness of the baina as well as consideration of payment of Tk. 30,000/- out of 36,000/- for the land of 18 decimals. It appears from the records that the plaintiff claimed that he got a baina from the defendant before about 06 (six) years back from the date of filing of the suit. To disprove the genuineness of baina  the alleged writer of the baina was examined as D.W.4 and he categorically stated that he did not write the said baina. On the other hand to prove the genuineness of the baina P.W.2 was examined on behalf of the plaintiff he stated that he was present at the time of baina but he was a chance witness due to reasons as mentioned above and no witness was examined by the plaintiff  who was acquainted with the signature of the executant i.e. to say that the plaintiff did not produce any single witness to prove the genuineness of the baina. Thereafter the only method of scrutiny of the signature of baina by the Court was available by comprising of signature of the executent alongwtih the admitted signature of the defendant. On scrutiny, the signature of the baina as well as the admitted signature of the defendant No. 1, I find that the manner and style of writing of the executant and defendant can be said as similar but can not be said as same and identical without any other corroborative or any other circumstantial evidence.<br/><br/>In view of the matter, the plaintiff totally failed to prove the genuineness of bainapatra as required under the provision of Section 44, 45, 47, 67 and 73 of the Evidence Act in support of his case.<br/><br/>The requirement for the Specific Performance of Contract was not fulfilled by the plaintiff and accordingly he is not entitled to get the discretionary relief in the suit for Specific Performance of Contract. Therefore I find that the lower appellate Court did not commit any error of law  in his decision and I also do not find any non consideration of evidence of D. W. 4 rather I find that after proper consideration of the deposition D. W. 4 along other evidences led by the parties  the appellate Court came to a legal and proper decision. <br/>In view of the above facts and circumstances and discussion made above I do not find  any substance in the Rule.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged without any order as to costs. The judgment and decree dated 19.07.2011 and 27.07.2011 respectively passed by learned Additional District Judge, Patuakhali in Title Appeal No. 85 of 2008 reversing the judgment and decree dated 11.09.2008 and 17.09.2008 respectively passed by Senior Assistant Judge, Patuakhali Sadar, Patuakhali in Title Suit No. 3 of 2004 is hereby affirmed.<br/><br/>Send down the lower Courts record together with a copy of the judgment and order to the Court below at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
