On perusal of the depositions of P.Ws. and other materials on record and on careful consideration we find that the petitioner’s case does not come within the purview of the aforesaid four conditions as laid down above. The impugned judgment and order of conviction passed by the learned tribunal does not call for any interference under the purview of section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

K. M. Shahidul Huq, J:</strong></u></span><br/><br/>This Rule was issued calling upon the opposite parties to show cause as to why the impugned Judgment and order dated 18.09.1997 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge (3) Special Court, Dinajpur in Special Court Case No. 97 of 1996 should not be quashed or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court might seem fit and proper.<br/><br/>Facts relevant for purpose of disposal of the instant Rule, in short, are that on 15.03.1996 informant Asma Khatun (15) along with her father A. Hamid went to the Katwali Police Station Dinajpur and lodged an Ejahar to the effect that on 12.3.1996 she along with her younger sister Aseda Begum and maternal cousin Tahera watched Matinee Cinema show at local Chourangi Cinema Hall at 3.00 PM. Cinema show over, they started for home by a rickshaw.  At about 8.00 PM they reached a place named Baterhat and by leaving the rickshaw proceeded for home on foot. When they reached a place named Kushumbi accused Najrul Islam came across them with a torch in his hand and expressed to the informant, “ I shall marry you, come with me.” When the informant refused to go with him, he forcibly pushed cloth inside her mouth and proceeded towards Khanpur village. At that time one Anisur Rahman of village Chak Gopal appeared before them. The accused threatened him. Aseda Begum and Tahera Begum went away with Anisur Rahman. The accused petitioner then dragged her at the forest of Khanpur Zagirpara at 11.00 PM and raped her forcibly there.

After closure of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses there was no scope for examination of the accused petitioner under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he being absconding from the very beginning.<br/><br/>After hearing the learned Special Public Prosecutor and the state Defence Lawyer and considering the evidences on record, the learned Special Judge and Additional Sessions Judge-3, Dinajpur was pleased to convict the accused petitioner under Section 9 (Kha) of the Nari and Shishu Nirjatan (Bishes Bidhan) Ain, 1995 and sentenced him, thereunder  to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and also to pay a fine of Taka one thousand, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 3 months more by his judgment and order dated 18.09.1997. The petitioner after coming to know about the case on 20.10.1997 voluntarily surrendered before the Court of the Additional District Magistrate, Dinajpur on 21.10.1997 and he was taken into custody on that day.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid impugned judgment and order dated 18.9.1997 passed by the learned Special Judge and the Additional Sessions Judge-3, Dinajpur in Special Court Case No.97 of 1996 convicting the accused petitioner under Section 9(Kha) of the Nari and Shishu Nirjatan (Bishes Bidhan) Ain, 1995  and sentencing him, thereunder to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and directing  him to pay a fine of Taka 10,000/- (Ten thousand) in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 3 (Three) months more, he preferred before a Division Bench of this  Court  an application under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure and obtained the present rule.<br/><br/>No one appears before us to make submission in support of the Rule when this item has been taken up for hearing.<br/><br/>Mr. Bishmadev Chakrabortty, the learned Deputy Attorney General  appearing for the State-respondent submits that the learned Additional Sessions  Judge did not commit any wrong in passing the impugned judgment and order convicting the petitioner under Section 9 (Kha) of the Nari and Shishu Nirjatan Daman (Bishes Bhidan) Ain, 1995 and sentencing him, thereunder to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and also directing him to pay a fine of Taka 10,000/-, in default, to suffer  rigorous imprisonment for 3 months more.<br/><br/>At the trial prosecution examined 9 witnesses out of 10 witnesses and one was declared tendered.<br/>         P.W.1 Ms. Asma Khatun is the victim.

The following opinion was given, “No sign of sexual assault present Ges bony age of the victim is between 14-15 years”. This witness was not cross examined by the defence.<br/><br/>P. W. 9 S. I. Moksad Ali is the investigating officer. At the relevant time he was posted as S. I. at Kotwali Police Station, Dinajpur. He deposed that S. I.

Victim Asma Khatun was examined by the Doctor. After investigation he submitted charge sheet against accused Nazrul Islam. In cross examination he stated that letter ‘Ka’ was the place of occurrence but he did not mention about the nature and particular of the place. The occurrence took place in a field.<br/><br/>On the basis of the aforesaid evidence on record learned Judge found the accused petitioner guilty of the offence under section 9(Ga) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishes Bidhan Ain) 1995.<br/><br/>It will not be out of place of mention here that though charge was framed against the accused petitioner under section 6(1) of the said Ain, 1995 for commission of rape upon the victim, the said victim Asma Khatun who deposed as PW1 did not allege commission of rape upon her. On the contrary, she stated that she left with the accused petitioner and returned home when she found that he was married and had wife. Medical examination report did not support commission of rape upon her. But consistent evidence of the PWs proved that she was forcibly taken way by the accused petitioner when she along with her younger sister PW5 Asheda and cousin (sister) Taher were returning from Dinajpur after watching a cinema show. PW5 Asheda categorically proved the same now a pertinent question is involved if there is scope to quash the impugned judgment and order of conviction.<br/><br/>It is now a well-established principle of law that quashment under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure is possible in cases of (a) facts alleged not constituting any offence (b) bar of law (c) coram nonjudice (d) lack of legal evidence adduced and for ends of justice. None of the conditions referable to (a), (b) and (c) is applicable in the present case before us. Only point that is before us for consideration is condition no (d) lack of legal evidence adduced. This court in its jurisdiction not being a court of appeal has hardly any scope to asses and appreciate evidence like a court of appeal. The witnesses who were examined were competent witnesses. There was no legal flaw in their evidence.<br/><br/>On perusal of the depositions of P.Ws. and other materials on record and on careful consideration we find that the petitioner’s case does not come within the purview of the aforesaid four conditions as laid down above. The impugned judgment and order of conviction passed by the learned tribunal does not call for any interference under the purview of section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner is not at all entitled to get any relief under the inherent jurisdiction of this Court under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><br/>In that view of the matter we find that the learned Additional sessions Judge rightly convicted the accused Nazrul Islam and did not commit any wrong in passing the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence, thus it does not deserve any interference under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. So the petitioner is not entitled to get any relief under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><br/>The impugned judgment and order of conviction passed by the learned Special Court and the Additional Sessions Judge, Court No. 3 Dinajpur in special case no. 97 of 1996 is hereby affirmed.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged.<br/><br/>         Send down the lower Court records along with a copy of this judgment immediately for information and necessary action.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
